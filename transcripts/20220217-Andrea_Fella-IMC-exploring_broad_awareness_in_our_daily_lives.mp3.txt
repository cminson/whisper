The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I wanted to speak a little more about this broad awareness and the broad experience that we can touch into in the guided meditation I pointed to this.
First of all, there's a broad awareness which can receive many experiences, many different kinds of experiences.
We might in a broad awareness kind of settle back and feel some very specific experiences first.
So in a broad awareness kind of taking in the whole of experience, we might feel a particular sensation in the knee and then a sound and then another body sensation and then a breath and then a thought.
And so there can be some very specific sensations that come into a broader awareness.
We can also focus on those sensations. It might feel a little bit like at times the awareness can narrow down to just that one experience.
But in this broader kind of more receptive awareness, we can kind of settle back and just take what comes first one thing, then another thing, and then another thing.
Another experience that as I pointed to in the guided meditation can be connected with with that broad awareness is what we could call a broad experience.
The experience can also have a very broad, vast kind of quality to it.
Body sensation might might be felt this way. We can sometimes touch into a sense of a vibratory energy throughout the body or a sense of an emotional tone that's felt in the body.
Other states can be experienced like this to something like sleepiness also can have a very diffuse broad quality or concentration can have this quality.
So there's a lot of experiences that can have this broad kind of quality.
In my experience with touching into this, and I've been talking about this kind of experience over the last many years, but mostly I've talked about it in retreat.
I talk about it in retreat practice when people get a little quieter and it's sometimes what happens as the mind gets quieter, it begins to touch into these broader experiences more kind of almost more naturally in a way.
And so I speak to it in those kind of situations. But recently I came across or re came across a book that I had known before. It's an old book.
It's a psychological technique described by a psychologist Eugene Gentlin. And he calls his technique focusing, which to me is a funny word for what he's talking about because he's talking about this very broad kind of awareness, which to me feels the opposite of focusing.
But that's what he calls it. And so there's a book. I'll show you the little book. This is the book I came across on my bookshelf, you know, about a month ago, and just picked it up and was browsing through it.
And he speaks to this very same broad experience and the value of it in terms of navigating stuff in our daily lives.
And I hadn't really made that connection in my own practice yet. And mostly I had been exploring touching into that broader sense when the mind got quieter.
And so I played around with it and it's extremely valuable. It's extremely useful.
And in the last month or so I've been playing with exploring doing guided meditations to see if there can be a way to help people touch into that broader sense when the mind is at a more ordinary level, at a more ordinary space to start with.
So not like deep into retreat, but just sitting down for 30 minute meditation. Is it possible to begin to touch into that?
And I found there's some capacity for that at times for people. And so I've just started exploring this kind of broad awareness, certain characteristics of it.
I find this kind of sense of the whole experience, the broader sense of how you are, or if there's a, you know, sometimes I think in our daily lives this kind of exploration might come if there's something that's really niggling at us.
And this is how I've been exploring it actually in my own practice. Three or four times over the last month, something has come up where the mind has just gotten kind of hooked into the content of something.
It keeps coming back to it and like gnawing on it and trying to figure it out and trying to understand what's going on there.
And when I've seen that happen, I sit down and explore this kind of broader sense. It's like, okay, so there's something niggling at the mind. What's the whole feeling of it?
So sit down, let my mind quiet a little bit and then just can I touch into the wholeness of it, the whole feeling of this niggly, itchy kind of irritant that's going on.
Can I touch into the whole feeling of it? And there's almost always something there that's a kind of a shifty, uncomfortable, when there's the niggly thing going on.
There's something shifty, uncomfortable, something vague, something that I can't articulate.
And just letting myself hang out with that, just letting myself be with that vague sense, the whole sense of it.
And allowing it to kind of reveal itself and using all of our skills of allowing, of friendly attention, allowing attention to just let it be, let it be what it is.
And then a little bit of deeper exploration at some point of, okay, so I really, I can touch into this feeling. Yep, there it is.
There's some like sense. And what I've seen also is the whatever niggly thing is happening, you know, whatever thing the mind is launching into.
There's some kind of a root or base in that shifty feeling, that broad sense.
It's almost like where all of that stuff is arising out of, all of that struggle, that stress, that suffering is arising out of some of this broad, vague sensation level of experience.
And so touching into that broad sensation level of experience and just dropping in the question of like, okay, I feel you.
Yep, there, it's there. I don't know what you are. Some, you know, maybe it's a sense of jumpy confusion or, you know, something just very, just at the sensation level it feels that way.
And then dropping in the question, okay, so yeah, I feel you.
What is it about the situation, this whole niggly situation? So again, going back to the broad situation, so kind of a, again, a meeting of the content of our lives or the context of our lives with our exploration of what's happening right now.
So that niggly thing, rather than saying, well, that's thinking, I shouldn't be attending to that in meditation.
It's like, well, that's there. So that part of the experience is part of what's going on.
So how does this feeling connect with that whole situation?
And then again, not try to figure it out. And I talk about that a lot in, in retreat also, dropping in kind of questions for investigation and just letting them drop in and not try to figure them out.
But letting that, that kind of question of how does this whole situation connect with this funny, jumpy, undulating, messy feeling?
At times what I've seen, and it, it hasn't actually taken that long, you know, 10 minutes or something, you know, to, in exploring this in my daily life.
There'll be some kind of word or some kind of understanding of a view or a perspective that's there, that's been hidden, that kind of sheds a light on what's going on.
So recently, a few days ago, I was exploring something and, you know, there was a dynamic with some people and I sat down with the niggly feeling and came to this uncomfortable kind of diffuse feeling.
And what, what came to me in that was, oh, I feel like I'm not being valued. That was, that was the kind of, that was the, the belief in there, you know, that, that was, that was underneath the whole thing.
And in the seeing of that, you know, I wouldn't say the whole thing fell apart, but it's, it's like the, the seeing, the seeing of it. And this is what we see all, all the time in our meditation when we can see something that hasn't been seen, when we can see something, something can get revealed that has been hidden from us.
It loses its power to have us just acting out of it or trying to figure things out or fix things or change things.
And so that's what I've seen the three or four times that I've explored this, this touching into this broad diffuse sense has allowed a meeting or touching into something that was really subtle and kind of hard to see.
And then it allowed it to be seen. It allowed it to be seen. And that took its power away. It, it, it, like, before that, that in my own example, that sense of feeling like I'm not being valued right under there was the sense of I need to be valued.
You know, like, I have to have value in my relationships or something. And, and just having it seen just exposed the, I don't see the silliness of it, but just the, the kind of irrelevance in a way of that in my, in my experience.
It was, it was, it took its power away. It took away the power of that belief to have me, you know, be thinking I needed to do something different or to figure something out or to fix something or change something.
Just like, oh, well, this is the situation. This is how these people are responding. This is what I'm doing. And this is the situation.
So it created a container of, of Dharma understanding that, yeah, this is what is, and this is nothing actually needed to happen.
Now, I imagine there can be times in this kind of exploration that there might be a sense of, oh, yeah, and something does need to happen.
Because when we sometimes open into a truth or a deeper understanding, there can be a sense of, yes, and a skillful response would be this.
So this doesn't always mean that we would not take action. In this case, in this case, that's this thing that was happening the other day, I didn't actually have to take action.
And actually, the next time I had interactions with that group of people, it was very different. I didn't have the same kind of feelings and situation.
Something in me had shifted that created, I don't know how it did it, but it created a shift in the dynamic in the relationship.
So this broad sense of, I offer that my own example as a kind of a demonstration or a sense of how it can be useful to explore this broad sense of how you are.
And I've also seen at times it's fun when there's not something niggling happening, like when I'm out taking a walk, I find I can just touch into that broader sense.
And it almost tickles. It's like a very light and shifty quality that's just little bits of emotions or feelings are kind of bubbling up and just being felt and known.
And it can actually be very delightful to touch into this experience of the broader sense of how I am at times too.
Taking a walk, I found that to be a fun time to kind of check into it.
So while it can be extremely useful for working with something that's really niggling at us, it also can be really useful to touch into.
In a way, it felt like in exploring it in my walking, it was almost a more grounded sense of how I am while I was walking, as opposed to noticing all of the different sights and sounds and smells.
It's just like, oh, this is how I am while I'm walking, and still able to notice all the sights and sounds and smells and tastes and everything else that was going on.
And so it's a broad field of experience that we actually can learn to touch into in our daily lives.
And I feel like I'm still, I mean, as I say, I had really explored this a lot in my retreat practice, but much less in my daily life.
And so I'm still learning the value of it, still learning how to speak about it, still learning where it contributes to our Dharma practice.
But I do feel that it's a really interesting and valuable aspect to explore attending to in our daily lives.
So I'm curious, I think most of you were here for the guided meditation.
And so I did, for those of you who came a little later, I did a guided meditation, which was recorded and will be available on audio Dharma shortly after this session's over.
I did a guided meditation about touching into that broad diffuse quality in our experience.
And in a way, what we explored in the guided meditation, the context or the content of the experience we explored in that was, how are you in this moment?
And so I'm curious, if anybody is willing to talk about, speak to what you noticed in that, in that guided meditation, was there a sense of being able to touch, even fleetingly being able to touch into a broader sense,
a broader felt sense of experience.
And what, and what did you notice if anybody, if anybody's willing to talk about that.
PG. I've been feeling the miglieting feeling, I couldn't name it, but you named it, like I knew that's exactly what it was feeling.
I've been in kind of a bad mood, same thing, interaction with people, and I tend to get quite angry, you know, like I could see the anger in me rising, but I tried, I didn't think it was worth it to get angry and
I tried to see all the best possible reason why this person might not be doing these things to provoke me, but it's just their habit, they're doing this.
But at the same time, my old habit, I could see the frustration and the inability to be calm, you know, I had lost it.
So I see that it could be, it was interfering in our conversation and our discussion. And this was at work, so we were doing it remotely. So I would, so as not to say anything negative, I would turn my mic off.
So that, you know, I'm like, paying attention to what they were saying and not reacting to it, but all the while, I could see my mind was like, Why did you do it? Why did you delete all that stuff?
I spent two hours writing all that stuff, you just deleted it, but I was just listening. But I got through that two hour meeting. But then I was still agitated the rest of the day.
And I was trying to calm. So that was still floating in my mind. And so that I was trying to get away from it, I didn't want to think about it. So the broader outer feeling was, I still kept, but then really oddly enough,
when I did feel the outer sense of it and being uncomfortable and feeling that discomfort, I started yawning. I wasn't tired, but I was yawning. I don't understand what is happening. But it's kind of funny right now.
Yawning is often an expression of release. When something is letting go, for some reason, we yawn. So it's almost physiological sometimes. And I find that too, if I touch into something and the mind can really meet it.
And it sounds like you did just a little bit, touch into that discomfort. And it's like there can be a little bit of a release and there's a little bit of a, oh, okay, this can be held kind of experience.
So, you know, one thing I think we, with that kind of uncomfortable experience, part of the niggling stuff is wanting to get away from that uncomfortable experience. And so, you know, we resist meeting it. But then when we meet it, it's almost like, oh, it actually was asking for attention.
And touching into it, if we can touch into it with a little bit of that holding it in a broad way, it can fluctuate, it can shift, it can be uncomfortable, and there can be the sense of, yeah, and it's there, you know.
So there's something about the meeting of it, the seeing of it, the direct seeing of it, that has a transformative power and has a way to allow there to be some release with it. So, yeah, I mean, so it sounds like you touched into it a little bit.
Yeah, I didn't want to go into the details of the conversation.
We don't want to go into the details. Yeah, because then it was getting worse. So I tried to stay away from it and just feel the discomfort. Oh, the discomfort was just, yeah.
It's hard to be with. It's hard. But that's what we don't want to go into the all thatness of it. We do just want to kind of, you know, like hold the whole thing and feel into the.
The wobbly, because sometimes the uncomfortableness is partly because it's so wobbly. You know, it's not like really specific. We can't say this is what it is. I've got it. I figured it out.
And so it can feel really uncomfortable. And so knowing, yep, it's uncomfortable and there's an awareness of it. So, yeah, and sometimes we do have to step away from it if it gets too hard.
But it sounds like it sounds like there was a beginning to touch into it. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Vici.
Jessica.
Hey, I just wanted to thank you.
Even the word niggling was very close to my mind from either today or recently. But what also had come to mind and maybe the way you were just talking about who in this later part was something that I've been looking at in terms of like figuring things out.
Like sort of this insistence always that there's something to a to figure out, but also like lately I've been almost thinking about in terms of a way that we project into the world or push out into the world or our issues or our disconnections or whatever the way that we don't kind of
commit ourselves where we want to and how sometimes that gets projected into the world as brokenness in a way and or as a lack of love for what's there and like how that some of that lack of love shows up and how relations happen outside of us and and like there's
a way of figuring in to like, you know, this holding of of the discomfort and the way that we could sort of bring some sort of like love and and kindness to those places that are not so comfortable and lovely within ourselves and maybe how that can also maybe then
maybe the way that we bring our love to inside ourselves could maybe help some of the ways that it's reflected outside of ourselves as well again or something but there's I just appreciated the meditation and the concepts.
Thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome. And I agree with you around the the way that
we project outwards on to the world, our own inner experience and that when we can bring a sense of more acceptance and allowing to our own experience that also spreads.
So it's it's beautiful. It's beautiful to to have that happen. Thank you, Jessica.
Anyone else have any willing to share. Yes, Sally.
Well, I just want to say, first of all, the retreat was very, very powerful for me. I, I, I felt like I just went to a different level in my practice and one of the important things that started to happen is my
long time struggle with the delusion of self of my fantasies.
I began to see it as a delusion to experience it as a delusion which I've never been able to do. And so that was like amazing.
It was really hard is that it really didn't stop. I mean, in a way, because it's so conditioned. And so I had to just watch that delusion play itself out over and over again. But and there the challenges just to let it go, let it be and not expect it to change.
But I'm so grateful for the retreat.
Well, and what you say is exactly my experience to sometimes we see through the delusion, you know, sometimes the delusion goes away, but then because it is so conditioned, yes, it comes back.
And so, but and yet the differences, and this is what you're noticing, you can see it now as delusion. That's hugely different. You know, it's very different than just being in the delusion, you know, and delusion to can have this kind of, you know,
hazy quality almost like we're looking through a veil of some kind. So that sometimes we if we can touch into this broader sense of the veil, you know, that that can also help in terms of meeting.
Oh, yeah, there's that big veil of delusion, that old habit of seeing things in that way, and knowing that that's happening.
That's very helpful because it gives me something more specific to notice is the veil.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's specifically broad.
Thank you, Sally.
Anyone else to share anything.
Joey.
Yeah, that was really helpful for me because as soon as you started the guided meditation, the niggly feeling came up for me that is sort of this background thing that's been sort of coming up happening.
And sometimes I have been thinking about your instruction to say, Oh, too big for me. I see you. I think I'm going to put that on the shelf.
And I'll, I'll, I don't want to dive into it and get tangled. But I think this is probably a better way of, you know, looking at it more as, you know, without getting clumped.
It's an option. It's an option as a way to explore these kinds of things. And sometimes setting it aside is, is something that's really useful.
You know, that it's like, yeah, you know, even try. So if you, if you notice, you know, trying to hold the, you know, the all of that, you know, trying to be with all of that that you just end up right back in it, you know, yeah, not so helpful.
But sometimes we can, we can, you know, and I think maybe touching into the broader sense might be an avenue to maybe not getting so caught in all of the thoughts if we can hold the hold the sense of the broader experience.
So, yeah, I'll be curious to hear if any of you, you know, can explore this on your own or, you know, what happens.
I'll probably talk about it more, you know, over the coming weeks and months because it is so interesting to me right now, this exploration.
I've found so much value in it and, and I'm just learning how to talk about it. So it feels a little bit of a step, a little bit of a leap for me to speak about it in this way in terms of the context, the context of our experience.
So.
