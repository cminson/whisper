 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Take a few moments to check in and see if there are areas of the body where there may be tension and see if there can be a softening, a relaxation of the body. And being aware, being mindful while doing that. Aware of the body, aware of where there may be tension, aware of the possibility of softening and relaxing that tension. So letting the attention connect with the head and face. Maybe there can be a softening of the muscles of the head and face. Perhaps the neck, the shoulders also can soften and relax. The arms and hands. Maybe the chest and upper back can also soften and relax. Seeing if there can be a softening across the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back. Maybe the hips, the legs, the feet can relax. Maybe too there can be a little bit of softening inside the body. Sometimes this is more, in my experience, more of an invitation and just not so much something we do, but just an invitation. Maybe, maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. Organs in the body to just settle inside the body rather than trying to hold them up. Let them be held by the earth. Release the body to the weight of the body to the earth. Perhaps too there can be a little bit of softening in the mind, a relaxation of any mental tension that might be there. Setting aside for now worries or concerns about past or future. And seeing if the mind can be willing to rest with just what's happening here and now. Letting the awareness be curious about how you are in this moment. As the body and mind can relax or can soften a little bit, quite naturally we will become aware of what's happening in the present moment. We'll become mindful, very natural capacity of awareness. When we're not caught in thoughts of past or future, it's a very natural function of our system to be aware of what's happening right now. So we don't have to work too hard if we can relax. And so with whatever relaxation is available in this moment, what's being received by mindfulness, by awareness, what's happening, what's obvious in this moment? What are we already aware of? What's most obvious, what's most easy to be aware of, to be with in this moment? Often body sensation is something that's quite easy to be aware of and so that may be what the attention is connecting with. Maybe the broader sense of your body or contact points, your hips against the chair or whatever you're sitting on. Maybe sensations of your hands and feet or perhaps a breath. That's the easiest place to connect with what's happening in the present moment. That's most naturally available, easily available. It might be the experience of hearing could become obvious at times, the sound of my voice or sounds in your environment. Maybe sounds connected to your body, gurglings or the sensation, the sounds connected with breathing or inner, the inner sounds of the body. What's easy to connect with in this moment? Perhaps the attention will connect with something and linger with it for a few moments and then shift to something else for a little while with the sensation in the body. And then the attention connects to sound. One way of practicing mindfulness is to just attune to the shifting of attention. We don't have to hold on to any one particular object or experience. We don't have to direct or aim the attention at anything in particular. But instead we can settle back and receive or notice what the attention shifts to. It might be felt as if we were receiving experience one after another, as if experience were coming into us. Or it might feel like mindfulness is kind of following the attention now on a body sensation, now on a sound, now on a breath, maybe shifting to an emotion or mood. This form of mindfulness practice of noticing the shifting of attention, really supported by relaxation. And letting go of needing to be in charge of what is happening, but willing to receive, willing to, we could say, maybe accept what is offered in our experience. And exploring this kind of mindfulness. Of course the attention will wander, will lose touch with the present moment. And yet at some point we'll become aware again, mindfulness will return. In that moment it can be useful first to recognize that awareness is back, to recognize perhaps what we have become aware of as mindfulness has returned. Maybe the thought that we've been wandering in or a different mood or sensation in the body is here. So I'm just kind of taking in what's here as mindfulness returns. And it may be supportive if you notice that there's tension in the system to reconnect with a little bit of relaxing the body. And relaxing again as a support for reconnecting with this very natural capacity we have to be aware. The Relax. Receiving. Aware. Whatever is easy to be aware of. It's most naturally available. And exploring the possibility of a friendly, allowing attention with whatever is here. It's very important to be aware of the possibility of a friendly, allowing attention with whatever is here. It's very important to be aware of the possibility of a friendly, allowing attention with whatever is here. It's very important to be aware of the possibility of a friendly, allowing attention with whatever is here. It's very important to be aware of the possibility of a friendly, allowing attention with whatever is here. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
