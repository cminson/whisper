Practice Note: One Thing at a Time

One of th e very significant ways of focu sing both 
mindfulness practice and  concentration practice is to 
remember the idea  of doing just one thing at a time. 
When you do one thing at a time, you can enter into 
that activity more wholeheartedly;  more of yourself 
can be put into it. Our wholehearted effort is such a 
precious thing . To be able to give it to one thing allows 
for purity, integrity, wholeness, and greater insight into 
what ’s going on.  
 
In terms of walking or sitting meditation, doing  one 
thing at a time would mean – if you’re doing breath 
meditation – knowing  that the one  thing you ’re here to 
do is to really mindful of your breath as full y as you 
can, and It is not to be with the breath  and to also be 
thinking about plans for the rest of the day.  When you 
do walking meditation , the practice is to be 
wholeheartedly involved  in the process of walking , 
and not thinking about what ’s going on ar ound you or 
about  other people. Are you walking as well as they 
are? The mind can get involved in other activities 
besides the activity of walking.  
 
If you have to think  while sitting or walking, then think 
about sitting;  think about brea thing;  think about your steps. D o one thing, and have everything involved in 
just one thing. Try to keep it really simple.  This 
morning I offer you the idea of just doing one thing at 
a time. If you go to the bathroom, just do that.  If you 
need to do something that ’s different than the walking 
or sitting, think of doing it like, “This is what I ’ll do 
wholeheartedly. ” It can be as simple as, if you ’re going 
to open t he door to go to the bat hroom, j ust open the 
door. You can open the door and be thinking about all 
kinds of other things , but what i s it like to just open the 
door?  
 
I’ll end with the answer that the famous Catholic 
monk, Thomas Merton , gave when he was asked 
what he learne d in his years of monastic life . He said, 
“After years of monastic life , I learned to open and 
close doors. ” May you open and close your doors, if 
that’s the one thing you ’re doing, when you are 
opening and closing your door.
