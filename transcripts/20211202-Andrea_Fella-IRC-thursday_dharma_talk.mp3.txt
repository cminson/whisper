 Continuing on our topic of the teachings, some of the teachings in the Satipa Tanasuta, going into the refrain, actually more springboarding off of the refrain for reflection this evening. The sentence in the refrain that I'd like to springboard from is one that got really touched on this morning in a way mentioned last night and elaborated on a little bit more this morning. Actually I think I'll read you the whole refrain right now and then I'll tell you which sentence I'm springboarding from. So this translation I'm reading is from Biku Annaleo. In this way, in regard to the body, one abides contemplating the body internally or abides contemplating the body externally or abides contemplating the body both internally and externally. One abides contemplating the nature of arising in the body or abides contemplating the nature of passing away in the body or abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the body. Mindfulness that there is a body is established to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness and one abides independent not clinging to anything in the world. The sentence I'd like to reflect on a little more is this one about the simplicity. Mindfulness that there is a body or there is feeling there are mind states there is mind I think that's the way it's offered. Mindfulness that there is a mind. Mindfulness that there is phenomena for the four foundations is established to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness. The continuous mindfulness here is pointing to the or is the phrase Pati Sati the guilt spoke about and has been translating his lucid mindfulness, clear awareness. Here Biku Annaleo translates it as continuous mindfulness. Mindfulness that there is a body is simply established to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and clear awareness kind of a mixture of translations there. This is pointing to as Gil was saying both yesterday and this morning to an awareness that is meeting experience without filters, a clear awareness, clarity of mindfulness not interpreting or judging or having an agenda or not experiencing through an interpretation or a judgment or an agenda. So the awareness is clear it it it's not distorting the experience. That's a way I like to think about what this clear awareness is. It's a non distorted awareness, undistorted awareness, transparent. So this phrase to me kind of connects to or springboards me into another teaching offered by the Buddha that may be an alternative kind of instruction or exploration of what it means to have this bare clear awareness kind of training to to do that. Now the Satipatana Sutta is the training to establish this kind of mindfulness and yet there's another teaching that's offered in the sutta's it's a brief teaching. Many of you have probably heard of it the teachings to Bahia where Bahia came to the Buddha having traveled a long way and wanted to hear what the Buddha had to offer and he was he was in he was kind of a little bit in a hurry. He arrived to where the Buddha lived and the Buddha wasn't there. The Buddha was out for alms around so Bahia followed after him looking for him. He didn't want to wait for the Buddha to come back. He followed after him and found the Buddha and said, will you teach me the Dharma in brief? Will you teach me the Dharma? The Buddha said, you know now's not the time Bahia I'm going for lunch basically and Bahia was so on fire you know with this spiritual urgency that he asked the Buddha again and he said we don't know how long you will live we don't know how long I will live please give me the teachings in brief. The Buddha again said now's not the time I'm having going for my alms round and Bahia asked him a third time. Many many places in the suttas when you ask the Buddha something three times he'll consent. So he consented he stopped and he offered Bahia a teaching. He says, Bahia you should train yourself thus. I'm gonna read just a piece of this right now. You should train yourself thus. In reference to the scene there will be only the scene. In reference to the herd there will be only the herd. In reference to the sensed there will be only the sensed. In reference to the cognized there will be only the cognized. This is how you should train yourself. He goes on but I'm gonna stop there and just consider this part of the teaching. How do we train ourselves? What is this training? What does it mean? This it evokes in a way what we've been saying about the simplicity. Just know the body as a body just no seeing as seeing. In the scene is only the scene and the herd is only the herd. So these four words seen, heard, sensed, cognized are kind of in a way I understand as a shorthand for the six sense bases. The five physical senses plus the sense base of the mind. So the seen, heard, and sensed it says in the commentaries that sensed refers to smelling, tasting, and touching. So those seen, heard, and sensed are the five physical senses and then cognized is the mind. What the mind does. And the instructions or the encouragement are to kind of notice the simplicity of each of these aspects of experience. This teaching is not very elaborated here for Bahia. Bahia did offer the ask for the teachings in brief and that's what he got. So what might they mean? In the scene is only the scene. Seeing when we when we see when we hear smell taste touch. Often it's not as simple as the sight or the sound or the smell. There's a lot that goes on in our system, in our minds, mostly in our minds, in relationship to seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and also in relationship to things that go on in our mind. So we see something and we, you know, we feel it. There's processes, there's these processes at work in our human system. Processes of body, processes of mind, and these processes connect. They interweave. Now normally we're not so aware of how the body and mind kind of play together when we see something or hear something. We're not so conscious of all the different processes that come into play. We just think of it as seeing. And so it's useful. It's the Buddha in the teachings of the Satipatanasuta is encouraging us in the first three foundations, encouraging us first of all to get to know the body, feelings, and mind states. So kind of to begin to distinguish body from mind. So the experience of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, recognizing something happening in the mind, there's a lot that goes on there. Just as some examples, I mean you're kind of actually all very familiar with this. Connected with a sight, for instance. We might have, let's start from the most obvious kinds of experiences and then work to the subtler ones. We see something and we, you know, we find we have a response to it. It might be as simple as we like it or we don't like it. Or it might be more of an emotional response. We see somebody doing something and we feel threatened or we feel excited or interested. So there's the seeing and then there's the response to it, the kind of the mental, emotional kind of terrain that happens in response to seeing. This is a big part of what we've been talking about and exploring here. Beginning to recognize the difference between a sense impression and what's happening. Our mind in response to it, the relationship to it, or just the follow-on from it. So we can begin to notice that distinction, the seeing and the emotional response are different things. And we can imagine or reflect on perhaps that the emotional response that we have is different depending on different conditions. And we see this, I think, we know this at times that yeah, if I wasn't so annoyed at that other person I would have a very different response to this situation. So we kind of see how our responses to things are shaped by prior conditions. So this kind of beginning to separate out the experience, the sense impression from an emotional kind of response. So the emotional responses are often the more obvious kind of mental response to the sense impressions. At a subtler level it might be just the simplicity of liking or not liking or the recognition at an even subtler level of the experiences pleasant or unpleasant. That second foundation knowing or recognizing, well there's this seeing of something, seeing this person doing this thing. And there's a sense of unpleasantness. Because that's actually a pretty complicated process because the unpleasantness in that as we start to look at it, so this we really start to see how body and mind are intertwined, the process of seeing intertwined with the mental activity. We see something and we form an idea about what the person is doing. And often, especially in the realm of seeing, the seeing itself, seeing is just form and color. The light comes into our eyes and hits the back of our retina and its shape and its color. And then our minds turn it into an experience. It recognizes it. So this is the perception that Gil was talking about yesterday, the painting of an idea onto the experience. And so there's that process that comes into play. We see somebody. The first thing we do is we recognize perhaps who it is and we form an idea about what they're doing. And it is the idea about what they're doing and our relationship, a whole perhaps host of history of our relationship to that idea that is pleasant or unpleasant. That's probably not actually the actual sight. This is a really interesting place to explore. So this is the training kind of the Buddha says, you know, train in the scene is only the scene and the herd is only the herd and the sensed is only the sensed and the cognized is only the cognized. One way to train to that direction. We can't just flip a switch and say, okay, I'm not gonna have any interference. Mindfulness is going to be completely clear and lucid. We can't do that, but what we can start to notice is where the mindfulness gets a little muddled, where there's something interfering, where there are processes involved that kind of take that clarity away. And so this is a way to begin to explore this training, to get familiar with the difference between what is the scene and what is all the mental processes at play there. What are all the mental processes at play as we go through the simple living of our day. So we see something and perceive it, recognize it, have ideas about it, feelings about it. And the practice is to be curious about what are all of the pieces that come into play when seeing is happening, when hearing is happening. Begin to get curious about what is seeing and what is all the mental stuff supporting it. So we might begin to recognize that as we see somebody doing something, have a sense of, oh, I don't like that, that there's a lot going on in the mind behind that. Now this kind of exploration of these mental processes at play with the sense spaces is, it's not something we try to look for so much, but as mindfulness gets a little stronger we might start to be able to see and see what they're seeing and then there's this idea of what I've seen and all of these views and beliefs and thoughts about what I've seen. That's actually what I don't like. I don't like the ideas. I played with this at one point on a retreat. I was noticing a lot of aversion in doing walking meditation. It was an evening walking period and pre-COVID we were all squeezed into a small walking hall and somebody entered into the walking room and kind of squeezed in next to me. And as soon as that person squeezed in next to me, it's like everybody kind of adjusted. There was enough room for that person but the aversion just flared up. So I started getting curious about this. You know what? What's going on here? I began exploring this the senses. What is seen? What was seen was a person walking and I was looking, I was curious actually about where was the mind actually reacting. Well what was unpleasant about the experience that it was averse to it? So I started looking at the various sense basis. Oh they're seeing happening and the person was just kind of walking normally. The person didn't look unpleasant and so it's like well that's not what the reactions to. It's not the seeing. They weren't making any noise. Not the hearing. They weren't touching me. Not the touching. They didn't have an odor. I went through all the physical senses. Not there. It's like huh, that's interesting. And I knew it's like there must be something going on in the mind but I didn't see it. I didn't know what it was yet. So I just kept stopping, you know, kept walking and looking at this experience of the aversion that was here with this person. And at some point as I was just walking back and forth I said I said to myself there must be some thought in there and I didn't particularly see any thoughts about the person at that point but as I kept walking a couple passes back and forth at one point as I turned around I saw this thought, they're weird. And there's a thought. Okay. I still didn't quite get it, you know, but after a little bit further on the justification for they're weird came up in my mind. You know, why did the mind think they were weird? And the thought that burst into my mind was it's freezing cold outside and they're in bare feet. And at that moment the mind just kind of laughed, you know, it's just like well that's that's a kind of silly thing. I mean I could see that there was a reaction to the feeling of the person being weird, that there was a kind of a tension or a tightness. But as soon as I saw this like justification in the mind of oh they're weird because it got bare feet and it's cold outside, it was like the whole thing fell apart. The judgment fell apart. The feeling of them being weird went away. And I was just walking and actually what happened in that moment was that the the heart opened and just was wishing that person really well. So it transformed from aversion to metta. This process was just I wasn't, I did look through each of the sunspaces, you know, kind of curious about well what's going on in the body, what's going on in seeing and hearing. So we'll check each sunspace. And then, but it wasn't like I was digging to find things out. It's like there must be something there, let's just see. So it's just being available for it to appear, to show up. And it appeared. And the willingness to see it, to be with it, to know it, led to a release of it. So this kind of process of how body and mind interact, in this case the seeing, I thought it was the seeing at first. But what it actually was, what the reactivity actually came from, was a thought in the mind. And it was a little bit humbling. It's like wow, what's going on is I don't like this thought in my mind. That's what actually the mind is reacting to. So this kind of curiosity about what's actually being seen, heard, sensed, cognized, what's actually going on in the sense world, and what's going on in our minds. It's really humbling to see this. And very valuable, really valuable to see this. So the process, the processes of body, of mind, there's a whole teachings on the different processes of body and mind. I'll just, I've named them a little bit here informally. So the body, and then in relationship to the body with each experience, this is how they come together. So every time we experience a sight, there's a feeling that comes with that. We experience that sight as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. And that's one of the mental processes. Feeling is understood to be a mental process here. There's the feeling of it. And then there's the recognition, the perception, knowing what that sight is, or that sound, or that smell. So another mental process at work, very connected to the sense-based process. I mean we're not going to be able to navigate our world without these processes. They're not a problem, per se. They confuse us. We misinterpret what they are. We take our perceptions and our beliefs and our views based on our conditioning to be what's actually out there. But it's kind of more of a reflection of what's out there. It's more, it's a reflection that is distorted by our past conditioning. And so this is where the the notion of clear awareness is interesting, that the clear awareness does not distort experience. So our processes of mind, the sight, there's the feeling, the pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, and the recognition. That's a sound. We feel, hear the vibration, the pitch and tone, and then the mind like recognizes it. Right now I'm hearing this kind of subtle rumble coming from the windows outside. The mind is interpreting that as Route 17 traffic noise. I don't know that's what it is, but that's its kind of perception at this moment. So there's the perception of the experience, the feeling, the perception, and then often there is this mental relationship to that. I don't particularly have an emotional response to Route 17 noise, but sometimes as I've been meditating in various locations at IMS, for instance, hearing the sounds on Pleasant Street, sometimes there's a really loud car or motorcycle that'll go down the street, and there's a reaction to that. There's that kind of emotional response. So that's another mental process at work, and then there's just a simple bare kind of recognition of knowing, knowing experience, another mental process. So these four mental processes that are described in a teaching on the five aggregates, which talks about the body plus these four, feeling, perception, mental, mental formation, activity of mind, and knowing. These five processes kind of come together, weave together, to help us navigate our world. We couldn't get by without the perception and possibly even without some of our responses, like that I think to those emotional responses have evolved in a way to keep us alive. Not always skillfully, but they are a part of our human nature, our human system. So with this kind of exploration of these processes of body, of mind, we begin to understand that so much of what we're experiencing, everything of what we're experiencing actually, it's not actually, we're not actually experiencing what's out there. We're experiencing a reflection of it that is informed by, shaped by our conditioning, our history, our views of the moment, whether we're hungry or not right now. There's so many things that are shaping what's happening in this moment. And the difficulty or the problem with the way our minds kind of work, or not so much problem, but why we get caught in suffering. It's problem or no problem, it's just the nature of our minds that when we're caught by these processes and don't understand them, we tend to suffer. So this is what the Buddha is pointing at. If you understand, if you can understand the processes as processes, begin to see, here's the seeing and here's what's going on in the mind. Understand them as kind of an interweaving of process. There is, it begins to help the mind to not believe its construction. So that kind of reflection that I was talking about, we know something in the world and it gets filtered through our mind, our ideas, our views. So it's a construction or a fabrication in our mind that we're actually meeting. That's what we meet in our experience. It's kind of humbling to know that. We're not actually receiving the world, we're receiving our interpretation of it. And so if we can begin to recognize that as an interpretation, not take it to be truth, not take it to be what's actually out there, not take it to be reality. So much freedom comes from that. There's a teaching in the suttas that kind of talks about these interweaving of the sense processes and the mental processes. And to point back to the bhiyasuta, what I think the bhiyasuta is really pointing to is, so yeah, notice the seeing, the hearing, the smelling, the tasting, the touching, the sense, the seen, the heard, the sensed. And notice the cognized. Know they're separate. Know they are both processes. We don't have to stop those mental processes, but we need to understand them for what they are and that's what we typically forget. We take them to be reality. We take them to be what's actually happening in the world. So this teaching that kind of talks about the interweaving of the sense base and the mental processes also talks about how that the mental process gets confused. This is in a sutta called the honey ball sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya. It's Majjhima 18 and partway through that sutta there's an elaboration on a teaching the Buddha has offered by one of his monks. And he goes, he says, he describes this basically, here's how the process of our mind works. Here's how it usually works. Dependent on the eye and forms, so the eye and light rays, the light rays coming from the forms out there. Dependent on the eye and forms, eye consciousness arises. There's that knowing. There's sight. The meeting of the three is contact. There's the kind of the impression, the sense impression we get. There's the sight. It's impinging on our sense base. We know it is there. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact is conditioned, there is feeling. Pleasant and pleasant, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. What one feels, that one perceives. So we recognize it. There's a sight, impinges on our eye, the light rays impinge on our eye, and we kind of the feeling there, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, and the recognition. Various places it's said these come together, just like there's, for instance, the sight of the light over there. And there's kind of both the feeling of the pleasant, unpleasant, in this case pretty neutral, you know, the seeing of a light neutral. But the recognition of it is light. That's this process. So this is all pretty normal and useful so far. Sense impression, feeling, recognizing it. Then it goes on. What one perceives? That one thinks about. So we start to think about it. And maybe it's it's, you know, just basically the kind of at the beginning it's just the, oh, there's a light and that's a useful thing. You know, it's it's helping to see the room. I need lots of light so I can see the the notes. So there's that there's that kind of little thinking about it perhaps. Or we hear something. You know, this happens a lot in meditation actually, this kind of phenomena. So there's a sound outside, the sound of there's been some hammering outside lately. So, you know, oh, there's hammering. And you know, so first there's just the recognition. Oh, there's there's the sound. And then we may start thinking about it. I wonder who's doing that hammering. You know, at first it might not be terribly charged, but you know, it's just kind of like a little bit of thinking about it. I wonder who's doing that hammering. What are they doing? The next step of this is where it begins to get a little more tangled up. What one thinks about that one mentally proliferates. So this could be a kind of a spreading of thinking. Don't they know there's a meditation center here? Don't they know we just started doing retreats again? I mean, what are they doing over there anyway? That they have to be hammering at this hour. So there you even hear in the tone of my voice, there's already some, you know, reactivity involved. This is kind of the place we begin to get tangled up. We get tangled up with our views and our ideas and our reactivity. And often at this point we are not recognizing, oh yeah, there's a there's a version happening. We're already in the world of that aversion, believing that aversion, believing that they shouldn't be doing that at that point. So this happens a lot to us. This kind of process happens a lot. And actually it's a very interesting, potentially interesting thing to explore around where and how the mindfulness gets lost. Because I'd say very often, quite often actually, that the place where the mind will wander out of the present moment and start to get involved in all of these things is when we don't clearly recognize that we've recognized something. So there's a sound that happens and the sound of the hammering. And, you know, there's kind of a hammering, but we didn't really clearly recognize the attention got pulled to the hammering. We're already thinking about they shouldn't be doing that. So there's been a perception that wasn't recognized. This is one of the main ways the mind wanders. There's something that that goes on, sound, sight, smell. We smell it and there's a recognition of it like, you know, the smell of the curry this morning. You're just, oh there's curry, oh I wonder what kind of curry it is. And we're off, right? We're off into thinking about lunch and envisioning what kind of curry it is on the table. So this is a prime place where the mind will wander and lose mindfulness. It's this shift from perception to thinking to all of the ideas and proliferation around it. But then it doesn't just stop there, this teaching. The elaboration and the teaching says, with what one has mentally proliferated as the source. Perceptions and notions related to mental proliferation beset one with respect to past, future, and present forms, cognizable through the eye. That sounds a little complicated. The language is a little complicated, but I think what it means is that these ideas we have, when we have some kind of a proliferation, it begins to cement in our minds our views and our ideas. And we start relating to experience through those views and ideas. So for example, this is a way essentially that history comes into play. Our history, our conditioning comes into play in the present moment. That's what I interpret this as pointing to. That the perception that we have, what we're noticing in the present moment, it's not just like our eyes are a camera taking in things in a really neutral way. It's already influenced or informed by all of our conditioning, all of our past ideas, past perceptions. So an example potentially of something like this. So we see somebody across the road, you know, and just seeing a person, not somebody we know perhaps, that may be a pretty neutral experience just to see somebody walking down the road. But if you have a particular conditioning in your past, maybe this person walking down the road has a way of walking that reminds you of somebody from your past. So there's an association, reminds you of somebody from your past and the connections and associations with that person from your past are ones of fear. The person had been really mean to you. Your relationship with seeing this person you don't know walking down the street may be instantly, oh I don't like that person, I don't I don't want anything to do with that person. Without really being conscious of the thoughts or the past history coming into that. We just get this intuitive feeling, you know, we sometimes call that intuition. That person's not safe and we don't really see that it's been our past or our history that has influenced this perception. One scholar puts it this way about how this process plays and he uses the word distorted perception for this mental proliferation. The Pali is Papansha, different translations for this mental proliferation. Tanasaro Biku calls it objectifying where we kind of create the idea of something. This scholar calls it distorted perception. So he says this is Professor Palihawadana. The process of distorted perception of placing every bare perception onto a framework of emotions and beliefs that have come out of our past, our history, our conditioning, robs the freshness out of our experience. But we are not aware of this constant interference of the past. Because of this unawareness which is our ignorance or our delusion, we see humanity fragmented as me and others, us and them, and in various other stereotypes, skin color, ethnicity, language, and ideology included. So this process that we're talking about, it's not just about, you know, looking at stuff going on in our minds, it's about the vast suffering of the world, how that comes to be. This is part of the importance of understanding it in our minds, how these processes work. So this description of the distorted perception is essentially not in the scene is only the scene in the herd is only the herd in the sense is only the sensed and the cognized is only the cognized. It's believing those views and ideas and perceptions to be reality. This is me. We do things right that they do not do things right. You know that kind of us and them, that kind of breaking yourselves into factions and beliefs in there. So the coming back to the bhiyasuta in the scene is only the scene in the herd is in reference to the scene there will be only the scene reference to the herd only the herd and reference to the sensed only the sensed and reference to the cognized and only the cognized. This is how you should train yourself. The training, you know it might be possible to at times kind of hear those teachings and and just like get a taste or a moment or a sense of oh for a moment as I hear that the sense of extra falls away. Some of you had that experience and in the guided meditation this morning I think. So just nothing extra is necessary and it just falls away but much of the time we have to do the duller work of actually kind of noticing what is actually in the way. Oh what are these ideas and thoughts and views but that noticing that very noticing begins to help the mind to understand how they are processes. It's not that we have to say in the cognized is only the cognized we stop the cognizing we stop the feeling the perception the mental formations but when we can recognize them as cognized as mental processes we're approaching or heading in the direction of understanding in the cognized is only the cognized. Knowing perception and recognition oh that's happening in the mind that recognition of oh that person's weird oh that's happening in this mind that's an idea happening in this mind. So powerful to see the difference or to kind of notice that something just being formed in this mind is not an inherent reality it is just a thought. There's a vast difference there and the seeing of that begins to help us to land in that place with oh this is a this is a thought this is a cognition this is just a thought. So we can move in the direction of in the scene is only the scene by being curious about mental processes physical processes opening to how we are in relationship to experience all of the teachings that we've been encouraging begin to point us in this direction and the scene is only the scene and the herd is only the herd and the sensed is only the sensed and the cognized is only the cognized. The teaching goes on to be here the Buddha says when for you there will be only the scene in reference to the scene only the herd in reference to the herd only the sensed in reference to the sensed only the cognized in reference to the cognized when that is the case when that is your when that is how your mind is meeting experience the Buddha says then Bahia there is no you in terms of that appointing to this kind of sense of self as being kind of fundamentally tied up with this whole process of distortion of distorted perception there is no you in terms of that when there's no you in terms of that there is no you there the sense of I me another cognition another construction of the mind it arises independence on history conditioning often arises independence on certain different flavors of I me my mind may arise independence on certain relationships you know for myself the identity or the sense of me as a daughter arises when I go home to visit my parents different sense of identity here sitting in front of the room different different experience so the the teachings here when there is no you there you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two this is the end of suffering what I find interesting here is this teaching doesn't start from trying to teach Bahia about what self and not self is just says you know look at your experience from this perspective see if you can tease apart the body and mind look at the processes of mind look at the process of body notice the difference between them and that begins to point out this the way that the sense of self is just another construction in the mind we don't have to go looking for not-self or try to figure out what is this me then Buddha points to just notice the scene notice the heard notice the sensed notice the cognized when that's the case for you when in the scene is only the scene but that's the case there is no you in terms of that the mind lets go of clinging the mind lets go of its identities and suffering releases once I was thinking about this teaching of Bahia I went in to check in with Gil and said is there any other place this is in the suit is and we found one place one other place this particular teaching is just two places in all of the texts but the one that we found has a nice little poem at the end of the teaching that the the person after he's heard the teaching from the Buddha now when Bahia heard this teaching what happened for Bahia was he became enlightened he he it was he was ready for this teaching and he he woke up and sadly he died within hours but I think that's an interesting kind of counterpoint to the beginning where he's saying to the Buddha we don't know how long you're gonna live or I'm gonna live he kind of brings that spiritual urgency you know practice while you can in this story that we found the person the Buddha gave the teachings to kind of checked his understanding out afterwards said here's what I understand that you said and so he kind of rephrased the teaching in his own words but here's what he he said having seen a form with mindfulness muddled attending to the pleasing sign one experiences it with infatuated mind and remains tightly holding to it many feelings flourish within originating from the visible form covetousness and annoyance as well by which one's mind becomes disturbed for one who accumulates suffering thus Nibbana is said to be far away and then he repeats it with respect to the other senses and then he goes when firmly mindful one sees a form when it's not inflamed by lust for forms what experiences it with a dispassionate mind and does not remain holding it tightly one fares mindfully in such a way that even as one sees the form and while one undergoes a feeling suffering is exhausted not built up for one dismantling suffering thus Nibbana is said to be close by I like that kind of language mindfulness but muddled you know seeing a form with mindfulness muddled that distortion that's not in the scene is only the scene bound up with our passions and our dislikes confused and emotionally responding suffering follows but seeing without that distorted mind just seeing just hearing just recognizing and feeling and knowing and maybe also knowing an emotional response this begins to unwind our being hooked to our habits and patterns and moves us towards freedom so let's sit together for a moment Thank you for listening to the Dharma
