 Gently opening the eyes and coming to attention. We're still meditating though. So if you would like, I'll invite you to come into the standing posture. Okay, so finding a spot where you can have your feet on the floor. And let's place our feet about hip width apart. If you're able to stand and just have your eyes open now while we're getting settled. It's possible to do standing meditation with your eyes closed. You're actually less likely to fall than you think. Or you can put your hand on something. For example, I see some of you have your hand on a chair. I have a chair here. So that can help just to have one thing. Or you can also have your eyes open and slightly downcast. You know, downcast to the floor about maybe five feet in front of you. But it's actually for most people, okay to stand with the eyes closed. So coming into a standing posture. With your hands, you can put them in the front like this clasped. Or you could have them hanging at your sides. That's fine. And now closing your eyes if you are going to be doing it that way. Just feeling down into the feet where they are standing. Feel the contact with the floor. The stability of the feet on the floor. It's important not to lock your knees. So please make sure your knees are soft. Very slightly bent. And just feel into the sensations of the legs supporting you. Feeling up into the calves and the thighs. Feeling into the pelvis area. Placing your hips above your heels. Feeling balance. As with the sitting, you can rock back and forth slightly and forward and back slightly to find a middle point of standing. Feeling now into the spine. It's helpful for the lower part of the spine to be slightly tucked. And then feeling how the vertebrae of the spine align. One on top of the other. Preserving a gentle curve of the back. Up to the shoulders. Shoulders align with the hips. Can help to imagine a small space between the very top vertebra and the base of the skull. This allows the chin to tuck just slightly naturally. So when we begin standing, it's helpful to have this global sense of the body so that you can settle into a posture that is relaxed as well as upright. Maybe now that you're balanced, if you didn't have your eyes closed, you could try that. And the sensing that the body can stand still. Standing and aware. This posture has a little bit more energy than sitting. So it can be used if we are sleepy. Nodding off on the cushion. You may notice certain areas of tension. Just hold those gently. Inviting relaxation. Standing by doing how we can stand softly and also straight. Like options. buring. attend to any sensations that come forth. You can anchor attention in the feet on the floor, or in the body as a whole, taking care of little tensions as they arise. A bit like riding a bike, there can be small adjustments that otherwise, in an otherwise dynamically sustained posture. So we have a sense of standing effortlessly. Let's do this now for just a few minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As we relax into this standing posture, and we stop fighting it in small ways, we may find that the body has a vertical energy to it. It can hold itself straight like a pillar, but it can hold itself straight like a pillar. It helps to continue breathing gently and easily, keeping the knees soft. So we have about five more minutes in this meditation. And if you would like, I invite you to continue standing. Or you're also welcome to return to the sitting posture. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
