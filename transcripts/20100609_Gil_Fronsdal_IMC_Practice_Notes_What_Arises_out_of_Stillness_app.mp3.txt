Practice Note : What Arises out of 
Stillness ?

As we were sitting here together, I was appreciating 
how still it was in the room. There’s something special 
that happens when a lot of people are together  and it ’s 
still. T he stillness gets heightened somehow  – more  so 
than if you ’re sitting alone . 
 
In mindfulness practice, meditation practice, t here’s 
something very  valuable about tunin g into stillness – 
having  a sense of the stillness that ’s here. There ’s 
always a powerful stillness present – all the time  – but 
often the mind is not still enough, or focused enough to 
notice it. M any times we notice that the mind is so busy 
running aroun d being active, that there ’s no room to pay 
attention to something as subtle as the powerful 
stillness. Or it never occurs t o us to pay attention to it, 
unless it stands out by itself in some very strong way.   
 
I’ve been in certain situations where the place itself 
seem ed to have a tremendous power of stillness . 
Somehow just being there allowed the  stillness to call  
attention to itself. But it ’s always here , and one of the interesting things to do when you meditate , is to see if 
you can sense some stilln ess. It can be stillness inside. 
It can be stillness around you in the environment.  
 
An interesting place to sense stillness is just outside of 
the edges of your boundaries of self. With your eyes 
closed , can you feel where the boundaries of yourself 
are? Generally, you don ’t feel it so solid ly as you would 
if you touched yo ur boundaries, touched your arm: 
“That’s the edge of who I am. ” You may feel  that there ’s 
no sharp line . But in that diffuse  sense of your outer 
boundary, you might feel just  beyond tha t. Maybe 
there ’s stillness there to hold you or inform you. It can 
be there  inside or outside . It can be in the mind , if the 
mind is  still. 
 
Sometimes, whatever little hint we have of stillness 
exasperates all the activity , movement and thinking 
going on in our minds,  and it can actually make us feel 
stronger.  Sometimes  we need patience or perseverance 
– just staying with that, and trusting that we can hold 
ourselves  still. In holding your body still and allowing all 
the movement to happen through you is o ne way to help 
detach  from all the movements of the mind or  of the 
body – not making  meaning out of it , or making  self out 
of it, or think ing about it.  
 
One of the interesting questions  to study when you use 
stillness as a reference point is , “What seems  to arise out of the stillness? ” And “What seems to arise out the 
preoccupations of the mind? ” When the mind is being 
reactive, or thinking about a lot of things, it tend s to 
create it s own momentum , and things arise out of that. If 
I’m really thinking about lunch a lot , then thoughts arise 
like, “Oh, maybe I need to go out to the d eli to get just 
the right bread for my sandwich .” 
 
If you really sense and feel what arises out of the 
preoccupations of the thinking of mind , you probably 
feel an energy of being contracted , tight, stressful or 
tense.  But if you tune into stillness , then what arises out 
of stillness? What bubbles up outside of the realm of 
thinking when there ’s no tendency to think about 
experiences ? Then there could be vitality, aliveness, or 
a sense of presence that seems to come out of that 
stillness , and which has a very different feeling than 
what a rises out of the afflicted mind, or the anxious 
mind, or the thinking mind,  or the preocc upied mind, the 
busy mind.  
 
You might, during this day, see if you can, in some way 
that nourishes you, tune in to stillness. It might highlight 
how you ’re not still , but maybe appreciate that highlight. 
Don’t be troubled by it. Just, “Oh look at that .”  
 
I hope those words are interesting for you to explore 
today. If they don ’t make any sense at all just forget 
them.
