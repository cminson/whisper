 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello everyone. Welcome to our meditation time together. And one of the supports for meditation is our meditation posture. And there's many dimensions, many elements to the value of the meditation posture. But one of them, the simple one that I'd like to offer today, is familiarity. That to more or less take the same posture meditation after meditation, when you sit down to meditate and take that posture, the associations with meditation, the channels of meditation, the habits, the orientation towards meditation, can kind of begin to click in, like your body knows what to do. And so it doesn't have to be so much of a mental effort to meditate, because the body participates. It kind of takes the posture, and our awareness kind of enters our body, and there's places of maybe some comfort from the familiarity. Oh, this is my meditation place. This is how I am. And then that familiarity, that physical sense of familiarity, can make it easier to be oriented towards the present moment here and now in this body. And we need help sometimes because of how strong the currents of thinking is that maybe takes us away from the present moment. So to assume your meditation posture, and sometimes if you do it slowly and kind of carefully, that supports this movement towards familiarity and entering into the present moment through your posture. Sometimes I've seen that the longer someone meditates, the more time they take to get into their posture, kind of moving back and forth, kind of adjusting their knees, maybe twisting a little bit, maybe moving their heads, just all kinds of getting everything kind of lined up and coordinated, cooperating with being present here and now. And lowering your gaze. Perhaps if it's comfortable, closing your eyes. And then taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. And those deep breaths can also be part of this entering the posture, returning to your posture, to your body that's here and now. The deep breath. Now the exhale, a long exhale in which you relax the shoulders, the belly, a kind of letting go, that somehow in the center of your being, and letting go into the pull of gravity. Letting your breathing return to normal. And on the exhale, relaxing the muscles of the face. Around the eyes, the jaws, cheeks. If it helps the mouth be a little bit more relaxed, let the teeth fall away from each other slightly so the lips are very lightly touching. Perhaps relaxing your scalp, or even just imagining the scalp is relaxing. Relaxing the shoulders on the exhale. Taking time to feel the release or softening of the shoulders, and perhaps how it settles you more into your torso. Softening the belly, soft belly as you breathe. And then turning your attention to the breathing itself now. Centering yourself and the body breathing. Maybe imagining that the sensations of breathing are like a river, ever flowing river, or ever repeating waves washing up on the shore. And for you to settle back and watch how all the aspects of breathing, the details of breathing come and go. The inhale comes, begins, and ends. It disappears. The exhale begins and ends. If there is a pause between the exhale and inhale, that pause kind of begins and ends. And within the inhale there are particular sensations that are the manifestation of inhaling. And rather than hanging on to each sensation, see them as a river flowing through, or as a constantly changing wave washing up on a sandy shore, all the little foam and little waves. And all the detailed sensations of inhale, they come and they go, they appear and they disappear. Don't hold on to anything, but see if you can settle back and just allow those sensations to wash through you, wash through awareness. And the exhale as well, all the sensations of exhale, settle back, relax, let them flow through you as they appear and they disappear. And for this meditation you're more centering yourself on the flow of coming and going, appearing and disappearing. Satsang with Mooji Your mind renders off in thought. Let go of your thinking and let go into the flow of breathing. The sensations of your body as you breathe. Almost like you're receiving it like the sand receives the waves or you're floating on it like you're floating on the river flowing. And then gently expanding your awareness that as you experience breathing in the flow of sensations, sensations, you begin to be aware of the flowing sensations of the body. Being aware of the coming and going, vibration, tingling, glowing, way in which sensations come and go in the body as well. And so the flow of sensations and breathing is centered in the larger field of flow and comings and goings. Flow and comings and goings. Flow and comings. Flow and comings. Flow and comings. Flow and comings. The best you can, centering yourself in the flow and vibrant, moving, changing sensations of breathing and body. In any place maybe where there's a hardness or things are coagulated or bunched up. As you exhale, see if that can be relaxed or softened, opened or expanded so that everything is somehow participating or joining. The dynamic way in which sensations come and go and appear and disappear, the vibrancy, tingling, flowing, glowing.......... If you are thinking a lot, relax the contracted mind. Relax the thinking muscle..... So the mind too can somehow float on the flow of change throughout the body. Maybe even becoming a flow of change..... And if what is hard and closed is in the heart, perhaps for a little bit you can open your heart. Relax so the heart also floats, it floats supported by the flow of sensations. It's okay to open the heart, to allow it to be, to float, to be held by all the flow in the body.................. To have the awareness centered on all that's changing in the body, all the sensations coming and going, is said to be healing because it begins to dissolve the places of contraction and holding resistance. The more things flow, the more health moves through us. And it is liberating. The more we can relax into the changing nature of life, the less we're holding on, clinging, resisting. And over time we can become the change, become the dynamic process of flow. Have our inner experience. And as we come to the end of the sitting, with time we'll discover that opening to the changing, dynamic nature of the body is moving towards wellness, moving towards healthiness, to wholesomeness, to freedom. And may it be that what we learn about wellness and freedom, that we carry that with us into the world. And perhaps sharing just by the nature of who we are and how we are, sharing that wellness, that freedom with others. May the ways that we develop and grow in this practice, may it be for the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be well. May all beings be healthy. May all beings discover the wholesome body, the wholesomeness embodied within. May all beings discover freedom as it flows through our veins, flows through our muscles and bones. May we live harmoniously in this changing world, knowing how to float and open to the rhythms of change, the comings and goings of things. May all beings be happy. Thank you. Thank you.
