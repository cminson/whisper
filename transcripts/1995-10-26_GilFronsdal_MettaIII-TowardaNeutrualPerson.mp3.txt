 I was thinking all these horrible thoughts about people I was working with. Well, loving kindness isn't an antidote. It can be an antidote to anger, aversion, and ill will. So I don't know, I mean, if we've talked about it a little bit, it's quite common that when people do do loving kindness meditation, that the opposite results. Because loving kindness lowers or reduces our defensiveness. And the normal way to kind of keep ourselves distracted from ourselves, it makes us more sensitive. But if we're more sensitive, then both are more sensitive to our own inner workings, and sometimes there's pain there. And the pain triggers into things like aversion and ill will. And sometimes we're just, you know, not necessarily more in touch with our own so much, it's more sensitive. And people irritate us more because we're more sensitive. But the understanding, at least in our tradition, is that in the development of both mindfulness and loving kindness, becoming aware of these tendencies and seeing them is actually considered very useful. And even though it's not necessarily pleasant. And so I don't know, I don't know how, the example or the metaphor that one teacher uses, which I don't know how I feel about this metaphor exactly, but I'll give it to you anyway, and you can struggle with it, is if you have a boil, I guess sometimes you lance a boil, and it's kind of, you have to kind of painful as you kind of clean it out. And sometimes with our own life, you know, there has to be kind of this release of the stuff before you can become clean or purified. Things come to the surface before they kind of depart. So then the question is always with something like that, is can you then have a little bit of loving kindness towards either your aversion or towards that part of you which feels pained for having the ill will? So there's two different, there's different aspects of multi-dimensional. So can you find somewhere that you can direct your loving kindness? And sometimes you can just do it to the part of yourself which is angry or upset or hateful. And because often we complicate it by hating or hate, and then we run off, you know, run down the street to get to our local loving kindness class, you know, to get a hit. Yes. Last week I was having a real struggle with my feelings of anger and hatred, etc. etc. And I just kept working on them in my way, one of the ways who's talking to a good friend. And I got really, really clear about Sunday morning and it was such a relief. I could like feel it through my body. The anger. And I knew what I had to do. I've done it this week and it was helpful. And then the perspective came for me. I did the emotional work and then I did what I had to do in the world and then the real, the bigger perspective came. So the key to turn it for you was talking to a friend and explaining your... There's not a lot of talking about this problem that I guess it just finally came together for me. And I knew what my problem was and what I was feeling. I really got clear about what was happening to me and then I acted on it. And I felt good about the way I acted on it. I didn't have to punish or anything. I said the truth. Good. Does someone else, how's it going with this realm of loving kindness, which seems to include today anger? I don't have anger, but I find myself looking at other people with giving them loving kindness but not loving them. And I think that's all right because I tend to take a rather long view of a lot of people anyway. But I feel good about sending them loving kindness, but I don't find them loving. So what's the difference between love and loving kindness? Well, there is a difference or else I'm mislabeling one of them. I think loving kindness is a more... Well, the fact that it has kindness in it. You can be kind to someone without loving. And loving seems to be a much more active kind of a relationship with loving kindness. Is that, do you think that's tenable? Yeah, I don't know. But I've been thinking since we're doing this class, I've been thinking a lot about what loving kindness is. I'm supposed to know something. I'm thinking we're going to teach it. And wondering, there's actually a lot of different definitions for loving kindness for metta. And so they don't necessarily... Maybe we don't want to kind of limit ourselves just to one definition. But the one definition I've been thinking about today is it's wishing for the welfare of others. And so seeing that someone has a potential to be happier or be happier to be safe or well, and they're wishing that for them. Whereas loving someone is also, I don't know if anybody knows what that means. I don't know, it's a very complicated... love is notoriously complicated. But one of the things I wanted to say today was that in talking about loving kindness, the Buddhist tradition distinguishes it from what's known as the near enemy of loving kindness. And the near enemy of a wholesome emotion is that state, that emotion at state which looks like camouflages itself as loving kindness or as the wholesome emotion. And so you confuse it with it. And the near enemy then for loving kindness is the word for metta, the word in Pali is pema. And pema usually is translated into English as affection or some kind of... what's the problem with word affection? A lot of us feel affectionate for each other. What's the problem we say? So the problem is not so much the word is finding the right word to which is always difficult. But it's a state of having a relationship with someone or loving someone where you want something in return. Whereas in loving kindness there's no desire for anything in return. It's just simply your own goodwill towards someone else, your own kindness to someone else, not expecting anything in return. Whereas a lot of... the world of love for a lot of people involves some kind of repress... And that could be appropriate many times but pema at least is this... is where you love someone in order to, in order to quality to it. And in order to for you to get something then not considered to be loving kindness. But it's a long answer, a long response. But yeah, I think there are people who... whose surface behavior isn't very lovable or difficult to appreciate it. But I think one of the things that you come to as you do mindfulness practice, as you go ahead and do kind of... as you do mindfulness practice or Buddhist practice, is you begin... I mean first seeing it in yourself and then being able to see it in other people is something that's very precious, kind of at the core of our being perhaps. Maybe it's our awakened nature or our Buddha nature or something. And you recognize that in other people and you realize that other people have it just as much as you do. Even though it might be covered up and hidden by all this bizarre behavior. And if you can relate to that quality in someone else then it's easier... then it's a lot easier to have loving kindness without necessarily feeling that they're lovable. You don't want to go over and hug, you know, this person but at least you can wish for their welfare. It's maybe easier to wish for their welfare when you see that there's this wonderful potential that's inside of them. But it's unrealized very often. It's unrealized. But unrealized is a difficult word. It's there, just it's unseen. Maybe it's my blindness, but it doesn't seem... I doubt it. Well, you know, it has nothing to do with behavior. So I like very much what, you know, Gandhi's distinction between a person and a behavior. He would never criticize a person for being a person, for whatever they did, but he would criticize particular behavior. And so can we look beyond the behavior to something more precious? And I think it's possible. Polly? I want to just touch on what you're saying. I feel I'm kind of a sarcastic cynical person, so I get kind of a little icky around this loving kindness. I really detest fake kindness or insincere. But something I can do is when I'm really angry with people, which or I feel unpleasant towards somebody, is to consciously choose a softer response that there's that sort of deciding point where I could do something sort of retaliatory or maybe something a lot more neutral. And that's repeatedly shown itself to be the right way for me. It's good for me. I don't know about them. So that's how I can see it changing the way I behave with people. I told somebody that I was going to say, what's this class? Loving kindness? And I said, well, it's where I go and think nice thoughts about everyone that I hate. So they weren't going to come with you then. One way of understanding emotions in Buddhist psychology is that there are two categories of emotions. And actually, there's not a lot to be said, but two categories. There are emotions that connect us to others and to ourselves and emotions which tend to isolate ourselves from others. So anger, the way we usually act on anger, it usually isolates us from others, kind of removes us from others and separates ourselves and alienates us. Whereas loving kindness done properly is supposed to connect us with others. Though it's possible to do it in a sentimental way, kind of false, hypocritical way, and actually just puts up a huge barrier between you and someone else if it's done kind of because it's the goody-goody thing to do and it's kind of tied in with pity for the other person. Yeah, I guess when I think about it, it's that I don't put up the barrier. That's the path in choosing is not to, you know, I just kind of do something that still leaves the connection. So rather than trying to do some loving kindness, just kind of hauling it in into the situation, just try to see if you can maintain the... if you can feel or see the difference between connectedness and isolation or separation, then you can choose connectedness and then see what arises out of that. Or just leaving it open. Good. The last thing and then we'll sit. There's a... Norey and Joe Gobek's one of her books, The Attachments Do With Love, and she defines it in this way, which I consider to be Buddhist way to find love. There's a story of a young man who comes into the influence of a very wicked woman. And a wicked woman tells him that he must go and cut off the head of his mother so he does so. And he is running along with his mother's head in his hand and suddenly the head starts to talk to him and says, don't run so fast. You fall down and hurt yourself. She says, Joe Gobek is his very sweet grandmother in San Diego. So it's wishing for someone's welfare regardless of what they've done to you. Regardless. And some of you probably read the story in Sharon Salzberg's book about the Tibetan monk. Before he was a monk, he was a guerrilla fighter in Tibet and was captured by the Chinese. And the Chinese did terrible things to him. They tortured him for a long time, I guess. But he vowed, apparently the beginning of his imprisonment, that he'd only have feelings of loving kindness for his captors. And so that's what he did was in jail and finally he was released or escaped. And then he became a monk and had unusually deep, quick progress in his meditative life. And it was so unusual that he made such quick progress. People asked him, why did he make such much, much progress in your meditation? And he said, oh, it was because of the way I treated my captors. Because I vowed only to have loving kindness to them and not to hate them or be bitter at them or attack them. So, strange stories. It's in the car. Maybe next week, I have a story I was going to read in LA this weekend. Maybe I'll bring it here next Thursday. And we can talk about this kind of subject a little bit in our short hour. So let's sit a little bit. So make yourselves comfortable sitting upright in an alert way. And close your eyes. And then take a few deep breaths to settle into your body. And then breathing normally. Feel your body as it is right now. And then take a moment now to discern, to sense, what is the basic mood or emotional state that you're sitting in right now? How are you feeling right now? And if it's simple, you can name it. Name your mood. And then if it's possible, see if you can feel where in your body that mood or mental state primarily resides. And sense and feel it in the body, allowing it to be there. And then letting go of that. Bring your awareness, settle your awareness to the area around your heart, middle of your chest. And as you keep your attention there, imagine that your breath flows in and out through your heart center, through the center of the chest, center of the body. That is called the heart, maybe because it tends to be sensitive or vulnerable. Allowing the breath to flow in. Filling the body, filling the chest with warmth, fullness. And as you breathe out, it breathes out peacefulness, calm. And if you wish, you can use a label for the in-breath and the out-breath, whatever you choose. But for the in-breath, you can say love or kindness, warmth. And for the out-breath, peace or calm. Allowing yourself to be just the way you are, resisting nothing, open to everything. Breathing in warmth, kindness. Breathing in care for oneself. Breathing out calm, peace. Breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing out calm, breathing in calm, breathing in calm, For which you feel good about. Makes you feel happy that you did it. It can be a very small, almost insignificant act. But think of something that you did. It makes you happy to remember you did it. And allow yourself, if it's possible, to feel the contentment, perhaps the lightness or the joy or the happiness, however small it might be. Connect to this memory. And then getting an image of yourself, perhaps a mental image or a physical felt sense of yourself as a human being, as who you are. Express the words of loving kindness to yourself, allowing yourself to sink into the intention to rest in the meaning of the words. May I be happy. May I be free from worry. May I be filled with joy. May I be free from physical harm. May I be free from mental harm. May I be at peace. May I be at peace. And then bring to mind some friend or benefactor who you currently know, someone who's in your life these days. And holding the image of your friend or benefactor in your mind's eye, perhaps the image you form or the memories of a time when they were happy. And then continuing to breathe in and out through the heart. Extend your loving kindness to your friend. And may you be happy. May you be free from worry and anxiety. May you be filled with joy. May you be in health. And as you say words of loving kindness for a friend, sometimes it can be nice to actually say the name of the friend. As part of the phrases of loving kindness. May you be at peace. May you be well. And now bring to mind some other person, friend or benefactor, relative, who is also part of your life these days. And remember in a recent time you were together. And quietly in the heart, you can state their name, letting their name, their presence resonate in your heart and your being. And may you be happy. May you be free from harm. May you live a life of delight. May you live a life of ease. And now bring to mind someone who is sitting here in this room. Maybe it doesn't have to be anyone special. It could just be a vague recognition of someone you sat next to or noticed. It could be anyone who's you noticed here today or tends to come here. And then extend your well-wishing to this person. May you be happy. May you be free from ill will, irritation and anger. May you be free from harm of all sorts. May you be filled with joy. May you be filled with loving-kindness. And now bring to mind some neutral person in your life. Someone that you have no particular liking or disliking of. Someone that is a total stranger or that you see regularly but you haven't formed any particular relationship of. It's more or less a neutral person. The person who delivers the may all are a clerk in a store, a distant neighbor. So bring to mind such a person. Perhaps having an image of their face. And just as most people want to be happy, so this neutral being person most likely also wants to be happy in his or her life. And has the capacity to be happy. So then extend your loving-kindness or your well-wishing to this person. May you be happy. May you be free from suffering. May you be free from anxiety. May your days be spent in ease. May you be at ease in your body. May you be filled with delight. May you be at peace. And the last person is once more see if you can find a neutral person. Some person who's relatively neutral. And see if you can include them in the sphere and the embrace of your kindness, of your well-wishing. Of sensing and feeling their capacity for happiness and wishing it for them. And as you do this you can breathe in through your heart, breathe in warmth and fullness. And as you breathe out you can now breathe out through your heart, feelings of loving-kindness for this neutral person. May you be happy. May you be filled with joy and delight. May you live your days in peace. May you live your days at ease. And then again breathing in and out through the heart. Breathe in feelings of loving-kindness or fullness or warmth. Breathe out calm this peacefulness. Breathe out calm this peacefulness. Breathe out calm this peacefulness. Breathe out calm this peacefulness. Breathe out calm this peacefulness. Letting go of your thoughts and concerns. Allowing yourself to breathe gently into and out of and through the stillness of the room. Breathing in loving-kindness. Breathing in. Breathing in. Breathing in. Breathing in. He has said that a transition from a friend to a neutral person is a very important transition for the practice of loving-kindness. With extending loving-kindness to a neutral person, that tends to be more difficult for people because it's usually someone you don't naturally feel and immediately have these feelings of kindness or friendship to. But the idea of loving-kindness is to be able to extend it or spread it to everyone regardless of whether they're friend or foe or neutral person because loving-kindness has nothing to do. Loving-kindness is a universal expression of wishing for someone else's welfare. And it's not limited just to people you're close to, people you feel friendly with. It goes beyond that, beyond preferences. Opening up to a neutral person is beginning to go beyond our usual narrow circle of people usually open up to. And also it begins making us sensitive to people who come through our life who normally we would just tend to ignore, overlook, and not have anything to do with, not have any heartfelt feelings for. For as many people it's more difficult to do loving-kindness for a neutral person. And it's interesting to reflect and think about why that might be, if that's the case for you. Why is it more difficult for someone who you're kind of neutral to? Why can't you extend loving-kindness equally to everyone? So how was that to sit today? I think that neutralness is a kind of boundary where something fades out of tension. But you can pay attention to someone who's close to you, and you can pay attention to someone. The statement you made, I think it's often very accurate that it's easy to have some kind of, to be engaged with, or to pay attention to people that we like or people we don't like, or things, events that we like or events we don't like. But the things that are kind of neutral, there's often not that much interest. And I think part of the reason is that we are such identity addicts, that what we tend to be interested in is in things which support our identity, or notions of self, or whatever, and either support them or threaten them. But things that neither support or threaten are just not so interesting. And so neutral people at times can be such a category. So you tend not to notice them because there's no benefit from them, or no threat from them. And this is where maybe you understand how pemma, the steady of pemma, the near enemy of loving kindness, is so important to understand. Because often the kind of love we want from someone, or the kind of attention we want from someone, is there because we want something from them. And we're getting something from them. But a neutral person, we're not necessarily getting anything from them, not in the normal way. And so it's much more difficult to sustain the attention there. I can't think of a single human being that I don't have some thought about in the near. Yeah, some liking or disliking. Well, that's why I said, that's why I worded it, I thought, very carefully. I try to say, relative like or dislike. So more or less neutral, relatively without any like or dislike. Because a lot of people, judging others, good or bad, or some variety of that is just such a habit and automatic. I'd respond some way. Yeah. I can find people that have done sort of a little mix of each, so I'm confused about how I feel about them. So that's why I chose for a neutral thing. I think the idea is not to make this a hard and fast category, but rather just kind of, there's a range of, there's kind of a range of how we feel about people. And it's not like completely we don't like it, completely we like. But find someone who's more or less, in your way of seeing people, more or less kind of, you know, kind of neutral. You know, you can't get any more neutral than that because you're not capable. So to get as close to neutral as you can, without having to analyze every possible person, just kind of in a casual way and be satisfied with that. And, you know, we do tend to judge people very quickly. And how many of you had the experience that you judged someone? Either you liked them or didn't like them, or they were a particular kind of person or something. And then as you got to know them, you realized how wrong you were. I've done that so much myself that I kind of learned that maybe my first impression isn't always, you know, the best one to go on. And so I'm willing to hang out for a while and see what else might happen as I get to know the person. I found this really interesting because I go places and I see people that I feel neutral about. It's almost like a hiccup in my heart. I don't, it's a space where nothing exists in it. It's an annoyance to me and I never identify it. And I couldn't center on any one person as you were talking. And I finally did a comparison and I realized by having that kind of care in that space where I had no feeling at all, it was the freest expression I felt in the world. The freest expression of loving kindness or friendliness? Yeah. Beautiful. That's really nice. Anybody else feel that? There's a kind of freedom to the loving kindness. It tends to be true of friends or family. It seems very complicated and nice. I came up with a neutral person which was the person who served me my lunch today. And as I've directed loving kindness for this person, I became, I kind of felt sad or a little bit regretful because I don't think I was in a bad mood at lunch. But I just had a sense of how stressful it is to be a fast food person and self person and how many people come through the cafeteria where I get my lunch and are irritating for the take a long time. Not that I, but I felt sad that I hadn't expressed anything towards this person. I thought I could have just smiled. Not that I was mean to her or anything, but just I was aware of how I could have been. Great. I think that's the benefit of loving kindness. You realize that. Well, you choose a neutral person. You kind of see maybe regularly, but neutral and suddenly that person's not necessarily so neutral anymore. If you do that person regularly in your loving kindness meditation, suddenly you run into that person and suddenly there's all this history suddenly that you've spent loving kindness, even if it was an intimate time with them. And they have a special place in your heart for them. And suddenly there's a whole other relationship blossoms. Whereas before they were just this neutral person you never thought about. Maybe next time they serve you, you smile. I felt really this afternoon just kind of a sense of spaciousness. Well-doing, actually all of it, but it just felt like my universe was expanding. Great. And it was a universe perfumed with loving kindness or was just perfumed with space? Well, it felt like a really warm, loving place. Nice. And I could embrace a lot more people and creatures. That's nice. Nice. It's one of the great delights I think of loving kindness practice to begin opening your heart or your care or your kindness or whatever the word you like for it to strangers and neutral people. One of the things I like doing is sitting in public places. It's like an event or something or an airport and just watching people go by. And I'll try to imagine in my mind what their faces would look like if they were filled with delight and happiness. Or what would be like if, because everybody has that capacity and probably they have that. If they're home with their family or home with a friend or whatever. That they would probably, I try to imagine what they would look like if they were completely delighted rather than rushing around with big frown or whatever. And I do that and I kind of imagine or can see kind of, oh, that's how they look if they were really smiling or delighted or laughing or whatever. Then I kind of had this natural feeling of metta or loving kindness arises for that person. And my experience of being in airports becomes a whole different event. Then another way I used to be, I used to not necessarily like or dislike people, spend all this time putting people in categories. This kind of person, that kind of person, this kind of person, that kind of person. And now that's not so important anymore. Rather, it's just this wonderful exercise of appreciation. And maybe it's related to this thing about learning to recognize that everybody, there's something precious within everyone. And so if you spend some time actually reflecting on what's precious, one way to do that is to imagine them happy. Because everybody wants to be happy. And that's a pretty reasonable request. I took this laughter therapy course for a week. We had a YouTube thing. One was we had to carry around this huge stuffed bear. Looked like a black bear, wasn't like a teddy bear bear. And then you had to hug somebody by the end of the week, a stranger. You mean stranger off the street or in the workshop? Off the street. And it was an exercise to really look at people and say, and for me it would be willing to even consider the hug. And also how people would respond to the bear. You felt like such an asshole. Then you carried it everywhere. And we just had the most outrageous interactions with people that you just wouldn't even think. It was really hard. It was hard because it really messed with your, you wanted to be serious or a guy's dragon is barren and McDonald's would be a cup of coffee. I'm just reshotting. So did you succeed in laughing for a whole week? Wasn't that the hardest I've laughed? Yeah. It's really fun. Your ligaments and your ribs tender by the end of the week? Yeah, my stomach gets so sore I can't have severe pain. So you're successful? Okay. How could I not? At least for the week. I mean, she's been a week laughing. Well, actually it was interesting because her theory is that laughter is a way to release stress and it doesn't have to be funny. And when you go like that, it's going to become funnier. There was a book called Anatomy of an Illness many years ago by no one could. And he had laughter therapy for his cancer. He went and got all these funny movies and watched them. I'll read this to end. This is by George Washington Carver. How far you go in life depends on your being tender with a young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with a weak and strong. Because someday in life you will have been all of these. So you might experiment this next week with reflecting on paying attention to neutral people, either sending them loving kindness or just reflecting what it means to meet someone who's neutral or stranger and anywhere. When you stand in line at the supermarket and the person's in front of you or behind you, how do you think about that person? Do you form a relationship with them when you're standing in line or you look at the magazines? And forming a relationship doesn't mean you talk to them necessarily but you kind of include them in your world or you just kind of look at men's health or whatever it's called. I go to Whole Foods and I'm so surprised by the magazines they have there. Does anybody buy them? And all these men's magazines, I've never seen them anything like it. The buff men. So next week is the fourth week and we said this is going to be a four-week event. And next week we'll do, I won't tell you what we'll do, we won't come. Because it's okay to do neutral people but... And what I'm planning to do, I'm going to do, whether you come or not, is the next week you all come because it's part of the four weeks. But what I want to do is the following two weeks is continue having a loving kindness hour from five thirty six thirty. And I would like to do it much more regularly, just an ongoing thing. And I looked at my calendar and I could only do it for the next two weeks and then I can't do it for a while. So we'll start up again in the new year, January or February. But I just want to let you know we'll extend it two more weeks into the first three Thursdays of November. And probably what we'll do is we'll just kind of expand the progression, the way it traditionally goes. Because it's self, friends, neutral people, difficult people. And then it goes beyond that too. Slime balls. Now what you do then is, in the formal way of doing loving kindness, after you do those four people, categories of people, then you do something that's called breaking down the barriers, where you extend loving kindness equally to all four people at the same time. So it's kind of you're getting beyond kind of wider than just the one person. And then you start expanding it out to categories of people, not just single people, like categories of everyone, all women or all men or all beings in Palo Alto or everyone in the sitting group. And then you do include animals and birds and slime molds, I guess. So be well.
