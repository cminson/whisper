Practice Notes :  
Ease as a Reference Point

A very helpful concept, or attitude, or approach, to 
mindfulness is to look for the ease in whatever is going 
on, or to be easy with what’s happening. In mindfulness , 
there’s a lot to do with being present for what’s 
happening – so we bring our presence;  we bring our 
attention to what’s happening and, hopefully, give 
careful attention, presence, and really be present for 
something.  But then how we are, how we are with that 
presence is very important and it’s useful to look for 
ease in what’s happening. Where is the ease? Can we 
find ease? Because the opposite of ease is not helpful 
for meditation.  
 
The opposite of ease is to take t hings heavy, or tight , or 
contracted, or constricted. I t’s to be preoccupied, caught 
up. To be easy with what’s happening is to make space 
around it, or hold it lightly, to not be so fixated on it, not 
take it as being so incredibly important, and b e easy 
with it. Even very important things can be held easy.  In 
that space of ease , there’s opportunity to relax. There’s 
opportunity to unwind a little bit,  to soften , to step back and see what’s going on with greater clarity , which  you 
can’t do if you’re really  caught up with things.  
 
What’s amazing is the degree to which our minds have 
the capacity to not be at ease with things. Generally , 
when  the mind is focused  on something, i t’s usually not 
so easy with what’s happening. And so, to use the 
reference point o f ease. To ease up. To be easy with 
what’s happening. To find the ease with what’s 
happening. To shift your relationship to whatever you’re 
paying attention to, whether it’s the breath when you’re 
meditating, or your steps as you walk. As you go about 
your daily life, pay attention to what’s happening in the 
present moment, whatever it might be. It might be a 
very global experience . You’re driving on the freeway:  
the whole experience of traffic, rush hour traffic, stuck in 
traffic. Or it’s a particular conv ersation with someone. 
Whatever it is you’re paying attention to, in the back of 
your mind you can say, “ What would it be like t o be at 
ease in this situation?  How can I find my ease with 
this?”  
 
If you can’t find your ease with the situation because 
you’r e so uneasy, then perhaps the task is to be easy 
with that. You could be at ease with being uneasy. It’s 
really easy [laughs] to be upset, or reactive, or resistant, 
or contracted, or judgmental about feeling uneasy. 
Especially after I tell you to be easy about everything. 
Of course , you’re going to be uneasy, so if that’s what you’re paying attention to, be easy with that:  
“Okay here I am. That’s what’s happening. I’m 
uncomfortable. I’m upset. Okay , so I’ll make some 
space for that. I’ll hold it lightly. I won’t be so  much  
in a punching match with it. I won’t be running away 
from it. I won’t tighten up around it. Let me just  hold 
it, make lots of space.”  
 
The last thing in this sense of ease, an expr ession I 
think is really beautiful, is to give something breathing 
room. One of the things we try to do in meditation is to 
give breathing room to our experience. So that brings us 
back to the breath. Breathe in an easy way with your 
experience. Make room for your experience. Make 
breathing room for it, so there’s more space, and more 
circulation, and more possibilities for it to show itself, 
and unwind, or process, or do what it needs to do.   
 
Breathing is a way of finding that ease. Breathe. 
Breathe in a  relaxed way. Make breathing room for your 
breathing. Make breathing room for your mind. Make 
breathing room for your experience. Breathe.  
 
As you go about today, I’d encourage you to use that 
category, idea of ease as a reference point and see how 
that l ubricates, or opens up your day for you.  
 
Thank you.
