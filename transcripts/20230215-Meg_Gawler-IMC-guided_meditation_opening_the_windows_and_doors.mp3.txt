 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Greetings, everyone. Welcome. It's lovely to be here with you, and I really do appreciate you being here with me. So, here we are today in a community where we're creating together, opening the Dharma heart, cultivating wholesome qualities in our hearts and minds. Monday, it was focusing on receptivity. Yesterday, cultivating a softness of mind. And today is perhaps an ambitious one of cultivating a mind that is unobstructed. So, I'm sure many of you are familiar with the five hindrances, those unwholesome states of mind, sensual desire, wanting, not wanting, aversion, ill will, a lot of intraprene or feeling rigid and stuck, the agitation of restlessness and worry, and the hindrance of doubt. So, to make this a doable project for a 30-minute meditation, we'll try to create the conditions where we can notice if one of these unskillful tendencies starts to arise and see how we might let go of it. So, let's begin by vowing to be gentle with ourselves, kind with that mind that may be spinning off in thoughts. And if we see that the mind has been spinning for a while, it's no problem. We can rejoice that we've seen it, and we come back to being present here in this body, breathing. And then comes the important part, appreciating what it's like when that negative tendency subsides, even if only temporarily. So, as we have been doing and will continue to do this week, we begin with each of us setting our intention for this period of meditation. What motivates us to practice? And now taking your meditation posture, sitting or lying down, connecting with the earth, and aligning the spine. So, feeling your seat or your body on the bed and the earth supporting you, and feeling your spine as an alive space where the energy can flow through you, up from the earth and out to the heavens. And you can also appreciate the energy that comes down from the sky through you and into the earth. It's important to try to center the head a little bit on the spine so that it's not logging forward or looking out for being off to the one side or the other. So with our alignment as balanced as comfortable as we can make it, we do a scan from the head down to the toes, relaxing the shoulders, the arms and hands, the heart area, the belly, the hips, the legs and the feet. And if you can settle down into the stability of being here, it's really invaluable if you can refrain from moving while you meditate. Just be here in this body the way it is without trying to change what your circumstances are. And now we'll continue with some short Metta meditation. The last two days we did it with inviting a benefactor to come and join us sitting in front of us and looking into their eyes and sharing. The well wishing. I just heard somebody maybe there's a participant who's not muted. So if today you are comfortable being your own benefactor, you can try it that way. Or if it's helpful for you to do that in the company of someone that you really love and always feel good with, that's fine as well. And what we're doing with this little bit of Metta is warming up our mindfulness meditation by lighting a little flame in our hearts of kind friendliness towards ourselves and towards whatever arises moment after moment. Creating a safe space where we're protected by this feeling of warm hearted well wishing towards ourselves and all beings. May I be safe and protected. May I be happy. May I be peaceful. May I be free. Now beings be safe. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. With this well wishing we light a little candle in our hearts, bringing warmth, receptivity, softness, and openness to our mindfulness. Now we bring in the wisdom to vow that for this period of meditation, we'll do our best to help the body and the mind to settle down. It's the wisdom to know that we and our community here are better off if each of us can leave our preoccupations, responsibilities, worries, concerns outside of our meditation space. No need for them now. So connecting with the breath and letting that little flame of wishing ourselves well imbue our mindfulness with a feeling of benevolence. Connecting with the cycle of the breath. Breathing in well wishing. Breathing out well wishing. Breathing in safety. Breathing out happiness. Breathing in peace. Breathing out freedom. And just staying with the quiet of the mind that is happy to be here, just breathing. Together with our like minded friends from all over the world. Breathing in. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. I wanted to turn something off. Let's go back to the breathing. Breathing in with a warm heart. And breathing out. It's a peaceful heart. Feeling the beginning, the middle, and the end of the in breath. Beginning, the middle, and the pause after the out breath. And letting your quiet of your friendliness towards whatever arises. and letting yourself be nourished by the quality of warm-heartedness as we breathe in and as we breathe out. And happy to open the windows and the doors of the mind, not shutting anything out and not spinning off in useless thoughts. And letting that warm heart radiate inwards as we breathe in and letting it radiate outwards as far as it wants to go as we breathe out. And letting that warm heart radiate inwards as we breathe out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And if you should find yourself on a thought train, you could say, I see you Mara. So if you don't know who Mara is, he was the tempter who was furious that the Buddha had so many devoted followers and was so highly respected. And Mara's job in life, as far as he was concerned, was to knock the Buddha off of his pedestal of enlightenment and to knock all of his followers off as well. So I find this a very helpful image if I discover, oops, been on that thought train for a while. And I just say, I see you Mara. And Mara, when he's seen, he's defeated and he slunks away. So if we find ourselves thinking again, just coming back gently, no judgments at all. And just with his simplicity of being here in this body, in this breath and tasting the goodness of even a second of just that. Thank you. We'll see you again next month. you you you you you If another thought starts to arise, I see you. No, thank you. And with a smile, you come back. Being here in this body, with the ebb and the flow of the breath, and gently daring to open the windows and doors. Breathing in, enjoying the spaciousness of a moment of freedom. Letting in the warm sunlight and the fresh air. Enjoying these moments when the mind is unobstructed. Breathing in, radiating warm openness. Breathing out, radiating spaciousness for all beings. Breathing in, openness. Breathing out, spaciousness. Breathing in, radiating warm openness. Thank you. Thank you. And as we come to the end of this sitting, with a mind that has benefited from fresh air by opening some windows and doors, through the goodness of our practice, may we from our center of openness now radiate our heartfelt wish. May all beings everywhere be safe. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you. Thank you.
