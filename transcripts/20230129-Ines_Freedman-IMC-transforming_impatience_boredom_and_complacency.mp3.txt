 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So it's particularly wonderful for me to be back here. It's been a number of years since I've been at IMC teaching. And it was very sweet, you know, because one of my good friends, Peter Medina, some of you might know him, died last year. And over 20 years ago, he was a monk in Asia, and he gave IMC his clock, his travel clock, you know. And so it's still here. It survived all the modernization and improvements, and it's still here. So it's kind of sweet to see that. So I'll start with a metaphor that really helped me in my early practice, which was the metaphor of the snow globe. You know, when you shake a snow globe, you know, all the snow just, you know, is all over. You can barely see anything inside it. But if you just let it settle, it just kind of very gently, eventually it settles down. And that image was very helpful for me in my early meditation. You know, I'd sit down and my mind would be so chaotic. There's so much happening. But just thinking of the snow globe was like, okay, okay, I just have to sit here, and in time it will settle. And for quite a while, that was like a really helpful piece of my practice, that patience of just, okay, it will settle. But at a certain point, I realized that I was thinking of those first 15, 20 minutes that it took me to settle as not really being part of my meditation. And so I just kind of sat down and it was just like, okay, I'll think about whatever I want, an occasional breath. And I started really taking it for granted. And just assuming that that was just kind of, you know, this part of my mind wasn't even worth paying attention to. It was so, so irrelevant. And as I started learning more of the subtleties of practice, I began to really understand that my thinking, this thinking, messy mind is what's here right now. And that that first 15, 20 minutes of lots of messiness and chaotic thinking and busy and restless was really worthwhile to pay attention to. That it was a very rich part of my practice. And I found that no matter how restless and agitated my mind was in that time, that by becoming mindfully aware of it, I could, there would be a little bit of space around it. There was the agitation and there was a little bit of sweet space. And, you know, and I recognized that that agitation, it was unpleasant, you know, and so I was trying to avoid it. I didn't want to feel that agitation of, you know, really not liking the how my mind felt at those times. So I just started folding all of that into my practice so that my practice is just as rich, whether my mind is busy or my mind is still. It's still just as close and intimate as regardless of the state of the mind. You know, the practice teaches us to show up for any mind state, whether we like it or judge it as not interesting. So I wanted to talk about three related mental states that arise commonly in meditation. And because they're kind of related because we tend to not find them all that compelling to pay attention to. And they're impatience, boredom and complacency. And all of those are kind of these kind of subtle states that we tend to like to, you know, if you've got a strong emotion, meditation, that's really juicy. That's really interesting. Oh, a fantasy. Oh, yeah, you know, it's very strong, very compelling. But these states of or even physical pain, we can get very interested in, you know, trying to fix it, trying to try to, you know, there's a lot to grab on to a lot to to engage with. But boredom and patience complacency, they're all mental states that we tend to not like. We don't like them, but we don't hate them enough to pay attention to them. So so they tend to kind of go under the radar. You know, for instance, did any of you, you know, maybe not today, maybe on rare occasion are kind of waiting for the bell to ring? You know, I've been very few people who haven't had that experience at least once. When I was for a long time in practice, you know, I used to keep a clock in front of me, you know, and I'd also have a timer that would go off. So I didn't really need the clock. The timer did its job. But I would just open my son's peak, you know, and, you know, if there was 15 minutes, I'd like, oh, 15 more minutes, you know, and and, you know, the idea. The idea that there was 15 more minutes was unpleasant, more unpleasant than the moment itself. The idea of 50 more minutes. And, you know, so I'd get really involved in my impatient thoughts. I'd get very engaged, like, OK, so 50 more minutes, that's 150 breaths. You know, I negotiate my way through it, you know, totally involved, you know, much more interested, interesting at the moment. But then if it was like five minutes, you know, my whole heart would lift. It's like, oh, only five more minutes. Great. And suddenly I'd settle. My mind would settle and would actually enjoy my meditation and I could go longer, you know, because the idea of all this long time period of possible not not enjoying it, you know, was got in the way, you know. And so these are the games we play because we don't like that feeling of the impatient mind. It's just a slide unpleasantness. Right. Nothing's that terrible. Nothing's that awful. That time, it's just a slide low level unpleasantness. But I find it really interesting that the English word for patience comes from the Latin word pati, which means to suffer. And it means to suffer with, you know, the definition is delay, difficulty and annoyance. You know, so it's the ability to to suffer with, to feel the pain of delay. You know, have you felt, you know, waiting in traffic, you know, impatience arises, right? Waiting in line and patience arises, you know, that ability to be with that with patience, you know, with annoyance, with, you know, somebody who's just nonstop talking, you know, and, you know, they're annoying, annoying us, right. And, you know, the ability to be patient with that, the ability to be with difficult things. When when we're feeling impatient, what's really helpful is to realize that there's something in our experience we're resisting. We're actually resisting. There's actually aversion when we're feeling that impatience. I don't want something. And so the practice calls on us to turn towards it. How does impatience feel in the body? You know, maybe you feel, you know, maybe the body is tense, maybe the body is relaxed, maybe part of the body is tense, you know, shoulders are up the face, different parts. How's the belly when we're feeling impatient? Or how does the mind, what is impatient, the flavor of the mind? I don't know. Do you know what I mean by the flavor? You know, like, how do we know the difference between this is anger and this is fear? You know, this is love. You know, it's a flavor of the mind. And so what is the flavor of the impatient mind? How does that actually feel? You know, so we turn our attention to the actual felt experience of the moment, the actual felt experience of impatience. With patience, you know, we're practicing patience. You know, patience is considered one of the most really important qualities to develop and practice. In the Buddhist teachings, you know, many of you familiar with the 10 parmies, the 10 perfections, the qualities that we have to develop to wake up, you know, such as virtue, patience, loving kindness, you know, energy, wisdom, you know, all these wonderful qualities that we develop. But patience is a particularly interesting one because I think Gil is the one who told me this. He actually, you know, once we got digitized versions of the suttas, he counted how many times the word patience appeared in the Maja Manakaya compared to the other parmies. I guess he had a lot of time in his hands that day. But, you know, so it's like it's that commonly the Buddha, you know, said how essential patience is to wake up. Now, patience is only needed when there's something happening that we don't want. You know, when there's nothing, if we're not resisting anything, patience is no longer needed. It no longer takes effort. And so there's always something going on that we don't want to see, we don't want to know, we don't want it to be there, we're pushing something away. One kind of patience is patient perseverance. And that's, for instance, we can persevere. Let's say we're training for a marathon. I don't know if you've ever trained for something that you're really trying to get really good at, you know. And so every day you go out there, regardless of how you feel, regardless of how you feel. And you can do that with the attitude of gritting your teeth, you know, I'm going to go out there and I'm going to do this, and you can do it. Or you can do that with the relaxed attitude. You know, I'll show up every day, but you can be very relaxed. They both get to the goal. But the difference is an attitude of kindness, you know, and how happy we are, you know, how at ease we are. And with almost anything we do, bringing in kindness, the quality of kindness is what makes patience really possible. The real patience, persevering patience. It has to be with the softness, with the kindness. You know, and sometimes meditation is difficult. It is unpleasant, you know, and we can appreciate that this is hard sometimes. Sometimes it is hard. And when things are painful and hard, kindness is appropriate, you know. It's like we bring that into our space, you know, oh yeah, this is, I'm suffering here. This is hard. You know, my body is uncomfortable. I'm in pain. I just, I don't like doing this. You know, at this moment, this moment I don't like, you know, oh yeah, I'm suffering here. I can bring kindness and compassion to that moment. It's a couple of things, you know, sometimes when we're feeling that way it's hard to put our arms around it. We may have kind of an intellectual understanding of it. So you can help to just remember that the first part of working with this impatient state is to recognize it. Just recognize that it's there. That already gives us a little bit of objectivity. Oh, it's just impatience. It's only impatience. It's just something that comes and goes. You know, and then we turn to our bodies, you know, this is impatience in the body. And we start getting interested in what is it really like? What is it like to be impatient? Sometimes focusing on a bigger picture can be really helpful. Sometimes that directness doesn't quite work for us. And for instance, we'll be stuck in gridlock, for instance, and we can, instead of being all caught up in, oh my, how much longer and it's going to take forever and all those kind of thoughts, you know, oh, what a great opportunity to practice. You know, we sometimes go, oh, I only have half an hour here. I'm going to sneak it in. No, this is a great time to practice. You know, or if you feel tight, you know, you can bring loving kindness into your space. I know people, some people who make it a habit, whenever they're stuck, even at a red light, they just look around and do loving kindness towards the people they see in the other cars. You know, it's this very sweet thing to do. It makes it a kind of a joyous, a joyous thing to happen. You know, or you can just settle into just meditating, just watching the breath, open eyed, you know, just want to make sure I say that. I gave walking instructions once, you know, and at the end of the walking instructions, I sent people out to go for their walk. And one of the young men said, do we do this with our eyes closed? It didn't never occur to me. You know, and one of the things said to me is always a go to and I'm suffering is humor. Like Chad Cornfield used to say, I'll be the first meditator to die of impatience. And I would just think of that, you know, and it would just kind of, you know, break, break a little bit of my serious seriousness out. There's a cartoon, you know, it was in the New Yorker a long time ago. And, you know, you see this group of meditators and, you know, the teacher sitting in a podium just like this. And, you know, there's like a poster, you know, it says, journey to enlightenment, you know, and then they have a little thought bubble. One of the, I mean, voice bubble, one of the meditators whispers to another one, are we there yet? So a little bit of humor. So a kind of close relative of impatience is boredom. Boredom, if you haven't noticed, is a state none of us like. We don't like to be bored. And if we look at boredom a little bit more closely, we see that often what's happening is that the mind has very little stimulation going on. You know, if we're in pain, we're not bored. We may not like it, but we're definitely not bored. But in boredom, there's just very low stimulation. Now in daily life, in normal, in regular life, usually when we're bored, we either go to sleep or we go do something different. You know, we stimulate ourselves. And as we get calm, the mind begins to get calm. It stops stimulating itself so much with all this thinking, all that's going on. And we initially, the calmness, it's a little bit unfamiliar. It's not what we're used to during the day. And it can feel really boring. You know, is this it? I mean, you know, I've been meditating. Is this it? Just this, yeah, a little bit of calm, but hey, you know, this isn't fun, you know. And so, you know, so there's a little bit of something unpleasant, not enough, something going on in that state. And again, we can turn our attention right to the boredom. We can get interested in the boredom. What is boredom really like? What is it really like? You know, what is it like and what's the flavor of the mind that we don't like? What is that flavor? You know, I really notice what that feels like. What does it feel like in the body? Sometimes it's actually there's actually other things going on underneath, but it's not thinking about it and figuring it out. It's like really seeing what is this moment really like? What am I resisting? What don't I like? What am I pushing away? I read somewhere I don't know where they get these statistics, but 31 percent of Americans wonder if heaven will be boring. Now, what's interesting about it is that, you know, when we think of heaven, we think of everybody being good and everybody being nice, you know. And, you know, it says something that we think that everybody being good and everybody being nice is boring. You know, so we look all you have to do is look at our entertainment. And, you know, we're what sells the most are horror movies, war movies, violent thrillers, all these things that aren't good and nice, you know. And so even a lot of humor is about, you know, you think about slapstick, you know, people falling, you know, a lot of humor is put down humor, laughing at pain or laughing at other people's pain. You know, it's so there's something about all those things are very stimulating to the mind and the mind really likes being stimulated and boy, no devices really stimulate us. We prefer a lot of us prefer doom scrolling, looking at bad news after bad news after bad news for long periods of times over being bored or that terrible, horrible feeling of being bored. Let me look at how horrible the disasters in the world are. There's so much more stimulating than being bored. So it's really interesting, you know, to look at this at these aspects of mind. So we're used to, you know, either stimulating ourselves externally, you know, by the we can do it, as I mentioned, you know, in unskillful ways, watching things that are actually dark in our minds. Or we can stimulate ourselves externally with wholesome things, you know, watching a movie that that has a lot of depth, reading a biography that connects us with people, listening to wonderful music, having meeting with friends. There's lots of wonderful stimuli out in the world going out into nature, going hiking. There's a lot of wholesome things. It's not I'm not pointing at being wrong to stimulate the mind. You know, that's how we learn. That's how we grow. You know, it's really great for the cognitive mind to stimulate it in ways that are productive. But we also stimulate the mind internally. And how do we do that? You know, we can stimulate the mind internally with planning, you know, which can be really useful or it can be compulsively done in a minute during meditation in particular. Sometimes, especially in retreat, I find myself like planning when I was considered the teacher, when I met with them over and over and over again and just kind of rehearsing. I sort of ministated them and, you know, and totally missing out on my process, just planning, planning, planning. So we do stimulate ourselves internally and because we like stimulus. Sometimes just to avoid feeling boredom, we'd rather we'll stimulate ourselves with really thoughts that upset us even more because we'd rather have upsetting thoughts than be bored. One of the things that happens, you know, with giving something attention, when we become attentive of the mind, energy arises. When energy arises, kind of interest follows. And so we, by turning our attention to boredom, that we bring energy to it and we bring interest and or the quality of our beingness kind of increases in its energy and its aliveness. We start getting connected with ourselves just by giving attention, just an open attention to what's really going on in the moment. Knowing boredom, just knowing it, really being close to it transforms it into something interesting. And, you know, I want to say just one word about intimacy, you know, if you think about an intimate moment, you know, maybe, you know, a young child or a lover, you know, where you're maybe touching their face very gently, you're very close to them. You're very close to, you know, you're right there. You're very soft. There's no distance between the two of you. And this is the intimacy that we develop in meditation. It's a little bit of a love affair with the moment, you know, just being very close, very close to that breath, very intimate, very, very open to it. You know, and if you touch if if the if what you're touching is a child that starts to cry because they're sad, you don't lose that intimacy because they're sad. You don't lose their intimacy because they're laughing. You know, the intimacy is there because of your willingness to be close, your willingness to be connected that way. And in the same way, you know, we can be intimate with our experience, being very close to it, whether it's laughter, whether it's a wonderful sense of peace permeating or whether it's a really agitated mind, just like the agitated child. We can stay intimate. You know, in the 60s, Aldous Huxley wrote a novel. I don't know if anybody ever read it, read it called Island. You know, it was like a utopian novel. You know, I don't remember hardly any of it. You know, I was pretty young. But I remember it had birds that flew around and, you know, they'd go near humans and go pay attention, pay attention. And it's one of the things that that periodically shows up in my meditation when I'm distracted. You know, it's so, you know, many of you are familiar with MBSR mindfulness based stress reduction. It's a secular mindfulness meditation program that John Kabat-Zinn created. And when did he do that? In the early 80s, you know, for the medical community to make mindfulness available to people who were having, you know, major surgeries, cancer diagnoses, terminal, terminal illnesses, you know. And so it needed to be very, very secular, very specific. And they would they do it in like sessions of eight weekly trainings. And it encompassed, you know, sitting meditation similar to what we do here. But it also included a guided body scan that's done lying down, where it guides you through relaxing each part of your body, connecting with each part of your body. And it lasts about 45 minutes. It's a long, long guided scan. And at the time that it was just beginning to take off and gains a little bit of a renown in the medical world, the teachers at IMS, which is a retreat center in Massachusetts, they thought, well, you know, why we're you know, we should know about this. So why don't we do the training? And so we know how it is. And so we know what people are doing, you know. And so several of the teachers went to this class where they were the only people who didn't have either a terminal illness or something severe really going on in their lives. And, you know, they they did the sitting meditation, everything, you know, and then they went to do the guided the guided body scan and everybody in the room laid down and did this. And every one of the teachers fell asleep. None of the students, none of the other students. And, you know, in one of the teachers was, you know, after that, she was reflecting back about it. And she realized that what had happened in in her practice or, you know, after all the years of like lots of Duke, lots of suffering, her practice has gone to a point and her life for everything was pretty good. Everything was was pretty good. She'd sit and meditate was pretty pleasant. It was kind of nice. And she'd become really complacent. And and it's it's such a tricky, seductive little thing, you know, to just, oh, yeah, that's good enough. It's good enough. Not that, you know, we don't want to mistake it with a mind that says that's never good enough, you know, but but there's this quality of it, of where we stop. We stop really paying attention to what's going on. And a definition of complacency is self satisfaction, especially when accompanied by unawareness of actual dangers or deficiencies. So what does that mean in meditation? And it's not seeing the dangers of reinforcing certain habits of mind, which gets strengthened when we become complacent. We just strengthen the part of our minds that don't pay attention. The teachings guide us to allow our experience, to accept our experience, not to strive, not to push, not to to really be at ease with our experience. But again, that comes back to the issue of intimacy. When we allow, we accept, we allow and accept something by being close to it, by being intimate with it. You know, we allow, accept that my body hurts right now. Oh, yeah, my body's hurting. You know, we're close. I feel it. I'm not pushing it away. I'm right there with it. Allowing it. I see the reality of it. Complacency says, oh, yeah, it's hurting. I don't have to pay. I'm not going to pay attention to it. I'm not going to be near it. You know, it's a distancing ourselves from our experience. The practice points to a balance between tranquility and alertness. We're trying to, you know, we kind of go to a meeting of those two where the mind is really at peace, but really bright and alert, really curious. And the words that I like that have been like a guiding, guiding words for me in my practice is Srimadran Samadho. He calls that affectionate curiosity. It's the quality that we want to bring into those moments. That's what's missing in the complacency. Complacency doesn't have either the affection or the curiosity. It's just kind of nice or good enough. Like those first 15, 20 minutes of my sitting. Oh, yeah, that's good enough. Good enough. And some people, when they first start meditating, you know, they take to it right away and they like it right away and they have nice pleasant sits right away. That wasn't me. You know, for me, meditation was really hard earned. You know, the fact that I persevered was I just had such a strong intuition in, you know, in me. I had a certain level of trust that this was the way for me, even though mostly my first quite a fairly long period of time was not very pleasant for me. And so when I finally, finally start experiencing like this really nice periods of calm, you know, and they go into this nice, drifty, peaceful calm. They're so nice. So nice. And there was so little sharpness or alertness, but it was such a pleasant change from from my agitated state that I hung in there for a long time. And, you know, and it was very healing. You know, it was very healing for me to do that. And and it allowed me to feel enjoy being with myself, you know. But as my practice grew, then I saw that there was more, there was more and more engagement. You know, I don't want to make that wrong, you know, but then I would find my patterns, you know, like I would be like, especially in retreat. You know, if any of you have done retreat, we have a lot of ups and downs and retreats. And that's we have a lot of stuff can come up and sometimes really painful emotions would come up or really intense physical sensations would come up that weren't pleasant. You know, and and, you know, maybe I'd spend, you know, like spend a couple of sittings just crying or just feeling all sorts of painful feelings. And then it would be over and it'd be like, ah, and then I'd reward myself with a fantasy, you know, it's like, OK, that was good enough. I worked hard fantasy time, you know, and, you know, and I kind of had that pattern for a while where I'd get really complacent instead of like, really, OK, now let's stay really engaged with what's next. So it took a while for me to see that, to notice that. You know, and as I mentioned, I really want to stress that that as we meet complacency, when it arises, to really notice the difference between that and not good enough, you know, it's, you know, like the type A personality or the workaholic personality, you know, they get a lot done. You know, they accomplish a lot, but it's very tight, very tight, you know, and so really want to caution that attitude in how we work with our minds. We're more aiming for the quality of a musician, really enjoying playing the music, but really be really listening it too carefully, not doing it automatically. Really, you know, maybe they play that song a hundred times, but they still find something new in it or maybe the runner, you know, really engaged in the running and they might notice, oh, yeah, my shoulders are a little tense. Let me relax them a little bit. Or maybe the artist who's, you know, painting, you know, and, and, you know, they, they notice, oh, the sunset could you so a little more red over here. You make adjustments, but the adjustments are just part of the play, part of the play, part of the engagement. It's not that there was something wrong that we have to fix. It's just an adjustment. Oh, we see that. Okay. That's what we do. There's no fixing needed. We don't need to fix complacency. We don't need to fix some patients. We just need to get to know them. And once we get to know them, as we engage in them, they reveal themselves. They transform. One of the real benefits of turning towards the challenging, towards the difficult in this practice, this practice says, if it's hard, you turn towards it. You turn towards it. We turn towards the wonderful. We turn towards the difficult with the equal interest. We can bring the equal interest to it. And by doing so, by developing patients, we increase our capacity to be with the difficult. I like to say we become comfortable being uncomfortable. We can tolerate, be there for things that are very hard to tolerate and be there for. And that capacity works both ways. It increases our ability to feel joy, to feel all the really wholesome, happy, enjoyable things in life. It allows that connection too. So we increase that practice of really being here fully, full heartedly into the moment. You know, and I'll say the last thing I'll say, you know, sometimes the magic word for me in my mind is to relax. Just relax. Let go. And at other times, the magic word for me is like a very strong here now, you know, just here now show up, you know, and so different times we need like different little, this is my level of my pep talks to myself. Usually these little singular little, little words. I shortcut them, you know, that, you know, I might sit up straight or pay attention. You know, a little bird, you know, pay attention, you know. So, you know, keep folding in everything that happens in the practice belongs. It all belongs. You know, the deeper states of mind, you know, when you, we develop samadhi in meditation where the mind is really steady, we call it a unification of the mind, where the mind is united and it includes everything. And that's the thing about this practice. It does not exclude any part of who we are, any part of our experience, it all fits in there, it all belongs. So I'd like to end with a poem by Rosemary Watola Traumer. I don't know if you know her work. So in May, I planted a whole row of beans along the back fence of the garden, pushed each of the small white seeds one inch into the spring damp soil. I waited weeks, not one came up, not one. I planted them again, planted them in twos, two inches apart. I waited weeks, three came up. There were over a hundred seeds. I'm trying to tell you that sometimes that we wish for doesn't happen, that we do everything by the rules, that we have known success before, that we long for our plans to take for our plans to take root, to bloom, to fruit. Then all through the rows emerged this spring, dozens of volunteer cosmos. This morning, a generous riot of pink, dark pink and white, fluttering in the spaces where I had envisioned only the green of beans. So thank you.
