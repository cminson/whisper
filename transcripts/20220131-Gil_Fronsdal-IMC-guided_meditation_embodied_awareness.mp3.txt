 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome to beginning of our week. Week of meditation. Discussion of the Buddha's teachings on the four foundations for mindfulness, for awareness. And I want to begin with a little story. There was once a novice who entered the monastery and was being introduced to the teachings of mindfulness, Satipatthana. And asked the question of the abbess. When should we be mindful? Maybe the novice hadn't really heard about mindfulness before and seems like a reasonable question. When should one be mindful? And the abbess replied, When it is better than the alternative. When it is better than the alternative. And I think that certainly in my experience, as I've followed this path of mindfulness for now several decades, that it becomes clearer and clearer that mindfulness somehow is the best alternative, is the best option. And so rather than mindfulness being rather than struggling, wondering where I should be and what seems important, to have mindfulness in the middle of our experience, whatever we're doing, is really a delight. It's really a wonderful thing. Because it's mindfulness when it becomes comes to its simplest potential, simplest form. It's also its most profound form. It's a clarity and a freedom of awareness that in and of itself is not diminished, not being hurt, not being undermined or deflated. That's not being eclipsed. That's not being coming under the influence of some of the challenging states of mind that we might have. And all too easily, when mindfulness is not present, when this kind of clear awareness is not present, the mind can easily get under the influence of stress, of tension, of one form or another. So what is it about awareness, being aware, the practice of awareness, practice of mindfulness, that makes it one of the best alternatives for what to do at any given moment? And now here we are to meditate, to practice mindfulness. So gently closing your eyes and perhaps, without trying to meditate, see if you can have a very simple awareness of your body. Maybe exploring your body, re-familiarizing yourself with your body as if the two of you haven't connected for a while. And without the idea of meditating on the breathing, familiarize yourself with your breathing. And without the idea of meditating on the breathing, familiarize yourself with your breathing. And then, familiarize yourself with the body's experience of breathing, the sensations in your body that come into play as you breathe. And when there is awareness, the awareness of the breathing, and when there is awareness, especially awareness that almost arises together or out of the body, the breathing can feel like the experience, the sensations of breathing can feel almost as if they are infused with awareness itself. At the minimum, the awareness is the awareness of the breathing. At the minimum, the awareness that has to be present to feel sensations. And perhaps as if you're filling, you're breathing your body with awareness. Gently take some deeper breaths and longer exhales. Gently relax your body as you exhale. Letting your breathing return to normal. And continue a few more rounds of breathing to relax on the exhale as you relax some of the muscles of your body. Perhaps it's a relaxation into more awareness. In that part of your body. And then letting go of relaxation in favor of a simple awareness of breathing in and breathing out. The simpler that awareness is, the more profound it is. Letting awareness grow in the breathing with the breathing. And if you wander off away into the mind, thoughts, consider whether mindfulness, coming back to mindfulness, might be the better alternative than what you're doing.

Becoming more sensitive to your embodied existence. It is with your body that you will move and walk and stand. Move your arms to eat. Whatever movements you make with your body. Imagine that you'll do that with an embodied awareness. So you're living in your body, aware through your body of the activities of your day. And that those activities might also be the means for conveying care and kindness for yourself and for others. If you're alone, your actions of your body can be done attentive to how they care for yourself. When with others, you can be attentive to how in some way or other they convey your care and kindness for others. On this day, may we explore how our activities, what we actually do in our actions, might be done with a greater dedication to kindness, goodwill, love, appreciation of self, of others, and this whole world that we make direct contact with with our bodies. On this day, may we have Midas's touch that everything we touch, we touch with kindness. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be healthy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free.
