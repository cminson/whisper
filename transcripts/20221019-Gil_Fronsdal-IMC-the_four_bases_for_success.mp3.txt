 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So earlier I talked briefly about desire and the importance of it in practice, and I wanted to continue because this teaching on desire is part of a fourfold teaching that the tradition puts a lot of importance on because it's sometimes what the Buddha taught has been summarized under a list of lists called the 37 Wings of Awakening. And there's something like seven or eight lists that are within that, but they're all practice lists. The eightfold path, the five faculties, the seven factors of awakening, different things. But one of them is called the Four Bases for Success. That's one of the ways of translating it. So these four bases, these four foundations for success, how to succeed in things, is a wonderful teaching that can be supportive for accomplishing what you need to do in life. Sometimes if we don't have these four things, it's hard to succeed in what we set ourselves up to do. And so they're considered very important for practice. They're part of this list of 37 Wings of Awakening. So the first one is desire, and is to have a focus on desire that supports the whole engaged way of practicing, being engaged in our practice, supported by desire. And as I said earlier, sometimes desires are usually treated as something unfortunate or worse in Buddhism. You're not supposed to have desire. But there are certain kinds of desires which are problematic, the ones that involve compulsion, the ones that involve a kind of craving or thirst or clinging. But there are clinging free forms of desire. And to be clear, oh, this is what I want, then things can organize around that. We can follow up with that. We can put ourselves behind that. If we don't have any desires, then we just kind of bumble around. And everything is okay, and I'll just kind of bumble around, and somehow things will work out okay. But to have a desire doesn't have to be with attachment, but it does become an organizing principle. And when people do this practice, or any kind of spirituality, sometimes to really realize, oh, this is important for me. I have this desire to be part of this practice, to do this practice. I have a desire to be part of the spiritual tradition, for example. And so that desire organizes, okay, then what does that mean? What do I do now because of that? Oh, it means X, Y, and Z. It means that I sit and meditate every day, or I come to IMC. Things can then now fall into place because we have clarity about what our priorities are. So there's a place for desire, and to be clear about what is it we want, what do I really want, what do I really, really want, is one of the really great questions. What is my deepest desire? What's my deepest wish? My deepest intention? And to reflect on that, you can go down through layers and layers. Sometimes you figure out the first one that comes as an answer, when you keep looking. Really, what's below that? What's below that? Or something. An interesting way of reflecting on this is to say, I think I have this really big desire for whatever. And now if I succeeded in that desire, what would my desire be then? So, for example, my desire is to meditate. What if you succeeded to meditating regularly so that you're fulfilling that desire? Now what's the deepest desire? Oh, now the desire is to meditate honestly. I just want to be really honest when I meditate. And then if you discover how to do that, then what's your desire? So you find you go deeper and deeper to something. So this whole reflection about desires and having desire and being clear about it, there's a lot of things this world wants you to do. There's a lot of billboards and advertisements that want to tell you what you should desire. There's no shortage of people who are paid a lot of money to get you desire in a certain way. For you to kind of be clear about what you want is a very helpful thing in a wise life. The second of these four bases is for success. It's one thing to wish for something, it's another thing to act on it. So the second one is act on it. Engage in the process of following up on it. And the word that is used for this act on it, the Pali word is veria. And veria can also mean courage, a courageous effort. And sometimes what's needed is kind of a certain degree of courage, some degree of, yes, I'm going to do this. I have this desire, this wish, I've looked at it, it's a healthy wish, it's an appropriate wish, it's my heart's wish, and now it's going to go against everything I ever learned from my family or whatever, but I'm going to do this and it takes some courage. But you have to act on the wish, to have a wish and say, well, it's not going to work, so I'm not going to even try. Well, then it's true it doesn't work. It'll prove itself, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. But once you act and engage, it's a new world we enter into. And who knows, things will happen that you couldn't have predicted, that will support you and find your way around that desire. The third basis of success is be reflective. Think about what you're doing. Don't just do things because you have the desire. It could be done selfishly. Don't just do things because you have a desire because it feels good or you have intuition. Don't just engage, act on it, and some are being barrel ahead. Be reflective. Live a contemplative life, reflective life. Think about the desire, think about the actions, the choices you make, how to live it best, to think about the context for having this desire and how does this desire fit the context and is it appropriate? Or are there different ways of expressing the desire, different ways of following up on the desire depending on the time of day and the weather or the context you're in and the people you're with? So this idea of desire, I'll go a little further, and then the fourth one is review, investigate, inquire about how it's going with it. In other words, there's an action-reflection cycle. You act and then you reflect on the consequences of your actions. What happened? What do you learn? I have a desire, I acted on it, and now that I've acted on it, what were the consequences of acting on it? What can I learn from that? Because sometimes we act in the wrong way. We made a mistake, oh, that didn't work, and we need to see that. Sometimes we see that, oh, this did work or this worked partially and this worked for what I wanted to do in the world, but actually I exhausted myself in the process. It wasn't good for me the way I did it. Maybe I can find another way of doing it. So the idea of learning from experience is the fourth basis of success. Action-reflection is one way people call about it. You do act and then you reflect on it. You investigate the impact, the consequences, and then you can make cross-corrections and change what you're doing and all this. Some of these things are not something that practitioners often understand. In fact, it's almost like we understand from the teachings that these are things you're not supposed to do. You're not supposed to have desire. You're not supposed to have courageous efforts. Just cool, chill, relax, don't try too hard. And you don't think. Meditation is not about thinking, we're told, don't think. And there's some truth to that. We have to learn how not to be caught in the group of thinking and meditating, but we're supposed to think. We're thinking beings or reflective beings, and so there's a time and place for thinking about things in deep ways. And then this reflection part, some of it has to do with reviewing what happened, and that's looking back in the past, even if it's two minutes ago. And some people say, well, all I'm supposed to do is be present, be mindful and present, right? And the past and future, I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not allowed to reflect. That's true when we practice in some contexts. If you're practicing meditating, maybe that's true. If you're doing walking, maybe that's true. If you're on retreat, maybe it has some truth to it. But we're more than that. We're allowed to think. And thinking is actually a very important part. Without thinking well about things, we get in trouble. And then, so reviewing, thinking, all these things are things that maybe the way this instructions are often given are, seem to be things we're not allowed to do. But in fact, these four are part of the collection of practices that are on the path to awakening, the 37 wings of awakening. So desire, action, thinking, and reviewing or reflecting about what just happened. These are the basis of success. And there's a long tradition in Buddhism that, like in Thailand, these are understood to be useful for any endeavor you do in daily life. Cooking, working, it's a job, or whatever you're doing, to have these four. So to be clear about the desire, be clear that you have to act on it, be clear about thinking it out carefully, and be clear about doing the review of it so we can learn from it. Maybe we'll learn from our mistakes. So maybe this is an interesting thing for you to consider. And maybe there's a time and place where these four bases of success will support you in a nice way. So we're going to stop now.
