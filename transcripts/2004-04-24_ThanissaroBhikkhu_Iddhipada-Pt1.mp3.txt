I thought we'd start with a brief meditation.
My teacher once told me not to talk to anyone who hasn't meditated.
I'll get you all settled down first.
Close your eyes.
And start with thoughts of goodwill.
Wish for true happiness.
Just tell yourself, may I find true happiness?
You start with yourself because if you can't feel goodwill for yourself,
it's hard to feel goodwill for other people.
And think of where true happiness is found.
It has to come from within.
Things outside are always changing.
And if your happiness is based on things that change,
it's going to change into something other than happiness.
And of course, when you look inside, you see there's a lot changing in the mind as well.
So it's going to require some digging down.
That's why meditation is a practice, something you do again and again and again.
But the happiness doesn't wait till the end of the path.
You find that you develop good resources inside all along the way.
And they provide happiness not only for you, but it also spills out to other people as well.
When you have an inner sense of well-being,
you're less likely to inflict your greed, anger and delusion on others.
So the wish for true happiness, as I said, is not selfish.
It spreads out to others as well.
So do that.
First start dedicating thoughts of goodwill to other people around you.
First start with people who are close to your heart, your family, your very close friends.
May they find true happiness as well.
And then let those thoughts spread out in ever-widening circles.
People you know know well and like.
People you don't know so well.
People you're neutral about.
And people you don't like.
Remind yourself that if everyone in the world could find true happiness within,
the world would be a much better place to live in.
So don't let there be limitations on your goodwill.
And spread thoughts of goodwill to people you don't even know.
And not just people, living beings of all kinds.
East, West, North, South, above and below.
Out to infinity.
May we all find true happiness in our lives.
Now bring your thoughts back to the present moment.
What do you have here right now?
You've got the body sitting here breathing.
You've got the mind that's thinking and aware.
These are both your raw materials for digging down inside and the tools for digging.
So bring them all together.
Think about the breath and be alert to how the breath is going.
Know when it's coming in, know when it's going out.
And try to be sensitive to how comfortable it feels.
Notice which sensations in the body are the ones that tell you that now the breath is coming in,
now the breath is going out.
And watch them all throughout each in-breath, all throughout each out.
And if you notice that there's any sense of discomfort or tension or tightness
or squeezing the body, allow it to relax.
You may have a sense that the breath is too short or too long, you can adjust that as well.
You can experiment with deeper breathing, more shallow breathing, faster or slower, heavier or lighter.
There are all kinds of variations in the breath.
So explore to see what feels best for the body right now.
If you're feeling tired, you may want to breathe in a way that gives you more energy.
If you're feeling tense, you may want to breathe in a way that makes you feel more relaxed.
If you're feeling tired, you may want to breathe in a way that gives you more energy.
When you have a rhythm of breathing, it feels good, stick with it.
As long as it feels good, if it starts not feeling good, you can change again.
Try to keep on top of what your body needs in terms of breath energy, from breath to breath to breath. The needs may change.
The next step is to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in.
A good way of working in that direction is to go through the body section by section.
We don't have enough time at the moment to go through the whole body.
Let's work on a few of the sections.
Start around the navel.
Just locate that part of the body in your awareness and watch it for a while as you breathe in, watch it as you breathe out.
You feel any sense of tension or tightness or blockage in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
If you want, you can think of the breath energy coming in and out of the body right there.
Working through any sense of tension or tightness and dissolving it away, so that no tension builds up as you breathe in,
and you don't hold on to tension or tightness as you breathe out.
Then move your tension up to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Watch it for a while as you breathe in, breathe out, and allow any sense of blockage or tension or constriction to dissolve away.
Then move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your tension up to the middle of the chest and follow the same steps there.
Now move your tension up to the middle of the chest and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your tension up to the base of the throat.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.

Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now if you had more time or you were meditating on your own, you could continue the survey
of the body down the back, out the legs, starting again at the back of the neck and going down
the shoulders and out the arms to the tips of the fingers.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
You may find that your awareness has a tendency to shrink, so keep reminding yourself
with each breath, all body, all body.
And sorry for that, there's nothing else you have to do.
Just allow the breath to be comfortable and your awareness to be centered and broad.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.

Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
Now move your body to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there.
I apologize for the mix-up in the naming of the course and the naming of the course material.
The course translates itibata as basis of success and the material translates it as basis of power,
which shows you that Pali words have many translations.
Back in the late 70s and early 80s, we built a jetty at the monastery where I was staying in Thailand,
a jetty in one of the spired monuments.
And it was unusual in that you could go inside and there was a meditation room inside.
And in the course of doing the blasting for the rock at the top of the hill where it was built,
this very nice piece of rock came up, much longer than this, a nice rectangle.
And my teacher decided to have a Buddhist footprint carved in the top.
And then they had a sculpture made of a naga to hold the footprint and to protect it.
And on the side of the rock he had them place the word itibata, the four itibatas.
And in Thailand, everyone would know what that meant.
It's one of the more common teachings.
Dharma talks will often refer to these four bases of power, four bases of success,
which is very different from here.
When people ask this weekend, what are you going to teach this weekend?
And I said the itibata, isn't it?
Look, what's this?
It's not one of the more popular teachings here in the West
and I thought it would be good for us to go over them today.
And also to reflect a little bit on why they're not popular.
The first reason is that the word iti, i-d-d-h-i,
which was translated either as success or as power,
can be translated as actually the name of psychic powers that can be gained through meditation.
And a lot of us in the West have a very ambivalent attitude towards the psychic powers
that can come from meditation.
On the one hand, we're told that you better stay away from them because they're pretty dangerous.
And on the other hand, they sound kind of cool.
And it's a very tempting.
I know someone who's an editor of a Buddhist magazine who said one time,
if you actually believed that these things were possible,
he would drop his job as an editor and go and meditate in the cave.
The only thing that kept him going was that he didn't believe that it could actually happen.
Another reason is if you look at the actual list,
and the shorthand list has four elements.
There's desire, if, effort, or persistence,
intentness, and discrimination using the powers of discrimination in your mind.
Now, most meditation instructions you get will tell you that three of those four things
are things you should try to avoid.
Try to avoid desire, try to avoid efforting, as they say,
and then try to avoid the discriminating mind.
And here the Buddha is basing one of his sets of teachings,
which he said in one place is equivalent to the eight-fold path.
He places these elements as essential to the path of practice.
So I think it's important to reflect on the discrepancy here, why that happens.
The concept of power, the concept of success also has the implication that there is a goal to attain.
And again, we're often told that you have to avoid a sort of goal-based approach to the meditation.
And a lot of that, I think, has to do with the problem simply of how you organize meditation retreats
so people don't go crazy on the retreat.
I'm serious.
You get people in there for a set period of time, say for a week.
And given the way Americans are, they will tend to compare,
okay, I've given up this week, I could have gone to the Caribbean, I could have gone someplace else.
I want to have something to show for my time.
I at least should get stream entry by Tuesday.
And so what you do is you create a kind of pressure cooker environment,
especially when people can't look at each other, can't smile, can't communicate.
And so there were their own impersonal pressure cookers.
And in order to release a lot of the pressure,
one of the teachings that's useful in a retreat is for the teacher to say,
okay, don't worry about the goals, don't worry about attaining.
Just learn to be with the present moment.
And you get through the retreat okay.
Really.
And so they don't have people flipping out on them, you know.
Which is fine for a retreat-based practice.
But if you're thinking of a practice that's based on your entire life,
that you're going to give your life to Dharma practice, you need to have goals.
You need to learn how to approach them in an intelligent way, in a mature way.
A weekend retreat cannot teach you how to have a mature attitude towards goals.
But if you're thinking of a lifelong practice, this should be an important part of the practice,
is how you relate to goals.
There really is such a thing as awakening.
There really are, the possibility of overcoming defilement is a real possibility.
But it's a large job.
So you have to learn how to relate to large jobs, relate to long-term,
a long-term practice in a way that doesn't get you discouraged.
So this theory bottom may be an awkward teaching to have on a retreat,
but it's an important teaching to have in day-to-day practice.
Because as many teachers in Asia will tell you,
that these four qualities of desire, persistence, or effort,
intentness, and using your powers of discrimination,
are useful not only for dealing with the goals of meditation,
but also any kind of goal, any kind of goal that you set for yourself.
When it's translated as basis of success, a typical teaching in Thailand will be,
if you want to complete your education, these are four good qualities to have in mind.
If you want to complete any task, these are four good qualities.
In fact, the word in Thai for gaining a diploma is to succeed in your education.
Some of that goes inside.
And so the idea that the body would apply to any student going through an education
is a common idea over there.
So that's one thing we should think about as we contemplate
why the itty-bottice have never been emphasized in the West.
Second, I think, has to do with an attitude towards what the meditation is all about.
We'll be going over the idea today that one of the purest or one of the most deep forms of pleasure
is when you can have reality fit with your desires.
And there are two extreme ways of approaching that issue.
And many times we tend to fall into either of the extremes.
Which I could call the Barney of the Dinosaur extreme,
is that you decide just through the force of your will, the force of wishing, you want things to change.
Many people like to approach life with the attitude that if they will something strong enough,
if they're persistent enough in their willing, that reality is plastic enough that it will change in line with their will.
And as I said, you can associate this from anything from Barney of the Dinosaur to Adolf Hitler.
It's that one extreme on the spectrum.
The other extreme is that you have to tame your desires so that they fit in with things as they already are.
In other words, abnegate your desires and you will find in their abnegation
that what little desire you have left fits in with reality and everything is perfectly fine.
This type of thinking, you can trace back to, part of it goes back to the period of the Romantics.
The idea being that by taming your will and overcoming your sense of your separate self,
which is often equated with the will, if you can overcome your will,
then you can get in touch with a larger reality which is a friendly reality
and having a sense of oneness is something that is the goal of the practice.
The Romantics themselves were divided on exactly what was involved,
but one school of thought was that religious practice is a return to your innate nature.
What you really are, what you were before, you were conditioned by society.
The meditation practice would be a process of deconditioning your social conditioning.
Part of that would be the deconditioning of your will.
The element of will is what keeps you separate from things outside.
This underlying belief is something I think that accounts for the popularity, the idea of Buddha nature in the West.
In the course of practice we are getting back to our true nature,
which is a Buddha nature, which is the enlightened nature that we return to in the course of the practice.
Whatever Buddha nature meant in Asia, it has certainly picked up that notion, that Romantic notion,
that we are returning to a sort of a preconditioned state that is our true self or our true and motive being.
If you take that approach to the practice, then it is one in which you are undoing any kind of effort
and just allowing yourself to get back to your innate nature,
in which case the development of the basis of power would seem to be antithetical to the practice.
Now as always in Buddhism, where there are two extremes, you realize the Buddhist approach is to take the middle way.
And the middle way here is I found many parallels with the Buddhist approach to practice
to the psychology that psychologists discovered is involved in mastering a skill.
And the idea of skill is in a very central concept to Buddhism, in fact the very first reading.
You might want to open to that.
Points to this.
I'll give you a little context here. This particular passage is in a whole series of sutras
which discusses issues that the Buddha does not talk about.
When he is asking, is the world eternal or not eternal, he doesn't answer.
When he asks, is it infinite or finite, he doesn't answer.
Is the body the same thing as the life's force or is it separate things, he doesn't answer that.
After awakening, the death of the awakened person, does the awakened person still exist and not exist, both, neither?
He doesn't answer those questions.
And so as part of a whole series of questions that he doesn't answer, here's this sutra about one of his lay students,
Wajya Mahita. I'll read it to you for those of you who don't have the sheet.
Then Wajya Mahita went to the householder, went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were staying.
On arrival, he greeted him courteously. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesy, he sat to one side.
As he was sitting there, the wanderers said to him,
is it true householder that the contemplative Godama, that's the Buddha,
criticizes all asceticism that he categorically denounces and disparages all ascetics who live the rough life?
And Wajya replies, no, venerable service, the blessed one does not criticize all asceticism,
does not categorically denounce or disparage all ascetics who live the rough life.
He criticizes what should be criticized and praises what should be praised.
Criticizing what should be criticized, praising what should be praised, the blessed one is one who speaks making distinctions,
not one who speaks categorically on this matter.
When this was said, one of the wanderers said to him,
now wait a minute, householder, the contemplative Godama whom you praise is a nihilist one who doesn't declare anything.
And that whole series of sutras, you begin to get that impression with questions that he doesn't answer.
And this is Wajya's response.
I tell you, venerable service, that the blessed one righteously declares that this is skillful, he declares that this is unskillful.
Declaring that this is skillful and this is unskillful, he is one who has declared a teaching.
He is not a nihilist one who doesn't declare anything.
So here Wajya is taking as the central teaching of the Buddha, the distinction between what is skillful and unskillful.
The Pali word here is gusala, which is sometimes translated as wholesome.
And gusala, K-U-S-A-L-A, sometimes translated as wholesome.
And one of the difficulties in translating Pali is that you don't have native Pali speakers that you can go up and ask.
What does this word mean?
A lot of it, especially in the Buddhist teachings, is fairly abstract.
And so what you have to do is go through the canon and see either stories or parables or day-to-day incidents,
which give you a sense of how the word is used in normal context.
And in the case of gusala, the prime context in that sort is a story about a monk who was practicing too hard.
And it doesn't say so in the Pali canon, but it says it in the commentaries.
They say that he had been so delicately brought up that he had hair on the soles of his feet.
And the commentary also tells you that the word of this gets around.
Somebody has hair on the soles of their feet. It's not kept secret very long.
And the king wanted to see this. This was quite something. This was pretty rare.
And so the word comes out that the young man is invited to the king's palace.
So the parents talk to him. They say, now, before you go to the king's palace, the king wants to see the bottom of your feet.
Now, there are polite and impolite ways of showing him the bottom of your feet.
They say, don't just stick out your feet like this in front of you.
They say, sit in a full lotus position and the king can kind of glance at your lap
and not be too obvious about staring at your strange feet here.
And so the guy goes and he does as he's told. In the meantime, while he's there, he hears a little bit of the dharma
and decides that he wants to be a monk. And so he goes out to be a monk.
That's in the commentary. You know the commentaries. They like to have funny stories.
The story that's told in the canon is you've got this young monk who's very delicately brought up in his walking meditation.
He walks so much on his path that his feet start bleeding. His blood all over the path.
And he's beginning to get discouraged. He says, here I've been trying so hard. And I'm not getting awakening.
So the Buddha hears about this and sees what's happening, reads his mind.
And so he levitates from where he is and comes right down in front of the young man as the young man is thinking,
maybe I should just rope. And that would be very effective teaching.
You're sitting here thinking of disrobing. And your teacher comes and lands right in front of you.
And so the Buddha asks him, you know, when you were a layperson, he said, were you gusala at playing the lute?
Now he's not asking him, did you play wholesome songs on your lute?
He's saying, were you skilled at playing the lute? And the young man says, yes.
He says, do you remember that when you tighten the string on the lute and when they were too tight, what was it like?
He said, well, you couldn't play it. Sometimes the string would snap. And if it was too loose,
he said, well, in that case, then you couldn't play anything at all. The string wouldn't make a sound.
The string would have to be tuned just right. And then once you had your first string tuned just right,
you tuned the other strings of the lute to that first string. And that way you could play the lute properly
and the song would sound good. He said, in the same way, when you're practicing meditation,
you tune your string of your effort first to what you're capable of.
And then once you've tuned that, then you tune the other qualities that are needed in the practice to that basic level of tuning.
And then you get your practice will lead to the results that you want.
And as a result of this, the young man practiced his effort, was in tune, and as a result he became an Auraan.
The point here, related to here, is that the word gusla primarily means skillful.
And it's important to think about what this means. The idea that skills are possible or that skills are important
means several things. One, it means that there are patterns in life.
There's patterns of cause and effect that you can learn about in life.
If the world were totally chaotic, there'd be no purpose in spending time to master a skill
because what you had mastered wouldn't be necessarily useful further down the line.
It does, however, on the other hand, mean that even though there are patterns of cause and effect, they're not totally deterministic.
If things were deterministic, you wouldn't have to work at making a skill.
You'd either have it or you wouldn't.
But the fact that skills are possible and that skills can be mastered shows that life has patterns
and the patterns can be affected by the way you pay attention to what you're doing.
Now you think about what's involved in learning a skill.
We'll be going in more detail on this particular topic later on in the day.
By the way, let me stop just for a minute and give you sort of an overview of what the day is going to be like.
The first part of the day, we'll be going over the material in the reading passages,
talking about skillfulness, talking about issues of how the ideabodas or the faces of power relate to developing a skill.
Then the next section, which will probably come right after lunch and you're probably going to be sleepy,
I'll be telling you some stories about psychic powers just to keep you awake.
The third part is to go into some findings that psychologists have had about developing skills,
what exactly is needed in developing skills.
This is based not on a scientific document but on a New Yorker article that appeared a couple of years ago
where they had interviewed and studied various people who were skillful.
There was a surgeon named Charlie Wilson who used to be a brain surgeon at UCSF,
Wayne Gretzky, Yo-Yo Ma, Michael Jordan.
To see what qualities these people who had mastered skills, what qualities they all had in common.
It turns out that the qualities they had in common were the ideabodas, the four bases of success.
I think it's interesting to reflect on what psychologists have discovered in this kind of study
and how they throw some extra light on the ideabodas and the role they play in the practice.
And then finally we'll go back into the issue of meditation specifically on how to apply the approach of skillfulness to the practice of meditation.
So that's the way the day is going to be marked down.
The issue of skillfulness, in addition to implying that there's a cause and effect pattern to life,
also implies that there are some causes that are preferable to others, some effects that are preferable to others.
If it didn't matter what you were doing, if it didn't matter whether you could play the piano well or play the piano poorly,
no one would bother to put all that effort into playing it well.
But the fact that a well-played piano sounds a lot better than a poorly played one
implies that there are some results that are preferable to others.
And in fact it's this combination that there's desirable and undesirable results
and then there's a pattern of cause and effect.
This provides the framework for the Four Noble Truths, which as we all know is kind of the major structure of the Buddhist teachings.
You have undesirable effect, which is suffering.
You have unskillful cause, which causes that effect, which is craving and ignorance.
You have the desirable effect, which is the end of suffering, and then the skillful causes, which is the eightfold path.
That takes you there.
So implicit in the teachings of the Four Noble Truths is this distinction between skillful and unskillful.
It may sound like a dualistic teaching, but if you're going in for brain surgery, you want to have a dualistic surgeon.
So it's not dualism for the sake of dualism, it's just a very realistic approach to life.
Here is, happiness is better than suffering.
And long-term happiness is better than short-term happiness, which is what the Buddha says.
That understanding there is the basis for all discernment and wisdom.
Look at passage two here.
So this is the way leading to discernment.
Another way to translate discernment would be wisdom.
When visiting a priest or contemplative to ask, what is skillful venerable, sir?
What is unskillful?
What is blameworthy?
What is blameless?
What should be cultivated?
What should not be cultivated?
What when I do it? And this is the big question right here.
What when I do it will be for my long-term harm and suffering?
Or what when I do it will be for my long-term welfare and happiness?
Those last two questions have some important implications.
One is you realize that your happiness or suffering depend on your actions.
Again, things are not totally determined by outside factors.
What you do has an important impact.
Secondly, the kind of happiness you want is something that is long-term.
Something that is not going to change on you.
Ideally, long-term could even be better if it were totally timeless.
In fact, that is what the Buddhist discoveries on it in the night of his awakening
was that there is a welfare and happiness which is totally independent of time,
which is what we are working towards.
But the way to get there is to work on being more and more sensitive
to what you do that creates long-term happiness.
This is what the Eightfold Path is all about.
Are there any questions on what we have covered so far?
Yes?
The first one is desire.
This is just a short-hand definition because there is actually a long formula
which we will be going over in the material.
But for just short-hand purposes, desire is the word chanda, C-H-A-N-D-A.
The second one, the Pali word is ridia, V-I-R-I-Y-A,
which can be translated as persistence, effort or energy.
The third one is jitta, C-I-T-T-A.
Of the four, it is the most difficult to translate
because normally the word jitta means mind,
but it has other meanings as well.
In this case, it means intentness.
It can also mean will, acts of will.
The fourth one, translated as discrimination or analysis, is wimang sa, B-I-A, B-I-M-A-M-S-A.
The second M has a dot over it, which is translated as an N-G, wimang sa.
So those briefly are the four bases for power, but we'll go into the formula a bit further on.
V-I-M-A-M-S-A, and the second M has a dot over the top.
Ridia, V-I-R-I-Y-A.
V-I-M-A-M-S-A.
As I said, there's a dot over the second M, so it's pronounced like an N-G.
You might want to keep those four in mind
and think about how they would apply to any skill that you have developed
or any task you set yourself.
It's pretty simple.
Learning how to cook, one, you want to eat.
So that's desire right there.
Two, you want to eat nice.
So you're going to work a little bit harder than normal on it.
So you make an effort, you go out and you get the food
and you look at the recipe.
And the third one is you pay careful attention to what you're doing
so you don't burn the food while you're fixing it.
You don't go against the recipe.
And then when you're done, you taste it
and you use your V-M-A-M-S-A to decide whether you like it or not.
If you want to be a good cook, then you would take that knowledge
and you apply it the next time.
You might decide either that the recipe was not a good recipe,
so you want to find a better one,
or that you screwed up somehow,
or that you basically like the recipe,
but you have an idea of how you can improve it.
In that much case, it sort of goes through the cycle again.
You use your powers of discrimination
and you've begun to improvise.
So ultimately you become your own cook
and then you can throw away the cookbook
and work on your improvisation.
And one of the assumptions of wanting to develop a skill,
you've probably heard the concept that all things are possible
for a beginner's mind,
all these things are possible in the expert's mind.
The process of developing a school,
half believes that and half doesn't.
It recognizes the fact that there is a room for improvisation,
but there's also a word to be said for experience.
Learning from your past mistakes,
learning from your past successes,
and it's learning to combine those two,
that you really develop a skill and it becomes your own.
So that's a little bit of a preview.
Any other questions before we go on to the next?
Yes.
So you're making a distinction
between different kinds of patterns,
maybe the unskillful is based on the separate,
or some improvement, improvements to the emotions
and that is skillful,
but a great deal of long-term happiness
is that's where it's the other way around.
It can be anything from just causing yourself out and out suffering
to putting a lot of energy into getting a very short-term happiness
that will turn on you and you're going to regret later.
This is what wisdom comes down to,
realizing that there are gradations in your happiness
and some forms of happiness are more worth pursuing than others.
Remember when I first brought up this topic in a study group
I had done and I didn't mean to dump on Southern California
because they feed me,
but someone objected and said,
who has the right to tell me that my pursuit of happiness is wrong?
I like my happiness.
Nobody has any right to tell me any different
and the idea of different strokes for different folks
would be okay if the way you perceive happiness
or where you pursue happiness didn't have consequences.
Some forms of pursuit of happiness
create a lot of problems down the road.
Others create no problems.
So if it were simply a question of whether you like vanilla or chocolate,
that's not an issue.
But if it's an issue, does your happiness require that you bomb a city
or does that happen?
Then you've got a problem with your happiness.
Yes?
In short-term and long-term happiness, do you also call it conditional happiness?
With short-term and long-term, they're actually both conditioned.
The process of Buddha's path is to learn how to use the process of conditioning
so eventually you get to the unconditioned
and that's where it's all aimed ultimately.
In the beginning though, it's just learning how to see the difference
between conditional short-term and conditional long-term happiness.
Yes?
It sounds like vanilla or chocolate,
and there's nothing real controversial about that,
but something with a big fever that said,
well, if you look at the way...
Chocolate has grown in Africa, yeah.
I'm not sure you did stuff like that, sorry,
but I think it's a bizarre question.
Well, if you feel...
start thinking about the implications of your choice, yeah.
You might decide, well, I don't want to eat chocolate.
I'll go for it.
But then, how is vanilla raised?
Everything has sort of dirty little secrets.
This is the part of being interdependent.
I've never understood what people say,
that being feeling interconnected is a good thing.
Someone traced a...
I think it was a gap sweatshirt one time,
and it starts in cotton in Kazakhstan,
and then it gets woven in Iran,
and there's one of the accesses of evil right there,
and then it goes over to South Korea,
which is getting close to another access of evil,
before it's made into a sweatshirt,
and then it's shipped to Kentucky where wages are low,
and then finally gets to your gap store.
And so just about anything you buy has these implications.
So you might decide, in terms of chocolate,
that you like chocolate while you buy,
chocolate from the producers that treat the workers right,
as opposed to what's happening in West Africa.
But yeah, I mean, ultimately what you want,
and this is one of the reasons why the Buddha has monks reflect
on their requisites every day,
where required before we use the robe to think about
why we're using the robe.
Is it a proper motivation?
And if you...
And this applies not only to clothing,
but also to food, shelter, and medicine.
Think about that.
Why are you using these things?
Well, one, because you're born with a body
that has this big gaping hole.
Hunger needs of various kinds.
It needs to be protected from the hot and cold.
It needs to be filled with food.
It needs shelter.
From time to time we'll need medicine.
And so as we're born into this world,
we're not born with birthrights,
we're born with birth needs, or anything else.
And so our survival depends on, you know,
fulfilling those needs,
which either our parents do for us when we're young
or else we start taking over the choices as we grow up.
And when you start reflecting on where these things come from,
there's nothing that does not involve somebody's suffering.
And so in which case you'd say,
the obvious choice ultimately is,
what can I do to get out of this cycle?
And it turns out you can't just drop out.
You've got to learn how to use the processes of causality
to get to a non-conditioned happiness.
So you want to use them as wisely
and as minimizing the amount of suffering
you're causing for yourself and other people.
But realizing that causality always involves
suffering of some kind.
And the question is how you use your pursuit of happiness
working first for longer and longer term conditional happiness
and to find you get to a happiness that's unconditioned.
Okay, then you're free.
Then as the Buddha says that,
from that point on you live without debt.
You're totally outside.
I don't know if I mentioned in this group,
but several years back,
I made the point that one of the very first teachings
they give to young novice monks and nuns,
this goes way back from early centuries
in the Buddhist tradition,
there was a series of questions.
What is one? What is two? What is three?
What is four? Five and on up to ten.
And some of the answers are pretty obvious.
What is four? The Four Noble Truths.
What is five? The Five Condes.
What is six? The Sixth Sense Sphere.
What is seven? The Seven Factors Awakening.
Eight is the Eightfold Path.
The interesting question is what is one?
And the answer is all being subsist on food.
That's the initial teaching on causality
and the initial teaching on interdependence.
For one thing, it's easy for kids to comprehend.
That's their direct experience with conditionality.
You depend on food.
Secondly, the more you think about it,
our interdependent relationships are not totally pure.
They leave their mark.
There are some traditions that will compare causality
to light reflecting off of mirrors.
The old Huayin teaching of the mirror
surrounding the lamp in the Buddha image
and causality is just the light reflected off the mirrors.
The light reflected off mirrors
doesn't do any harm to the mirrors.
Except maybe on a molecular level,
which I don't know about.
But eating obviously harms one part of the equation.
And many times it's bad for both.
So it's important to think that in this quest for skillfulness,
the quest for long-term welfare and happiness
is a really serious issue.
What are you going to do so you're not causing a lot of suffering
for yourself and other people?
In fact, the Buddha said this quest for long-term welfare and happiness
ultimately will also bring you to compassion.
Because you think about your desire
or your dependable happiness.
Think about it. Everybody else in this room,
everybody else in the world,
desires dependable happiness.
And that can spark two responses.
One is a sense of empathy.
We're all in this together.
And then secondly, if you realize that if your welfare and happiness
depends on somebody else's suffering,
one, it's not fair.
Two, it's not going to last very long.
Because nobody's just going to sit around idly
and let you abuse them.
They're going to work against what your happiness is.
So as you reflect on long-term welfare and happiness,
it has to include that welfare and happiness
of the people around you.
So.
