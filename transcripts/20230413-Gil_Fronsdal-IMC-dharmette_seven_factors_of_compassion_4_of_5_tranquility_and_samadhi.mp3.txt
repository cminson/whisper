So hello and welcome to our fourth talk on the seven factors of compassion. And
today we'll talk about the tranquility factor of compassion and the samadhi
factor of compassion. So just to kind of review a little bit. A few weeks ago, about
three weeks ago, I suppose, two weeks ago, I gave a series of talks on kind of
the foundational elements for compassion. The things that ideally would be in
place so that compassion can come forth in a healthy and useful way. And so
learning how to be aware in a calm, non-reactive way, just to be aware. And to
be aware what's happening within us carefully and well so we can track
and monitor our response to compassion and how to be compassionate. So
just learning to be aware and then to be attuned. To attune ourselves to the
people with the compassion that we're being present for. To find the right
way to be in harmony with it. Before we act. Maybe even before we focus on
compassion or and then appreciation. To have some deep respect and
appreciation for oneself or others so that when we're compassionate it's not
pity. It's not kind of a feeling sorry for someone. But maybe there's something
there more important than compassion which is deep honoring and valuing of
others and oneself. And then there is an aspiration, aspiration that people not
suffer. That we don't have suffering. That we come to the end of it. That we
support the end of it. And then there's action. And when all those five things are
in place then compassion has a healthier foundation for being supportive and
actually nourishing for our lives. Rather than being debilitated by the
compassion because it's so painful and exhausting. It's actually enlivening and
valuable for everyone. And this week it's when we do have compassion to
continue practicing with the presence of compassion. Not just take it for
granted or not just take it as being something we have to now live with as
it is. But to begin appreciating some of the different elements that follow in
the wake of the compassion. If there's healthy compassion then as we live
compassionately there will be mindfulness. There will be a kind of a natural
easeful awareness if we're coming from that motivation of being present for
somebody or someone or ourselves with compassion. And we don't have to work on
that so much to be mindful. It just kind of comes along in the wake of the
compassion. But and that awareness that comes along is useful so that we can
really see better what's happening as we're compassionate. And see are there
ways that we're operating that are harmful or not harmful, harmful or
beneficial? Are we a little bit straining? Are we a little bit under the burden of
responsibility and contracted around that? Are we a little bit afraid? Are we
feel like we have to jump in? So how are we with it? And to see the
difference between a way of operating which is not so healthy or beneficial
and then one that is. So rather than being straining to learn how to be
present and engaged with the kind of ease or relaxation rather than
clinging to something, finding a place of non-clinging so the compassion can
flow more effectively. And as we make these distinctions and
seeing where the challenges are with the compassion and adjusting for it, that's
the effort factor of compassion. We do make some effort and follow a path,
make the choice to go in the direction of where it's more useful, where it's
more free, where it's more you know less clinging, less attachment, less
resistance, less burden. And so there's this effort factor of compassion that
comes along with the compassion that supports it. And then there's the
appreciation side, the joy side of compassion. There's something very there's
a kind of sweetness that comes from healthy compassion. And if we don't
feel that sweetness, we probably should go back and review and do these other
steps and maybe even go back to this, the Four A's, awareness, attunement,
appreciation, to really see what's going on here with us ourselves. And then
comes tranquility, calmness, that healthy compassion has a calmness to it, a
tranquility to it. I've sometimes responded with compassion to try to take
care of something in the world and that seemed to be taken care of right away.
And because I acted reactively, kind of agitated, I have to do something and
jumped right in. I ended up making a mistake. And once I thought there was a
little fire in the distance in the farm I was living on and without, I wasn't calm,
I got immediately activated. I didn't take the time to take a second look
before I called the fire department and they came and I don't know what it was
anymore now. It was so long ago, over 50 years ago or so, 50 years ago, that it
was some kind of, it wasn't a fire and if I had actually taken the
time to look, I would have seen that there was not a problem.
So this idea of being calm, I have enough calmness to see clearly. So the
calm factor of awakening and that is supported a lot by the ability to trust
easeful awareness, to trust an awareness that's not straining or not under the
burden of our needs or desires or fears. That's not easy to find, but it's part
of the gift of this practice as we do this practice is discovering this
easeful, calm awareness so that the compassion can exist with that calmness
as well. And then comes this fascinating, wonderful capacity of
compassion to support concentration, samadhi. So the samadhi factor of
compassion. And a lot of samadhi, samadhi is a unification, gathering
together. I like to think of it, of feeling so at home in our experience
that we just kind of settle into the, settle really deeply so that all of who
we are settles together and feels at home with itself. And so what that means
about samadhi is that it's not meant to override our dukkha, our challenges, or
override the way we're distracted, or override our suffering. Samadhi
should wait until we find a way to be present for what's challenging for us,
find our way through it with mindfulness, with compassion, with care, with
attention, so that we do find that even in the midst of challenging
experiences in life, we've found kind of an inner home, that we're home in our
heart, we're home in our inner well-being. And again, that's not an easy thing to
come to at all. It might take years for some people practicing to find that. But
that's when we begin. At that point, we can appreciate how compassion is an
ingredient for samadhi, for a part and parcel of this being collected and
settled and contented, and just really kind of gathered around so that the
focus of compassion, the focus of attention, can be an effective way just
here with what's needing to be done, just here, gathered together in the moment.
And so when we have this easeful, relaxed kind of way of being present, and
this be at-homeness in this world, even if the external world we're not at home in,
we're at home with ourselves. We feel like we belong to ourselves, we belong
here, we belong in this universe in some way, even though maybe even the people
around us don't feel that we belong. We carry our belonging with us, we carry
our subtleness with us. That's part of the gift of samadhi, especially if samadhi
is not held on to as some kind of, only some kind of deep state of concentration
in meditation, holding on and attached to it has to be really kind of something
special. There are deep states of meditation that happen, they're called
samadhis, but the samadhi in daily life and meeting the world is more
the the after-effect of being settled and calm. Whatever ability we have to
settle and calm and be centered and belong and feel cozy and at home here.
And if it is very deep states of concentration, it's kind of the after-
effect of that that teaches us how to feel at home or be at home to
ourselves. That after-effect is also a kind of, I think of it as samadhi and so
to allow for that reference point to be there. And then it's really, really a
fantastic thing. And then with that samadhi, without the kind of ability to
gather around and let the concentration just be and the attention really be
present for what needs our attention. And that's part of the sweetness that can
come from compassion. So an example I gave an earlier, a little girl who scraped
her knee in the playground, that we care for, we care, we try to be sensitive to
attune to her and care for the wound and in her the kindest, most
supportive way for her. And so there's an ease to that. We're not
alarmed because it's not a big danger she's in. We're present in a
kind, caring way. We almost become self-forgetting in caring for something
like that. And in that self-forgetting there's a deeper, if we're at home in
ourselves and collected here for ourselves, then that gathering of attention
to care for her knee or care for her comes along with our capacity to gather
in or unification of being focused, just focused and concentrated on the task at
hand that has a sweetness to it. It's so sweet to have this ability to be focused
in this kind of way. And so the samadhi factor of compassion. So we're going
through these and we have one more tomorrow, the equanimity factor. And what
I'm hoping that you learn from this is that not to take compassion as a fixed
thing, like you're either compassionate or not compassionate, and then you're
compassionate whatever way you're compassionate, and you don't want to
hear anything else. You know, this is my way of being compassionate or
something, or you never thought about it, and you're just compassionate the way
you are and think you're supposed to be that way. Not aware that compassion has
many flavors and many component parts, many aspects, many things interact with
compassion. And so to learn to be mindful of compassion and appreciating the
different factors of it, then we can start playing in the playground of
compassion. We can start kind of exploring it and adjusting it and finding
how the best of compassion can come forward. And so it's not just, you know,
the compassion just happens to arise, which might sometimes not be so healthy,
what we call compassion. But we find that which is most healthy for ourselves and
for others. So if you would like for today, maybe focus on tranquility and
calmness. If you have occasion for, have compassion for the suffering of others,
and the circumstances allows you to take some time with it, you don't have to
jump into action. So you can kind of do the experiment to kind of explore. How
can you feel the warm-hearted, tender compassion for somebody, or for
yourself, and let there be a tranquility as part of it? That maybe it floats on
tranquility or it's supported by tranquility, or it just, compassion is
tranquil itself. And you know, try not to feel or fall into the trap of the worry
that you're portraying compassion by focusing on having it be, or some other
person, by finding the tranquility for it. Actually it supports and helps grow
healthy compassion in a wonderful way. So thank you all very much and I look
forward to our time tomorrow.
