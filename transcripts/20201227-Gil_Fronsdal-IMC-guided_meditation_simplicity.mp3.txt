The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So warm greetings.
Happy, I'm happy to be here.
Be here with you all and share this time together.
And we'll start with our meditation.
And as introduction to meditation, one of the great teachings about this mindfulness meditation
is that it's meant to be simple.
If it's not simple, it's not vipassana, it's not mindfulness.
And there's many implications of this word, simplicity.
And one of them is simplicity of being.
In meditation, if we can, it's time to cease, for ceasefire.
This is not the time for any kind of relationship to oneself that's complicated by repulsion,
aversion, blame, anger, or the opposite, attraction to oneself in some kind of egotistical way
or praising oneself, glorifying oneself.
The simplicity of putting aside both diminishing ourselves or criticizing ourselves
or approving of ourselves.
The simplicity of being that doesn't need either one,
but almost a situation where we can forget about ourselves,
forget about our self-definition and proving ourselves or becoming something or being anything at all.
Just to be sitting here, just to breathe is enough.
Just to be alive is enough.
And by putting aside all this self-concern and attraction and repulsion to self,
that we can begin to forget the self and discover a freedom of simplicity,
the freedom of lightness and openness, maybe even a kind of spontaneity and ease
that can come when we're not carrying along the self-concern, self-preoccupation of any kind.
So the simplicity of being of just here.
So to take a meditation posture.
And the idea is that if you can, to assume a posture that itself embodies a degree of attention,
a degree of intent to attend to this present moment experience.
And for some people that means to sit up a little bit straighter
or to do something with your hands and arms that is a little bit more an expression of being present and being here.
Gently closing your eyes.
And perhaps you can begin by swinging your arms, flapping your elbows a little bit.
Just to loosen them, just to keep it loose in your arms.
Maybe adjusting how your hands lay on your thighs, on your legs.
So the hands feel at ease and relaxed.
Softening the belly so that all the muscles around the waist, the belly and around to the lower back,
can feel like they can release a little bit.
Relax.
And maybe even the tops of the thighs can be softened and relaxed.
Perhaps as sometimes when you soften the tops of the thighs, it releases something in the small of the back.
Some holding.
Also when the belly is soft and relaxed, when the diaphragm, when you inhale the diaphragm pushes down,
it pushes the belly forward and expands the belly, balloons it a little bit.
But it also ever so slightly gives a small massage at the small of the back, the curve in the lower part of your spine.
With a relaxed belly, things become looser all around your waist.
Relaxing around the chest and solar plexus, heart area.
Appreciating how the ribcage in the chest expands and lifts as you breathe in, comes back and settles as you breathe out.
And even if some of those feelings feel like work, breathing is a little hard.
Perhaps there's some part of that movement of the chest that can have a sense of ease to it.
A rhythm.
As you exhale to relax the shoulders.
Maybe ever so slightly kind of rotate or shake your upper torso to see if you can help your shoulders free a little bit more.
And then softening around the eyes, where the eyes closed.
Softening around the mouth, cheeks.
And softening a bit in the brain.
As if the brain is a muscle and you could feel any tension or holding there.
As you exhale, relax the brain.
Letting the mind become spacious and open.
Now bring the attention more fully to the experience of breathing.
Probably for most of your life, your body has breathed, you have breathed, unselfconsciously.
And just breathes itself.
And perhaps for these few minutes, it's enough just to be present breathing.
Nothing to prove, nothing to attain, nothing to become.
Nothing you need to be thinking about beyond the simplicity of what's happening now.
Here in this body, in this body breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
In whatever ways that you're wondering often thought and distracted.
Notice how that is and in a sense notice the complexity of that.
And hold that in contrast with the possibility of a simplicity of being.
Of being here and now in a simple, honest way.
A light way, lightness.
Whatever way you are concerned with me, myself and mine.
Allow that to be there.
There's a reference point to feel and to it, to recognize.
How it is to be here breathing in the simplicity of the moment.
Without any concern for me, myself and mine.
That just to be alive breathing is enough.
Staying with the rhythm of breathing.
Trusting.
It's enough just to be here devoted to breathing mindfully.
One inhale at a time.
And next exhale for that time.
Breathing.

Any way that you're caught up in your thoughts or self-concerns.
Recognize that honestly.
And then see if that can stand in contrast with the whole other way of being.
A simplicity of being that it's so good, so right to just be here in oneself.
That there's no need to involve with self-concern.
No repulsion, no attraction.
No criticism, nothing wrong and also nothing right.
In the sense that thinking about what's right.
Just a simplicity of being.
Content at ease.
Honestly being here in the middle of the simplicity of this moment.
Being mindful, present in this body.
Trusting oneself to the breathing in the simple way of just breathing.

Ways in which we think that we're special or ways that we think that we are awful to be free of such self-thoughts,
to give ourselves the generosity, the gift of allowing yourself minutes meditation to just be present without the swinging between repulsion and attraction,
diminishment and aggrandizement just being.
And it's a gift for others as well.
We become a safe person for others if they don't have to contend with how we diminish ourselves or aggrandize ourselves.
When we're not trying to compensate for feelings of being inadequate or wrong,
we're trying to assert the truth of ways that we feel we're better or special.
To be present without all the selfing, lightness of being, simplicity of being.
And we become someone who's safe for others.
Someone who's available, present, attentive to the circumstances of the moment.
And may it be that as we learn to this art of forgetting the self, that we gain the world.
We gain a greater connection, awareness and presence for the world as it is in the moment that we are.
And may the ease and simplicity of just being be a vehicle for us to care better for the world.
To care for the world with some sense of ease, without duty or requirement.
But to care for the people around us, the world around us as simply as we would be breathing in and breathing out.
And as we prepare for this new year, may we dedicate the value, the benefits, the merit
of the practice that we're doing, the meditation we do, to the welfare and happiness of all beings everywhere.
And may it be that this simplicity of freedom and the freedom of simplicity
provides us with lots of opportunities to support the welfare and happiness of others, to care for others as if we're caring for ourselves.
May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe and healthy.
May all beings everywhere be free.
