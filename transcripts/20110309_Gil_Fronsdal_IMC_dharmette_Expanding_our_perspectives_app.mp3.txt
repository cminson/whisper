Dharmette : Expanding  Our Perspective s

One interesting thing to think about is that in 
mindfulness practice, we’re often instructed  to be in the 
present moment , as if the present moment were  a 
simple  thing , whereas t his prese nt moment is amazingly 
complex. There’re  a lot of different things going on at 
the same time in the present moment. Anytime that a 
human being pays attention to t he present moment, 
they’re  actually choosing certain aspects of the present 
moment to notice , or certain aspects of the present 
moment get highlight ed and known .  
 
I think it’s probably impossible for one person to be 
aware of everything that’s going on in their field of vision 
or experience . There’s so much going on in the present 
moment.  For example, you sit down to meditate , and 
close your eyes. It’s a relatively simple thing for you to 
sit there and have your eyes closed. Not much is going 
on. Some people get bored  because n othing’s  
happening . But there’s a lot happening. T here’s the 
whole physical experience of being in a body that’s 
happe ning. Maybe you just had  lunch ; you’re digesting ; 
and you have the sensations of digestion. Perhaps 
there’s som e concern about your digestion. Did I eat the right thing ? Or how’s that going to sit with me? Or 
maybe there’s tension from the day in your body . And 
one thing  that is happening is that the tension becomes 
revealed  as you’re sitting . Even  if you don’t focus on 
your tension , some  of the tension begins to relax 
because you’re sitting still and quiet. There’s a releasing 
that goes on.  
 
Perhaps you cut your toe nail, or cut your little toe during 
the day , and it’s healing. Maybe you’re not interested  in 
your little toe . It’s healing just fine , so it never occurs to 
you to look at it , or pay attention to it. Or perhaps you’re 
obsessed  and really  vain about your little toe , and how 
the world sees it i s reall y important . You’re completely  
zeroed in on the fact that it got cut . That  little toe is the 
most important thing in the world , because of how it 
represents you. Or you don’t pay attention to your little 
toe at all , because who cares about it? But it’s still 
happening in the present moment.   
 
There’s a whole array of different sensations going on in 
your body , some of which  you wouldn’t  think twice 
about. You might be aware of the contact of your butt 
against your cu shion. But perhaps it never even 
registers at all that there’s contact of your knee against 
your mat. I’ve spent whole sittings where I’ve been 
aware of many things , but that particular contact point 
just didn’t come into the radar. But it’s there. Or I’ve  had 
situations where I’ve sat , and even though the cushions are pretty soft, if you sit on them non -stop for three  
hours , they feel like concrete. And then I’ve s at down , 
being cautious , and tuned in to the sensations of my 
knees against the soft mat  – “Oh, how does it feel?  How 
is it going to be? ” It becomes really interesting. At other 
times , I can go weeks, months , and years without ever 
being aware of that particular sensation. But those 
sensations are there, ready to be felt and recognized if 
I’m interest ed or directed to pay attention  to them . 
They’re  part of the present  moment.  
 
All those sensations have feeling  tones. They’re 
pleasant or unpleasant . Some  peopl e get really 
interested in: “Is this pleasant? Is this unpleasant?” So  
you can pay attention to the pleasure , or the lack of 
pleasure that’s there , and some  people get really tuned 
into that . Other people h ardly notice. They don’t  
experience the world through the filter of pleasure or 
displeasure, unless it’s really dramatic. All the subtle 
pleasures and displeasures in the body just go 
unnoticed because it’s not so important for them. They 
still get concent rated, peaceful and quiet. It’s just that 
they do it without the feeling tone coming into 
awareness.  
 
There’re  all kinds of perceptions going on while you’re 
sitting. Which  perceptions do you really register and 
take in? I could take in the fact that there  are traffic 
sounds outside. I’m capable of hearing that . But I’m also quite capable of not, and instead could sit here  being 
absorbed in my breath . It doesn’t really registe r in some 
conscious way that there  are traffic sounds, but the 
traffic sounds are happening. Or I could be obsessed 
about that  – “Why did we choose to buy a building on 
the corner of such a busy street?  I wonder if I could 
write to the city. Maybe we can turn this into a parking 
lot so no cars would be  driving by.  Let’s c hange this 
somehow. ” I could obsess about the sound , or I could 
just not even notice.  
 
There are all kinds of subtle  perceptions and thoughts 
that go on in the mind that are drifting through. Some of 
them just waft through , and we don’t pick them u p. 
Some of them get our attention. I’ve had a subtle 
thought just wafting through , and then thought about my 
high school girlfriend, and boom, everything gets solid 
and tight, and boy , that got my attention ! At other times , 
something just  comes , and I don’t even notice it, 
because it doesn’t have any charge to  it. It just goes 
right through, I’m staying with the breath  and think,  “Oh I 
think that was a thought , but I don’t know what it was.” I 
wasn’t interested. But there are these thoughts , and 
subtle layers of thoughts , that go on .  
 
There are attitudes  and choices we make. Because  
there’s so much going on in the present moment , 
there’s always basically some kind of choice of what we 
pay attention to.  Sometimes the choices are because we have been  given instructions in sitting to pay 
attention to our breath, so we choose that. But subtle 
decisions sometimes are made about what has priority. 
What  is important to pay attention to in our experience? 
It has to do with life experiences, things that happened 
just before, and our values, priorities, and sense of self. 
Often what we pay attention to is related to our  sense of 
self, safety, status , and well being. We tune into that part 
of the environment that reinforces ourselves or 
threatens it , and that becomes importan t. 
 
What we pay attention to i s not a simple, innocent thing. 
There’s so much in this field. What happens is that 
some minds get into ruts  and habits of focusing on 
certain things. I’ll give you all kinds of silly examples. I 
remember when I  was in Burma , I was sitting in silence 
for eight  months. In that kind of state, y ou get a little bit 
of what’s called “yogi mind .” It’s like having a mag nifying 
glass , and the things can seem so much more important 
than they really are . You  can obsess about things in a 
wonderful way if you have nothing else to do but sit 
silently for days on end. I remember having this teeny , 
pin-sized  thing on my shoulder  that I could see. “Wow 
that’s interesting. ” I got upset : “Oh I must have skin 
cancer.” I would look at it , and look at it.  A lot of things 
were going on in the present moment , but I chose a 
teeny , little dot to look at. At the monastery there was a 
dermatologist , so I went over to him and asked , “Can 
you please look at t his?” He said, “S ure, I’ll look .” He looked at what I was pointing at , and he thought I was 
crazy [ laughter] . I mean there was really nothing. It was 
a little dimple [ laughter] . But I got obsessed with that. 
 
So all of this is to say is that  with everything that’s  going 
on in the present moment , what you’re  paying attention 
to is probably not so random. There’re  probably some 
choices that you’re making , and those  choices of what 
you’re paying attention to might not be the best  – the 
ruts you follow , and the things yo u constantly go back to 
notice. “This is important. This is what I should pay 
attention to ” – but maybe is not really the important 
thing to  pay attention to. Or maybe it’s the perspective  
or the interpretation by which you see it. Maybe it’s an  
okay interpretation , but maybe there are other 
interpretations as well. There  are other ways of seeing 
the situation. There’s a present moment , and there’s 
how we see it , and there are many things going on in 
the present moment.  
 
There  are also many perspectives from which to see the 
present moment. When  we e ncounter another person, 
we can see the person as a threat, someone who can 
do something for us, someone who has had a hard day , 
or someone who has struggles in their life like everyone 
does . Or because of a certain hairstyle or manner of 
being , do we see this person as  vain and arrogant ? And 
so we’re going to focus on the fact that the person is 
arrogant. Or do we focus on the fact that this person is also struggling to make it through this life, and maybe 
has some arrogance , but that’s not what we’re going to 
focus on.  
 
What are we doing in this life of ours? What do we focus  
on? W hat are the choices? W hat are the 
interpretations ? I believe that Buddhism says  two thing s 
in this regard . It says it’s possible to relax, and do less 
and less of all that  – less and less choice , and just let 
things get simpler and simpler. Let things stand out and 
show themselves to you. But the other is that it’s very 
important and  possible to choose what you focus on , 
and to start becoming creative in reinterpreting , or 
looking , and fill ing out the picture , and saying, “Is there 
another perspective  or point of view here?”  
 
This is not  to deny one point of view , but to realize that 
there are maybe a dozen points of view , all of which 
may be  relevant  or valuable. There isn’t just one thing 
going on here. When you sit and meditate i t depends on 
what you look at . Are you looking at your digestion, the 
tension in your body, your feeling tones, or thoughts and 
beliefs ?  
 
With w hat perspective do you want to look at yourself 
right now?  When you’re looking at another person , what 
perspective  is there ? Are  there many perspectives  that 
you could  have ? Which perspectives are you locked 
into, and are you only seeing it that way? Or is it possible to shift perspe ctive, open it up and see multiple 
perspectives ? 
 
I think the more  perspectives and angles from which we 
can see any particular thing,  the more compassionate, 
caring and wise we can be . The  fewer perspectives  and 
interpretations  we have for seeing something , chances 
are we’re missing a fuller picture of what’s happening.  
 
So part o f practice is to be very simple, relaxed , and just 
be. Another part of practice is to start us ing our 
intelligence creatively , and asking , “What are the other 
perspectives that I can bring to this ? What other 
perspectives  are relevant in this situation? ” Expand  the 
intelligent, creative way in which we see any given 
situation.  
 
People’s whole experience of life and themselves  can 
change dramatically jus t from a change of perspective. 
“Oh, there’s another perspective.  I didn’t realize that.  
That’s how it  is.” For example, I’ve known people who 
have had a lot of physical pain , and as long as the 
perspective was  “my pain” and “my struggle ,” it was 
hard. It was reasonable , and they  were trying their best 
to struggle with it.  
 
But I’ve known some  people  with trem endous pain , who  
realized it wasn’t just them having it , but there were 
other people in the world having it  too. To see that perspec tive, and to  feel some sense of connection and 
compassion beyond themselves made a big difference.  
 
I’ve also known some people who have had a lot of 
struggles , and realized that the degree to which  they 
struggled was a gift to others. The degree to which  they 
could understand their pain was something they could 
bring  to and support other people who were going 
through some similar thing. They weren’t just doing it 
alone. They were doing it within a community. Their  
ability to deal with it was hopefully beneficial for others. 
To change  that perspective of being caught up in their 
own pain  shifted , and created a whole different way of 
being with it , and  which was meaningful.  
 
So someone tells you , “Be present ” as if t he present is a 
simple thing, y ou’ll know otherwise.
