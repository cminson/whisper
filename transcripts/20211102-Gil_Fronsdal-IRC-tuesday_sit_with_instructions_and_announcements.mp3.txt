 Good morning everyone and maybe a few of you who are now too subtle can lift up your hand that you hear me. Great, thank you. It's a little odd to be guessing that you hear me. So this morning I'm going to do a little guided meditation on getting centered in the body and then add to that mindfulness of breathing. For some people, mindfulness of breathing is a stabilizing practice. It's a steadying practice, a place to steady ourselves, stabilize ourselves. The continuity, the rhythm and the continuity of breathing that just goes on for you know on and on and on that rhythm. It's a kind of a nice default for some people to come back to, to stay with, to be massaged by, to ride the rhythm like you're riding the waves perhaps. And just kind of a way of cultivating continuity over time, just staying right there. Sometimes having the continuity of something like the rhythm of breathing or the rhythm of stepping as you do walking meditation can better highlight when the mind wanders off away from the present moment and becomes kind of a habit after a while to stay connected to the breathing and then you notice when you're away and to remind her to begin again, begin again. Now like this expression beginning again as opposed to bringing the mind back. We often use in meditation the mind wanders off and then we bring it back. The mind actually doesn't go anywhere. It's just doing a different activity and rather than bringing it back, which is kind of some people jerk their mind back or you know to bring it back in a way that's not so helpful, to simply begin again with the breathing can be more peaceful and more less agitating. Just allow the breathing to return. And then as I am very aware for some people, mindfulness of the body actually is more stabilizing or easier to connect to than the breathing. And if that's the case with you, maybe you remain at the primary object for meditation, the primary place of stability and embodiment is with the body. But sooner or later if you're with the body you'll also notice the breathing because the breathing is an intimate part of our embodied experience. So we begin this process of becoming embodied and I like to translate sati not as mindfulness but sometimes as bodyfulness. And so to kind of almost almost like you're entering the body begins by the posture you take. And even if you're not going to adjust your posture into a better posture, it's still nice to go through the motions of adjusting your posture just because it's a kind of beginning of being connected to your body. And sometimes I'll rock back and forth, sometimes even forward and backward or big circle, just to kind of help find a place of balance in the posture alignment but also just to start feeling my body more broadly, places that I normally wouldn't feel if I just sat still. And then coming to center, whatever that is in the posture you have. And if your eyes are still open, turn your gaze down towards the floor and maybe relax the focus so you're not looking at anything in particular. And if it's comfortable for you, you can close your eyes, letting the eyes be cool, relaxed. With the eyes closed in meditation, you don't have to use your eyes to be mindful, like looking at things. And as you are, to familiarize yourself with how it feels, how your body feels, how does the body experience itself? In some ways the body is always shifting and changing, so it's nice to check in with yourself. And how's the body now? What sensations are alive and happening? In general, familiarizing yourself with the body, maybe from the inside out. And then to take a few long, slow, deep breaths, maybe three quarters full, not so full you get winded or just leisurely deep breaths. And as you on the inhale, kind of like you're getting massaged from the inside, feel the expansion, the stretching of the torso, the belly. And as you exhale, relax the body. Let go and settle into your body. And then letting the breathing return to normal. In this inside meditation, we usually don't do any special kind of breathing, but allow breathing to just be as it is without any direction or from ourselves. And then familiarize yourself with the simplicity of your body breathing. This also shifts and changes from day to day, meditation to meditation. Where parts of your body are activated or come to awareness as you breathe. And as you exhale, relax some more. On the exhale, you can relax the muscles of your face. Around the eyes, the jaw. Your teeth or lips are pressed against each other. Maybe you can let them be a little bit further relaxed apart. And as you exhale, to relax the shoulders. If they don't relax, but you feel the tension in there, it's okay to just feel that on the exhale. Perhaps softening around the tension. And perhaps softening the belly. Having done this kind of preparation, familiarize yourself with your body again. From the inside out, the living animated experience of the body pulsing and vibrating with temperatures warm and coolness. The body in which maybe there's some stillness and some movement. If you notice that you're up in the control tower, watching the body or thinking about the body, is there some way to relax that tension or focus of the control tower? Let it become more gentle and soft and receptive. And settle into your body more fully. Letting the sensations of your body be received by the body. And now within the body as part of the body, becoming aware of your breathing. And awareness that as you inhale, is receptive. The body receives the experience, the sensations of inhale. Maybe in the belly, maybe in the chest, maybe then the tip of the nose as the air goes in and out. Maybe all of the above, whatever way is easy for you. Receive the inhale. And as you exhale, allow for the release, allow for the exhale. And there's a rhythm of breathing in and breathing out, receiving and allowing. Perhaps a thinking mind can get quieter so you can better feel that rhythm, changing sensations as you breathe in and breathe out. And occasionally you might feel a little pause at the end of the up-wrap. It might be just a micro moment. But if you can let go into that pause, it might be easier to just receive the beginning of the inhale. And as you're aware of your breathing, You might change slightly or more where in your body you experience your breathing. The place you are experiencing it feels any way uncomfortable. It's okay, but maybe it's a little bit better to be aware of the breathing. A place where it's a bit comfortable, even if it might be more subtle. If the mind wanders off in thought, recognize that it's happening without judgment, without being for or against it, just recognize. In matter of factly, begin again with your breathing. It doesn't matter so much how often the mind wanders off, it only matters how often you begin again. Gently, kindly, lovingly. You are near. You are near. You are near. You are near. I am near. This is your way. This is your way. you Is there some way of getting out of the control tower, out of your thoughts, and feeling more stability in your body, more of a steadiness with your breathing? Your body, your breathing are always in the present moment. Thinking can be focused on some other time and place. Maybe you can trust the present moment, trust your breathing, trust your body to find a place of stability, steadiness, being rooted here. You can be focused on some other time and place. You can be focused on some other time and place. You can be focused on some other time and place. You can be focused on some other time and place. You can be focused on some other time and place. You can be focused on some other time and place. As the meditation continues, see if you can kindly, gently stay present for the next three breaths, fully with just three breaths. Then do three breaths more. If it's helpful for you to keep it that simple, continuity for only three breaths at a time, you might follow that rhythm. If it's not helpful to do so, just come back to how you were doing it. The measure of which is best may have something to do with which way are you least likely to wonder off in thought. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place. If it's not helpful for you to think about, you might be focused on some other time and place.
