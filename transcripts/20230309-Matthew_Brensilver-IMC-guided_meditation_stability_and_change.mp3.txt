 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, good morning. Welcome. Yeah, Gil is feeling under the weather. He's okay, but was just feeling tired and a little feverish. And so he's resting and asked someone to step in. So here we are. Okay, so let's, yeah, let's sit together. Thank you. Thank you. Just letting all the thought and feeling come to rest here. Take its place amidst awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Letting gravity have you. The dependability of the Earth's support. And the breath. That soothes what's overactive and vitalizes what is flat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. My question to pay attention is to pay attention to change. Everything in motion, no such thing as things really. Nothing owned. Nothing momentarily rented. Perfect. But we cannot open to a Nietzsche, the changingness of all things. We cannot open to a Nietzsche from a place of fragmentation, Brit on this. So we establish a sense of refuge, the center line, kind of inner safety, stability that's unrocked by changing conditions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We find a kind of love that's flexible enough, malleable enough to absorb the body blows of being human. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ordinarily, we have our home base from which we gaze upon our life, gaze upon phenomena, as if the view were outside the flow of change. But this river has no banks. Whatever vantage point we take as ground is just more change that we're not noticing. So we start to join the river of change. River of life. In a sense, nothing can be protected. But nothing needs our protection, just in this radical openness. The mesh of our being is what my teacher says, so open that experience flows through. We literally practice this practice. Of course, bits of our experience congeals, become solid, needs our protection. And we melt back into this river, wide flowing, unobstructed.
