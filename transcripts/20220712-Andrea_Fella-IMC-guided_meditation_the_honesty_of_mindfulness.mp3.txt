 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Arriving with yourself in just a really simple way connecting with this body in this moment. Perhaps noticing if there's tension in the body and maybe if there can be a little bit of relaxation. Sometimes the tension that we carry is habitual and with connecting with awareness, being aware that it's there, sometimes just that awareness can support its softening. Also there might be a little bit of inclination or invitation to relax. Arriving with your body and opening to the possibility of relaxation of body. And connecting also with how you are emotionally, mentally. Is there agitation or ease in the mind? Confusion, concern, worry or a sense of ease or calm? And starting with a little bit of just checking in, how are you right now? Not to think about it but to feel, feel into how you are. And how we are in our minds is also very much shaped by habit and as we open to and recognize how things are for us, if there is some tension, mental tension, worries or concerns about the past or the future, sometimes there can be an invitation or an inclination to soften that. Perhaps reminding ourselves that for this little while we can set down worries and concerns, not to push them away but just set them aside for a little while and give yourself the gift of space, give yourself the gift of allowing the mind to rest, the mind and body to rest right here in this moment. However it is for you in this moment, whether there is pleasant experience or unpleasant experience or neutral experience, resting with however it is in this moment is way more easeful than struggling with how it is in this moment. It's an opening in a way to honesty. How am I right now? With curiosity and interest, hoping to adjust how you are. Our system really appreciates this kind of attention, this kind of honesty, this kind of respect for what's here. Thank you. If you can touch into a sense of connection and care, opening honestly to how you are, you may taste or feel the sense of well-being that can come with that kind of honest meeting of how we are, even if it's unpleasant. The well-being is not unpleasant, but the honest meeting of whatever is here can be felt, open to. And if you can at times taste a sense of that quality of the mind that is willing to just be, allow, be curious and taste the quality of okayness there, maybe more than okayness, maybe more of a sense of appreciation, delight, ease, maybe, maybe there's a taste of that. And you might be curious about how the mind gets in the way of that. What happens? A little thought that the mind hooks to and starts to tense up around a memory, an idea. And noticing that, not trying to stop that from happening, but seeing if the container, the opening to experience can include that, that tightening, that tension, that getting caught, that too, is also what's happening in this moment. Maybe the sense of allowing and curiosity can expand to include that. This is where the learning happens, seeing that way we get caught. It's not a problem. It's a natural habit, conditioned habit of our minds to move away from ease and peace amazingly. And so we can learn, what is it that motivates the mind to leave ease and peace, not judging ourselves for it, but learning with it and keeping the practice simple. Just aware with what's here. Curious, receptive. famous. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
