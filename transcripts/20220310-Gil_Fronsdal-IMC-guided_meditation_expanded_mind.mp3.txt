 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, good day everyone, and I'm happy to be back. I don't know how many of you noticed that Tuesday and Wednesday recordings were, the broadcasts were pre-recorded. I had to go away for a couple of days, but I had to go off a couple of days to accompany my wife on her trip. And now I'm back, and now it's literally live. So, continuing on this theme of satipatthana, there's a paradigm shift that happens as we do this practice, especially the third foundation. And that is that we go from a fragmented mind to a mind that becomes whole, inclusive. That a fragmented mind is a mind that, well, one of the things that fragments the mind is excessive preoccupation with desire. And any preoccupation, any singular focus kind of being caught up in desire, the mind is limited by the desire. Preoccupation with ill will or version, and the mind is limited by that, and is narrowed and the scope has become smaller. And same thing with delusion. With mindfulness we're beginning to expand the scope of the mind of awareness to become not absorbed in greed, hatred, and delusion, absorbed in the hindrances, but rather becoming broader, wider, stronger, bigger, to be able to include all those but not be limited by them. And at some point the paradigm shift is when we have a sense of the mind as a whole, the wholeness and how good that feels, how satisfying it is, and how comforting or at home it is to be at home in the wide, broad, inclusive mind. And it's kind of a big shift because there can be so much authority, so much pull into the world of desires and aversions and the hindrances, and they can feel so compelling and feel like that's the right place to be, that's appropriate, it's justified. And so to pull ourselves out of that world is quite difficult because the habit of it, the pull of it is so strong, the insistence of it. But as the satipatthana deepens, we are able to no longer be limited or caught up in that limited world, so becoming aware of a shift to something that's more holistic, sometimes called the expanded mind or big mind, and that can include everything in its scope. So we'll sit a little bit with this. So to assume a meditation posture where the posture is the beginning of a shift away from the preoccupations of the mind to something broader, wider, more inclusive, kind of like going from a cooped up in a small little room, beginning to go outdoors, wide open, so the body can be beginning of that shift, assuming a bright posture, sitting strong and present, and to take some care to awaken awareness in your body, beginning by taking some long, slow, deep breaths, feeling the rib cage stretch and expand, the belly expand as you inhale, and relax, relaxing your body as you exhale, and then letting your breathing return to normal, and allowing your awareness to roam around your body, feeling the different parts of your body, and a way to awaken them or to welcome them into the wholeness of being here and now, and perhaps as you exhale, to relax more in your body, and as you relax to feel the effect of the relaxing, and then breathing normally and settling into the experience of breathing, just enough that it highlights any ways in which you are being pulled into the world of thought. And perhaps you can notice if you pulled into thoughts and ideas, stories and memories, commentary, that your attention might become limited by those concerns. And there's a way that if you let go of them, relax a thinking mind. You become aware of more than your preoccupation, aware of your body, aware of the state of your mind. Is the mind contracted or expanded? Is it scattered or settled? Is it possible to, is the mind tight or is it loose and open? Is it receptive or closed? And settling into your breathing, every exhale, relaxing the mind and letting go of your thoughts, every exhale, relaxing, every inhale, receiving the experience of breathing...... If you're involved in your thoughts, see if you can realize and even feel maybe what is beyond the edges of your thinking. If your thinking has a lot of desire or aversion in it, desire and aversion doesn't fill the universe, it's in you. And the mind awareness can be expand beyond the edges of desire, the edges of aversion. And as you breathe, let the breathing expand, inhale, expand outward into this wider world, massaging an awareness that's larger, more inclusive than any particular thing... In a sense, your mind or your awareness can feel like it's as extends as far away as the furthest sound that you hear. If all the sounds, furthest sound, occurs within the sphere of perception... On the exhale, relax any tension or contraction in the mind, in the brain.. The mind becomes broad and still, like the broad and still morning lake in a windless quiet dawn.......... If you're involved in any thoughts right now, see if you can shift your allegiance from thinking to awareness. Maybe a broad, wide awareness that is able to and willing to be aware of whatever is happening in the senses.......................................................................... consideration. And in this open, relaxed state, to have thoughts of goodwill, well-wishing for others, thoughts about how it would be quite wonderful if others could be happy and safe, peaceful, and free. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. And to the degree to which we have an open, relaxed awareness, may we have that as the medium through which we contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free.
