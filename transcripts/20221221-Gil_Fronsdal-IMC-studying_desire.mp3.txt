The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
And so to say just a few comments about the practice today,
that maybe is interesting for you and also maybe prepares you for what I want to talk about,
probably in 1145, is one of the ways of understanding Buddhism, this Buddhist practice we do,
that's maybe a little bit very simplistic and maybe even misunderstanding,
is this idea that we're supposed to become liberated from desires and not to have any desires at all.
But a little bit more nuanced way of saying it, understanding it is the same thing,
is that yes, we're supposed to be liberated from desires, but not by having no desires,
but rather we're freeing our desires from our attachments, our clinging, our resistance,
our heaviness, the intensity with which many of us can have desires.
And to have desires to practice, desire to wake up, desire to be present,
desire to be present without any clinging or contraction or heaviness or without any suffering,
that can be an oppressive desire if we hold it one way,
and it can be a liberating desire if we hold it a different way.
And how to have the desire to practice, to wake up to be present, be in the second camp,
to be liberating, to be wonderful, to be nice.
And so it supports us and guides us and inspires and it opens us, you know, supports the whole practice.
That's the art of this, is how do we have desires.
And so I'll leave you with that for this morning, that maybe as you go through the morning and practice here,
call upon your desire to practice, your desire to not be wandering off in thought,
and recognize that if you wander off in thought you probably want to come back and be present,
that involves a desire.
See if you can get behind that desire, be in that desire moment by moment,
in a way that is, feels good, the way that is not like a should or not like heavy, not like forceful,
but actually the opposite.
It feels really a light, but still guides you, still kind of keeps you present here.
So with that, thank you.
