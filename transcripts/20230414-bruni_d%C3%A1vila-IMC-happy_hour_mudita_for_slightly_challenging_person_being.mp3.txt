Okay.
So we've been practicing with Mudita, which is this aspect of, or one of the faces of
Meta, when Meta, loving kindness, meets the happiness, the prosperity, the good fortune
of others, or our good fortune, it transforms into sympathetic joy.
And, you know, there's this wish of, may your good fortune continues, may your prosperity continues.
And so we cultivate this mental state of Mudita.
And we cultivated with a sequence of bringing different beings.
And there's an intention and a purpose for this, because it's hard to start Mudita with someone we're having difficulty with,
or something maybe neutral, or someone which we're having a lot of emotions.
So we started, we started with an easy person, meaning a dear friend, a person that you really have,
you know, dear, dear to your heart, that when you see them, they may have a smile that may have some kind of joy going,
or you feel happy about them when you see them.
And then, and then we brought the neutral being.
Actually, we brought several easy people, you know, like the benefactor or dear friends,
and then a neutral being yesterday and today, we're going to practice with a little bit more of a person that we may have slight difficulty with,
or a slight challenge.
And I want to say this, because again, we're building capacity as we practice with, you know, all these different categories.
So please, you know, as it brings someone, a situation that is, that you can feel resourceful in practicing with this person.
And, you know, if not, that's, that's okay too.
Sometimes other beings show up without being invited.
And it's okay, we can say no, thank you.
So, but anyway, so we'll, we'll practice today with a person that he has a, we have a slight challenge and let's see how it goes.
Okay.
And so with that, you know, the purpose and intention is to, to have peace within us and to, to break the barriers between us and,
you know, different categories of beings and being able to, to have these mind states towards everyone without exception.
It brings freedom, it really does.
So with that, arriving, continuing arriving here, maybe taking two or three breaths.
Yes.
And appreciating priming ourselves, setting the ground here, conditions that will support us in our practice as we have done previously too.
Appreciating that we're here, appreciating your sincerity and dedication of your practice is a beautiful thing that you're doing.
And something that is completely against the stream of how things are sometimes in society.
So appreciating yourself.
Appreciating this body in whatever way is manifesting itself now.
Any posture of sitting, standing, walking, lying down, honoring this body that you inhabit in this lifetime.
Having some gratitude towards all of us supporting each other, bearing witness.
Sharing the human experience.
Taking a moment to settle in.
Being embodied here.
Receiving physical sensations that tell you that you're here, maybe some vibration or tingling.
Just sensing the contact points of the body with the chair, feet on the ground, body lying down or moving.
This is the present moment here.
And continuing with resting, resting the attention in this full body or breath or just receiving the sounds.
Just resting without anything to do or create or fix. It's okay just to be, just being here.
Just being here.
Maybe having a sense of being here and also reviewing your day today.
Seeing if there were any moments of joy for you.
Some moments of mudita for you. Some moments with a celebratory heart for yourself.
It could have been the moment in which you were savoring your tea or coffee in the morning.
Or just taking a break to rest in the midst of things.
And just yes, it's nice to be here having this tea or resting or enjoying the day today.
Whatever it was, take a moment to take it in to remember.
Taking a moment too to remember how we've been practicing throughout the week.
Bringing an easy person, the mudita for an easy person. It can visit you for a few minutes now.
The benefactor, the mudita that you felt for these benefactors.
As you breathe in and breathe out, having a sense of how it's felt in the body.
And body mudita for the easy person and the benefactors.
Maybe the neutral beings visit you now too and you remember the mudita generated for this being.
Having a sense of the body right now.
And so with or without these beings we've been practicing mudita for in the past weeks.
In mind you choose, you can bring to mind a new being today, a new category.
This being you have a slight difficulty with, slight difficulty, a slight challenge.
And having a felt sense of this person arising in your mind heart, in this mind heart.
A clear sense of this person. As you breathe in and breathe out, connected here.
Let's see if there's any physicality of this experience.
A sensation that tells you, yeah, this is a person having a slight challenge.
It may be a slight contraction, there may be warmth or not, but also there's some kind of contraction or not.
Staying within the body.
While you bring this person to mind.
Now bringing maybe this person, maybe you know that it have had some moments of joy, moments in which you have seen the joy of this person.
And in one way or another, you've been happy for this person.
Maybe a past memory that you remember of being with them or something that you learned about them.
Bringing other ways of seeing this person other than being challenging.
This person may also have had moments of having a celebratory heart for other people or even if challenging.
There's something that tells you that there's a humanity here.
Maybe this person do something very ordinary, extraordinary of other things that you also do like eating something you eat or doing other chores that you do or
being kind to yourself.
Maybe now you can visualize this challenging, slight challenging person.
Maybe if at any point this person has been happy for you remembering this.
Maybe not, but maybe yes.
So maybe one last way of seeing this being is by seeing it as a baby, as a child, as a newborn.
As you breathe in and breathe out, feet touching the ground, eyes open or closed, whatever supports you.
Maybe bringing some compassionate patience for this being, for how it is for you in relation to this person or this being.
And without forcing anything, maybe you can bring some phrases for this slight challenging person,
but maybe for those moments of good fortune that this being may have, may they continue.
Would that be possible?
May their continued prosperity stay with them.
And maybe you okay with it, happy in some ways or at ease or at peace, some way traces of mudita towards this being.
May your good fortune and happiness continue.
Maybe you can have a soft smile remembering the humanity of this being that also may have moments of good fortune and success in their lives.
Thank you.
Noticing if it is too much, if it becomes harder to wish mudita to this being, you can go back to any of the other categories or even to meta for this challenging person.
May your good fortune continues.
Yes, there's some mudita here for you. Yes, may it continues.
If mudita is not, is it flowing, please continue and if not, also you can go back to your mindfulness practice.
So mudita for other beings, come back to the challenging when you're able to and if that is not supportive, maybe go back to mindfulness practice, how it feels in the body, the sensations.
And practice meta for yourself, it's okay.
Thank you.
There may be a sense of acceptance in some ways or another of the humanity of this being, not to resolve anything now, nothing needs to be resolved.
A mudita no need to be forced, it's just for this moment, can there be some mudita sent to this person?
You can use any phrases that support you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Checking in with yourself, how are you right now?
What physical sensations are being received?
Only if support is appreciating your virtues.
Yeah, may your happiness continue, your good fortune continues.
Yeah, I can be happy for you remembering the moment of joy you have had or that we have had.
Whatever works.
Sometimes we can visualize this being at a distance.
Whatever distance is comfortable for you.
Yeah, may your happiness and good fortune continues.
And now as this being with whom you there are some slight challenges, still being here, you can bring the beings of other categories you have practiced here.
Almost like if you would have a circle of all these beings, a person that you see and just emanate mudita or happiness or your benefactors, neutral beings.
And see how it is.
How it is felt, the sense experience of bringing all these beings you can send mudita in one way or another, whatever lives they have.
And how is it to send mudita to this slightly difficult person in the presence of all these beings that are here with you all together?
All human beings doing the best they can.
As you breathe in and as you breathe out.
And so now to that circle you can include all of us here. All the categories you have practiced with all these dear beings and all of us here including them.
Now in the field of mudita including yourself dear friend.
Maybe sending phrases of mudita to all of us.
I am happy for our good fortune made it continuous, made this prosperity continuous.
And remember including this slightly challenging person being in the circle, other categories, all other beings.
May we all have a continued happiness and prosperity.
May we feel delighted, yes, for this good fortune.
For any moments of happiness that other beings in other parts in your city, parts of your city, your neighborhood, your communities.
Extending to other places.
For any moments of joy that you may have, I feel delighted.
May your happiness continue. May your prosperity continues and doesn't diminish.
Continue practicing in this way.
Not in any way that is supportive for you within this practice of mudita.
Continue practicing in this way.
Continue practicing in this way.
Continue practicing in this way.
Continue practicing in this way.
Continue practicing in this way.
Continue in this way.
Continue practicing in this way.
Continue practicing in this way.
Continue practicing in this way.
So now to end this meditation, appreciating all of us here, appreciating yourself and your practice.
Listen at the rain of the bell, receiving the bell. Take your time receiving the bell.
Maybe open your eyes and look around as you listen.
Listen at the rain of the bell.
Now taking a moment to stretch, move around, look around.
Dear friends, is there anyone?
As you take a moment to engage a little bit, maybe as a group we can just say how it was for you before going into groups.
I just want to give an opportunity to everyone that wants to share in this way.
Anything you want to say or share or celebrate.
Oh yes, Kim, please.
Thank you.
It was a wonderful practice. It's just trying to feel like how Modita was different from the other Brahma Viharas.
For me there's a delicacy or something a little bit fragile or I'm not sure how to describe it.
I don't know. More than some of the others where loving kindness feels like a big heart.
For me then Modita is kind of a delicacy.
That's the best I can do.
I love that way of describing Modita Kim.
That's beautiful. Thank you.
Yes, these different things we take in, it's just great to see, oh, this is interesting, this is how it is.
Sometimes we see, well, maybe this is the one or maybe all the Brahma Viharas, they support each other in one way or another.
It's just great that you see how do they feel.
Thank you so much for sharing that.
Anyone else? Maybe one more person?
We'll come back to share more after breakout groups, but for people that will not want to do the breakout groups, you can come back later or you can share now if you want.
Okay, so today, let's see, I will set down the breakout groups now.
You can come back in maybe eight minutes, whoever wants to go.
Okay, so, okay.
So, let me see, so we're going to be...
Okay.
Oh, this is...
Okay, so, here you go, and maybe the prongs will be...
Yes, how did this practice with the slide, Difficult Being, was and what is your takeaway of Modita?
You know, cultivating this mind state, how does it support you?
Even for this person, for this slide challenging person.
Okay, here we go, and everyone is in groups, okay.
Okay, here we are, we're back.
Oh, look, there are more smiles than before you left.
Oh, that's great, it makes me happy, Modita rising.
How was it, dear friends?
Let's see.
Susan here, I just think it's great when we share, because we...
Some of what we thought and feel, we think the same way, and then in other times, we bring up thoughts that maybe the others or I hadn't thought of, so it adds a little bit more richness to the experience.
That's great. Thank you, Susan.
Well, let's see, who else?
Maybe Padma joins again.
Anything else that wants to be said?
Oh, there you go, Padma.
I think the computer is playing with me, but anyway, no, I just wanted to say that this week was really beautiful, and I want to thank you for such a...
It was just very easy, not only beautiful, it was very easy, and today was one of the easy ones as well. Thank you.
You're very welcome.
May it support you and enjoy it.
Marianne, yes, please.
Well, thank you very much for all of your teachings, and I just find it so nice to just sit with people and everybody go around and talk and not really react or respond or fix or have anything.
It's just letting things, when they stop talking, just that very peaceful feeling to just let it sit there and then go on to something else. I love that.
So I just wanted to say that.
Thank you.
Yes, thank you, thank you. That is deep listening and supporting each other in that way.
Yes, please. Sridevi.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I thought Neil was in line. Okay.
Yeah, thank you so much. It was really nice learning about Mavita.
You know, we grow up in a society where it's all competition, all of nothing.
So lately, I think for the last two years, I've been learning how to appreciate others. So I guess not be jealous and slowly I'm improving. So it's just amazing how Buddha came up with all these different good qualities.
And thank you for bringing them up and teaching them how to do it.
It was great. Yeah. And, you know, we have this inner capacity too. It's so great that you notice that in these past times that you've been practicing with all this.
And we all have a Buddha, Buddha nature, Buddha capacity in us. So it was great.
So dear friends, time is almost up.
So in sharing the merit, so much Mudita for all of you.
So happy for your practice and just appreciating yourself and in sharing the benefits, benefits that you have cultivated today, all these past days may benefit you.
And may you be delighted with it and may it benefit everyone you come in contact with everyone.
May all beings be free. May all beings be happy. May all beings know peace. May all beings know peace.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for this week. Wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Have a great week.
Have a great week.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Good night.
Bye bye.
