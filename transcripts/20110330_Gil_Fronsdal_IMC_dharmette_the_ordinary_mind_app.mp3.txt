Dharmette : The Ordinary Mind

There’s a Zen koan I’m fond of, although I wouldn’t 
pretend to understand it. It says that someone asks a 
Zen master in China, “What  is Buddha?” And the  Zen 
master  says, “Ordinary mind is Buddha ” – which  kind of 
goes against what most people think. If you’re ordinary , 
certainly you – your mind – is not a Buddha . You’re 
practicing in order to cope , and to deal with your 
attachments, fears  and desires . This mind can’t be 
Buddha.  
 
But the ordinary mind is Buddha. I like this because it’s 
a bit of a n antidote to t he idea that becoming a Buddha 
– being enlightened  or spiritually mature  – is some 
extraordinary state , which takes you out of the  world , 
out of the ordinary stuff. Maybe i t makes us just more 
ordinary than we are.  
 
I wanted to introduce you  to an idea that I found very 
helpful in practice , which is t hat whenever you hear 
Buddhist teachings , a good vantage point from which to 
try to understand them  is to reflect on how you already 
know what you’re being taught. What experience do you already have that makes this true for you ? And in what 
areas of your life is it true?   
 
It’s easy to hear Buddhist teachings as being  lofty. After 
all, Buddhism is one of the great world religions. So it 
must be really a lofty, powerful thing  that you have  to 
study a lot before you can understand it. But don’t do 
that. Rather , listen the best you  can, and then say, “How 
do I already do this? How do I already know this?”  
 
For example, the heart of the Buddha’s teachings is the 
Four Noble Truths. You hear that there is suffering ; 
there’s a cause for suffering ; there’s the cessation of 
suffering ; and there’s a path to the cessation . You can 
try to study and understand it – the twelve  different 
stages, aspects , or spokes. You can get into the details 
and subtlety of it , and get more and more confused. Or 
you can ask yourself, “How do I already know that this is 
so? Do I already know that some of my suffering  and 
stress is because of how I cling? Have  I seen how 
letting go of and ceasing that clinging  leads to ending 
that suffering?” What might come to mind immediately 
is, “No ,” because you are focusing on your big 
existential issues. But ask again, “How do I a lready 
know that this is true?”  
 
It might be true when you  are at a traffic light . You’re 
driving along ; you see t he light turn yellow and then red , 
and you have to stop. You feel how uncomfortable and distressing it is , because you  have an important place to 
go to, and you’re  late getting there . You’re  very 
impatie nt for the light to turn green, and it turns out to be 
an extraordinarily long red light. You feel the agitation 
build , and then some driver going crosswise to you  tries 
to get across to the other side, but doesn’t because 
there  are so many  cars backed up , and t hey can’t get 
out of the intersection the whole time the light is green 
for you [ laughter] . You can’t go anywhere , and the 
impatience gets more and more worked up, right? 
That’s  the suffering. So maybe you can see, “Oh, I’m 
suffering because I’m ho lding on to wanting to get 
someplace and having my way.” Since  a traffic light is a 
relatively minor issue, maybe you can realize , “I can just 
sit back , relax , and let go.”   
 
It could be some really  simple , ordinary thing in daily 
life, like you were counting on having toast with jam . 
You put the bread  in the to aster ; your toast is done ; and 
then you go to the refrigerator , and find that there is no 
jam. You feel this distress , and it occurs to you, “ It’s 
okay. I don’t need to have jam today. I’ll let go of it. 
Maybe I’ll just have butter , or peanut butter , and let it 
go. That’s okay.” In that letting go of the attachment to 
jam, and ceasing  that discomfort you have , you’ve 
discovered the Four Noble Trut hs, or at least the first 
three.  
 Likewise,  in letting go of your impatience with the traffic 
light, you discovered the Four Noble Truths. They’re 
operating for you in a very simple, ordinary way. I would 
argue that a ll of you know very well the Four Noble 
Truths , or the first three at least. You wouldn’t have 
gotten this far in life  unless you had succeeded many , 
many  times see ing your suffering, see ing the cause of 
it, and let ting go. Standing in line at the supermar ket 
and getting impatient , you realize that there’s no point to 
being impatient here . The  line is  going to take however 
long it’s going to take . I’ll let go , and stand here. That’s 
the first three noble truths.  
 
We already do it , and we do it a lot , I believe. So if we 
see that we are already doing it , then perhaps what 
Buddhism is suggesting is : Can you spread it out, and 
do it in places where  you haven’t yet done it ? Can you 
expand it out further and further into your l ife, from 
something  very ordinary ? I would argue  that it is very 
ordinary to let go of your impatience at a red light. 
Maybe you can think of better examples for yourself  – 
some  very ordinary, simple wa ys in which you do it 
already . It’s ordinary mind  – but we’re trying to spread it 
out, and integrate it into all aspects of our life.  
 
Those insights and understanding – which we’re already 
doing – we apply  in more and more areas , including 
those that are really hard . Those places where  our 
attachments are deeply embedded may be hard to see  and let go of . For example, the attachment to life and 
being alive  is very powerful. People think it’s 
reasonable , but it’s going to cause a lo t of suffering if 
you have it at the wrong time. To face our attachment 
and really work with it  is not an easy thing to do. But it’s 
still the same ordinary thing  as a traffic light. It’s just that 
the stakes are much higher. It’s the same principle: if 
you’re attached, you’ll suffer. If you let go of the 
attachment , that suffering goes away. There  are a lot of 
powerful places  –  attachments to relationships, 
opinions , identity – where  we’re encouraged to extend 
this very simple insight.  
 
I believe that sometimes it is a lot easier to be inspired , 
or to find Buddhism meaningful , if you begin with the 
notion that you’re  already doing these things , and then 
question , “How is this already true for me?  And given  
that it’s already true for me, h ow does it make  sense to 
expand, develop , or grow it out into my life? ” Then  it 
becomes personal, meaningful , and your own. But if you 
take it as being a lofty philosophy that is so far and 
distant from anything that you can manage to do today , 
then it can be discouragin g. 
 
I would like to believe that the Buddhist path is mostly 
made up of the continuity of many  of these small steps. 
To begin understanding how it works in these small, 
ordinary ways , and doing it continuously through the 
day builds momentum  and support. So when you meditate, come on retreat, and come into the big crises 
of your life, you have familiarity , understanding , and 
momentum with this process. You begin to recognize 
really well : “Oh, here’s suffering ; here’s clinging ; and 
here’s lett ing go. I know that I’ve exercised that muscle 
a lot at the traffic light, the supermarket , and  all these 
different places in my life. And now I’m being tested , 
and asked to do it at a time of crisis. Since  I’m familiar 
with this, maybe it’s easier for me to do it. I’m not being 
asked to do something supernatural , or to do something 
that requ ires a foreign belief system or metaphysics. 
Rather, I’m being supported to thoroughly do something  
that is pretty ordinary .” 
 
So I hope you take your ordinary mind, the ordinary 
things you can do , and make them  extraordinary – so 
you can be really ordinary. Thank  you.
