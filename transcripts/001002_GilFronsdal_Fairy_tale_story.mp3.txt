 So I came back yesterday from teaching a three-day retreat at Spirit Rock. And a number of people from our local community who were there are here again tonight. And it was very sweet to sit. And I think it was very helpful for a lot of people to be able to take three days off from their life and go sit in silence. And I think many of you who are here in this room have been on retreats, so you know a little bit about the process. I said at the opening of the retreat that most cultures that I know of, in some corner of the culture, the religious part of the spiritual traditions within the culture, they have some form of stepping outside of society, outside of the culture, whether it's 40 days in the desert or going into the wilderness. It often had to do with going into the wilderness. But sometimes, for example, in the Tibetan system, the three years, three months, three days, the people spend basically in a small little room, sometimes just completely alone, just flew to be passed in through the hole in the door for you. It's such a common phenomena that there's a famous anthropologist by the name of Turner. I think it was Turner. It wasn't Turner, but the famous anthropologist turned the century that coined the word liminal, liminal having to do with the entry of a door. And liminal is to go across a threshold into space that's beyond or outside of normal cultural norms. And then unless we spend some time outside of our normal conceptual world that we live in, the social world, it's very hard to see ourselves very clearly. Even if you do go into the wilderness or go into the desert, it's very hard sometimes to see ourselves. But at least then you increase the chances. Many of us live with belief systems, with values, that cause us a lot of suffering. But they're so deeply ingrained, we don't even know we have them. And we think that this is the way the world is. It can't be any other way. But by stepping outside of the normal cultural patterns that we always live in, there's a chance to kind of see this freshly or see it kind of see maybe that they're arbitrary, see maybe the roots of them. So many traditions offer some way of doing this. And in our tradition, the way is to go on retreats. And there can be day-long retreats, it could be weekend-long retreats like we went on this weekend, or it can be longer, three-month retreats, or even longer. And I think that they're incomparable in value. And sometimes I think we have Spirit Rock Retreat Center up there in Marin County, which is a state-of-the-art meditation center. It's as if the art has changed in two thousand years. And it's easy to think that it's kind of in this wealthy suburban kind of, a little bit of rule up there, but wealthy county, that just a continuation of our normal life is not so special. But actually it's a very powerful process. And at the opening evening of the retreat, I told a fairy tale, and I wanted to tell you the fairy tale. And I wanted to tell you it because I think it somehow represents this process, but also because it's a fairy tale, as maybe all good fairy tales do, each of them you can personalize it. If you listen to it, it's kind of like a fairy tale is kind of a blank slate in a sense, where these images or symbols are being spoken, and then you have to figure out how that makes sense in your life. And of course you don't have to do that, you can just kind of not do the exercise, not do the homework and personalize it, but it often has great value if you personalize it. So as I tell the story, you might think a little bit about how to make it your own. Well, there was a farmer and her husband who one morning got up before dawn to milk the cows. And they went out in the field where the cows were grazing, hanging out, and it was still quite dark. And the edge of the fields, they heard someone crying. And so they went over in the dark with their lantern or candles, and they saw there was a small little girl, her face was all pinched up and tears were streaking down her face. And she looked cold, she looked miserable, quite afraid. And so they went over there to comfort her and ask her, you know, who are you, what's your name, who are your parents, where do you come from? And to every question they asked in between her sobs, they got just some crooks, you kind of croak, grunt. And she didn't speak. So being kindly couple, they didn't know quite what to do, but they brought her back into their farmhouse. And offered her some warm milk and some food and put warm blankets around her. And after some hours, she stopped sobbing and crying and her face dried out. So when they asked her again about her and where she came from, all she'd do was croak and grunt. And so they sent out all over the village and the local countryside and far afield, asking if anybody knew who this girl might be, this lost girl. And no replies came back, no one knew who she was. And so this kindly couple decided that, well, what to do? Well, we'll just keep her here for until whatever. And so they started living with her, and she was very, very happy. And after that, she went to her and she went on a farm, and she went to her home and she was very happy with her and they fed her well and took good care of her and offered her lots of love and kind of almost adopted her as their own daughter. And she followed them everywhere. She followed kind of their heels. And she was always very afraid. And she followed along as they went about their chores on the farm. And slowly she relaxed and slowly things got a little better for her. And then finally she, you know, things were pretty good there in the house. But then she had to encounter the neighboring children. And since she didn't speak, only croaked and grunted, the neighbors would, neighboring kids would tease her and taunt her in the kind of way that maybe some kids can do. And as she got older, the taunting got worse. And the teasing got worse, and she went to school. And in school she got quite a bit of ribbing, and it was much more painful for her. And she'd go home to the kindly home that she lived in and put herself to bed crying because it was so painful and despair and feeling quite a bit of shame for herself for not being able to speak and not knowing what to do. And so her life continued. And at some point in her tear-filled evenings, laying there in bed before she fell asleep, she started kind of daydreaming or dreaming that really she was someone else. And really she wasn't the daughter of poor farmers, but really she was a princess who belonged in a beautiful castle in a country far, far away. And she had this beautiful image, a visualization she'd make of the castle and the beautiful pastoral settings and what her parents would look like and all the people in the court and how she'd be playing with all the other kids and running around and how people would sing a lot and how she had this beautiful voice and she would sing in this beautiful voice, a beautiful song. And she would live with this dream every night. And at some point the pain of the abuse and the taunting that she got and the shame she felt with it became too much. And she said, I have to do something. I have to go find this castle. I'm really convinced that I really am someone else. I'm this princess and I must go find where I really belong. So in the middle of one night she snuck out of the house and headed out. And she followed the road until she came to the edge of a great wood. And by the great wood the road split in three. It's going in three different directions. And one of the roads curved back to the nice warm loving farmhouse where she had spent many years growing up. The other road skirted along the edge of the forest and ended up going down the valley to the local village. A village that had lots of opportunities. Both the opportunities of being taunted some more because that's where the school was. But also all kinds of possible opportunities of other kinds of futures and other kinds of people to meet and promise and dangers. And then the third path went directly into the forest. And the forest, as soon as the path went into the forest, it was dark. And there was a great wind blowing through the trees and there were lots of animals making sounds. And she was quite frightened by all the loud commotion and sounds and screechings that came out of this dark woods. But she didn't want to go back and she somehow didn't feel the promises of the village were what she wanted. So she headed into the dark path, into the woods. And as soon as she entered the darkness, the path was quite overgrown. And there were thorns and brambles and branches and tore at her and scratched her. And she stumbled along her way, kind of making her way in the darkness. It went from dark to darker. And she went for many hours until she finally realized that she was quite lost. But that time it was really going to get dark. It was night time. And she felt a lot of despair, a lot of fear. She was all alone in the middle of the forest. She croaked in her inability to speak and sobbed and fell asleep for the night. She woke up the next morning and her impressions was that it was not quite as dark as it had been the day before. And in fact it seemed to be a light somehow in the distance. So she didn't have any other ideas of what to do except to head for the light. And so she kind of plotted a course that she might maybe take her there around the trees and whatever and start heading in that direction. And she walked for many, many, many hours. And at some point she realized she'd walked in a circle. And she tried again. After some time she came back to where she'd started. By that time it was nightfall again and again she fell asleep crying, feeling somewhat hopeless about it. And the next morning she woke up and still there was some light somehow in the distance, a little bit of light. So she said, well I have to go there. Maybe that's the answer to my dreams. And this time she decided that instead of just kind of plotting a course and kind of heading more or less in that direction, she was going to fixate her eyes on that light. And it wasn't going to let her eyes move from the light one moment. And as long as the light was fixated for her, she wouldn't go in a circle. She would just head straight forward. And so she did that. And because she was so fixated on the light, she again couldn't see the thorns, the brambles, the branches. And again she stumbled along cutting herself. And after walking that way a whole day, she was not any closer to the light. She fell asleep, cut up the next morning. The light was still there and she continued walking the same way, fixated, absolutely determined. A great courage and great power of concentration just heading for that light. End of the day and she didn't come and get any closer. She fell asleep again, despairing even more than she had ever before. Completely lost in this woods, wilderness. Not really knowing how to go forward, how to go backwards, how to go sideways. She woke up the next morning and she thought about all this. And she thought, maybe if I can't find my way, make my way to my dream that dreamts for so many nights back there at the farmhouse. Maybe I'll just sit here and wait for the dream to come to me. So she's found herself a tree to sit under and she sat there to be really still and very open. Listening, waiting, open for something new, some new possibilities, some new opportunities, something to arise that she didn't know what it would be. All she knew was that you had to be open and attentive and listening and waiting. And she sat there and the first thing that happened was a daze of despair in the forest. Relaxed a little bit and she shook with convulsions. And she shook in fear. Somehow the concentrated effort of walking and always searching kept the despair and the fear at bay. And then once the shaking and the convulsions and the fear and the sweat stopped, she fell asleep. She slept for three days. She woke up and she sat up under the tree again. And she sat there again open, allowing whatever to arise to arise, knowing all she had to do was stay present and open. She'd had no other way. Waiting for something to happen unexpected. That's not her own doing. Waiting for the dream to come. And as she did that, the years of shame that she felt back at where she lived and the way children taunted her for not being able to speak and the shame and the fear of having something imperfect and something wrong with her and not being up to the standard of the people around her. The shame came and washed over her. And she came and the shame kind of washed and washed and washed. It seemed like it got stronger as it came to the surface of her consciousness. Eventually the shame passed, exhausted itself, there was no more shame in there to be come out. And then the anger came. And layers and layers of self-hate and health and anger towards herself and towards the children came. And she had trouble with the anger. She didn't think that was right. She kind of resisted it and judged it. But eventually she let it come again. She got out of the way and just returned to this inner stance of listening and allowing whatever to come to come. The anger flowed through her. After a while she got really calm and settled. At times there was an inner light that came from inside of her and she felt a lot of joy. But it took her many days to realize that since she was hanging on to the joy, after all these years of despair, she deserved it. So she hung on to it. But then she realized after many days that hanging on to the joy didn't allow her to be open anymore for anything to happen, for the dream to come. So very reluctantly, with great difficulty actually, she let go of her joy and let that move through her also. And then more fear came because she felt that she had lost control. Fear came of the unknown that would happen next. And as the fear passed through her, she got quieter still. And she sat there and sat there for the days and days. And then she got the impression that the light was getting stronger and stronger. The light that had been so far in the distance that she had always been looking for. It was getting stronger and stronger and closer and closer. And when it felt quite strong and quite close, she finally opened her eyes to see. And she stood up and she saw that just two steps away from her, from where she was standing, was the edge of the woods, edge of the forest. And on the other edge of the forest, outside the forest, was a great green, verdant pasture that had a nice yellow brick road that followed its way to the great Emerald City. And there in fact, waiting for her, were her parents, the king and the queen. And it was in fact the truth that she was a princess and that she had gone all along. And as she returned, she heard the singing that she had dreamt about in her dreams. And as she heard the singing, a beautiful voice came out of her throat and she started singing herself. The first time her voice had spoken in many, many years. And then she lived happily ever after, until she got married and got a job and a mortgage. So that's a fairy tale. Is it anybody here's fairy tale? Do you speak to anyone? How would it have been to manage to get to the light if you start being married and having a mortgage? You had three days of it. You should tell us what happened to you as you sat under the tree. Smita was at the retreat. He's been thinking about the story for four days. I think it's the same, regardless. I think it's so essential that we find some opportunity, regardless of our situation in life, to step outside of the currents of our life, the momentum of our life, in all the ways in which we are busy and acting in the world and responding and relating to the world. And let that kind of unwind. Because we can be so busy and so directed and so going so fast that we don't even know what is motivating us and what is fueling us, where the impulses are for our lives. And so regardless of our situation in life, we take some time to sit every morning, to sit in meditation, to sit maybe in the evening, to go on retreats, go walk in nature, do something that stops everything. So that I call it the process of letting our life catch up to us. If our busyness keeps us far ahead of ourselves, far ahead of our physical body even, then our body needs time to catch up. Our body is a lot slower than our mind. But our body is where our freedom is, to a great extent. Or to say it differently, that the process of freedom, the process of unraveling and discovering the depths of compassion and joy, that's possible in each of us, is really, I think, to a great part discovered in opening up to what can move through our body. And if we're always ahead of ourselves in the busyness that the mind creates, we don't give a chance for the body to participate in our life. To find some way to let us catch up with ourselves, some way to discover what's deep underneath. I think it's really, really important. And it takes a lot of courage to do that. And I think that part of the story for me is this young girl had tremendous courage. For us to go into the woods, but also to sit there. Yes? I wanted her not to go into the woods, I wanted her to go into the woods, and I didn't know why she used to do that. She said, something can go right into the forest, but she's still herself, she was like walking in the dark, like why would someone choose to walk in the dark? That's your story. Why would someone walk deliberately into the dark? That's a great question. So let's have some responses to that. Andrea. She didn't have a choice. She didn't have a choice. Andrea doesn't have a choice. In the forest of Burma, really dark. Someone else. When the known has a choice, you don't want to make a choice. Sorry? When the known has a choice, you don't want to make a choice. When the known has a choice, you don't want to make a choice again. Can you say a little bit more? I've chosen to walk in the darkness, but the known was back to where he came from. The village she hadn't taken before, it had some knock-off of her thing, taunts from the children, but it also had opportunities. That column was just safe. Please. I'm not sure if this is an answer or a response of your point, but I think the denial is safe. I think she's too to look home. Her original home. With her adoptive parents. Why I say that, the original story was weird. She had suffering as a satisfaction in her life, but she had adoptive parents who unconditionally loved her for what she is. So she's unsatisfied, she would if she did, but she goes off in this fantasy. Now, I've heard you have many reasons. If you were in the fantasy, I'll pull back. She really gets into it, and go, how am I worse? She's going to belt the dancing, where her home, and like if they invented it, you really go into your original home. I mean, she had unconditional love there. I think she should have realized how wonderful she had it at home. She would know that there's a very sweet in life. Beth, we have a Zen teacher here. Beth, where is your original home? Right here. You remember the Wizard of Life? A place like home? Kansas? I would like to say something. Please, yes. Which is... Without the forest. There's no way to know anything. There's no way to be where you are. You know, when I... I'm always telling people, Buddha left the palace. You know, he didn't stay in the palace and say, I really got it good here now, why won't I just, you know, keep it all in getting light of me from talking? I don't know why that's true. I don't know why the forest is the essential condition. The darkness is the essential condition. But we have, in every tradition in the world, long, deep experience that affirms the necessity. And... However we encounter the forest, whether we encounter it at Spirit Rock, whether we encounter it, as I do, in a hospital for the destitute, state-patient in California, where Andrea is going to find it in Burma, you know, wherever we find it, wherever that forest is for us, our ability to be that whole really does depend on going in there, on taking that path and on following it until the light does penetrate every... Please. I think there's more to it than just the forest of darkness or chapter 3. I think I am. So, what I mean to me, the most important thing to know my correct answer, and what I'm doing here, I think there's a lot more than forest. You're saying it's more important than finding the forest or finding... Knowing, if I'm not correct, just this. Yes. You said correct functions, correct situations. And then, when everything is clear and correct, in order to have correct light, no matter what I have, no matter what I am. So, I think that going into the forest is a way to maybe find that correct way for that, what you're referring to. And it seems that until you actually do that, you'll be lost, even in the comfort of your own home. Please. I was just reminding you of Joseph Campbell's Hill, his Thousand Days and how you have to go into the abyss and totally lose control or not. And to me, the darkness is something like that. It's similar with all of your touchstone points of who you are, who am I, who are you, what my realities that I've defined for myself before it's represented that to me. Of totally getting out of that. And because all that is, is the construct of how you create a life. And until you get out of that environment, whether it be a village, which is somewhat unknown, or your home is very well known, and you can show it to you. Only then can you get to the depths of it. And that's what the forest represents. Thank you. Please. Those were the same. I think it's both so and not so. I think everything is true. That's the darkness, that's the question. We simply... ...call for it. I'm concerned about two aspects of this authority. The fact that she was taunted and persecuted and driven into the forest, and that there was something drawing her there. She was somewhat more noble into the forest. Because there... If she has a choice. Not everyone enters the spiritual path based on their nobility. Yes? I like the hero's journey way of looking at it. And one of the things that Joseph Campbell said about the hero's journey is, not only do you go into the forest, and experience what she did, but when you come out, you bring something with you to give back. Really, what you've found is something deep inside yourself that you can give back to the pain and confusion and persecution that you found earlier. And so I would hope that she would find the yellow brick that I was going back to the village, and come to the village with a new awareness. In the Chinese Zen Buddhist tradition, the Chan tradition, they have the ten ox-reading pictures, which describes in that particular tradition how this process works. And there, there's definitely this liminal phase where you actually completely leave the... ...you know, and you disappear into the darkness, the unknown. And then clearly you come out of it, and when you come back, you don't leave society forever in your place in society. But then you come back with very different abilities than you were before. And then it said you come back into society with gift-bustilling hands. Yes? What kind of kind of... ...you're talking about a half-chain and everything, right? I mean, I put it in the... ...the psychology of that situation. But what hit me with the whole theory is that kind of the cat-chain is very... ...is it a fantasy, or is it just about the creation? Which is it? It's out there, but it's harder to think of what they're looking at, and what they're in. Oh. As far as... since it's a fairy tale, we assume that it's the highest aspiration. But the fairy tale, we always assume the best. But more profoundly, I think the question is how do we know whether... ...if we're living in fantasy or living out of some real aspiration? Nancy? I was struck that she described her as mute, and the left hand is mute. No, no. No? She didn't know why she wasn't speaking. But later she could see. But she was, and the left hand is not. I don't know. I like to... She was cocooning herself. Possibly. You don't know. I was throwing the bat at the hospital. Okay. Follow up. If that's the part... if that's a possible way the story goes... Follow up on your thoughts. Well then, quite possibly, the forest would be just the most natural choice. How so? Because there she wouldn't have any of the other distractions that people find her to feed her children, and to come see her. I see. So just the inward work she could do... Nice. ...when passing pamphlets. Oh, nice. So that's how it happens on retreats. When you go on the post-nary retreats, they're silent. And there's very little of the social interactions that we're used to. And it's such a relief for some people to be... At first it's very disorienting. People aren't used to it. But after a while it's a real pleasure, because so much of the exhausting way in which we relate to people is put to rest. And we get a chance to see ourselves in a much deeper way. So some of us are silenced by our society. And by stepping outside of our society we find our voice. Cheryl. Yeah, please. I think it would be significant that the farmer found her and she was in a graceful distress. And then they nurtured her and cared for her and gave her the strength and fortitude to be able to make that to some point, go, and stretch it for dreams. And I think that's something like my husband's... I would say that she benefited greatly. And I think she was very grateful for the love and the compassion she received from the farmers. And I think that strengthened her and gave her courage to go for it. If the dark forest passed, were not the way, then would we not all be enlightened being couch potatoes and working in the village? In the village. I think the ending is not proper at all. With a mortgage? With a mortgage. Going to the palace, I think that she was just going in a circular way before. I think she should have gone back and recognized that the farmers were the same in the same. And she was very happy. This was more like the odd story in broad, long, fairy tales. The realization. This wasn't didactic in that way. But I think it wasn't quite proper. I think it was. I'd like to step in back. I'd like the castle to have been the farmer's house. And I would like her not to have gotten a mortgage, but to have gotten some way of working compassionately in the world that was not as self-explanatory. And I would have been involved as it sounded in that telling. I would have, you know, it could be marriage in a family, it could include all those things. But somehow, I felt a little less doubt at the end that she had this beautiful voice now. And she's going to use it to bitch about the rent. I want more for her. Beautiful. So it's... I was hoping that he was going to make this big one. Please. I was just wondering, at the end, if the farmers were first hitting at each and coming to her and her staying kind with it, and expressing that you're also loving it now, especially letting the choice out. And then she would see that process coming to see her on her future. Whether that was the vision of going onto the farm now and then it being in the castle, or the castle. Great. Thank you. Yes? It just felt to me that she forgot who she was. And she went to the forest and through a process went back to find out who she was, just because she happened to be a princess or come from a castle. And it's not her fault. But it's about really finding out who she really is and not listening to the children and those that were talking to her or recognizing that she has support on her journey. But her truth was to find out who she was. Don? Well, as long as we're re-writing the story. I don't know what that was like, but it kind of bothers me that the punchline was her having a fantasy with the children. And maybe she could have kind of let the fantasy go again too. Yes? I think it's interesting that we also had a similar reaction initially, but hearing the conversation now is a bit like, we believe you can go through the forest once. Or not do it over. Yes? The forest is within and in the fairy tale it takes off. Right. And in all the conversation it takes off. It's on the moon. And it's always this. Yes? I'd like to know why she didn't go mad. Like for example, on a retreat you have a special set up and there's support and whatnot. But solitary confinement is what you do. They don't even do it anymore. So people go insane. And I'm wondering, where's the... Someone there's a must be a lot. And then we'll go the forest without being actually on the trees. Would she not go mad? Wasn't the pain and the fear and agony all came back when she was alone? What gave her the confidence and the trust that they hang in there and not to flip out? Good question. And maybe Cheryl's point is important that she did receive this very good care and love from these farmers. And that love, that metta, that loving kindness and the compassion she received helped create the condition that gave her the trust to hang in there. And maybe all of us need to cultivate a lot of love and compassion if we're really going to go into the depths of the forest. And it's hard to do it without at least some compassion. Well, thank you. That was wonderful to hear from you and have the fairy tale come alive in so many different ways. And in fact, she did use her wonderful voice as a healer and spent many, many years... ...singing many songs. In other words, a mythical wizarding culture. And next week I have a planned, a very different kind of Dharma talk, but it's also going to... ...not to use a fairy tale in the same way, but it's going to, in a sense, it's also about fairy tale and debunk a fairy tale. So, stay tuned. Thank you.
