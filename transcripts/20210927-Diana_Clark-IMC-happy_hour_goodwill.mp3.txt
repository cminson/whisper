 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome, welcome. Nice to see you all. Nice to share this practice, right, to practice together. And today I wanted to kind of continue with this, what I started last Thursday, with this exploration of this different definition or different phrases for one way that we might do metta. And I'll get to that in a moment, but part of it is also considering maybe a different definition for metta. I'm often using loving kindness or, you know, there's a whole slew, and sometimes I give like a whole string of synonyms and invite you to just choose your favorite word. But going back to Mr. Obiku, who I've been looking at a little bit to kind of how he teaches metta. He writes that if we translate metta as loving kindness, which I'm up to do, and which I'm up to, I think of metta as loving kindness, but he says that it might imply a certain amount of like tenderness. You know, this word loving kindness might have like some tenderness, or it might imply that we have a desire to provide for other people, provide some, like to protect them or nurture them or have some type of intimacy with them. And he said, you know, that's not appropriate for everybody. If we have this idea that loving kindness is going to go out to goodwill to all beings. Some people, if they knew you were doing that, might react with some suspicion and some fear. So it is true, I will say that loving kindness in the retreat setting, when you have days, weeks to really develop it, it can just be this beautiful, warm hearted feeling that goes to all beings and just naturally flows out. But it also can be when we're in our daily practice, it feels like loving kindness really quickly turns into a certain amount of tenderness or intimacy that might not be appropriate. Or might make other people feel uncomfortable if they knew. So Tanithra Bhikkhu, he really suggests this word, goodwill. That is, in my view, it's like more akin to not closing our hearts. It's this idea of maybe being helpful or cooperative or friendly. It has a different level of intimacy, different things are suggested, different things are implied or suggested from them. So one advantage of goodwill is that maybe it's easier to do goodwill for the difficult individuals in our lives. Maybe it's easier to do goodwill to have this idea that it's spreading out to more and more beings. To those that we don't know or even to all beings, to have goodwill, this sense of maybe being cooperative. It's not a high bar, right? But it does have this sense of not having a closed heart or not being mean or inappropriate or something like this. So with this idea with goodwill, it made me to also kind of change some phrases. And these are the phrases that I used last Thursday for the difficult person, but maybe we could use it, we could practice with it or play, explore with it to be for all categories of individuals. And this phrase, may you or may this person or whomever understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. So wishing that the person becomes aware, learns how to show up in the world in a way that's skillful and harmless. I think this is pretty, it's much easier to wish for even those people that we don't know and more all categories of people, the difficult people and everyone. So let's practice with that today. Good will, having goodwill. So we'll start with a little bit of mindfulness. Just again with this recognition and an invitation that if ever loving kindness doesn't feel like it's the right practice. Invitation to hang in there and stick with it until it feels like you know what this actually isn't helpful. If you're starting to tip into overwhelm or tip into something that just doesn't feel like the right experience for you, you can always come back to mindfulness practice. So taking a meditative posture. Feeling into the set, what it feels like to be sitting. Feeling the pressure against the body, feeling the energy level of the body, feeling the posture. Just tuning into the general the bodily experience. There might be some areas of the body that have some tightness, some tension. You can experiment with bringing our awareness to those areas. It might be that with awareness, some warm hearted, caring awareness, that there's a little softening. It might not be also, but it's always helpful to bring some care, some awareness. So those places that are perhaps asking for some attention in some kind of way. And then resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing. Feeling the inhales and exhales, the expansion, the contraction, the movement associated with breathing. Thank you. Thank you. In our loving kindness practice, I always think it's a good idea to start where it's easy to bring into mind a lovable being. An imaginary being, kittens, puppies, babies. Maybe somebody you know, somebody who's in your life, you have an uncomplicated relationship with. Maybe somebody that has touched you in some way. And connecting with this lovable being. It might be that just bringing them to mind as you experience some softness or delight or warmth, or maybe not, it's perfectly fine, whatever arises. Perhaps visualizing them. I'm going to start with the classical phrases for the lovable being as a way to support our intention of cultivating loving kindness, cultivating neta, goodwill. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Thank you. Allowing ourselves to connect with the warm heartedness we have for this lovable being, our appreciation, our care, respect. Thank you. Thank you. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you expand our loving kindness to include ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. And then can we extend our metta, our good will to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? And can we extend our metta to all beings? So I'd like to give you an opportunity to talk about this with others. This idea of thinking of metta as good will rather than loving kindness. Does that make it a little bit easier for other people to do it with more, a greater variety of people, those who are difficult, people we don't know, for all beings, all these different ways in which we might be practicing with the metta? So, how about now put you, we can go in for like 14 minutes. And it's helpful to not say all your ideas about good will, but maybe just to say one point and then let it go to the next person and they say one point, then it goes to one more person and they go to the other point. And Jerry just put in the chat, is true happiness related to contentment as the greatest will? That's something you could talk about in your small group. Okay, what is this true happiness thing that Diana is talking about? I will say that in the polycanon, just this word suka. It's so I don't think that there's a different expression for true happiness. But I think tennis or a big who is using this expression true happiness to make sure that people don't get it confused with pleasure. Sometimes happiness and pleasure get conflated. So, maybe Diana's little riff on the topic. Okay, so, whoops, let me see here. Let me do a little bit of rebalancing here. So you'll be in groups of three or four. And here we go. So welcome back. Anybody have a comment or question or something they'd like to share. Diana we were a lot of psychotherapists in there, doing really veered away from manic depression, which caused us to choose contentment rather than happiness. Yeah. Okay, there we go. Yeah. Yeah, you're welcome to kind of like, we're starting to use phrases in a way that makes it great. Yeah. Thank you. Michael, on the phone. Michael you just muted yourself. Yeah, there we go. I had huge moody to because I was in the token men's group. And also, one of the gentlemen shared he was going on retreat for two weeks at the holiday season. And, yeah, so that just warms my heart. And deep bow channeling the Dharma, Diana. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Was there a men's group did it end up that it was all men in a group. Yes, so rare but yes. Wow. Okay. Okay. Yes, yes, I really liked the, the distance of this practice because sometimes I, I'm pulled into the warmth and that's easy when I'm feeling warm but there are individuals I don't feel so warm with, and it's easier to just say, may you understand the causes, and it kind of puts the responsibility on them which is appropriate it's it's not appropriate for me to understand their causes. So I like that I thought it was. It's helpful and I want to say elegant, but I don't know how it's elegant but it feels kind of elegant. Yeah, I kind of like that word elegant right it's, it's good will. Right. Not, and it allows us to not be have any sense of hypocrisy, like, maybe we can really wish this with some. Yeah, that's, that's what it is. Or met that, or maybe a little bit of carrou to some equanimity thrown in there to write some new Pekka. Okay, oh yes Kathleen, very quickly, just occurred to me maybe people would be open to renaming the group, instead of loving kindness, you know, the meta, it's meta happy hour for meta, which is what I always do. And I appreciate your offering this different translation. I'm enjoying it too. Thank you, Kathleen. You know, when I'll just say that when the key and I first started this, we weren't sure that people would know these poly words. But I think more and more you know the time we've been doing this and now we've been doing for a number of years I just think it's becoming more and more clear, but. So Dave says sorry I wasn't prepared for the breakout. I was actually looking for the YouTube link. YouTube happens when Nikki's teaching and that's usually Monday Wednesday Friday, when I'm teaching it's just zoom. And so, Nikki does both zoom and YouTube. Okay, great so it's two minutes after the hour, and I'm going to be practicing with you all and feel like we can unmute and say goodbye. So, bye bye and thank you everybody. Bye. Bye. Bye guys. Thank you so much. Bye Barbara. Oh, she left. Oh, well you tell her bye next time. Okay. That's nice Abraham your voice carries. Good night.
