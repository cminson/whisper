 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So hello everyone and welcome to our meditation. And somewhat following the day, my last few days of mindfulness of the four properties, elemental properties of earth, water, fire and air, I'd like to suggest some little variation of what we did yesterday. And today the instructions are to follow the sensations in the body, follow the trail of sensations that their body sends up, and if you're with a relaxed mind, relaxed, kind of not fixating or focusing on anything particular, let your body take the lead so that your awareness follows, your mindfulness follows. So if you're aware of a coolness in your fingers, your awareness would go to the fingers. Then aware of a teeny cough, you'd be aware of a little cough. Aware of warmth in the chest, you would go to the warmth. Whatever appears in the body, if you keep your attention open and relaxed to your body, what then sensations appear? Some may persist and last for a while, but if you stay relaxed around it and just kind of aware of it in a soft kind of way, kind of floating way, something else sooner or later will appear. And then as it appears, you continue on the trail along that sensations. So in other words, you're not directing the attention to something new or some idea you have of what you should be paying attention to except for sensations of the body. But you're following the lead. The body takes the lead and you follow. Maybe it's like a dance where there's a lead and a follower. So you just follow with awareness and see what happens when you relax into following along with no other responsibility, but to follow along and to feel the sensations that appear. And then at some point later in the meditation, I'll offer some additional instruction. So to begin, to settle into your body, to relax into the present moment, if it's nice for you, you can take a few deeper breaths. A clear kind of ritual recognition of being here in your body, breathing in deeply. And extending the exhale longer than your exhale would do on its own. And especially on the second half of the extra exhale, the extended part of it, is there more places in the body, the arms, the shoulders, that you can relax? The belly, chest. A ritual connection as you breathe in and the ritual of relaxation as you exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And to continue with a few more breaths, just ordinary breaths, let your breathing return to normal. And to continue with a few more breaths, just ordinary breaths, as you breathe in, feel some place in your body where there's tension. And as you exhale, relax and soften. Exhale, relax and soften. Breathing in, breathing out, relaxing into your body. And if you have any concerns, thoughts, pressure to think, feel that pressure as you breathe in and without expectation, without force. As you exhale, relax the thinking mind. And letting go of your thoughts. And as you do, letting go into your body. Whenever you need to let go of your thinking, let that be the same as letting go into your body. And then for this meditation, let your awareness, your mindfulness, follow the trail of sensations that appear in the body. Let your mind relax, let your mind relax, let your mind relax, let your mind relax, let your mind relax. Be curious, follow what appears in your body. In whatever way the sensations in your body appear, disappear, appear, persist for a while and then others appear. Follow the newly arising sensations in your body. Letting your awareness follow them in a relaxed, slow way, floating to the next sensation that appears, to the next one, to the next one. Where the trail, the lead, is set by the sensations. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. Whatever new sensations arise, let your awareness go there. And then when the new, another new one arises, let it go there. Be sensitive to the new sensations of body that appear. Sometimes it might include sounds appearing, sensations of the ears. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. See if you can quiet your mind enough that you can float between the new sensations that arise in your body. In a light, relaxed way. Where no one's sensation is given extra emphasis or importance. Just a new arising. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And awareness follows. And now for the end of this sitting. To have felt your body, the sensations of your body could come and appear and disappear, is evidence that you are alive. This is the animated body. One day this body will be not alive. This body will be a corpse. And none of those sensations will be here. And there's nothing, no sensations for the body to take in, be aware of. No sensations to react to or to cling to. Worry about. No sensations. And there's no awareness of sensations. No mind. This wonderful, powerful gift of nature to be aware will not be here as well. What is it to sit in the middle of this living body, animated with sensations and awareness, without clinging to any of it? Feeling the uniqueness, the timeliness of this in this time, in this moment. Now is the only time and place where all the sensations, the awareness exists. The lived moment of the present. Aware, but not attached. Just aware. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to know yourself as an animate being, alive with sensations, alive with the capacity to feel and sense, to be aware of the emotional life, an inner life of awareness and thoughts and memories and futures. With a heart that's sensitive to the comings and goings of life, the challenges and joys of life. And like you, other people are the same way. They too are animated beings with sensitivities of body and heart and mind, with capacities for their inner life to be happy and free or suffering and caught up. Knowing that others are in some ways like yourself and their capacity for happiness and suffering, open your heart of compassion and care, the heart of love to all beings. Imagining how wonderful it would be if they could be happy and free. Just as it would be wonderful for you to be free in this precious living life that we live. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
