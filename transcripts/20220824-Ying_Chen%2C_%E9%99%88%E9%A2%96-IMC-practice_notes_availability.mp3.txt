 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. For me there is a sense of opening and being receptive to whatever is here in my experience. Maybe a sense of a presence. And awareness, sati, mindfulness is here. You can also drop in to notice when you're not available. Maybe sometimes preoccupied with plans, thoughts, stories. I become unavailable to whatever is happening right here and now. What's your direct experience of being available and not being available? Miraculously we can know that. And being available also evokes a sense of centeredness, stability, not being pulled or pushed by our experiences. And showing up to accompany our experiences. But not getting caught up because of our desires, aversions of what's happening. And the last thing I want to say about being available has to do with releasing and letting go, letting go of our own agendas. Let the practice lead the way. Noticing the expectations and the control and strategizing mind can come in and take us away from being available to what is happening. So letting go, letting go of self-centered projects, very simple availability to the life unfolding in front of us.
