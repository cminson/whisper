The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So I'm just going to ask a few of you. I'm just going to mute a few just so that the quality of the recordings are a little bit better.
And today I wanted to talk about something that's definitely a heart practice, but it's a little bit different than loving kindness or compassion.
And that is this idea of forgiveness. This idea of, I think there's this little saying that I've seen about this idea of letting go of the idea of having a better past.
Like, okay, what's happened in the past happened. And there might be a way in which sometimes we hold on to things or rehash them or somehow get stuck on them in some kind of way.
And forgiveness is a way to help us let go of these things that are not helpful.
And of course, of course, this doesn't mean that we condone or approve of some of this behavior.
It's just more about making room in our own hearts. It's about letting go of these past sufferings and this burden of pain, or maybe even some form of ill will or hatred or something that comes along with it.
And forgiveness is such a tender topic. It's really tender.
Perhaps more so than loving kindness or compassion practices, but similar to compassion, forgiveness doesn't ignore the truth of our suffering.
And maybe similar to compassion, it's not weak or subservient or subordinate to any of these ways.
But instead, it's a way in which we can show up with dignity and courage and some integrity.
So without pretending like things didn't happen or that they don't have the same effect on us that they actually are having, or without just thinking like, oh, over time, things will get better.
Instead of recognizing that the suffering and the difficulties that's there now that we are experiencing with those memories, that whether they're obvious and clear or maybe more subtle,
that we haven't fully processed or metabolized or somehow come to a place to them where they are no longer causing us suffering in the present, in the present moment.
So I'll admit that I talk about forgiveness with a deep respect and a little bit of hesitation in the sense of I certainly don't want to feel like we're going to whitewash all these terrible things that have happened.
And also, with a deep respect that just what we do with loving kindness practice, with compassion practice, all these other heart practices, we start where it's easy.
We start where it's easy.
We don't start with the most difficult, the most that we have the most charge around or the most suffering around.
So just where it's easy.
And even before we, even if it's not our intention, before we know it perhaps, we start where it's easy, it just becomes a little bit easier as we, it becomes a little bit easier to forgive some of the more painful things.
And part of that is because as we just start to see the benefit, start to feel the unburdening that can happen when the heart and the mind is ready, that the unburdening that can happen with forgiveness practice.
So there's absolutely no obligation.
No obligation.
Right.
This doesn't work with obligation.
There's no sense that you should and you have to forgive.
Here we're just creating the conditions in which the heart can burden itself in a way in which it's ready to let go.
So we're not going to force ourselves.
We're not going to try to control ourselves.
And this is what we should be doing.
We're just creating the conditions in which some letting go might happen in a way that makes more sense.
Makes more space for some love, makes more space for some warm heartedness, makes more space for some spaciousness actually, just to allow other things to, to arise.
So it does, forgiveness is just this release of the burden.
And sometimes we're not ready to let go.
Maybe there's, there's all kinds of reasons why.
And in some ways, maybe it's not even wise to let go.
Maybe there's some ways in which we could learn something about ourselves or there's something for us to still understand better.
So maybe it's not even wise to like just forgive and let go in some kind of way, but instead to keep on using this expression.
But this is how I think about it, is to create the conditions in which the heart can unburden itself.
And we'll start where it's easy.
So ways that I like to practice this is with a mind and a heart that already feels a little bit soft and settled.
So we'll do a little bit of mindfulness practice, and then a little bit of loving kindness practice to, again, create the conditions in which the heart can unburden itself in which some forgiveness can happen.
And then I will offer some phrases.
And I'll reiterate this as we go, but there's no obligation.
But I don't want to offer something that allows our inner critics to come alive and, you know, demand that some experience we had or something like that.
Okay, so that's kind of a lot of a long preface.
So maybe with that as an introduction.
Just taking three long breaths.
And then allowing the breath to return to normal.
And then just checking in with the body.
Maybe in a really global sense.
Maybe some alertness.
Maybe some comfort sitting in this chair.
Or couch or wherever we might be.
We'll do a little bit of the body scan.
I like to start at the top.
So tuning into the feelings they experience on the face.
In the face.
The face is very sensitive.
We express so much with our face, including holding tension.
The eyes, the jaw.
And the shoulders.
The shoulders speak far away from the ears.
Maybe that with the exhale, now the shoulder blades to slide down the back.
The upper back.
The lower back.
Open the chest.
It makes sense for you to just open the chest.
Just a small, very, very small bit.
Maybe moving the shoulders back.
The belly.
The belly to relax.
And feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body.
And your seat.
Feeling connected and grounded.
The upper legs.
And the feet.
Noticing, feeling that feet are connected to.
Feeling grounded, connected there also.
The upper arms.
And the hands.
And letting the tension rest on the sensations of breathing.
The movement of the abdomen and the chest.
And that thing in particular needs to be happening.
Just noticing the sensations of breathing.
Aliving, feeling settled.
And then to begin with some loving kindness practice.
Of course we'll start right easy.
So bring to mind a loveable being.
That might be a person with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship.
Perhaps it's a pet.
Or perhaps it's an imaginary.
charged puppy maybe, maybe even a cat video one time.
Whatever it might be.
Whoever it might be.
And feeling into the heart in whatever way you understand that.
And to support this feeling of warmth and care, respect, goodwill, benevolence, you
can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be happy. May you be
healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May
you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you be happy. May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Allow yourself to feel the warmth, the warm heartedness that
goodness, the care that you have for this lovable being.
May you be safe.
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Is there a sensation in the body that somehow feels like it's care, warmth, love, kindness?
Maybe there really is a warm sensation in the chest and heart area. Maybe you're not
even quite sure how to describe it. Some bodily sensation associated with sending
goodwill to the lovable being.
What would it be like if this lovable being turned and was sending the same goodwill to
you? Now you are the recipient. Allow yourself to feel their care, their goodwill, their warmth.
Allow yourself to feel the warmth, the care that you have for this lovable being.
And then to begin the forgiveness practice, again, we'll start where it's easy. We won't
start with the greatest difficulties or biggest difficulties. And again, there's no obligation.
We're just creating the conditions. And we'll start with forgiving ourselves. We're giving
ourselves. So we can say this phrase, there are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion
or anger, in which I have harmed, betrayed or abandoned myself, either knowingly or unknowingly.
Or the ways I've hurt myself through action or inaction. I now extend a full and heartfelt
forgiveness. There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or anger, in which I
have harmed, betrayed or abandoned myself, either knowingly or unknowingly. For the ways
I've hurt myself through action or inaction. I now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or anger, in which I have hurt myself
through action or inaction. There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or
anger, in which I have harmed, betrayed or abandoned myself, either knowingly or unknowingly.
For the ways I've hurt myself through action or inaction. I now extend a full
and heartfelt forgiveness.
There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or anger, in which I have hurt myself
through action or inaction. I now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
Allowing ourselves to let go of past signs, allowing ourselves to let go of past signs,
suffering and release the burden of the pain, without ignoring the truth of our suffering
or ignoring the past. We're shedding what's extra while honoring and respecting ourselves
and what has happened.
There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or anger, in which I have harmed,
betrayed or abandoned myself, either knowingly or unknowingly.
The ways I've hurt myself through action or inaction. I now extend a full and heartfelt
forgiveness.
I now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
Now you're supposed to feel the unburdening
that expression of forgiveness.
Or if you're not quite there,
allow yourself to feel the intention
that maybe someday in the future
you'll have the idea to have the intention to forgive yourself.
You can honor and respect whatever your experience is right now.
There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or anger
in which I have harmed, betrayed or abandoned myself,
whether knowingly or unknowingly.
But the ways I have hurt myself through action or inaction
I now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
I now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
I've discovered that this self-forgiveness, having a foundation there
makes a really big difference for other types of forgiveness.
It's worthwhile practicing this.
And then to end this meditation with your feet on the ground,
with the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body.
When you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
So we just stayed with the forgiveness for oneself there.
After allowing ourselves to be settled,
sometimes we could go through other categories
asking forgiveness of others for those we have harmed
and then forgiving others for those we have harmed us.
As I said at the end there, it's worthwhile spending some time
with self-forgiveness and as best we can.
Like feeling what is the experience of forgiveness
at this lessening, this unburdening
and become familiar with that.
And in the contrast, we can notice that when our inner critic
is really loud and speeding us up in some kind of way
to recognize that self-forgiveness is kind of the opposite movement
and that can help really support us to be available
not only for ourselves but for others.
So it can be helpful to talk about some of these ideas
of forgiving oneself or combining forgiveness practice
with loving kindness practice with others.
So I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms
where you'll have an opportunity to share with others
and talk a little bit about what that experience was like
with doing that practice.
And or some of your ideas that you might have about
just you can talk about your experience
or maybe the idea of forgiveness practice too
whichever you feel comfortable with.
Okay, so we'll meet for about 12 minutes
and it's nice if one person doesn't start and then say
everything that they absolutely know
and then the clock continues ticking down
and then there's a little bit less time for everybody else.
It'd be really helpful just to say maybe that one or two points
and then allow it to go to the next person
and then allow it to go to the next person
and then allow it to go to the next person
and then in that way there can be
you can learn from each other
and you can build on what you said earlier
in a way that's helpful for everybody.
So let's do this.
We'll be in an uncreative way.
We'll just go in alphabetical order by screen name.
So if your first name starts with the letter A
you get to go first.
Okay, have fun.
So welcome back, welcome back.
What do you like to share?
What was it like to do this practice
and or what was it like in the small group
to talk about a chair a little bit about it?
Thank you.
Hey, it's Michael.
It was super sweet, helpful.
And yeah, it just warmed my heart.
And also Don was really awesome last Thursday.
So deep bows to her.
Okay, great.
Thanks for saying that.
Thank you, Michael.
Anybody else have a comment they'd like to say?
Did I just jump in?
Sure.
Yeah, I found myself able to see myself towards the end
and actually give myself forgiveness by seeing myself.
And, and kissing myself on the forehead,
kind of like a little kid, you know,
and that, that just really helped a lot.
Diana.
It was really sweet to be able to feel that connection.
And actually kind of feel like I was making eye contact.
So I really thank you for this.
Great. Great. Thank you. Thank you.
Trudy.
Yes.
In the group, we talked a bit about finding our own issues
within the problem that needs to be addressed and finding,
you know, I had a part in it.
It might be small, it might be large,
but I had a part in it and how to locate that.
And I realized in time that my expectations and my beliefs
about myself led to part of the problem.
Yeah. So self forgiveness kind of coming into the role that we had.
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you, Trudy. Thank you.
Abraham.
Hi.
I think it was very apparent in our group,
what a tender and sensitive place this topic approaches
and how incredibly important I, for me,
I feel this, this exercise is very important because.
Yeah.
Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.
I would use that word tender also.
Right. It's really tender.
And I would say a one that we should treat with, you know,
care and respect.
And all of us will find our way with this, you know,
in a way that makes sense in a time frame that makes sense for
our hearts and minds. And so just a real encouragement to
treat ourselves with care and whatever happened,
including like, I don't know,
that's like a waste of time or, you know, or,
or whatever our response is, you know,
and to realize that whatever response we had today doesn't
mean we're going to have the same response the next time too.
So.
Okay. So it's the top of the hour.
So just wanted to thank you all.
It's such a delight to practice with you all.
It's really a beautiful thing to have us all come together
and practice in this way.
So really deep bows, deep bows to all of you.
And if you'd like, we could unmute ourselves and say goodbye
in an unruly way, which is.
Bye bye.
Thank you. Thank you.
I forgive myself for being unruly.
Thank you, Linda.
That's very sweet.
I appreciate that Diana. Thank you.
You're welcome, Trevor.
So Abraham's asking me if I have time to talk about audio.
Yes.
But should we talk Abraham on, on zoom,
or do you want to talk on Google meet?
You're muted.
It doesn't matter to me.
Yeah. Can you send me a link for a Google meet?
And let's meet that way.
Sure.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye bye.
Bye, Trudy.
Bye.
I think, I think she said bye.
Didn't she?
Yeah.
I need email address.
Mine.
Yes.
Oh, I'll send it to you.
Aren't, aren't you in fearlessness?
Yes.
Here, but I'll send it to you.
