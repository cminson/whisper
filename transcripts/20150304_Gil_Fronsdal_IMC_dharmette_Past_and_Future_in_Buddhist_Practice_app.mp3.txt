Dharmette: Past and Future in Buddhist 
Practice

When many people encounter Buddhism here in the 
west, they often pick up a few simple thoughts or ideas 
and think that that’s the whole thing. For example, they 
might think we are supposed to be mindful  in the 
present moment – and that’s all you are allowed to do, 
with no concern whatsoever about the past or the 
future. Just be present.  
 
Some people might hear the idea that we are supposed 
to let go of attachments, of clinging. They think that’s all 
they are supposed to do – let go. They hear this 
wonderful Buddhist word: attachment. In Buddhist 
English, attachment is bad. Heaven forbid. But that’s the 
local idiom of Buddhist culture. It’s a synonym for 
clinging, grasping, addiction, things like that. But in 
popular English, attach ment has other meanings. So 
then people think: well, I’m not supposed to b e 
attached. I’ll just ignore my  kid.  
 
If you ever hear  yourself reducing Buddhism to one 
simple little sound bite, and you think that’s all it is, and in so doing you find yourself turning away or closing the 
door to what’s going on in part of your life, watch o ut! It 
will probably come back and  bite you.  
 
As some of you know, over the last thirty years or so the 
word mindfulness has become more and more popular 
in English. You coul d probably do a graph: uses of 
“mindfulness” in popular American culture . It has 
probably gone up dramatically. I don’t know if it’s 
exponential growth, but it’s certainly growing fast. It 
used to be that mindfulness was strongly connected to 
Buddhism. But  now Buddhism has been left in the dust 
with the use of that word. It’s been adopted. There’s 
even a member of the U.S. Congress who  has written a 
book on mindfulness.  
 
But this emphasis on mindfulness, as wonderful as it is, 
also can be reductionistic . It leaves out that Buddhism is 
actually meant encompass  our whole life – to include 
everything as part of it, to practice with. How do you 
practice? How do you include everything? Not to reduce 
it to just one simple thing – to just be mindful. I fe el bad 
sometimes when people listen to me for a long time , 
and they think all they are allowed to do is to be mindful 
of their experience. To think that sums it all up. 
Mindfulness is great. But to limit it to that  …  
 
This thing  about being in the preset mo ment, I’ve seen 
that also in Buddhist America.  That the present moment sometimes  is held up as the god of the Buddhist world. 
As though  this is the ultimate – the most sacred – just 
now. Everything is going to be okay if you can just be 
here and now.  
 
Traditionally in Buddhism, your past is important , and 
your future is important. And if you don’t take your past 
or your future into account in a healthy way, you leave 
out a big part of who you really are, what your situation 
is all about. When you meditate,  you want to be in the 
present moment  – but also to have some way of 
including the past , but not to be caught up in  the past . In 
a bigger way of encompassing our  lives, we want to 
take into account where we come from : our 
backgrounds, where our ancestors c ome from, the 
whole picture of conditioning , and cause s and effects 
that brought us to where we are now.  
 
We also need some sense of the imaginary future. The 
future is always a prediction, always an imagination . But 
to take it into account  can be valuabl e. To think ahead , 
plan ahead , imagine  – is part of our life . I am beginning 
to imagine trying to visualize when I am going to have 
time to do my taxes. I better spend a little bit of time 
thinking ahead , because April 15 th is going to show up 
and that’s going to be the present moment. That’s going 
to be a very full one if I don’t plan ahead. So, past and 
future are important part s of an overall wise life.  
 I want to talk a little bit about the past and the future in a 
particular way. One of the roles of the past in Buddhist 
practice is to focus on our past so we can learn from it 
how to go into the future. In terms of the past and the 
future, the emphasis  in Buddhist practice  is on the 
future  – looking ahead  – how you can d o better  – how 
you can practice  – how you can improve yourself , or 
improve this world. Buddhism tends to be forward 
looking , but you don’t want to ignore the past. You want 
to learn from the past.  
 
For example, some of you might have regrets or 
struggles about what happened in the past . It might be a 
burden for you. You might be held down by that, 
preoccupied with it. If you’ve made mistakes in the past, 
the idea is not to ignore them,  but to learn from t hem. 
Not to be burdened by them, but  to se e how you can do 
better in the future. When you see  how you can do 
better in the future, you can  be inspired by that, or 
hopeful, or positive. “Yes! I’m going to try to do better.” 
Rather than , “Oh no. What did I do yesterday? Oh no. 
What a terrible person  I am. There’s no hope.”  
 
Rather than being pulled down by the past, look at it just 
enough to get some idea of how you can do better. 
Then be inspired by the possibility of doing better. “I’ll 
do better this afternoon. Now I know what I can try to 
do. No w I know what the practice is. I might not be able 
to do better. But I know what I want to do. I want to try. I’m going to try to be kinder to my neighbors. I’m going 
to try to be a little bit kinder to myself. I’m going to try to 
be more present in those difficult situations where I lose 
my mindfulness.” We can  be inspired by the possibility 
of this kind of growth in the Dharma.  
 
So we look at the past to learn from the past , not to be 
weighed dow n by it. We look to the future , not to be 
afraid of it, or caught up in desires about it, but rather, to 
have a vision of what’s possible , and to be inspired to 
act on that  – to be different ; to live differently ; to make a 
difference in the world for ourselves and for others.  
 
The junc tion between the past and the future is the 
present. The present has a very important role in our 
lives. That is really where our lives occur. What is in the 
past is no longer occurring. What is in the future hasn’t 
occurred yet. Here is where it really oc curs. This is 
where you can make a difference.  
 
You can make a difference here and now by having a 
vision , an intention , a sense of being inspired by what’s 
possible. Without that possibility of being inspired by 
what’s possib le – if all we have is  just about being 
present and having no desires  – that’s a great way of 
becoming depressed.  
 
So, those are my thoughts.
