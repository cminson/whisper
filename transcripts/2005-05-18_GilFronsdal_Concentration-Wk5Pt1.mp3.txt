 So this is our last concentration class. I thought I would talk a little bit first, and then we do a sitting, and I'll talk some more, and then you can have a period of questions about all this, if you'd like. So earlier in this class, did I talk about the beeswax analogy that I use sometimes? Some of you might have heard it elsewhere, but did I talk about it here in the class? You've heard it somewhere else, right? In the class here? Yeah, but in this class here? In the concentration class? I did it recently on Sunday or Monday, but I don't know if I did it on... No? In the concentration class? I gave a whole talk about that on maybe Sunday or Monday. But was it here? I might have given it here also. Anyway, I repeat myself a lot, so it's a problem. Remembering where I say what? So anyway, those of you who have heard it will forgive me, and those of you who haven't heard it will be enlightened. So my son, in his kindergarten, when he was in kindergarten, he had this beeswax that they would play with, and when they got to school, the beeswax would be hard and cold, and the first thing they'd be taught to do is to hold the beeswax in their hand, and they'd rub it in their hand, just hold it in their hand, and their own body heat would slowly soften the beeswax, and once it got soft enough, then you could work it and shape it and make it into something. And if you tried to take the beeswax and shape it into something when it's still hard, you basically would probably break into pieces. You'd hammer it and it'd shatter or something. And so the same idea applies to the mind. If the mind is hard and cold, you want to be very careful that you don't use a hammer to it, or you don't want to push too hard, because it'll just break. But you want to first help the heart, the mind, become soft or relaxed or at ease. And I've known people who have engaged in meditation practice, both mindfulness practice and concentration practice, and because of their own personality or their own neurosis, or because of the way that the particular tradition or the particular teacher they practiced with taught, they sat down and right away they were expected to just bear down or really apply themselves in some hard way or direct way and really be very, very vigilant. And I've seen many people whose minds were hard, that approach being unproductive at the best. And sometimes I've seen people's minds break, shatter. In extreme situations people have gone long retreats and weren't really ready for the kind of approach that wasn't taught at the retreat. And they just pushed and pushed and pushed. And it just wasn't productive, because the beeswax of the mind wasn't soft enough yet. And so one of the very important issues in meditation practice is how do you get the mind soft enough so that it can do the work of getting concentrated. If you try to develop a laser-like concentration first, when the mind is hard, you might accomplish it to some degree, but it's probably not going to be very useful. Or if you don't accomplish it and you keep pushing and pushing and pushing against it, something might give. And as I said, on long retreats I've seen people whose minds have given, and sometimes it's not very pretty, because they're just pushing beyond what the mind can do. So it's very important to have a softness, to soften. And there's a variety of things a person needs to do, or could do, in order to create a certain softness, a certain kind of acceptance, a certain kind of ease, a certain level of relaxation, a certain level of well-being that allows for the mind to get concentrated. And one of the classic practices is loving-kindness practice. Loving-kindness practice is also a concentration practice, so some people will use that as the means for getting concentrated. They'll do a lot of loving-kindness practice. But loving-kindness practice is also one of these following practices, softening practices. And a lot of people who will spend five or ten minutes at the beginning of every sitting doing loving-kindness practice, so that they're going to create the right conditions for being able to do the other work. Each individual person is going to have to sort out and find out for themselves what is the appropriate way to, or what's the right timing and way to develop concentration or focus on concentration practice, and when is the right time to do something else, to do forgiveness practice perhaps, or to do loving-kindness practice, or maybe to forget about meditation for a while. Known people have done this, and rather, very diligently, very devotedly, worked on their ethics, on their sila. It's called sila, because it's hard to get deeply concentrated without some degree of ethical integrity. There's one teaching, I don't know how anybody knows this for sure, maybe there's a way to know it for sure, but there's one teaching that says that you cannot reach access concentration, which we talked about last week, unless your ethics is in good shape. So for some people, that's what gets in the way of being able to go further, so they have to kind of maybe stop meditating, or maybe not stop, but go off and do, you know, and really focus on their ethical behavior and get that cleaned up. For some people, it's a lot of self-forgiveness, a lot of compassion. For some people, it's just being relaxed, being at ease about what the meditation is about, not sitting down right away and thinking it's supposed to be, you know, have this adamantine concentration just immediately. My approach often, which I never would admit to some of my teachers in Asia, was I would sit down the first five, ten minutes of sitting, I would be quite relaxed about it. I'd just kind of sit there and let my mind wander. My teacher, I know he expected it as soon as he sat down, you were supposed to have notes right away and be on top of every single thing that happened. I knew people who adopted his approach, and they kind of broke because of it. But I found it was very helpful, just the first five, ten minutes of a sitting with him. I was very relaxed and just let my mind kind of float and settle. I had no agendas for my mind, I wasn't trying to do anything, and I wasn't trying to do any particular kind of practice to kind of be present. And what that did for me is it allowed me to settle and relax. The particular kind of mind I had, that was really helpful to kind of settle out. And then after that five or ten minutes, then my mind was soft enough to do the work that the teacher wanted me to do. And it worked just great for me. So when you sit down to meditate, do concentration practice or mindfulness practice, one of the first things you might want to do is to just kind of take stock of where you actually are. So we say often you start where you are. You just take stock where you are, and then what does it take for you to somehow become settled in who you are, or not be in conflict with who you are at that moment, or somehow have some sense of goodwill or some sense of well-being about just how you are right now. And so there's a variety of things you might do, as I say. You might do some loving kindness practice or forgiveness practice, or you might just do a very broad acceptance practice. Everything's okay, it's all cool, man. Everything's fine. And do that for a while, and just kind of get yourself settled and relaxed. Or you might use imagery, especially if you're doing concentration practice. And there's a variety of images you can use. There's images, for example, of sitting like a mountain. And some people like it, classic ones. Imagine yourself like a solid, like a mountain. And that stability can help people. Or imagine yourself like a really calm, placid, peaceful alpine lake, some lake or water that's really peaceful. Somehow imagining the mind is like that. And maybe that's helpful to kind of settle things. Or maybe imagine yourself kind of enveloped in a soft cotton blanket. So you kind of feel enveloped and kind of contained. In the monasteries, I learned this in the Zen monasteries, people would sit in sitting robes. So the robes in Zen monasteries went from one set to go some shoulders all the way down to the legs. And when you sit down to meditate, it's kind of like your whole body is kind of held or contained within this nice robe. And it's not divided with a belt. You have two different pieces of clothes. And that's feeling of being completely contained within the same garment that creates a nice container. I think for many people, a very nice environment within which to sit with the body, to feel the body, to be embodied, to be here. So to even just imagine that kind of being held in some way. Some people like to do it initially when they first start sitting, to think about things that inspire them. And there's again a classic Buddhist teaching at the beginning of a sitting, to maybe think about the qualities of a Buddha, or qualities of teachers you know who have really inspired you, or qualities of the Dharma. If you have some sense of what the Dharma is, or the possibilities of Dharma practice, to reflect on those possibilities. Or reflect about people who practice who have really good virtue, really good ethics, and kind of use that reflection. Contemplation is a way of kind of getting you settled and here. And rather than being fragmented or still thinking about conversations you had earlier in the day, or whatever else you might be doing. All this kind of preparation is to help you arrive and be here. And here in a soft way, not in a hard way, not forcing yourself, not fighting yourself to be here, but rather to be here and not be in conflict with being here. So what does it take to do that? And in different sittings, different things, different things will take different things. Now sometimes what it takes is just mindfulness. You've got to discover what it is and just kind of do a lot of mindfulness. And mindfulness itself can be a very accepting practice. So to soften the beeswax of the mind, that's the first kind of first task. Some people can just go straight into doing a concentration practice in the breath that's what they do right away. And the way they do it, that itself softens the mind and develops a concentration. You don't have to do anything extra to do it. It just comes along with the practice. And some people find it best to do something else to get started. So I thought we would do a sitting now. And perhaps would someone volunteer to recite the metasuta as part of the sitting? Anybody like to do it today? Okay, so what I'd like you to do is I'd like to get everybody settled in, the eyes closed. That's great. That's fine. Yeah, so he'll do a different version than I passed out. So I'll take a couple minutes to get everyone settled. And then you can keep your eyes open and when I nod to you, then you can recite it. And everybody else, when you listen to this in your meditative space, kind of take it in. Do you know how to chant it? You want to chant it? Okay, she's going to chant it. So you can take in both the chant and the feeling of it and the words and somehow take in the metasuta. See if you can take it in in such a way that it inspires you, it settles you, it helps you to be here in a kind way, in a friendly way. You're really here. It's kind of like bringing you in, it's pulling you in, it's anchoring you as it happens. So sitting upright, an alert posture, and quietly closing your eyes, and taking a few moments to feel your body here. This is a time and place where your lived experience is. What is your lived and your lived experience happens through the vehicle of your body, being in your body, feeling it. And then taking a few soft but long deep breaths. And as you exhale, relaxing and settling in. So laying your breath, return to normal. Perhaps feeling the area around your chest, your heart. And as you breathe in and out, you massage the area of your heart a little bit to soften. And then perhaps as if there are ears in your chest, in your heart, listen to the chanting of the metasuta. This is what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace. Let them be able and upright, straightforward and gentle in speech, humble and not conceited, contented and easily satisfied, unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways, peaceful and calm and wise and skillful, not proud and demanding in nature. Let them not do the slightest thing that the wise would later reprove, wishing in gladness and in safety, may all beings be at ease, whatever living beings there may be. Whether they are weak or strong, omitting none, a great or the mighty, medium short or small, the seen and the unseen, those living near and far away, those born and to be born, may all beings be at ease. Let none deceive another or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another, even as a mother protects with her life, her child, her only child, so with a boundless heart, should one cherish all living beings, radiating kindness over the entire world, spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths, outwards and unbounded, freed from hatred and ill will, whether standing or walking, seated or lying down, free from drowsiness, one should sustain this recollection. This is said to be the sublime abiding, by not holding to fixed views, the pure hearted one, having clarity of vision, being freed from all sense desires, is not born again into this world. So . . . . To make the mind broad, flat, peaceful, relaxing the energy behind the things you're thinking about, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, The tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it, the tension behind it. Connecting to your breathing. Feel your breath. And then see if you can begin to steady the awareness on the breathing. Stabilize the awareness on the breathing. So you're there to feel each breath. In breath, the out breath. Letting everything else kind of recede to the background. And letting there be as continuous contact with the breath as you can. And since the breathing is an alternating phenomenon, alternating sensations of breathing in and out, expanding and contracting, maybe it'll help you to imagine that that alternation is like a massage that's working the attention, working the concentration, working the continuity. It's very, very gentle, very relaxed. Keeping the mind at ease, peaceful, soft. But with a real commitment or firmness to stay with the breath, one breath after the other. Perhaps there's some way that you can let go into the breath. There can be a letting go into the experience of breathing so it becomes more the only thing happening. You're sinking into it, disappearing in it, becoming the breathing. Is there some way you can give yourself over more to connecting to the breath, staying with the breath? Maybe there's a certain kind of inner strength that you can muster up. But it's not tense, but a strength which keeps you more fully with the breath. And counting the breath if that's helpful. And then continuing with the breath in a relaxed way. Notice when there happens, when pleasant or unpleasant experience occurs for you, when something unpleasant or something pleasant happens. Notice if there's any grasping or pushing away. Or is there any movement of reaction to the pleasant or unpleasantness, however subtle. Or is it just there, a quantum miss about its presence? And the stillness that you have, whatever calm that you have, can then help you to see quicker, more precisely, the difference between the pleasantness of something and your reaction to it. The unpleasantness of something and your reaction to it. In the last minute or so of the sitting, review what that sitting was like for you, in a very matter of fact way. How it was for you to sit and what you might learn about your sitting, that maybe you want to remember for next time you sit.
