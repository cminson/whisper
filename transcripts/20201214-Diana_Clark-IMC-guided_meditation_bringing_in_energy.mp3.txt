The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening and a really, really warm welcome.
I'm trying to think of something original to say.
Often saying how happy I am to be here to practice together,
but it's what's on my heart at this moment, how nice it is to be here,
to share the Dharma.
And so we'll begin with a guided meditation.
I tend not to do a lot of guiding, just a little bit in the beginning,
leaving plenty of silence at the end.
So taking an alert upright posture,
and at the same time with this alertness,
maybe there's some settling in, settling down, both with the body and with the mind.
Just arriving in this moment,
maybe wiggling a little bit in the seat to find a comfortable posture.
It's worthwhile to take the time to find a comfortable posture,
one that can be sustained without too much difficulty.
We can do a little bit of a global check in with the body.
How does it feel now, in a global general sense?
Maybe there's a sense of delight or some feeling of relief.
Oh, I finally get to sit.
Maybe there's just a general sense of tiredness.
Oh, I guess I have to sit now.
However it might be, can we tune into the bodily experience right now?
In a general, maybe vague or diffuse way.
And allowing whatever is being shown to us, whatever is noticed.
Can we welcome that?
Can we allow that?
After all, it is the truth of the moment, the reality of this moment.
And then shifting from the more generalized global sense of how the body is,
to maybe some more specific areas of the body that are calling for attention.
Noticing what's obvious.
Maybe the pressure against the body, where the body meets the chair, cushioned floor.
Or more subtle bodily experiences.
If the mind has a certain amount of stillness,
maybe we can feel the more subtle places that are associated with breathing.
Or if the mind is still not quite settled, which would not be surprising.
Or clear, obvious, strong places of breathing.
The chest, or the abdomen, or the nose.
Or maybe the back, feeling the subtle movement in the back muscles associated with breathing.
Maybe the shoulders move, just a little bit with each breath.
Wherever we're noticing the sensations of breathing,
can we just gently rest our attention there?
And when we find that we're lost in thoughts, just very simply, gently begin again.
So feel, thank you so much.
Tuning into the sensations of breathing.
Now let me use the music.
This is the 3rd bags and next to my favorite bag.
I'm bringing a warmth, a kindness, an open-heartedness.
To the experience, especially when we discover that we've been lost in thought.
We don't have to make it a problem, we just then receive the sensations of
breathing into awareness in a receptive warm manner.
Sometimes when the mind starts to settle, there can be a little bit of a dullness.
Maybe it feels like being in a fluffy cloud or something caught in me.
At first it might feel a little bit pleasant, but there's also something unpleasant about the
dullness. So sometimes called like a sinking mind. It's not jumping around, but it's not
really attentive either. In order to help bring some brightness, some clarity, some
nimbleness to the mind when it's in a dull state, we can bring in just a little bit of
investigation. What is this state like in a relaxed, easy way? What is the quality of
the mind? Is it expansive, or is it lacking sharpness, lacking clarity?
Bringing in this investigation is a way to bring energy and to help balance
the settledness. So that the quieting of the mind doesn't lead into more like a stupor
or some state that's closer to sleep than to meditation. Just a little bit of investigation
can help bring the energy in. What is this?
