 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. Good morning, friends. Welcome again to the morning meditation in Dharamat. And I'm happy to be having another day with you. And if you've been following along, you probably have surmised that I'm going to talk about the fire element today. And we'll do a guided meditation with that. I wanted to start by naming, especially sitting here at this moment in time and the end of this summer, the complexity of our relationship with the elements. It's not all roses, so to speak. We're very aware with the fire element, with the fires that have been burning, with the amount of smoke, even if you're not nearby that you've had. The people, probably many of us know, I do, people whose houses have burned and the vast swaths of forest. And to acknowledge this, these elements are powerful. The earth shakes. The waters flood. The fires burn. When we stand in face of these elements and see the power of them, there's can be, it's a huge sense of awe that comes through us. And it's interesting having this, the enormity of the elements, the power of them, and to recognize that these same elements flow through us. We are not separate from that. And a certain portion of that power is flowing through us as well. We're in conversation with that. And this is even more evident when we sort of feel into climate change and the way every, all the elements are being amplified. And we, as human beings, are very much in relationship with that. We are an expression of the elements and we are affecting the elements. And whether we sense it on a very grand scale, you know, standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon and looking in and seeing the power of water and earth and the physical result of that, or whether you taste a summer tomato and feel the sun and the earth in it, the elements are expressing themselves all around us in these subtle and powerful ways. And as we touch in and practice with the elements, we're being invited into this full complexity of, from the very subtle sensations in our body to the grand expressions that are around us. I will say for myself that I live where I do in the desert, in Utah, partially because I really enjoy the dramatic expression of the elements, the fiery sun and the earth rising up dramatically and the intensity of the wind and the storms when they come. There is a potency and aliveness when we meet that rawness of the elements. And it can be terrifying as well. That word awe includes both of those. So I want to name that as we move into practicing with the fire element, the complexity and the breath of the experience that we have with them. So please go ahead and find your meditation, your comfortable meditation posture. And I'd like to begin by reading a quite a very wonderful quote from John Seed and Joanna Macy speaking about fire. Fire from our sun that fuels all life, drawing up plants and raising the waters to the sky to fall again, replenishing. The inner furnace of our metabolism burns with the fire of the Big Bang that first sent matter energy spinning through space and time. And the same fire as the lightning that flashed in the primordial soup, catalyzing the birth of organic life. You were there. I was there. For each cell of our bodies is descended in an unbroken chain from that event. Allowing your body, sensing it, feel it in contact with the earth. Scan through and find many places of tension and let this pull, this connection with the earth. Let it be here. Let yourself rest into it. You can touch in to the other elements as we begin. Feel the weight and heaviness of your body. Feel the contact with the ground and the ground beneath you. Feel the wateriness of your body as you soften, as you bring attention to different parts of the body and the little micro-movements of the softening, allowing the water element to come from frozen into its softer, more liquid form. The rigidity of the body being released. Letting the spine stand tall with the earth element, the solidity holding you up, and the softness of the water. And then beginning to allow yourself to come into contact with the fire element. First sensing very simply and directly the places of heat, of warmth, and of cool on your body. Perhaps there's places where the clothes, the warmth of certain parts that are in contact with more protection, and then the exposure of perhaps feet or hands or face. Letting yourself also feel internally the warmth, the warmth in your belly. The warmth in your chest. This fire element that comes, that comes from our sun, the sun heating the ground, the plants photosynthesizing, the energy accumulating. And as the energy accumulates, and then we eat it, we take in that energy. We're running on sun fuel, the warmth of the sun warming us, energizing us. The warmth comes from the outside, from the sun, heating the earth. We can feel it on our skin, and we can feel it from the inside, the sun transformed into energy taken in, used with movement and digestion, keeping it all alive and then dissipating. This element of fire is constantly changing, warm to cool, cool to warm as it passes through. Constantly in a state of disintegration as well, this food comes in, the energy is used and dissipated, released and gone. Feeling the sun in your belly. And this energy also in our heart, we feel the sense of fire, of passion in our heart, there's a heat, a warmth of our heart. It's like there's a line going from sun to heart to molten earth down below us, from molten to molten, our hearts here in the middle. And somehow you too are part, as John C. said, part of that big bang, the energy of the universe, the heat of it is in your body, temporarily being expressed, and just like the sun burning itself, burning itself out, but burning brightly. You might also sense in yourself the urges, the urge to move, the urge to do things, the passion for life, for things that you care about. This heatedness of us, this is an expression too, of the fire element as it expresses itself enough. The sun, the energy, the warmth and cool flowing through us, we are part of this vast exchange of the fire element. No inside, no outside, simply fire element, passing through, combining with other elements and being released. Feel the change, where cool thin heat change directly on your skin, in your belly, how it changes energetically in your heart. In the restlessness and calm with your body. If there is something in your life that is present and agitating you or eliciting passion or compassion, let yourself feel the fire aspect of it. You don't need to go into the content, but let yourself feel. Now this too is the fire element. Let yourself tune to the fire element, however it's showing up most clearly to you. Letting it flow and change, coming and going, fire element, simply moving through. Fire Cool. Where do you sense warmth and cool now? In your skin, in your belly, in your heart. Coming, going, changing. Is there fire in some way or are you more tuned to the absence of fire? The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet. The cooling, the quiet.
