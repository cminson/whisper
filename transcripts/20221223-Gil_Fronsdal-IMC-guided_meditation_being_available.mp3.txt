Hello everyone, and I'm happy to be
able to share this week on right effort. I think it's a really an essential
area of practice, and easy to overlook, easy to think of effort as being
somehow effortful in a stressful way. But there's also effortless effort. And so
for today, for the meditation, I would like to emphasize that when we're going
to do something, encounter something, engage in something, make some effort
perhaps, and to do something important. If it's important enough, we prepare
ourselves for the event. And someone who is playing a sport might warm up first
and prepare themselves for it. A musician might do the same thing, prepare
themselves for performance. Someone might going to give an important speech,
they might breathe deeply, or calm, or be quiet for themselves for a while, to
gather themselves together, to prepare themselves for what they're going to do.
So this idea that we prepare ourselves is a common part of human life. And maybe
in part, a big part of meditation, especially when we start, but is
preparing ourselves so that we are available. Available for what? Available
for life. The alternative to being available is to go ahead long into our
desires, our wanting, trying to make something happen, trying to assert
ourselves. And but to be available is a little bit to get out of our own way.
A little bit to make room beyond our opinions, our ideas, what should be, how
things are supposed to happen. To be available is a very different stance or
way than to assert ourselves. And one of the things we can become available for
is we can become available to what wants to emerge, what is arising here. And in
particular, be attuned to what feels healthy, what feels good, what feels
wholesome, what feels beneficial. What is it that arises? If what arises when we
are available are difficult things, difficult emotions that might need to
arise, there can sometimes be a sense of goodness or rightness in allowing them
space. And that availability, the wholesomeness is the receptivity, the
compassion, the care in which we open to receive what's difficult within. But also
what can arise is something really good. And maybe the goodness, the rightness of
just being available is so wonderful, the energy of availability. So this being
available is the theme of the meditation today. So assuming a upright
meditation posture, and gently closing your eyes, and to prepare yourself for
this meditation, or to prepare yourself for an encounter, a meeting with a
phenomenally important person, and that person is yourself, but to prepare
yourself as if you're an important and valuable and someone that you care for
and love, how would you make yourself available to sit and be present with this
important person? So maybe you would take a posture that's not collapsed, not
receding too much, but really showing that you're here and present, that you're a
posture of being available. And with the eyes closed, to take some long slow
deep breaths, and as you exhale, see if you can let go of other thoughts and
concerns that might get in the way of being available for what's here, letting
your breathing return to normal, taking a few breaths to continue the
preparations by relaxing your body.
The more the body is at ease, the more we have to be available with greater
sensitivity, attentiveness, more space to feel the fullness of our life. And then
rather than focusing on breathing, how would it be different if your awareness
was available to the experience of breathing, to be available?
And when the mind wanders off in thought, in that, wondering off, we're no longer
available for our immediate experience of breathing, of body, of here and now. When
you notice you're wandered off in thought, re-establish a sense of being
available with your awareness, with attention, not to assert yourself or
require something to happen, but to see what emerges, what wants to come, what's
here. Allow things that are good to come into full awareness. But don't get lost
by them, don't get caught by them, so that the sense of availability to what's
next is eclipsed. Keep staying open, available.
With awareness available,
might there be some feeling of wholesomeness, goodness, pleasure in the
sense of availability itself? Available, attention which is available for the
present moment.
The sense of awareness available to experience can be supported by imagining
there's lots of space here in awareness for things to arise, where the
difficult things are easier with all the space around them, and the beneficial
things have space to grow. Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
Allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully.
And as we come to the end of this sitting to take some gentle deeper breaths, there's
a way of expanding or returning to a sense of being available to our present moment experience,
whatever it might be. Availability, sense of availability that does take some kind of
effort, but maybe it's closer to an effortless effort than an effortful one.
And then to bring this meditation to an end, if your care and connection to others arose
out of this sense of availability, where there's no resistance or no assertion,
no obligation, no protection,
just available for oneself and for others, what would the nature of your kindness,
your care, your love be in such a circumstance, and perhaps with that as a reference point
to give some thoughts, think about it in your own way, of goodwill, well-wishing for others.
Who do you have goodwill and well-wishing for?
How do you want your goodwill and well-wishing to go out into the world?
May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful,
may all beings be free, and may my goodwill be available for all beings.
Thank you.
