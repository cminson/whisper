Dharmette: Begin Again

There was the past.  There will be the future. There is 
the present.  
 
Sometimes , we forget that the past was. In English , it is 
probably more grammatically correct to sa y the past is. 
But the past was;  the future will be ; and the present is 
what is. Sometimes , we carry with us the history, the 
ideas of what happened in the past . Sometimes there 
are powerful memor ies. We then  see the present  
through the memories of what happened , and to some 
degree through the c onditioning of the past . We 
evaluate our life.  
 
Sometimes  we are focused on the future. The future will 
always be an imagination. Some people have vivid 
imaginations, and can envision  all kinds of futures. 
Sometimes that future is so big and so heavy that it has 
a significant  impact on how we live now. Sometimes the 
imagined future is dreadful  – all these terrible things that 
are going to happen. Sometimes we imagine a future 
where all of these  wonderful things  are going to happen.  
For example , “I’m going to be come Mr.  Universe. It’ll be 
great when I buff up , and I live in the world of what that will be like.”  
 
But it is also a big burden to spend a lot of time carrying 
the past with us.  It is a big burden to inv ent the future 
and live by it. Things can be a lot easier if we are more 
in the present. There is a particular way of being in the 
present that I have found  very meaningful , which is that 
– probably much more often than you realize  – you get 
to start over in the present. You get to start all over 
again!  
 
When I was living at the Zen m onastery in Tassajara, I 
worked in the kitchen for a year. After a while, I 
understood somethin g about practicing in the ki tchen.  
Depending on the time of year, we had to make 
between three and six meals per day. There were 
anywhere from forty to one hundred people w ho would 
eat those meals. That’s  a lot of people who won’t  like 
you if you screw up with the food  [laughs] . Sometimes 
the meals we made  would work out. Sometimes they 
wouldn’ t. There was always food.  After a while of doing 
this, I discovered that I wasn ’t fired, which was nice. I 
discovered that each day, when I woke up, I got to try 
again. Every day was a new beginning. That was 
yesterday  that we burned the rice. “Oh! Today w e get to 
try again. ” It’s a new beginning. There is  food left 
behind. It’s either in the compost or in the toilet. 
Wherever food goes , it’s gone. Now, we get to start  
again with a whole new recipe, a  whole new batch of rice. The idea is starting fresh, to wake up and start 
again.  
 
Over my lifetime, I’ve had difficult rela tionships with 
some people at times. Sometimes  these thing s work 
themselves out in wonderful ways. Thinking back, o ne 
of the ways I am really fond o f, is relationships in which 
we made a decision to just start over  again. “Let’s just 
start over. Today. Let’s just start all new. Let’s not bring 
with us what happened in t he past. We’r e not going to 
sort it out. We’ re not going to figure it out. Let’s just start 
fresh.” And so we did. It was nice and very interesting t o 
start over.  
 
The present moment is a place  where , more often than 
you realize, you get to start all over . The n ext step is a 
new life – unless  you bring with you all of the memories, 
ideas, past experiences , and associations. You don’t 
want to forget about those things , because maybe then 
you’ll do foolish things again. Maybe you’ve done a few 
foolish things in your life , and you’ve learned. The idea  
is, that this moment here is fresh. You can start over 
again , and take the next step.  
 
Some people  can imagine  hearing  sounds and seeing  
colors. I sort of envy them. There are certain kinds of 
brains that work in certain ways . Maybe I have a 
peculiar brain , but I have a physical sense of the 
passing of time. It’s almost a physical feeling , seeing the future arriving. This ne xt moment is  just a big, open, 
vast expanse.  This next time. It’s always coming. It’s 
always starting over again. Here. This new thing.  
 
This idea of starting over again was very important for 
me when I was in  the monastery in Tassajara. A s a 
young person , I was trying to figure out what to do with 
my life. I spent a lot of time in my head thinking about 
my life, my future, what I was supposed to do. Should I 
do service work in some way and help the world?  
Shou ld I stay in the monastery? It was actually painful 
for me to spend the year  there . Mostly I thought about 
this on my days off.  On the monastic days ‘on,’ I was 
distracted from that  particular  suffering. But o n the days 
off, I was no longe r distracted. Alo ne, I spent a lot of 
time thinking and wondering. At some point , I realized 
that I was living in an abstract world . I was living in a 
world of imaginary futures, imaginary activities 
elsewhere.  It had nothing to do with the concreteness of 
the life that I was living. I couldn’t find my way anymore 
in this abstract thinking. One day , I made the decision 
that I would start over. I  would just take the next step: 
the next thing that came my way. That  was a turning 
point in my life – to start all over again. It was a peculiar 
place to start over for the next step because it was a 
Zen monastery. Maybe that was a good choice. If I had 
made that choice at a bar  [laugh ter], I don’t know where 
I would be to day. Maybe you ought  to be careful where 
you start fresh. I took the next step. In some ways, my life since then  has become more complicated , but to 
some degree, it has been the next step, the next step , 
and building on that.   
 
Even though it builds on that, more often than not, when 
I wake up, I still feel that I get to start all over again. I 
get to start over again with my practice. I get to start 
over again with my life. Let’s see what’s happening 
today.  What’s this now ?  
 
I don’t think I carry the past with me so much . I am more 
interested in the next step. The idea of the next step is 
so wonderful. Far in the future is kind of pale. But the 
immediate future that is coming now  is so full of 
potential. Take that next step , and meet tha t… and 
meet that … and meet that. There is something great 
about meeting that  next step. That’s the opportunity of  
the present moment. It’s no t just a matter of living  in the 
present moment , but you can be in the present moment 
enough that you can start over.  
 
Maybe , from time to time , you make a mistake , you 
have a regret, or  you have some difficulty  or challenge  
that seems too big. You can just take the next step , and 
you don’t have to carry  the burden of the past with you . 
You can take the next step , and not worry so much how 
tall the mountain is. Just the next step. Start over. 
Maybe starting over will give you your freedom.  
 So, those are my thoughts for today. I hope you have a 
good  beginning.
