 Wonderful weather, isn't it? I thought the most amazing thing about the windstorm was not that it blew so hard and so many things went down, but that there was anything left. Wake up in the morning and you think everything must be flattened, but actually, nearly everything is still quite all right. Angie, could you get one closer to the microphone? Get it closer to me? Yes. How's that? Better. Even closer. Even closer. Intimate. Yeah. It's better. It's better than that. In a way, our practice is all about mind, isn't it? Or mind-body or body-mind. It's an incarnational practice, but it's a practice of bringing mind and body into alignment, you could say. In meditation, the mind is all-inclusive. If someone comes late and we hear the door or someone's banging outside or the blue jays or yelling in the trees, that's all a part of our meditation. We accept it. It lives in our belly. I always think the sounds that we hear in sitting are heard down here somewhere, deep, deep inside us. And always the question is, what happens when we, what is it when we stand up and start moving around and driving the car and answering back? And then the mind creates all kinds of very fancy distinctions about what we like and what we don't like. Somewhere it's said that our attachments and thus our dismay comes because we're always trying to maintain what we like or make things better. Our whole society is based on this kind of mind, on the principle of dissatisfaction. We're supposed to be dissatisfied with, if not our life, then our self. And with that dissatisfaction we can be promised that if we just get the right kind of toothpaste or shampoo that we'll be much better people. Linda talked a lot about satisfaction, about how to be satisfied. It's a very delicate subject because it's very easy to take it as, I always think of a cocker spaniel, where they lie down with their paws up and surrender to everything and everyone willing to be walked on. But true satisfaction is about how to face what's really happening with a flexible mind. When we sit we accept, when we're driving the car and somebody cuts in front of us, we're quick. And it's a different kind of mind, a kind of poison of anger. And yet it's really only a matter of being able to see how things work and being patient enough to train ourselves how to see and how to be. I don't have to get mad at the fellow who cuts in front of me. There are all kinds of different ways of seeing that very situation. And actually every situation that we're in in our life is like that. There are many, many different ways of looking at each occasion. Much of our automatic reaction is about survival. I think these days we're all thinking a lot about survival. It's become a very big subject. And it's easier to see how our reactions are often based on that. It's not so easy to see that often that's a mistake. My favorite example is the siege of Leningrad. When there was no way to get any kind of supplies, food or warmth, everything was shut off. And this whole city of people began in the freezing cold of the Russian winter to die. And some people went to bed and got under the covers to stay warm. And some people went out and got to work and did whatever they possibly could to help the whole situation. The ones who went to bed died. Isn't that interesting? And many of the ones who went to work survived. There's a very big teaching in that story. I met with a friend of mine yesterday who came up with a moral dilemma. In her church, the assistant priest and her husband offered to give her a deal on fixing up her kitchen floor. The husband was a tile layer. And they said, oh, we will help you. And my friend thought, oh, well, then I can help them. That's a nice exchange because they need the work and I've got the work to be done. So it was a completely mutual and full of loving kindness kind of relationship that started out that way. By the time it was over, it was a disaster. The tile layer actually replaced the tiles with much cheaper ones than she had meant to buy that were ragged on the edges. So when he grouted them, everything is all a mess. And when she complained about it, he sent her another bill and said, you even owe me more money than you've already paid me. And it just got messier and messier and messier. And yesterday she was saying, what shall I do? I've got this other bill and maybe they'll get me arrested if I don't pay it. She was very upset. And I was thinking then of all the different ways of reacting to that. If you get very, very exercised about it and very judgmental about it and figure out all kinds of really mean ways of dealing with it. But often the best way of dealing with any situation between us is to give way. She's lost the friendship in the process of all of this, but she's stayed true. And she was realizing yesterday that she could continue to stay true and just keep faith with the situation, keep faith with herself and not make a drama out of it. It's very hard not to make a drama sometimes. Very hard not to rise up in kind of disturbed emotion, twirling around in the excitement of it. The most telling story I know about this is what I heard on the radio, maybe you did to last week, I think with Terry Gross, a woman who has written her memoirs of what it was like to be an adolescent in Auschwitz. Very, very touching. And one thing she said, walks around with me, she said as they were tattooing the number on her, she stood there at the age of 14 and she thought, this is an amazing situation. This is such an incredible and horrible and amazing situation. I must pay very close attention so I can tell about it when I get out. It's the same kind of mind as the ones in Leningrad who stayed out of bed. A kind of mind of being willing to meet the situation as it is. Not as a doormat but as something awake. That's what Buddha means. Buddha means awake. So satisfaction is a funny word in the sense of Auschwitz. You can't say she was happy to be there. She knew how awful it was and what was happening. But she was willing, willing to be her situation with the widest and most generous kind of mind. Once in sitting we achieve a kind of peace. In a Zen metaphor it's like being a little boat in the middle of the ocean. And all you can see for your whole view, wherever you look, it's just one big beautiful ocean from horizon to horizon. Very very peaceful. But Dogen Zenji says that if you examine it closely, the air and the sky, you see that there are worlds and worlds and worlds in them. In the sky there's the world of spiders that actually fly all the way across the ocean. Air flies do too. Albatrosses go out thousands of miles across the ocean skimming the waves. And if you look inside the ocean, he says it's just palaces, huge palaces where many many many different kinds of beings are living their life. And each drop of water actually there are many many beings living their life. And so this willingness and agreeableness also has in it a necessity to be willing to know how little we know. And it's one of the wonders of continuing in life. If you think about it superficially you'd think well at some time we would get it. We'd get everything that we needed anyway and then we could just stop. But it's not like that. Worlds within worlds and little by little different worlds open up to us. So even very old people are still extremely interested in what's going to happen next and what that new thing is that never occurred to them before. It's carrying the mind of meditation into our everyday life. It's Thich Nhat Hanh's walking meditation where everything is included and everything is revealing itself. Bringing itself to our new mind, our not knowing mind. Not knowing someone said is most intimate. I used to think when I was first practicing how there must be an overall picture for all of this. There must be some way to see it all and to live it all. But alas we're so limited and there isn't any all in that sense. There's just moment by moment and piece by piece and breath by breath. We talk about upright sitting and in the same way we can talk about upright living. Just to stand up and be present and find a kind of enjoyment. Not in the sense that everything is lovely. It certainly wasn't lovely in Auschwitz or Leningrad but things are the way they are. Coming and going. I think that's enough. You must have some questions and comments. It's different in every situation. In her situation she decided that she would pay the second bill because it wasn't very much and let them have the points or however that works with the balance of it and just give way. If it had been thousands of dollars it probably would have been a different situation. It seems like in most situations if we can gracefully give way and allow the other person enough margin that it smells sweeter in the end. It's a very good question and that's what I meant about not being a doormat. You have to take care of yourself. She had already taken care of herself by cutting off her relationship with them and hiring somebody else to finish the job. She was already okay. I'm glad you brought it up because it did sound like she was just disappearing herself and that is not the point. Thank you. I'm wondering in certain situations like afterwards I've heard that there are people who aren't awake but who for whatever reason psychologically they cut off. They just disassociate for survival reasons because it is too much for them to take in. I'm wondering about that given the whole philosophy of Buddhism to be awake at all times or that's kind of the ideal. There's a big question about that that often comes up in sitting groups about that very thing about how easy it is to simply go away somewhere just to cut off our attention so that we don't have to be overwhelmed by what's happening. It's a psychotic state actually and a big problem for people. Many traumatized people in wars or in difficult childhoods have that proclivity all through the rest of their lives of shutting out rather than being present. Given the assumption that very painful difficult situations are unbearable, it seems to me that we never are able to take in everything and that if we try not to take in anything that we're making a big mistake about our life. That our life wants to live itself in its situation. We are our world and if we dissociate ourselves from our world then there's nothing. It's like death. I'm thinking of the people I know who had very difficult childhoods and are still having when they sit find themselves going off into this never never land that isn't sitting. Sitting is being here where we are and who we are in this body, in this place. I think that dissociation is very temporarily helpful. Maybe like going to bed in Leningrad after a long day's work but then getting up again and going out and facing it so it doesn't become a habitual state of mind to be in. Does that make sense? It does, thank you. Actually I was talking about this with a friend last night who went to a retreat recently in Oxford. I guess they give things to him. They do, yes. He was telling me about it and how intense it was for him to be there and meditate. We were talking about there were certain survivors there that he was talking to. I was just thinking how can we really be awake so to speak in terms of wanting to be present or something like that. I think the answer that I heard you say maybe it wasn't quite the meditate but it's kind of the middle way. Obviously you can't be present for a few moments because it's too much but try as much as possible to be there. The other thing about it is the whole practice of compassion and refuge. If we make that the kind of foundation of our practice then it's much easier to meet whatever is our world. If we're always defending ourselves and protecting ourselves it's much harder. But with the heart of compassion then we can meet others' pain without feeling obliterated by it. You told us seemingly to me very wise things about our fundraising and various things as we're moving forward here. Now we're really ready to move forward it looks like. Congratulations. I was wondering what you might say about your experience in the process of moving into a home. I don't know if Jekoji was land, kind of in a highway of love or what it was that he got there or any other times when you kind of here we are remodeling a building. Without getting into holy wars over the color of the carpeting, whether it's got every single possible filament that it needs to have to avoid mobilization. You could get into very very many levels but make sure that we're also getting people's input but getting things done. Yeah, very tricky. When we moved in I can't even use our experience to help you. There were sixty people living on that land and tucked back up into the hills in little huts and geodesic domes and cabins and some of them were Vietnam vets who had not made it back and they were still in a very bad way. They were drug crazed hippies and runaway kids from all over the rest of USA. It was a mess and so we didn't have any aesthetic problems for a long time. We just had the human element to deal with. But it was the best of all of Kobin, my teacher's teachings. It was the one that I cherish the most because he moved into that situation and he said, It's all Buddha, we will all practice together. And we did. It was very difficult but once we agreed that that's what we were going to do then it was okay. There were a lot of things to do. One time we had a meeting outside and we were all sitting around on the porch which was about this high off of the ground. One of the denizens there said, Look at all this glass, this place is a mess. Somebody should clean it up. And Kobin just leaned down and started picking up all the pieces of glass. It was like that the whole time. It wasn't that constant teaching going on to embrace the situation but to impose some kind of order on it at the same time. And not expect too much because it took a long, long time. And it may take a long time for you to, you don't have to do it all tomorrow. It's taken a long time to get where you've gotten so you can be patient. And if there's a disagreement, often you can just let it go until it comes down to something that everybody can, often disagreements work themselves out. If people don't push too hard, if everybody is adamant about one thing, you can sense that. But it takes a lot of work. Working with people is the most difficult thing because we're so difficult. But that's why we're so interesting. I wish you luck. It's a beautiful building. I can't wait to see it. It was a great fundraising letter and the picture that came with it, I really appreciated that a lot. It's great. Yes? No, no. The woman she was interviewing. I don't, Hannah, I think Hannah is somebody. It's a brand new book in America. She published it in Germany and it was a tremendous best seller there. And it's just come out in America. I'm sure Kepler's or some plates would have it. Yeah. Yes? Oh, thank you. Yeah, yeah, Ruth. Ruth Kruegel? Kilgore. Kilgore. Yeah. Thank you. Yes? What is it? Devil's Arithmetic. That's... Bravo, bravo. Squeezed it out, didn't we? That's great. Well, that's an unforgettable title. Should we try? Yes. Anything else? Maybe it's time for the potluck. Oh, you have a question? No. Then maybe it is time for the potluck. Enjoy.
