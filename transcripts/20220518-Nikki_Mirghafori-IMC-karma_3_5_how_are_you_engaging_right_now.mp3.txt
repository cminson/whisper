Hello and greetings dear Sangha.
So karma, karma, karma as action, karma as action, is these three aspects of action that we've been discussing the past couple of days.
The intention around it, the leading edge, what is done, the action of the thought, speech, and body, and the trailing edge, what is left behind, what is created, what is made, what is made.
So today I'd like to talk about what Andrew Olensky terms where the action is, where the action is.
So there are two aspects to every moment's experience.
One is the content, what you're aware of.
It could be a sound, a thought, a sensation, in fact, in Buddhism there are six sense doors, as you know.
They're the five senses, the usual five senses that we have with smell and taste and touch and hearing and seeing, those five.
And the sixth sense door is the door of the mind. So in any moment you can choose to imagine a beach.
You can bring to mind maybe a music that you love and play it in your mind.
Again, it's a sound, but you can play it or you can have a thought of, say, a happy thought or a sad thought.
You can conjure it up, so in the mind door everything can be chosen to be played up.
So there is the object, there is the object of awareness.
There are many objects, either physical objects or seeing, hearing, tasting, objects of the mind, which again, the mind can access all of those five senses.
All of those five objects, even remembering a touch, a sense of sensation, you can remember it.
You can recreate it in the mind door, which is pretty wild, right?
It's pretty awesome being human, like we can do all this, right?
Recreating all these objects of knowing, objects of awareness in the mind door, the sixth door.
I thought this was pretty cool when I first learned about the sixth door in Buddhism.
Whereas in Western psychology, we only have the five.
Anyway, so in every moment's experience, there is the object of awareness, right?
Which could be through the sixth sense doors, the sixth sense doors.
And then there is what our emotional response is towards this object of awareness.
How we are relating to it, how we are engaging with it, right?
So as discussed, as I just mentioned, the objects of awareness, they could be recreated any moment in the mind door.
And our mind-body apparatus can really lurch around from one object of awareness to another object of awareness very quickly.
Sometimes it will, sometimes seemingly not it will, right?
You're thinking about this, and then maybe you're meditating, you come back, and then you're thinking about something else.
So these two, both the object of awareness and the way we relate to it, the way we relate to it, our attitude, our reaction, etc.
It's called, in the Buddhist psychology, this is called sankharas or formations. This is called form, rupa.
The objects are called rupa with the five aggregates.
So those who are familiar with the teaching of the five aggregates, and if you're not, don't be overwhelmed or scared.
What five aggregates? Wait a minute, I'm just explaining them to you, so stay with me, stay with me.
So form is just the objects of awareness and also known in Pali rupa.
And then sankharas, sankharas are the aggregates.
It's the aggregate of the way of the mental formations or also called formations, the way we relate, the way we engage, we react in each moment.
And each moment, in each moment, these shift and change, even though we have this sense of permanence, every moment it's a refreshing, it's a refreshing, because it can change every moment, right?
So the sankharas, these reactions, these formations, these mental formations, these are the ways we react, can shift and change every moment.
So what is interesting is that if we were perhaps an automaton, a computer, my background being in artificial intelligence, just knowing, just knowing an object is one thing, right?
Just knowing, but the sankharas, the way we react, the way we respond, the way we relate to an object.
In fact, that's where the action is.
It's that's where that is the way we engage with an object, because just knowing an object, oh, okay, all right, yeah, this is, you know, this is a pen, okay, this is just a pen.
Oh, I love this pen, I don't want anyone to take it, like, ah, or, oh, I hate this pen, this reminds me of, that's, you know, difficult day.
The way we engage, the way the sankharas, the way we are responding, engaging with an object, either physical object, object of the mind, that is what shapes and forms the next moment's experience.
That's how, that's how we are shaped and formed.
So, a skillful, healthy way of relating to an object, it shifts, it forms us into a more skillful, into a more kinder, a less deluded, more equanimous person.
Being in the next moment.
So, so we could say that perhaps the harm that comes, or the harm that we cause ourselves, isn't so much from the objects that we relate to.
Again, physical objects, I'm talking about the objects of the six sense doors.
Not so much from the objects, but the way we relate to the experience, the way we engage with the experience.
That's how, that's where the karma is shaped, is through our experience, is how our next moment's experience is shaped, and our next moments of experience, and who we become, and who we are, and how we show up in the world.
So, this is quite profound actually to see this in Buddhist psychology, this teaching of karma, which is this way we engage, and how we engage, that shapes and forms who we become, who we are.
Because that's also what Western psychology and neuroscience also, not surprisingly, supports, suggests, you know, it's not so much the moment's experience, but those emotional memories, those emotions that really fix something in place,
the memory of something becomes fixed in place because of the emotional engagement, because of the emotion that has been ignited, that has come alive, as we have engaged with something that has occurred with an object in the six sense doors.
And you know this to be true for your own experience, maybe some moment of experience became really etched in your memory, in your heart and mind, so that moment of experience in the past, because of the emotional response you had to it, because of the anger you had, or because of the love you had, or because of whatever happened.
And that really felt like a formative moment. And in fact, in AI, in neural networks, that's called one-shot learning when there is something so important, so, you know, a pattern that's so, we give it so much weight that it becomes, oh, it's a one-shot learning, it really shapes and forms.
The shapes of the neural networks, but again, coming back to humans.
So, the way we engage really, that's where the action is, the moment of anger becomes, and also it shapes, it also grows, maybe a moment of anger is a thought, and then it becomes a striking blow, or becomes a hurtful comment, or becomes a nasty thought, and then becomes an action, et cetera, et cetera, and then they grow.
So, who we are, who we are, and actually Andrew Odenski says this beautifully, who we are, and what world we inhabit actually consists of these series, of the series of these emotional responses unfolding within us.
So, it's actually just these series of emotional responses, is who we are, and we keep conditioning them for the future.
So, how we hold ourselves right now, in this moment, how are you holding yourself right now, in this moment, how are you relating, how are you relating to the contents of your experience?
How are we holding ourselves in this moment right now, is it with greed, hatred, delusion? Is it with the opposite, generosity, with love, and with wisdom?
How we hold ourselves right now, right here, right here people, right now is the key to the next moment.
So, it's not about what we engage with, it's how we engage with the what, it's the how, it's the how.
And that is so powerful, we have so much power to shift and change the way we engage in this moment, in this moment.
So, then, sitting on the cushion is important, of course, is when we really learn and observe and get to see our reactions with detail.
And yet, the whole day, our entire life is our practice, because every moment we are shaping and forming our responses, our reactions, our karma.
So, the time has come to an end, so I wish you a full day, a beautiful, a wise, a wholesome karma-forming day of practice.
Thank you so much for being here, for practicing, for your own benefit, and the benefit of all beings whose lives yours touches.
Thank you, and see you tomorrow. Be well.
