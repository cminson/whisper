Time for his teaching and questions and answers, and we'll have lunch at about 11. 
30 or 11. 
45. 
And he's going to lead us in some walking meditation and teach us some things about that. 
More Dhamma, Q&A, some chanting, a very nice relaxing day, and you can ask him anything. 
I found out I've done it. 
Tomorrow he'll be teaching at Karuna Buddhist Vihara in the morning, and we have regular programs there. 
That's the place where I live in Millbray, and there are programs on Sunday mornings and Monday evenings, Tuesday evenings, Wednesday evenings, regularly, sometimes Saturdays. 
If anyone's interested in getting on our mailing list, there's a sign-up sheet by the donation box. 
Some of you are on the mailing list. 
I think that's how you got here. 
So what I notice about Bante is that he just continues learning. 
As he talks to people and teaching and for someone to give their life to sharing the Dhamma and learning and teaching and helping people be happier and live better lives, I think it's just so powerful and worthy of our honor and respect, and we're so glad to have you here, Bante. 
Thank you. 
Thank you so much, Sati sent my host, Steele, when also Karuna Vihara, our Bhikkhuni, Santoshika. 
Are you Santoshika? Thank you so much. 
I'm now between Karuna and Sati. 
We have to balance otherwise we're going to get a big trouble. 
I remember almost, in fact, I wrote that story, one of my books, Saffron Days in Nile. 
It had happened in here, Berkeley. 
Sati and Karuna, I had to balance otherwise I got big trouble. 
Bante Steele, you may have heard about him. 
He's a teacher's IBS in Berkeley. 
He organized once a year Vesak celebration at Berkeley campus. 
Then I came with a couple of monks for that ceremony. 
We drove from Los Angeles to India. 
Then we had to go to immediately, it started at 3 o'clock, we almost reached 2. 
30. 
Then we had to go to bathrooms, toilets. 
The basement was a bathroom. 
Then my other colleagues went before me to the toilets. 
I was a little late because talking to some of my Sri Lankan friends and so forth. 
Then I had to cross the women's bathroom here, then passing through that had to go to the men's bathroom. 
A young lady was against the door, women's bathrooms. 
When I'm passing, I ask, can I talk to you? I say, yes. 
Are you Hare Krishna? I say, no. 
I'm a Buddhist monk, that is great. 
Can you do favor? What? Can you come to the bathroom, remove my clothes? I got shocked. 
Then she saw her hand, both hand due to accident, put in some white castor. 
And I saw her wet towels. 
So she immediately, first nature call, go to the toilets. 
So someone had to help her. 
I do have a corona, compassion. 
Same time I came to the mindfulness. 
Sati. 
Because if I go and help her with my greatest compassion, I make it a big trouble. 
Maybe police come and catch me, security catch me and put headline newspapers. 
Next day, Buddhist monk caught in the women's bathroom with a lady. 
So immediately I jump forward to upstairs and I met a Latin lady who married to Sri Lankan gentleman. 
Then her name is Ann. 
I asked Ann, please come and help her, that poor lady. 
Then I hand over to help her. 
So therefore, corona is a grave. 
Same time Sati is very important, both have to. 
Alone Sati also not working well, corona also not working. 
We have to middle path, practice together, corona and sati. 
That's why very good this combination, corona center and corona vihara and sati center combinations are very great. 
Today our topic is how to be happy, especially as a lay people. 
You know, I'm a storyteller, I'm allowed to say many stories. 
This is one of parable coming from Chinese tradition. 
In one day a lady opened the door, her house, she saw four people were outside, wet weather, cold weather. 
Then she asked, hey guys, come on in. 
Then she says, no, we cannot come unless your husband come and ask us to come in. 
So she went inside, told the husband, there are people wet weather, cold weather, poor guys outside, why don't go and invite them to come in? Then the man went over there and asked them to come in. 
They says, no, you have to call our name. 
The man says, I don't know your guys name. 
First one says, my name is wealth, money. 
If I enter to your house, your guys have a lot of money. 
Second one says, my name is success. 
If I enter to your house, your guys going to be very successful. 
Third one says, my name is peace. 
If I enter to your house, your guys going to be very peaceful. 
Fourth one says, my name is happiness. 
If I enter to your house, going to be very, very happy. 
Your guys going to be very happy. 
However, we have one condition, you can call only one person. 
If you are called right person, four of us going to enter. 
Otherwise you call person only going to enter the house. 
Man was confused. 
Man went to get advice from wife. 
Why immediately, why not call money? We need money. 
Go and tell into the money to our house. 
He says, no, money comes and goes. 
We better ask to success to come inside. 
Successful life is much, much better than money. 
Why don't we better call to success? Then they started arguing husband and wife. 
Son immediately shouted, peace, peace, peace. 
In disguise, I again started mummy and daddy fighting. 
Better to call peace. 
Then daughter saying, no, better to call happiness. 
Finally, husband went outside, called, please happiness come in. 
When happiness entered the house, money also entered. 
Then success also entered, also peace also entered. 
In other words, this terrible saying, where is the happiness? At home, if you are happy people, happiness, money automatically comes. 
Also success and peace, everything with you. 
This is a Chinese parable saying, therefore very important for us to have this happiness. 
How we can achieve this happiness? That is a very important thing as a Buddhist, especially how we do get this happiness. 
Of course, you know the Buddhist teaching, we divide two parts called conventional truths and ultimate truths. 
Conventional happiness and ultimate happiness may be different, but without conventional truth, we cannot have ultimate truth. 
Well-known Mahayana philosopher who lived 3rd century A. 
D. 
, Nagarjuna, he's one of famous book called Moolamadhyamikarika. 
In other words, it is a middle path. 
In that book, he says, in his own word, in Sanskrit, he says, dve saktya parama suthya buddhanam dharma desana loka sammuti sacchancha sacchancha paramartata vivahara manashruthya paramartu nadeshati paramartu managammya nirvana nadhigammyati Thus teaching through two truths. 
One is called conventional truths, other one is called ultimate truths. 
Without conventional truths, you cannot understand ultimate truths. 
Without ultimate truths, you cannot understand nirvana. 
Therefore, these three things have to work together. 
That's the way Venerable Nagarjuna explains, it is perfectly correct. 
So here I'm talking about conventional truth, as a lay person, how we can get happiness. 
To happy life, very important in their sutta is called dhiga nikaya, long suttas, called siga lovada ka sutta. 
In the siga lovada sutta, the Buddha explained to us our duties, our responsibilities, as a lay family, the story is saying this way, siga lovada ka householder worshipping six directions early morning, he got up and with wet weather in hair, he went over there worshipping ten directions, worshipping east, south, west, north, in the earth and sky. 
Then Buddha approached him and asked, why you are doing these things? My father, before he passed away, he asked me to do so, that's why I'm doing that. 
Do you know that meaning? Not exactly. 
Then Buddha asked, can I explain to you? Yes, certainly. 
Then Buddha says, when you venerate and worship in east, it means you are respecting your own parents, parents and children relationship, parents. 
Why south? I mean, east sun rises early morning, sun gives real light equally to everybody including planets, plants and so forth. 
Therefore, parents look like sun rises. 
So that is why your father asked you to worship, mean not east, respect your parents. 
Then explain Buddha many ways how to respect for that. 
Then south, why south? South equal to the teachers. 
Usually right hand, when I'm left handed, right hand most of people write in. 
Right hand doing many things. 
Therefore, south express as teachers. 
Teacher and pupil relationship explain through that Buddha explain that how to respect teacher, how teacher respect and take care of children or their disciples that we explain. 
Then west, west compare as a wife and husband. 
Because sun may be down, could be Buddha never meant to that. 
Your life is end of the wind, good to marry not really that way. 
But until sun goes down, until you meant to be live together, this may be not easy, but try your best to harmonious life, live with until die. 
Then their husband and wife responsibilities explain their place. 
By the way, it is very important today not to hear any young people. 
All of you have a lot of good experiences. 
I love to explain this thing to young people who especially going to get married. 
Even someone going to get married here, age is no problem. 
I can tell what the Buddha taught how to take care of your wife and husband to be happy life. 
Buddha says, Sammananaya, Ananaya, Anati Charayaya, Issaryav Ghanen, Alankaraanupadane. 
People do not know much about those things. 
Sammananaya, if you marry, if you going to marry, you must, the Buddha says, respect your partner, meet your respect, Sammananaya. 
Ananaya, no matter what, you must not put her or he down. 
Especially in front of children, in front of your friends, in front of others, must not put he or her down. 
And respect them not putting down Ananaya. 
Even teasing, oh my wife is a wonderful good lady, she cook very well, but too much salt, kind of, even that type of teasing dog should not do in front of friends and children. 
That's a Buddha directly mentioned, Ananaya. 
Anati Charayaya, Anati Charayaya means hanky, banky, monkey activities, you know. 
Sometime married, going to have another girlfriend. 
I happen to have a friend, I had to counsel a lot, a lot of family problems. 
This guy married to one lady, go to bed with another lady, go to parties with another lady, like that many type of womanizing characters. 
So the Buddha says, no, if you are married, if you have a partner, you must stay with him, with her. 
That is to be, if you want to be happy person. 
Anati Charayaya, Sariyogahana. 
Sariyogahana in the main, responsibilities have to share. 
Especially in Asian tradition, I don't know how to apply this country. 
In Asia, wife must get more responsibility, especially at home. 
Here may be same thing. 
The husband should give all of authority, taking care of children, taking care of properties and money and everything to the wife, unless he is not really crazy, go and shop in and wasting credit card. 
So the Buddha says, she have to give responsibility. 
Also husband have to have a responsibility. 
She are in things together and responsibilities. 
Then finally, alankaraanupadaneen. 
When a birthday is, anniversary is, don't forget. 
And those days, specially the man ask man, you must give some valuable thing to your wife. 
Alankara means some decorative thing like gold chains, gold, some kind of watch or whatever. 
Good thing, some memorable things, go and give to your wife and no husband, whatever you can afford. 
At least go to the garden, pick up the nice flower and say, honey, today is your birthday like that. 
I know so many stories I can tell this, most of the time, Asian people, they don't care how much birthday is. 
They think everything in permanent, everything subject to change. 
Birthday means another, we are close to the dead, therefore we don't have to celebrate like that way, have a thought. 
Maybe philosophically they are right, but practically they are wrong. 
In the Buddha says, this I have to celebrate to be happy life. 
You know, I happen to know family. 
July 30th that family has a big fight. 
I am waiting for to get a telephone call, go following them to counsel that family. 
The reason is, a wife love to have a birthday party and kind of beautiful words for birthdays. 
Husband hate birthdays, he doesn't want to even mention the birthdays. 
Then wife is crying and calling, complaining, this man never ever say to happy birthday to me and so forth. 
Then I go and talk to this man and say, hey, this is not right. 
She never ask you a Rolls Royce cars or Mercedes Benz or anything. 
She asked, just so you affection and love, go to your garden as a beautiful roses, bring one roses and give honey. 
No, no, no, no, I give her all of money when I go to work. 
That is true. 
He said, doctor, he immediately bring and money you to the wife. 
She can, if you want to, she can go to the shop all of birthday cards they can bring. 
I said, my dear, this is not the thing. 
You have to show your affection and love. 
This man never ever did. 
Finally, what happened? It's a long story. 
I'm getting short. 
Finally, at that time, the man was 50 years old, the woman was 48 years old. 
There was a gentleman, 65 years old, distinguishing his scholar guy. 
He heard this news and he sent a beautiful bouquet of roses to this lady. 
Then she fell in love with that man and left husband and went with that man. 
Still, after that man is so sorry and sad and come to me and say, oh, I did a mistake too late to understand. 
So those are the things we have to focus maybe for you, not enough, no need for you. 
This should be a young people with this advice. 
But Buddha directly mentioned it in Sigalovada Sutra. 
Then again, that is the family, then come to the north. 
North Kampya friendship, how to take care of friends and spiritual friends, important to be happy life. 
You know, spiritual friends, many, many suttas as the meditators, even if you go to Sanyuthani Kaya, one of famous sutta called Meghya Sutta. 
Meghya Sutta, the Meghya was a very Buddhist, one of the early assistants. 
He was taking care of the Buddha very well before Ananda. 
Then with Buddha, he went to the forest for meditation. 
After staying in the forest, while he came to the receiving arm, he saw a very beautiful mango garden. 
He felt very much, this is a good place to meditate. 
He asked Buddha's permission, can I go to that mango grove and meditate? Buddha says, no. 
Then after a few days later again, he came and asked permission. 
Buddha says, no. 
Wait for a while. 
Third time he got so angry, like a rebellion young man, son. 
You got what you need, you got a full enlightenment. 
I entered the order to get enlightenment. 
I want to go to that place, try to get enlightenment. 
You say, no. 
Then Buddha says, okay, okay. 
You don't have to quarrel. 
You can go and meditate. 
If you achieve, if you can get enlightenment, great. 
If you could not get enlightenment, don't run away, come back to me. 
Then to meditate under this beautiful garden, he sat down under the one of mango tree. 
When he tried to meditate, he saw in front of him, deers, male and female deers coming and playing each other. 
He got so many sexual desires. 
He got so angry, then got a violent thought. 
He thought, I came from very such a, such a great good family. 
I entered the order to become that enlightenment. 
Now my mind came this kind of crazy thing. 
I'm a stupid guy and he hit himself, his head to the tree and he get some violent thought came and he got anger, violent thought and sexual desire, these three things. 
He injured himself too. 
So finally he went to the Buddha and explained. 
Then whenever sir, when tried to do meditation, came to my mind, sexual desire, anger and violent thought. 
I could not even one minute concentrate meditation. 
Then he says, yes, my dear, that's why I told you. 
You have to have many things before meditate. 
Number one is a spiritual friend. 
You should have a spiritual friend. 
In the, in fact, one of the sutras says, Venerable Ananda said, Venerable sir, the sasana, half of, belong to half of the existing in this sasana because of spiritual friend. 
Buddha says, Ananda, you are on. 
Hundred percent, my institute exits because of spiritual friend. 
Therefore, all of we need spiritual friend, like each other. 
No, because something come to your mind. 
You have to share. 
Even especially meditators, while you are meditating, many things come to your mind. 
Sometimes as a meditator, when you are meditating, then some kind of lights come. 
Sometimes you are while meditating. 
You can share very beautiful sound or sound or something coming to you. 
Maybe you are disturbed. 
You may be, we don't know. 
If you talk to common folks, they think you are crazy. 
They try to send you to the psychiatric. 
This guy has a mental problem. 
No, as a meditator, when we are passing through the state to state, you see, then we call jhanas. 
When you go to jhanas, state to state, we are passing through this kind of many experiences. 
Sometimes we can see a demon. 
We can see hungry ghosts. 
We can see earthbound ghosts. 
Then if you have a spiritual friend like a Santoshika or like a Stephen, like someone who develop meditation, you can consult, discuss together. 
She never, when you come and talk to her, say, so while I'm staying in the bathroom, I saw hungry ghosts come to me and talk. 
She never going to tell you, oh, immediately you must go and see a psychiatrist. 
She never say to you, then she listen and she says experiences are like that. 
They are according to Buddhist cosmology, they are heavenly beings, human beings, animal kingdom, hungry ghosts are there. 
You have to be very happy and peaceful because your third eye or your development mind, you can see these things, you don't have to attach or you don't have to be fearful for that. 
Let it come, let it go. 
It is everything subject to change. 
Like that, see, you can advise. 
Therefore, spiritual friend is very, very important with this explaining five qualities of spiritual friend in that sutta. 
Then, other one is talking about the earth. 
Earth is compared with workers like an employee. 
Employees, employers are had to work together. 
Without earth, we cannot stand. 
Without earth, we cannot survive. 
Earth is very important, similarly employer and employee is very important. 
They are relationship, how to develop, how to respect, how to help your employees. 
Same time taking care of your employer. 
Those are the very, very well explained in that sutta, called Sigaalovada sutta. 
Then finally, explaining the sky. 
Sky compare with religious leaders, religious people, and their relationship with devotees and religious people explain. 
Thus, we heard that book also. 
I explained one chapter, explained this sutta very well. 
Otherwise, you can go to internet. 
Just put Sigaalovada sutta. 
There are a lot of explanations. 
I saw Karuna Center has one booklet written by Mr. 
Subhasingh. 
I saw they printed some booklet there. 
So, this is very good to read that book for as lay devotees. 
Then the happy life. 
How to be happy again? To be happy, the Buddha says we have to have a sangvara, pahana, bhavana, anurakan, these four things very important. 
Sangvara means prevention and protection. 
We have to know how to protect ourselves. 
Prevention of ourselves. 
Prevention means not to harm to ourselves, not to harm to others. 
That is a very important teaching in Buddhism. 
Buddha's main principle, if you go through the suttas, directly explain don't harm, make trouble and problems and difficulties, torture yourself, don't do that. 
That is whole unwholesome act if you do so. 
Then if you make trouble to others, also that is also unwholesome act. 
Therefore, If anyone makes trouble himself, if someone makes trouble others, that is I call monks unwholesome act. 
Atta-bhya-bhada-nohoti, Monks, I'm saying if you do not make trouble yourself, if you do not make trouble others, if you do not make trouble yourself and others, that is I call wholesome act. 
So, therefore, to be happy we have to be that way. 
That is the reason why every lay people ought to follow five principles. 
Five principles mean I undertake the precept abstain from killing, I undertake the precept abstain from stealing, I undertake the precept abstain from sexual misconduct, I undertake the precept abstain from lying, I undertake the precept abstain from alcohol and drugs. 
These five principles actually, you know, we had a world parliament of religions in 1993 in Chicago. 
At that time, most of the international, I think, over one hundred, I believe, sixty-two or sixty-three many, many religious group denomination around the world joined together. 
We had to get a preamble for that. 
In the research years and years to what type of thing we had to put the preamble for world parliament of religion. 
Finally, got this, except last one, four things they got together because the Catholic Church strongly objected, they had to offer to the God wine, therefore they don't want to include alcohol, that one, except four things we got there. 
Therefore, these are global ethics. 
Five precepts are global ethics. 
Just, we don't have to think of five precepts as coming from Buddhism. 
Just think of this way. 
What is the way? As a human being, we have to protect ourselves. 
We don't want to get hurt, injured, we don't want to hurt others. 
First principle is that. 
First principle is protecting ourselves. 
That is a beautiful thing. 
Everywhere we live, we have to protect ourselves, right? Then second thing is what? Second thing is protecting our property. 
We don't want anyone to come and steal our things, belong to us. 
Same time, we don't want to steal others and hurt others. 
So protecting our property is a second thing. 
Third thing is protecting our families. 
Adultery makes a lot of injured and making trouble for families. 
Then I undertake the precepts, abstain from sexual misconduct, mean the protecting families. 
That is not a bad thing, that's a nice thing. 
First one, protecting our happiness. 
If we lie, then we are not happy, others are not happy. 
Protecting our happiness, joy. 
Finally, protecting our health. 
When we drink alcohol or drugs, we are losing our memories and also our body going to injured and getting trouble, maybe liver going to getting trouble and many type of problems. 
Therefore, this five thing is nothing else, protecting our property, protecting our life, protecting our property, protecting our families, protecting our happiness, protecting our health. 
That's why Buddha asked these five things we have to follow. 
Then, to be happy person if we do this thing, second is called pahanam in removal. 
We have a lot of garbage, sometimes our houses. 
Some people have a habit to collect all unwanted, unneeded, unnecessary, many, many things. 
Then we do have what happened. 
That house going to be ugly. 
Even you cook something, if you put garbage can, some meat or fish or vegetable and we put in the garbage can, if you not remove on time, keep a couple of days, one week, two weeks, smell bad. 
Maybe cockroach come too, maybe virus come too, anyone come to house they feel bad, which is horrible smell. 
Same thing within ourselves if we keep unwanted, unneeded, unnecessary experiences within ourselves if we keep in our inside. 
The person come to us, they are naturally going to feel this guy is a not right person, he has some bad smell, not physical smell, kind of problem this guy has. 
Then the answer is he might be, oh, she might be get angry himself. 
Holding these things very, very difficult. 
Keep in this unwanted information, keep in mind we are suffer. 
Even common sense we all of, even though we are all getting old age, we are all of them are familiar with computers, right? When our computer we have a lot of unnecessary programs, someone junk eats and put in sometimes my computer in the temple, some of our young Sunday school children come in and they are allowed to put new thing, they put in many, many new programs. 
Then my computer get in slow. 
Then I ask my friend, teacher, teacher Mahatma, my computer very slow, very cannot work, then he come in and say, you know need this program, need this kids play in game, you don't need to play in games, and suppose he remove all of unneeded, all of programs he removed, then after that find my computer. 
Similarly, our head, if we keep in unwanted, unneeded, unnecessary information, we are really mind is slow, also unhappy. 
You know my, more than I give in the amateur counselor actually, I even license counselor, I do not do for money, but I love to consult with specialty teenagers. 
A couple of years ago at UCLA, one of young lady came to see me, it's an American young lady, she told me, Reverend, I hate my mom, I don't like her. 
When I go in to read my books, I cannot study. 
Oh it's coming, coming my mom to my mind, I cannot study. 
I went to psychiatrics and many, many people, no one can help me. 
Still I hate this problem. 
Then I ask my dear, what happened, tell me. 
She says, when I was three years old, she put in the bathroom, lock two hours, still this one occur my mind all the time, I hate due to that my mom. 
I say, well, tell me, how long you were in mother's abdomen before come to this world? She doesn't know, I say, at least nine months, can you tell me how many hours this nine months? When you come to this world, your mom, how did she take care of you? She feeds you, took to the bathroom, give you a shower and take to the bed and until you sleep and read some stories and she took you to school, until you were 17, she drove and took care of you very, very, how many years, 17 years, how many hours? Maybe 100,000,000 hours. 
Stupid girls, very selfish, you are talking about two hours, you never ever thinking of the 100,000 hours she helps you. 
I want to purposely attack her, not meant to that, to understand her selfishness. 
Because the reason I'm not blaming this young lady, same as her, we also hold in some time unwanted, unnecessary information of our mind. 
You know why people are unhappy? By the way, what does meditation mean? You call sati, maybe mindfulness, sometimes you call concentration, many, many words you use in English. 
What is a Pali word? Pali word is called bhavana. 
What is the exact meaning of bhavana? Bhavana means bhavati, living, present, moment. 
We translate as mindfulness or concentration and many, many ways, but real, direct translation is living, present, moment, right now. 
One day, another religious ascetic came to visit the Buddha. 
He saw this assembly of sangha members, monks and nuns, who were very happy paces, so handsome, so beautiful, men and women, nuns and monks, very calm and serene. 
He was so excited about that and asked Buddha, how come your disciples are so happy? They are very handsome, very beautiful, these monks and nuns are very good there. 
I can see all of them have a good vibration. 
What is the cause? What is the reason? Buddha says in his own word, Athitangnānu sochanti nappajanti tīnāgata pachukpannena yāpanti tenavannupasiddhati Athitangnānu sochanti, my monks and nuns never, ever cry, think in the past. 
They never think in the past and cry. 
Soch means they never get upset about looking at the past. 
Athitangnānu sochanti nappajanti tīnāgata My monks and nuns never dream about the future. 
Oh, when I'm going to get all age, do I going to stay, elderly care center or will I going to be a homeless person or they are going to take my children, going to take care of me or not that type of fear not to come to their mind. 
They do not have an insecurity problem either. 
In other words, Buddha says, if you're thinking of the too much past, even though you have a lot of good experiences, those good experiences not come to your mind, come to your mind something bad experience had happened to. 
Those are things come to your mind. 
If you're thinking too much in the future, imagination world in the future, more than happiness you get fear and insecurity. 
Think in the past, anger, you're angry yourself, you're angry with others. 
Think in the future, fear and insecurity. 
Therefore live present moment right now. 
That's the way Buddha asked us to do that, to be happy person. 
Then again, removal means we have to remove our anger. 
We do not know how this anger come to us due to the three reason maybe. 
According to Buddhist psychology, there are three terms in Sanskrit called ala vinyana, manana vinyana, prakriti vinyana. 
Alaya means the unconsciousness, subconsciousness and consciousness. 
These are the three terms. 
Direct contact with the last life. 
Without knowing previous life, some experiences are come to us. 
It's hard to stop. 
You know the Buddha's time, one of devotees want to have a full enlightenment monk, arhat monk, to take his home and give a food. 
Then he asked Buddha, Buddha asked Mahapantaka one of monks who was in charge of the sangha, give a full enlightenment monk. 
Then he got arhat. 
While they walk in, they have to go villages, walk in, the lay devotees going back and front the monk. 
When there was a water kind of muddy place, this monk jumped over the muddy place. 
Then the devotee was so upset. 
He thought this guy is not enlightened one because in Asian culture, monks have to behave in a certain way. 
He cannot jump, he can run and he has to be very calm and serene and all the time he has to be very good, disciplined. 
He was so upset. 
He thought this guy is not enlightened. 
They cheated me. 
I'm going to cheat him also. 
I give him a food but I prepared some gifts. 
Usually in traditionally when monks invited in Asian way from Buddha's time to even today, our lay devotees not only given the food, after that give us some gifts, robes or today mostly in America give us money. 
In our countries most of the time robes or other necessary articles give us a gift. 
This devotee thought that I never going to give to this guy but I prepared a gift. 
He never told, he just kept thinking. 
When he went to another place, there was another muddy place. 
The poor monk walking on the mud. 
Then the devotee was so surprised and asked, directly asked, first place you jump over that mud place, why you are not, why you are working, walk this place? He said, first place I jump over, I lost my gift. 
I lost the gift. 
If I jump over this place, I might lose in my food too. 
Therefore I never jump over. 
Then he could not cheat him and finally he offered a gift also. 
Then went to the Buddha and asked. 
Buddha says, yes, he is enlightened one. 
Why this happened? Because of furious life, he was a monkey. 
Even the fully enlightened one, except Buddha, as a monkey was a furious life, he was seen in this muddy place, he jumped over. 
So naturally happening. 
So our self also without knowing, sometimes going to have this monkey, donkey, many many kind of characters come to our activities, therefore we have to be very careful, that's the way Buddha says, we have to watch out our furious allay vinyanmin, unconsciousness, without knowing, unconsciousness occupied some things, without knowing coming out, we have to be careful. 
That is important sati. 
Then second is called allay vinyanmin, manana vinyanmin, the childhood. 
Childhood like that young lady who had a problem with the mother, similarly we do have some kind of that, like cognitive psychologists and environmental psychologists explaining about the children have some childhood problem with me, getting trouble for when they are growing up. 
Similarly Buddha says, yes, this type of thing happening, however you don't have to react. 
When come to this mind, think of those pasts, pasts, I don't have to hold like our bhikkhuni while meditating, explain to you, you have to drop, you have to not take it anything, let it go. 
Similarly we don't have to take it, let it go. 
Finally manana vinyanmin, daily life, when you go to work somewhere, stay in something, some people kind of way harass and do so many things to us, we don't have to get seriously, those things yesterday bhikkhuni and myself went to visit her mother, her mother now 85 years, 87 years old, very beautiful, very happy lady, I'm so impressed her explanation about, she's also the time positive way thinking, positive thing get to her mind, she said her some of her stay in the place, she that used to sit together same table on the yesterday, she was another table, even not looking at her, so was little her, but same time she understand the nature of human being. 
They have to understand similarly, nature human beings are no one permanent, everything come in and going, by the way our Lord Buddha's greatest faith taught us, he says in this world no man no woman is bad, everybody's good, then who are they wrong? Defilements, anger, hate, ill will, jealous, those are the defilements, everybody's we do have those defilements, if he can remove, if he can overcome, we are perfect, you can see many many stories, even Anguli Mahal story, those guys, murders and so forth, as a human being they are okay, what happen due to anger, hate, ill will, illusion, many kind of thing they will become wrong people, we do have those defilements, we have to away from that, then we can be very happy people, so second thing is called Pahana, removal, we have to remove those things, third thing is called Pahana, Pahana Bhavana means cultivation, cultivate means we have to improve, everyday, even though we are getting old, everyday we have to learn something, we have to improve our greatest qualities, our happiness, our meditation techniques, our knowledge, wisdom, everything have to improve, that way we can be happy, finally, Sangvara Pahana Bhavana, Anurakram means maintenance, when the building nicely you maintain and colourful way you keep in this one and paint it and similarly our body, you have a car you maintain very well, on time you change the oil, you put a gas and so forth, similarly our body we have to maintain, our mind have to maintain, mind and body works together, that is the reason why when we get sometimes sick, mind also going to weak, when our mind is weak, our body going to weak, therefore very important for us to maintain our mind and body, we have to eat on time, we have to sleep on time, we have to pick up right food, right food, what is the right food by the way, you hear American people are so picky about food, when you go into the stores you look in at oh it is not good for cholesterol, it is not good for diabetes, it is fat and so forth all the time you are looking at, that is nice, that is Buddha explained four types of food, that is called kabalinka hara, kabalinka hara means we are eating vegetable or whatever you eat in things, that is nice of you are thinking oh this is health, as it is health, this is not good for diabetes, it is cholesterol and so forth, it is okay, how about the other three things Buddha explained, pashahara, pashah means touching, our eyes love to, it is really important our eyes to see the pictures, our ear to need to hear sound all the time, our taste also we need to taste many things all the time, chakku, sotha, ghan, jua, mana, same time we love to touch things and so forth, but Buddha says do we think, like when you are looking at food and picky about food, same thing you are picky about those, our senses, oh if I see this picture, maybe it is not good for my mind and violent picture, they are this movie, they are each other killing and a lot of violent things, it is not good for my mind, I should not see this movie, do we think that way? Then again the other two food talking about, what is the pashahara, then second, third one is called mano vinyanahara, the mind all the time needs food, constantly thinking this thing that thing before, think of even you go to the meditation, how many thoughts come to your mind, comes and go, comes and go, comes and how many thoughts come, constantly mind want to make many thoughts, sometimes you think even midnight fortunately your guys are not, some young people I know got a big trouble, come to me, oh midnight get up and he thought that, oh I better to go to the ba, he went to the ba and they get in trouble in the fight with some young man, why did you go to the ba this time, oh no, I could not sleep, just my mind says go, go, go, they never, they surrender to thoughts, if we are looking at our food, this one not good for, close to old diabetes, why not thinking of those thoughts, thoughts come, don't allow every thoughts to work, let it come, naturally let it go, we have to think about our thought, other one is called fashahara, mano vinyanahara, vinyanahara, vinyanah means it is related to previous life, we are as Buddhists we believe rebirth, we are reincarnation, there are differences rebirth and reincarnation, we are believe rebirth, as the results as I earlier mentioned, we some way we have a relationship with the previous life, therefore sometime without knowing whenever someone see, immediately I felt that oh I know this person, how come, when you saw me, in the first time yesterday, you knew that you knew me, right, yes, I knew too, how come, not this life, previous life we meet, because we are like a visitors, travelers, going here and there and everywhere, therefore we going to feel that way, those are, when come to our mind, we have to be sometime very careful, have to be picky, so that way if we know then we can be happy people, I can talk many many things, I let you to ask any question right now, before we going to have a lunch, after that today, whole day, until 4 o'clock you can ask any questions, you can say also any comments, I am very love to hear from you, now time to, your term now to ask any questions, thank you. 
Can you hear me through it? You just mentioned there is a difference between reincarnation and rebirth, and I wonder if you would say a little bit about that. 
Reincarnation means our Hindu tradition believe reincarnate, reincarnate the same person going to become another person, in Indian Hindu tradition thought that Greek Yajur Samatharvan Vedas time, they thought that if someone brahman this life, he may going to become next life also brahman. 
The Buddha says no, Buddha says in the person may be nijaccha vasalo hoti nijaccha hoti brahmano kammana vasano hoti kammana hoti brahmano the wearing stabbings, you may not become brahman, nijaccha vasalo hoti, same time not become a low caste person, kammana, your action, when you do some action, as a result you going to be a brahman or low caste people. 
In other words, even the brahman caste someone were born, that person is alcoholic, or that person is gambler, that person is womanizer, that person is murderer, he is not a brahman. 
The Buddha says through his action how to measure the person. 
Similarly, in Buddhist concept, rebirth without person, this is very important for the Buddhists. 
When I go to some time school for young teenagers to teach, they ask immediately, do you believe God? They are very interested to know whether I believe God or not. 
Then I get the blackboard, I write God and good both. 
I say, hey, you guys do not know how to spell good. 
You drop one O. 
Good become, you drop the O, God. 
What is the difference between good and God? Same thing, I believe God, good you believe God. 
One thing I had to remind you, you do not know how to spell good. 
Then I write devil and evil. 
I again say, see, devil, evil, again what happened? D, you put another D instead of evil. 
Become a devil. 
I say evil, you call devil. 
What's the difference? It has the differences. 
What's the differences? Because in the atheist religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, all of the atheist religions who believe God, they want to explain the good through the God. 
Personalizing, there is a person. 
They want to explain evil through the devil, again personalizing, person, without them too hard to explain. 
As a Buddhist, we do not explain those personal things. 
That is why rebirth, no person, reincarnation, reincarnation has someone to incarnate. 
Rebirth, no person. 
Buddhist philosophy without person explaining, because we are going to explain person then what happened. 
We are going to have an attachment. 
We are going to have a kind of a desire. 
We are going to believe some kind of authority. 
That is the reason. 
Even the God concept, forgive me, I'm not criticizing God. 
What is happening? God loves man. 
Man loves God. 
Meet your love. 
That's fine. 
Why man loves God? I'm afraid God may not, God may go into punishment. 
I love God because God may be give me what I need. 
I have attachment and fear, both together. 
In here is not such a thing. 
Rebirth is continuation of our thought process yet it is not permanent thing, constantly changing going thought process. 
Any other questions? Yes. 
I wanted to ask you a question regarding keeping our mind free of the filaments. 
Because even if we have the intention to follow the precepts and we meditate, there are certain things, maybe because of strong impressions from previous life, or strong experiences in this lifetime, that are the return, keep coming up. 
Sometimes I wonder if the intention to let go and be in the present is sufficient. 
Or if there is other ways to purify the filaments and to help let go of those experiences and carry emotions and feelings with them that come up to disturb us. 
Yes, that is why we in the Buddhism seal samadhi panya. 
Seal means virtue, very, very important. 
Without seal, very difficult to do meditation. 
Without meditation, we cannot have wisdom. 
These three have to go together. 
Some of them try to practice meditation without seal. 
Then they won't get any results. 
I used to have a friend a long time ago. 
I was interested in Buddhist Meditations Center where you used to meditate. 
In 1976, we were together since Senjang, myself, Stephen, his name was Dyson. 
Another guy came from Hawaii, Mike. 
He was all of us sitting in meditation early morning, from 5 to 6. 
30. 
Then one of the community centers used to stay and another young lady came to me. 
Her name is Babra. 
I am the only ordained Sangha member at that time. 
Thikthianan was, but he is here and they are going. 
She came and told me, I remember that Mike, his Zen teacher, also minister, also claim as a Buddhist monk. 
I was his girlfriend. 
Only two weeks, he dropped me. 
He got another girlfriend. 
He has a habit of getting like that. 
I remember that before me, he had another girlfriend and another girlfriend like that. 
It's not good for your religion since coming from Jewish religion. 
It's not good for your religion. 
It is your duty as a monk to tell this man, not to do this nonsense. 
Then while we were having breakfast the next day, I told Mike, I heard this kind of thing. 
Oh, you should not do that. 
I am a Zen teacher. 
I am following impermanency all the time. 
If I stay with the one lady together, I am going to have an attachment. 
Therefore, I remove her, I get a new girlfriend. 
So some people are like that. 
They are benefit. 
They also try to use the teaching of Buddha. 
They are way. 
It is not right thing. 
You see, in the mind, they are trying to hide themselves. 
They are not honest with them. 
Number one thing, they have to be honest with themselves. 
Sealer means nothing else. 
You have to be honest with yourself. 
If you are not honest, if you are not, respect yourself, very hard to do that. 
Therefore, number one good principle is have to have a virtue. 
If we have a virtue, we can eradicate, remove and abandon all of even our previous experiences. 
Even childhood experiences, even daily things. 
Number one, we have to. 
. 
. 
on faith. 
Faith is very important. 
In Pali language, we call saddha. 
Saddha means the faith confidence. 
It is very, very important in a Buddhist. 
. 
. 
Every place has to explain. 
There are seven types of wealth. 
Number one is called saddha in the faith. 
Without faith, we cannot do anything. 
Faith is very important. 
That is the reason why daily basic, in the morning and evening, monastic life, we. 
. 
. 
Kuni Susantika's place also, you can go and see. 
Daily basic, like they are kneeled down to the Buddha statue, we are chanting, we are meditating, not only meditating, but we are chanting because we want to have some faith. 
Faith means the confidence. 
Saddha means actually not faith alone. 
More than that, it is called confidence, trust and kind of way. 
I believe this is the right path, something like that. 
If you do that, you are success. 
Yes? So if you have someone close to you, very close to you, I do, who is suffering, could be suffering from mental problem or physical problem that is really suffering, how can you be happy if that keeps tugging at your heart? In yourself or the other person, yourself. 
How can I be happy? Yes, the thing is, you have to think of yourself how you can help that person. 
For example, someone is unhappy or someone has a mental problem, so you do care for him or her, maybe take to the doctor and psychiatric, can get in medicine, make sure the person take a medicine or not. 
That way you can help. 
Other than that, we are not. 
. 
. 
Karuna means not to suffer for the other person suffering we should not get. 
In other words, we are sympathized, somewhere we are helping them, whatever we could do, that is maybe due to her or his come. 
I cannot change his or his come due to many disease or something happen. 
We cannot, hard to change those people, yet we are sympathized. 
However, the Buddha said, asevanā ca bālānāṁ panditānāṁ ca sevanā Sometimes, some of those, for example, if we live, mental sick person, we have to sympathize and help whatever we could, but someone foolish people, if we live a foolish people doing all of drug addicts, for example, there is a drug addict, he is foolish. 
If we should not live with those guys associated, when we get a bad reputation, we might involve with the drugs with him, or we might get in a legal trouble ourselves. 
This type of people we have to avoid, but mentally sick person, of course we have to help, but we don't have to suffer and sad. 
So how do you separate away, if you really care and love this person, then how do you separate? Separation means detachment. 
Attachment is the number one thing. 
For example, someone married to some lady, and she has some mental problems, and as a human being, we cannot abandon her. 
However, there are so many hospitals, mental institutes, she might be better than staying at home with me, put in there, she might be good because they are caring very well those nurses and hospital doctors, we have to put those type of institutes. 
There are so many health places, but we don't have to suffer keeping at home, why my responsibility, I married to her, my responsibility, I had to keep her at home, I had to take care of all the time. 
It is not easy task, and we are not professional doctors, we don't have 24 hours to take care of her, that time we have to put in some kind of channel and get some support, community support, friend support and medical support we have to get. 
So we don't have to alone taking these things to suffer ourselves. 
That's why I need a spiritual friend again, then spiritual friend guide you how to do, how to handle those things. 
Yes. 
I noticed when you were talking about protection, you listed self, protecting ourselves, and then property or our possessions, and then family. 
I was surprised that possessions or property came before family. 
What I am explaining to the five principle, five precepts, Buddha says, pāṇāti pātāvera mani sikha fadan samādhyāmi. 
It means I undertake the precept, abstain from killing. 
When we do not kill any beings, or any living beings, we do not want anyone to come and kill me or kill anyone. 
Therefore, this principle, Buddha, designed to protect our families, all of living beings, to protect not to hurt or not to kill or injured. 
Second thing is Buddha says, adinādāna vera mani sikha fadan samādhyāmi. 
I undertake the precept, abstain from stealing. 
In other words, without anyone's permission, we should not take anything from others. 
I don't like to someone without permission come to enter to my back and take in my wallet or my money or my pen or anything, my phone. 
I do the same way. 
You may not want to, even though I am a monk, I come to get to your purse and get in the money. 
You may not like it. 
That is the way, they designed this principle to protect our properties, the Buddha. 
Third one, kāme su mīcchācāra vera mani sikha fadan samādhyāmi. 
I undertake the precept, abstain from sexual misconduct. 
Sexual misconduct means someone married, men or women have to live together, not to go with another woman or not to another man. 
Going that family institute break, they are not trusting each other, the other family also, for example, the men go to another woman, that man and woman are going to fight, therefore that institute is going to break. 
So they put the design, this principle, to protect our family values, family institute to live harmoniously. 
Same thing with the other one. 
The fourth one says, mūsāvādā vera mani sikha fadan samādhyāmi. 
I undertake the precept, abstain from lying. 
When we lie, we feel guilty, also may be hurt in others, also the people hear that putting me down, and this guy is a liar, and if I go to say to lie to counselor, counselor cannot help me, if I lie to the lawyer, he cannot lie, he cannot help me, if I tell to the doctor, he may not able to help me either. 
They have one happiness, to happy people, happy institute, if we are truth, telling the truth, we are going to be happy institute. 
Finally, sūrā meri madjapamādā tāna vera mani sikha fadan samādhyāmi. 
I undertake the precept, abstain from alcohol and drugs. 
Alcohol and drugs, what does for us? Alcohol and drugs, physically, mentally, both way we make us, we get a sickness. 
Our physical sicknesses, some, I saw so many reports, even I happen to know many people who, death because of alcohol, they are liver damage, many many things, also mental damage. 
So, would they design this principle to protect our health, mental and physical health? That's why I explain this five principle, that's the way. 
Yeah, I was asking apart from the precepts, when you listed protecting self, and then property, and then family, perhaps you didn't mean that property was, should come before family. 
Property, you weren't necessarily listing them in the order of importance, is that right? No, not important, they had to explain the, not first one, this one, second one, this one, no, this one, no, everything was together. 
You mean, you thought that much better to put the life first, then family, then property, that's what you thought, huh? Thank you, your thought is good, but it is okay to this way too. 
Any questions? Like this? Can you speak a little bit more about Shraddha or faith? My concept of faith is probably a little bit different from Buddhism's faith. 
I come from Hindu tradition? No, I'm Buddhist and from Sri Lanka. 
Shraddha, Dhanang, Seela, Dhanang, Hiryottapya, Dhanang. 
Shraddha means in the, Shraddha nothing to do with the blind faith. 
There is two terms in Buddhism and Hinduism. 
Buddhism called Shraddha, Hinduism called Bhakti. 
Bhakti, you are faith on the God, Bhakti. 
To do fear, you have a faith on God or anyone, that is called Bhakti. 
Shraddha nothing to do with fear. 
Shraddha, see in good things. 
For example, when we see in iti pisso, bhagava, arahang, samma, sambuddhu, vijja, charna, sampanuvya, see in Buddha's greatest qualities, nine greatest qualities, we have a confidence on Him. 
We have a great affection on Him. 
We know this path is correctly right. 
For example, you are meditating when you get some good results. 
You are happy about that. 
That is called Shraddha. 
Shraddha is, you know, as a Sri Lankan person, I had to tell something. 
No, it's good for everybody's. 
You know, sometimes some people have a Shraddha, it is, they are mixed up with the blind faith. 
In I was a young monk in Sri Lanka, with my teacher, I went to one of our teacher, went to one house for house blessing, chanting. 
When we go, we have to go villages. 
I'm coming from very rural area, southern part of Sri Lanka. 
Then we have to walk for the house to house. 
One old lady take a broom and clean in the garden. 
Nicely she is cleaning the garden. 
Very old lady. 
She has a lot of faith. 
See, immediately our Lakoham Dhruv saw, immediately ran to Lakoham Dhruv, high priest, and she, the broom is a big broom. 
See, again she put the broom, the high priest, and kneel down and worship. 
I started laughing. 
Do you understand singleist? Sometimes when we are going to have too much faith, it becomes a blind faith. 
Therefore Shraddha is nothing to do faith actually. 
Shraddha is confident. 
Shraddha is kind of a achievement. 
Shraddha is kind of a good result. 
See, in the result you are happy. 
However in Buddhism, give a very number one priority to Shraddha. 
Sat means good, dha means holding good thing. 
We are holding good thing in our heart. 
Sat dha means good thing, dha means holding. 
Good thing holds in our heart. 
What are the good things in our heart? Loving kindness, compassion, apricity, joy, and equanimity, those types of things, if we have our heart and our mind, that is called sada. 
Sat means good thing holding the good things. 
In the verbally I say this. 
Even sada, asad, if you know any Sanskrit scholars here, you know asad in the Greek way also explains, sat means good thing, asad means bad thing. 
Sat means in Pali also called good thing. 
Dha means holding, dharati. 
Pali called dharati, holding good things. 
In other words, you have good confidence and good trust. 
Any other questions? Yes? Can you explain the difference between loving kindness and compassion? Yes, that is a very good question. 
Mitha, karuna, muditha, upekha, like call four sublime states. 
Mitha means loving kindness, karuna means compassion. 
If you have alone mitha or karuna, sometimes you are getting trouble but you have to equally balance. 
Mitha means most towards yourself. 
When we meditate in, may I be well, happy, peaceful and prosperous, may no harm come to me, may no difficulties come to me, may no problems come to me like that way, private to you, to yourself. 
Same way you have to treat others like you treat yourself. 
That is called mitha. 
However, karuna is action. 
Karuna jumping over and compassionate way you go and help others. 
For example, when someone comes to you and says, oh, my brother is in the jail, I had to bail out before tomorrow. 
I need $5,000. 
So you have to pay your rent tomorrow, but you are extremely compassionate. 
You go to immediately go to bank, get a $5,000 to give to that person. 
He may be said the true, may be not the true, but you are very filled with compassion without thinking yourself. 
You have to pay rent and you have to pay car payment. 
You give whatever you have money, then you are big trouble. 
Compassion and love have to balance equally. 
Compassion is a very nice thing. 
This is the Pali words I explained in both explanations. 
Mithasabhavo metta. 
The loving kindness means like you are treating your friend, good friend very nicely. 
Paradukke hadayang kampanititi karuna. 
Compassion means when you saw someone suffering, same you going to suffer. 
That gentleman mentioned earlier, he has more compassion. 
When someone suffers, you are going to suffer from the same mistakes. 
However, Buddha says you have to balance equally. 
If you are not balanced, you get in trouble. 
I think I am missing the balancing part. 
So balancing between metta and compassion? Yes. 
What is karuna? Karuna means compassion. 
Metta means loving kindness. 
Any other questions? What time is it now? 11. 
30? So 11. 
30, now time to have lunch after lunch. 
Maybe we can further discuss and meditate and so forth. 
Keep all your questions now. 
Maybe later you can ask me.
