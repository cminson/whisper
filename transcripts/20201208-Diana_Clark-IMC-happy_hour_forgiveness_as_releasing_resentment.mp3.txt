The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Yeah, so today I would like to continue on this theme of forgiveness just because it's a tender
topic and these recordings, you know, these means that we have, they're recorded and they
get put up. Of course, not what happens in the breakout rooms, but what I'm seeing gets recorded
and I'm just envisioning that there might be a time in which it's nice to have a resource,
that when we find ourselves stuck in resentment and we just can't find our way out or we can't
find a way through or something like that, that maybe it would be helpful to know that these
exist, that these little talks exist. So I want to just flesh out a little bit more this idea
of forgiveness and we'll practice it. But one thing that I find is really interesting,
or maybe I'll back up a little bit, one way to think about forgiveness is that it's a way in
which we can release resentment. So and when we think about resentment, I guess it means like
to feel again, resent like sentimental, you know, kind of feeling. So resentment and it has this
emphasis on like the past kind of really like being going over and over and old injury or
revisiting the hurt or the sense of powerlessness or the rage or the fear, the sadness, the feeling
of being wronged. And often kind of resentment has this feeling of we're just scraping off the scab
off of the wound again and again, and so that the wound is always painful and uncomfortable.
This is a tender topic. It's such a tender topic because maybe there's one way to think about
resentment is that it's this resistance, this reluctance, this refusal, this hesitation,
and a fear to cross this bridge of sadness, because maybe to acknowledge the, to begin with
forgiveness, somehow we have to acknowledge the sadness that's there. And so there might be a way
in which we're thinking, no, thank you, I don't want to go there. So somehow we find ourselves
kind of stuck in the resentment, partly because of this fear of this ocean of sadness that might
be underneath it. We should honor and respect that there is absolutely no requirement, right,
for us to forgive. There's no obligation. There's no timetable. There should be no pressure.
But part of what I want to do here is just help provide the tools. So if there comes a time and
the fact that these are recorded, that you can come back, and maybe there'll be a support for you.
If there is a time that it feels like some forgiveness or working with resentment in a
different way feels appropriate for you. And I discovered this some research that was done
quite some time ago about forgiveness. And the researchers were asking people who had been
suffered victimization, and I don't know any of the details of the specifics of that,
but that they were now not harboring resentment. And the researchers were asking them, well,
how did you do that? How did you get to the other side of this difficult thing and so that you no
longer have resentments? And the individuals, they didn't describe a specific act of forgiving.
It's not like they just once said, oh, okay, I forgive you and boom, it was over, right? Of
course, it's not neat and tidy like that. But what they instead what they discovered
is that those individuals who no longer had resentment and had some serenity,
that was the word that they used around whatever troubling thing that happened,
that they described that they just discovered that they had forgiven, that they just discovered,
oh, yeah, I don't hold this resentment anymore. So it kind of just slipped away without them
making it happen. It kind of like slipped away when the conditions were right for that to happen.
So this idea is not something that we have to force or make happen, but we can create the
conditions in which some letting go with some resentment can happen. There's probably lots
of things that have to come into place, including our having a certain sense of security and safety
and well-being or having resources to support us if we're going to cross this ocean of sadness
or difficulty that's associated with them, whatever it is that we still have resentment about.
But something that I like this idea is when researching those individuals who had forgiven,
the one person was quoted as saying, the harder I tried to forgive, the more I seemed to resent.
So I just want that to kind of color our practice, that we're not forcing ourselves,
we're just helping to create the conditions and maybe recognizing that there might be a time
that something like this might be helpful. Maybe that time isn't now,
but an encouragement for all of us to respect and honor our process
and working with some of these difficulties. Not because we have to forgive, but just because
so that we can no longer be like chained to the past, but instead can be
finding our way forward in a way that has some more ease and freedom
at a pace that feels right for you and in a manner that feels right for you.
So I just want to offer some tools that you can pick up when it feels like it's helpful
and put them down if they don't feel like it's helpful, if the time isn't right,
if for whatever reason it doesn't feel like it's right. Keep on saying this, but I think it bears
repeating, there's absolutely no obligation. It's not like you should or you have to.
That's the last thing we want here, right, is having that burden, but I just want to offer
a way to approach this if it feels like something that would be helpful. Okay, and then maybe I'll
say again to you, I think I said this at the end last time, but not everybody is there after the
breakout course, that these meditations are just a little tweak on what JetCornfield has developed.
So I'm borrowing these from him. Many of you know he's one of the founders of Buddhism in the West,
and he's also a psychotherapist, and so sometimes he includes things that aren't
clearly Buddhist, but are helpful and supportive, and forgiveness is one of those things. We don't
find it in the early Buddhist teachings, but it's one of those qualities of the heart that can really
support the advent of life of greater freedom and peace and ease. Okay, so with that as an introduction,
we can take an alert at bright posture
and allow the body to
settle in to feel connected or feel grounded in this moment. I'm just muting a few of
you just so that the audio can be clear.
And to arrive at this moment,
often the easiest way, not always, but often the easiest way is to connect to
the bodily sensations.
Of course, the body is here in this moment. Where else could it be?
It's only the mind that travels to their moments,
and feeling the sense of aliveness, of awareness
when we embody our posture, the experience of sitting here.
We can do a little bit of a body scan,
a phase in the area where we often hold tension,
the shoulders, I mean, the shoulder blades lie down the back
and the chest, is there a way in which the chest can be
open, maybe just a little bit more.
And feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body,
feeling connected, grounded, we're here right now.
And then I'm letting the attention rest on the sensations of breathing.
Just noticing the inhales and how they feel different than exhalations.
It's natural that the mind will wander, chances are you've been thinking all day long.
So we just very simply, gently begin again.
Inhabiting, feeling, embody the sensations of breathing.
And then we'll do just a little bit of loving kindness practice, kind of to
it's opportunity to dip into some warm heartedness, if it's available, to bringing to mind a lovable being.
Someone, when you bring them to mind, the heart smiles in some kind of way.
This might be somebody you have an actual relationship with, you have an uncomplicated
relationship. It would be somebody that you know, but don't have a relationship with somebody that is
somebody that is maybe it's been a teacher, mentor, coach, or guide for you. Maybe it's a furry friend.
Maybe it's an imaginal, in your imagination, kitten, puppy's, baby.
And bringing this lovable being to mind. And if you can, maybe to feel that warm heartedness
that you have for this lovable being,
that might be a physical sensation, maybe it's more a mood or attitude.
It helps support the cultivation of loving kindness. You can see these phrases.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
What would it be like to marinate in this warm heartedness?
Maybe it's helpful to refresh the image or refresh the sense of connection.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
In this warm hearted place in which we are extending goodwill to another, can we appreciate
ourselves, appreciate this, cultivating this goodwill? It's a beautiful thing we're doing.
It's a beautiful thing. Whether you actually are experiencing goodwill or not,
but just to have that intention to incline the mind that way.
And then to begin some forgiveness practice.
Again, there's absolutely no requirement.
It feels appropriate for you. You can stay with loving kindness practice or mindfulness practice.
We can do some forgiveness practice starting forgiving ourselves for the ways that we've harmed
ourselves. We can use this phrase.
There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or anger
in which I have harmed the trade or abandoned myself,
either knowingly or unknowingly for the ways I've hurt myself through action or in action.
And now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
There are many ways through my pain, fear, confusion or anger
in which I've harmed the trade or abandoned myself, either knowingly or unknowingly.
For the ways I've hurt myself through action or in action.
And now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
For the ways I've hurt myself. And now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
For the ways I've hurt myself.
For the ways I've hurt myself. And now extend a full and heartfelt forgiveness.
And now we can expand our forgiveness.
Put it in a different direction perhaps.
There are many ways that I've hurt or harmed others. I've betrayed or abandoned them.
Cause them suffering knowingly or unknowingly out of my pain, fear, anger or confusion.
I ask for your forgiveness.
There are many ways that I've hurt or harmed others. I've betrayed or abandoned them.
Cause them suffering knowingly or unknowingly out of my pain, fear, anger or confusion.
I ask for your forgiveness.
I ask for your forgiveness.
I ask for your forgiveness.
There are many ways that I've hurt and harmed others. I've betrayed or abandoned them. Cause
them suffering knowingly or unknowingly out of my pain, fear, anger or confusion.
I ask for your forgiveness.
I ask for your forgiveness.
I ask for your forgiveness.
And then one more direction for a forgiveness practice. There are many ways that I have been
harmed by others, abused or abandoned knowingly or unknowingly in thought, word or deed.
But if there are fear, pain, confusion or anger,
I have carried this pain in my heart for too long.
To the extent that I am ready,
I offer them forgiveness.
To the extent that I am ready, I offer them forgiveness.
To the extent that I am ready, I offer them forgiveness.
I ask for your forgiveness.
There are many ways that I have been harmed by others,
oppressed, abused or abandoned knowingly or unknowingly in thought, word or deed.
But if there are fear, pain, confusion or anger,
I have carried this pain in my heart for too long.
To the extent that I am ready, I offer them forgiveness.
To the extent that I am ready, I offer them forgiveness.
To the extent that I am ready, I offer them forgiveness.
Why don't we do a little bit of mindfulness breathing,
just coming back,
feeling embodied,
feeling the movements of the body as it breathes.
Just breathe them in breath and out breath.
And then to end this meditation, feel your feet on the ground,
feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body.
And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
Yeah, so forgiveness says that it's part of that family of hard practices,
and maybe in the way in which we kind of hold resentments sometimes in our heart,
if we can use that kind of language, you know, heart, mind,
but the way in which maybe we can find a little bit more freedom or space so we can
go forward in a way that is supportive for us and allows us to find more and more
freedom and space and ease.
So now is the time that those of you who have been coming here that I would to put you into
small groups, but before we do that, I want to let you know
so there's this question for that forgiveness
chats are kept together. Yeah, I could do that. I can have them be together upon audio
German so that they're both separate and together. So I'm very pleased to say that,
you know, it's just a beautiful thing that for all these times so many of us have been coming
together and, you know, night after night and practicing together. And there has been some
request that, well, you know, can't can we connect like outside of this setting and maybe share
resources or talk about ideas or, you know, I don't know exactly what's happening in the
small group discussions, but you know, can maybe continue threads there. And so we're happy to
say that there is now there's been created a forum that's for people who participate in happy hour
that exists when happy hour isn't happening will exist all the time now.
And and here's the link that Neil just posted. Neil is such thank you very much. I really
have a deep bow. Just Neil said this would be such a nice thing if we can connect with one
another. And if we could have a place in which we can share. So it's here in the chat box.
So you can click on this and you'll find yourself in a Google group. And an opportunity to connect
with others. It's more like just a forum. So a person posts and other people comment on it. So
thank you, Neil. Thank you, Neil. I think this is something that'll really support many of us,
especially in these days of the pandemic. So and because so many of us are first
we're strewn across the planet now, which is a beautiful thing. So we will never see what
our chances are, right? Well, I shouldn't say never, but we don't know what happens by that.
So thank you. Thank you, everybody for I don't know this. It's a beautiful thing that we all
come together and practice in this way. It's a beautiful thing. So now I'd like to put you
into some small groups. So you can talk about this forgiveness practice, or you can talk
about this new forum that Neil created for us. That's in there. And I'm going to put you into groups
of three or four. And we'll just meet for maybe 10 minutes today. And we can go by let's see the
person who goes first will go hopefully this isn't too complicated, reverse order by birth month. So
if you're born in December, you go first. If you're born in January, go last. And that can just
help going around the circle. And I say this every time, but I think it's sometimes helpful to
just remind you there's no prerequisite not for like a big monologue, but just share one or two
ideas and then let it go to the next person and let it go to the next person and then maybe
comes back around to you. And you might have some new ideas. So in this way, it's more like sharing
of ideas and creating something new together with the people contributing. Okay, have fun.
Okay, so welcome back. Welcome back.
Would anybody have like to share a comment or question or how it was in the small group or
maybe something about the forums? Yes, here's Neil. He's still here. Neil,
you're over there on the right side of the screen earlier. You're on the left side of the screen.
So he might have some questions if we're able to answer some questions if there are some.
Yes, Vicki. Yeah, I was thinking in terms of forgiveness, sometimes we people confuse who
the victim is. And while I was thinking about this, the example that came to my mind was the whole
Me Too movement of these women who were the victims. But then they might have thought that
they were doing something wrong by being too flirtatious or so forth. And so in the forgiveness
practice, sometimes we want to forgive ourselves for doing things, but those may not be
things that we should be thinking of as being wrong. Yeah, this is such a good point.
For me, I find it helpful, this idea that forgiveness is letting go of resentment. So
everything like wherever there's resentment, that's a place where we can work with forgiveness.
And as opposed to exactly what happened or who is the victim, I think it's just an opportunity
for us to make space in our hearts, to open up our hearts and minds, and in any way that makes
sense for us and that without any sense of obligation or that we should. So I'm assuming
that people will just work with that differently. Different people will work with that differently.
Does that make sense, Vicky? Yeah, thank you. Anybody else have a comment or a question?
Christine, I thought that you were raising your hand, but no, you're just paying attention to
your furry little friend there. That's so cute. Is she on your shoulders? That's so cute.
Yes, Iran. Hi, I'm just once again amazed at how powerful this practice is. I'm really glad
that you've introduced us to Happy Hour. It's really powerful. It speaks deeply.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Abraham. Diana, I was going to say with respect to our furry friends,
I happen to be a huge animal lover, and they always forgive us for whatever we do.
That's one of the great gifts of having animals. We can really screw up and they forget it in 10
minutes. Yeah. We need creatures like that in our lives. Yes, absolutely. May we become
that way for others and with whomever we can, right? Can we be a way in which we are able to
meet people with warmheartedness and care again and again and again? Does anybody else have a comment
or a question?
Okay.
Okay, so just a deep bow, a deep bow to all of you for your practice. It's really
such a delight that we come together in this way and set this intention to
bring more warmth and openheartedness into the world. This is what the world needs.
This is important work that we're doing. And sometimes it is work too, right? Sometimes we
get up against walls. I don't want to. That's okay. That's okay. That's how it is sometimes.
So if you like, we can all unmute ourselves and we can say goodbye. So bye. Thank you.
Thank you. Goodbye. Thanks Diana. Thanks Diana. Nice to see you again Marie.
Thank you. Thank you. I have to meet you all one day. Yes, you have to come to California.
Yes, absolutely. So how do you get on this website? What time is it on? When are they meeting?
It's any time. What? It's a forum. It's only typing and it's all the time. Oh, I see.
You just post whatever you feel like and see if anybody else shows up to answer you.
That's so fun. Neil and I have done a brief introduction and so maybe everyone just would
like to do the same so we can all get to know each other a bit better. That's great. I think it's
great. Yeah, it's fantastic. I'm very excited. Diana, I'm for helping to answer. Yeah, Neil did
this all. So clever bunny. Clever bunny. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Thank you again. Bye Diana.
Bye bye. Have a wonderful evening all. Yes, yes. What happened to being in Australia? Have a good
afternoon. Good afternoon here in Sydney. Yes. Bye. Bye bye.
