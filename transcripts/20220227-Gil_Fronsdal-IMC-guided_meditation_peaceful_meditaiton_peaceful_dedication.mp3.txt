 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning everyone. Those of you here, welcome to IMCE. For some of you, it might be one of the largest gatherings you've even been to in the last two years. And if that's the case, welcome. And I appreciate maybe that it's a big deal for your heart to do this. And for those of you who are online, welcome. And I appreciate that we have such a wide ranging community coming together to meditate this day. So, I'll do this meditation of what I offer in two parts. What I'll say a few words now and then I'll follow up with that with the dedication of merit. And to begin with, I'd like to say that it's a little bit hard to hear. It's a little bit soft. Should I increase the volume a little bit? So, let's see. So, if I listen in silence to see if it got louder, it doesn't work. Is that louder now? You could also use the hearing system devices. They work still. So, I'd like to say to start is one of the principles, especially in meditation, that may be easier to understand here than anywhere else, but it applies in many other places in our life. And that is that peace begins in our own hearts. That peace begins for each individual. It starts here in ourselves rather than looking for it in the world around us. And in meditation, if you can't start with peace in your own heart, then we have peace in our speech, at least out loud when we're not speaking. And ideally, we have peaceful speech in our own minds, how we talk about ourselves, we're talking about what's going on. We try to do it in a way that's coming from a place of peace, of compassion, of care, generosity. If we can't do that, then in meditation, we're doing it with our body. We're sitting in a peaceful posture, a posture in which we're not going to move particularly unless you have to make yourself more comfortable. So, it's not a posture in which you're going to punch someone out. This time, this is a peaceful posture. And to take refuge in the posture, take refuge and inspiration for these minutes that this is a place of peace, this body. Take refuge in whatever way in which your mind can speak peacefully. Take refuge in that interest, intention, desire to do so. And it might be more important to take refuge in the desire to do so than our ability to do so. It might be more inspiring and meaningful to be with people and people in self who have this wish to work and go in this direction. And perhaps in your hearts, maybe take refuge in your heart's capacity to sit in such a way that it's peaceful. And peaceful means, in my understanding, is that it's a heart that wishes to do no harm, and wants to avoid causing harm anywhere to self or others. And this is one of the great things to do in this world. And that kind of peace begins with ourselves. So to assume this posture, meditation, a posture that's meant to be a peaceful posture, and to gently close your eyes. And it's possible you don't feel particularly peaceful. And that's okay as you start meditation. It's okay, beginning of meditation, is the beginning of being at peace with what is. So if we're agitated or angry, upset, it's okay. Because here we're going to meet everything that is occurring with an openness, with a willingness to be present and see it without condemning anything for these minutes, just to be present for how it goes in us. Taking a few minutes to feel your body. How's your body now? And then within this body is the breathing. And from this place within where breathing, the in-breath begins. Take a long, slow, deep inhale. And as you exhale, relax your body. Relax into here now, the present moment. And then letting your breathing return to normal. With a normal breathing, for a few rounds of exhales, continue to relax your body. And relaxing is a movement towards peace, towards being peaceful, calm. And then letting go of relaxing the body. Instead, for a few rounds of breathing, if it's possible, relax your breathing. Kind of a lightening up, softening and breathing. Allowing the body to breathe itself. Not trying to use your breathing or influence or affect your breathing, do the breathing, but kind of getting out of the way of breathing and accompanying it with your attention. Maybe the idea of being side by side with your breathing. Whatever way that you can easily do so, accompany your breathing peacefully with a peaceful attention. As if peace is your offering, what you offer your breathing. Thank you. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of the singing, the dedication of merit, of care for the world is not an addendum to meditation. It's an expression, a peaceful expression that arises out of a peaceful heart. It's not a duty, obligation, but rather a continuation of the care that we offer to ourselves as we meditate. A care that then spreads outwards into the world. It's also a wise thing to do for oneself. If you want to be peaceful, offer peace to others. If you want safety, be a safe person for others. If you want to see, heal your sadness or your anger, be a healing presence for the sadness and anger of others. If you want to be understood, understand others, take the time to know them and their challenges. We could offer ourselves and our presence the way we are, the way we attend, they're aware of others. We can offer so much that may it be that as we end this meditation, that we offer our concern and care and kind regard for others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. May everyone that's been affected by the fighting and crisis of Ukraine, may they find a way to peace and happiness and freedom. May all the forces of goodness in this world come forth at this point to offer this goodness to the world. May we offer our goodness and may it spread from us into the world. Thank you.
