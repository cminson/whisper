 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. We'll start with about a half an hour sitting, as we usually do. I'll offer a little bit of a guided meditation at the beginning of the sitting. Relating with yourself in your body. with however your body and mind are in this moment. And you just kind of greet yourself, checking in, how are you? How are you right now? Not a trying to figure out, but a feeling into, not a thinking about how you are, but a touching into, a feeling into. How is your body heavy, tense, light, tight or open? Maybe some places tense, other places relaxed. Just allowing your body to reveal to you how it is. And seeing if the awareness can simply meet that without holding onto it or pushing it away. Just acknowledging it's like this right now. Our system likes that kind of attention. It likes to be met with honesty, without resistance, just this. It's like this right now. And also checking in with how your mind is. Are there worries, concerns? Is the mind at ease or tense? Is it thinking about the past or future? Is it relaxed? Okay with what's here. And however the mind is also, awareness can hold that too. Just touching in. Oh it's like this in the mind right now. Sometimes when we open to and acknowledge just how we are. If there's tension in the body or worries or concerns in the mind. Sometimes just the acknowledgement of, oh this is how it is right now. Allows there to be a natural softening of tension that might be held. A softening of worries or concerns. But sometimes that happens. And it's useful to, at the beginning of a sitting, check in and see how you are and whether this kind of meeting of our experience allows for some letting go. And sometimes that doesn't happen. And we're with our experience and we just notice, oh there's tension here. There's worries or concerns there. So sometimes it does support us to touch into those areas a little more closely in the body. Perhaps areas where there may be tension and invite there to be some relaxation. Maybe the body can relax. Maybe areas where there is tension can be released. And maybe too, worries and concerns in the mind might be able to just be set aside. Not engaged with. Maybe they don't have to stop. We also don't need to be involved with them. So maybe there can be some space. Exploring the possibility of relaxing the body. Relaxing the mind. Any little bit of relaxation that can happen can support our natural capacity to be aware. As the body and mind relax, aren't caught up in thoughts or worries, concerns about the past, the future. Quite naturally what they do, what our minds do is notice what's happening right now. And so what is obvious in your experience right now? Often there's some body sensation that's quite obvious. Maybe the contact of your body against the chair, cushion. Maybe touch points of your hands or feet. Maybe the sensations of the breathing. Exploring what's obvious, we kind of let experience come to us rather than aiming or directing, trying to look for anything in particular. Just relax and notice what's here. What's obvious. Sometimes what's obvious, the attention may linger with something obvious for a little while. It might linger with the breath for a breath or two or more. It might linger with the sense of the body, the whole body sitting here, a broader sense of the experience of the whole body. Or it might, attention might shift from one thing to another. It might be with a breath for a few moments and then shift to noticing that hearing is happening. Maybe linger with hearing for a few moments and then shift back to a different body sensation. Maybe touching into a breath and then noticing the thought in the mind or an emotion, a mood. This kind of receiving of experience, each moment, maybe something new, maybe lingering with something for a while, but just a changing flow of our human experience. This is a cultivation of mindfulness and a cultivation of that stability of mindfulness over time, not stable with one experience, but an awareness that's stable, meeting one thing after another. Relax. Receiving whatever is obvious, allowing awareness to do the receiving. And you will probably notice at some point that you're waking up having been lost for a few moments. That will happen quite normally. In that moment, before when we were wandering, there's not much to do about it, but that moment when we recognize awareness is back. Right then, notice that you are aware again and awareness is aware of something. What is it aware of? Maybe it's aware of a thought. Maybe it's woken up with a sound or a body sensation. What's obvious? As the mindfulness returns, I think there can be a curiosity of receiving. What's obvious in the next moment, in the next moment, in the next moment? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
