The three first foundations of meditation practices, and the fourth are a collection of teachings
that support the practice, the teachings of awakening.
In the first foundation it's of the body.
We've been practicing with the first three of six practices of mindfulness of breathing,
bringing mindfulness to the bodily posture, bringing mindfulness to the day-to-day activities.
Just so you know, there's three other practices within this foundation that may just naturally begin to arise within your practice,
and so it's part of the domain of the totality of what it is to be a human being.
There's a practice on the anatomical parts of the body called the 32 parts of the body meditation.
There's a meditation on the composition of the body made of primary elements of solids, liquids, motion, and temperature.
There's also a practice on the mindfulness of death in different stages of decomposition.
This practice of one day, I know, will be otherwise.
The second foundation has to do with feeling tones.
The third is of mind states, and tomorrow we'll enter into mind states.
But for today we're going to be bringing awareness into feeling tones.
And it's helpful with this practice to continue to be grounded in the body, this breathing body,
or sensing into the sensations that are present, or the sounds that are occurring.
So this grounding in the body, but being aware from time to time of different feeling tones of experience.
You can psychology, they sometimes refer to as hedonic feeling tones, or the valence.
But for me, I like to make things simple, and it's kind of like the immediacy of a reaction, of gut reaction.
And so from time to time as we're sitting, we'll be aware that there may be a pleasant feeling at times,
or an unpleasant one, or sometimes it's in between, it's neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
It's neutral, or indifferent, it's not very prominent, very noticeable,
but often we're going between these three throughout the day and night.
Pleasant feeling, an unpleasant one, a neutral one.
And so our practice is to become aware at times when there's something pleasant that's arising,
or something unpleasant, or something that's neither, just to know it.
The significance of this particular practice, and it's amazing when we look at these four foundations,
that a whole foundation is dedicated to its feeling tones, because in the chain of reactivity,
the chain of action, sometimes called, actually it's called a paticca semipata, or dependent origination,
in this particular chain of sequential events, it points to a wheel that creates suffering, reactivity.
And in these steps of the sequential reactions, feeling tones are very early in that sequence.
If we can become aware that we're getting activated very, it's more sooner than later,
we can perhaps circumvent a whole litany, a whole novel, a whole trilogy of reactivity.
So catching it close, oh here's unpleasant, to know it, to experience it, to understand it.
And like all things, it has beginning, middle, and ends, it comes and goes,
just like the breath we've been breathing, goes in and out, sounds of being listened to,
arising and passing, or different sensations, appearing and gradually leaving.
So too these feeling tones of experience are coming and going.
Last night I was speaking about my grandson, who's nearly six months old.
And he's just beginning to get introduced to food.
And I remember our niece, Nafi, being introduced to food, and you know, when there was a berry coming in her mouth,
there was an immediate, mmm, and if there was something else, it was like, eh.
So it's like the immediacy of that experience.
It's like when my dog sees me put on my shoes, she knows it's a W-A-L-K.
She's starting to whack her tail, she's starting getting really excited.
And of course sometimes, I used to do a lot of traveling, I don't anymore,
but when my dog would see me open up the suitcase, she'd kind of put her head in between her two paws.
It's like, oh no, he's going out, he's leaving.
So there's certain types of an immediacy, a gut reaction to things.
Sometimes we don't even barely notice.
It's only much later, like a snowball that's going down a mountain that becomes an avalanche.
So it's, pardon me.
So in this chain of reactivity, a chain of creating the wheel of suffering,
my teacher, Tampu Luciado, he used to give a very simple explanation of this process.
And simply what he'd say is that if you know, you can break the cycle.
If you don't know, you will go around and around.
This is dependent origination.
So if you know, you can begin to break the cycle of reactivity,
because you're catching it really early and circumventing all this reaction.
But if you don't know, you go around and around and around.
So here in the practice, we'll be sitting, as we have been sitting with ourselves, and being with the breath, being with the body.
And from time to time, definitely, there'll be times when something might be pulling you in one direction
or another towards something pleasant or unpleasant.
And just to know it, recognize it, to acknowledge it, to breathe into it if you want.
But simply to just know that these tones of experience, they're like weather systems.
I grew up in the Boston area and actually was getting some feedback.
Oh, some of the words you say sound like you're from Boston.
And you know what we say in Boston is, you know, how's the weather?
Well, like, wait a minute, because it's changing dramatically often.
And so the weather systems of these feeling tones, so many coming and going.
Just to be known, you don't have to analyze it and try to figure it out.
Sometimes just in the knowing and the experiencing, it will reveal more about us trying to do anything with it.
The feeling tones are these impressions or cut reactions to things that are not as complex
as it gets involved into thoughts and emotions and figuring out this and that.
But there's tones of experience and just to know them, oh, here's unpleasant.
Maybe that you've been off in a whole story reacting to this or reacting to that,
but then all of a sudden you realize, oh, here's the story and here's the unpleasant feeling.
Or here's the pleasant feeling, to know it's on either way.
Just to know these feelings, these feeling tones are coming and going as part of experience.
Again, as we do the practice, just continue to ground in the body, the breath expanding to sounds
or sensations being grounded.
And just experiencing a knowing feeling tones as they come and they go.
Pleasant, unpleasant.
Sometimes you're like, huh, it's just kind of neutral right now.
It's just to be known, to be experienced.
Being present.

Just being aware of these different feeling tones and just sure that whatever reason I lost completely
the ability to unmute myself.
Had to log out and log back in.
In the middle of it, it was like, oh, here's an unpleasant feeling.
It's just carrying on, it's feeling tones calming and going, and of course the pleasant
feeling of back on again.
I can talk, you can hear me.
It's being present.
