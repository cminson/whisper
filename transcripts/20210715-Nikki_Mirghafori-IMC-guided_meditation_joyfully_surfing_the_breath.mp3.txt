 Hello, greetings, International Sangha, dear friends, dear siblings in the Dharma inhabiting our shared planet Earth. And I greet you in this moment in time from Mountain View, California, from my home, from virtual IMC, a virtual background. I'm actually using Zoom to YouTube, hence the difference in audio and why I can beam in without needing to sit as usually guilt us, hence the explanation. So let's continue our practice together. We've been exploring various supportive conditions, supportive practices for samadhi, for calming the mind, for settling the mind, for unification, for concentration. So just a quick review of the techniques we're building upon. We started with relinquishing, relinquishing what is not helpful, putting aside what is not needed. And then the other side of the coin of relinquishment is turning our attention, our wise attention to what is actually here, what's already here, not the distractions outside. But what is joyful, what is delightful, what is wonderful in the simplicity of the present moment right here, right now. So instead of the stick, the carrot, what is delicious here to have contentment and peace with what is already here, to recognize what is already here. And we continue with the invitation to relax, to soften the body, to open up the body so that the mind can relax and can settle a relaxed sati, a relaxed mode of mindfulness, drawing inspiration from the Buddha under the rose apple tree, as well as the simile of the cowherder under the tree. When the harvest has been done, so there's a sense of relaxed spatial awareness. So we'll bring all of these in today, in addition to the new theme today that we'll be adding, all of these are interrelated, all of them depend on one another, is gentle perseverance, gentle persistence, coming back, keep coming back, keep coming back, you need to relinquish, it's okay, keep coming back, relax the body, notice the simple delight, joy of the pleasant moment, keep coming back, keep coming back, but gently, atapi is one of my favorite words in the suttas, especially shows up in Satipatthana sutta, the four foundations of mindfulness sutta, the four establishments of mindfulness sutta. Atapi, gentle perseverance, so it's not a forceful perseverance, it's not a jackhammer, like, okay, bring the mind back, yank it back, bad mind, it's not like that. It's the force of a feather, but it's repeated, bring the feather back, bring it back, bring it back, gently, kindly, patiently, a thousand times, maybe more during a 30 minute sit, without grudges, without judgment, self-recombination, just gently, okay, all right, distracted puta in this moment, okay, gently back, atapi, gentle persistence, gentle persistence. So with the basis of everything we have been cultivating, turning our attention to this week, and now today, special attention to this gentle persistence coming back, and I'll say more about both this and Vitaka and Vichara, which are essential to translate them, initial application of the mind with the breath, with the object, and sustained application. So initial application, as if you touch the breath, you gently bring back the attention, touch the breath, and sustained attention, as if you're rubbing your bowl, as if you're rubbing your bowl with a cloth, you rub the breath with your attention, gently coming back, initial application, sustained application, until the attention drops, drops away, and then again, again, and again. So a day for cultivating, gentle, gentle persistence and patience joyfully. So let us begin. Landing, landing in our posture, in our meditation posture, whether sitting or lying down, and inviting, inviting the body to relax, the forehead to soften, the eyes to rest back in their socket, for the jaw, perhaps to open up just a little bit, and then settle into a comfortable position, giving the neck and shoulders to give their weight to the earth, the arms, the hands to drop, the chest, the abdomen, letting go. At the next out breath, out breath, out breath, out breath, ah, the sit bones, the lower part of the abdomen connecting to the sit bones, dropping, dropping their weight onto the earth in lieu of the chair, the cushion. Letting go of the weight, the lower legs, upper legs and feet to the earth, bringing attention to the entire body, relaxed, soft, breathing, being breathed, the in breath, the out breath, connecting, attention, awareness, sati, connecting, with the in breath, with the out breath, in their entirety, as much as possible, relinquishing what is not helpful in this moment. Nothing wrong with thinking per se, but in this moment, we choose to give our hearts fully, our minds wholeheartedly to this moment, to this moment's cultivation and goodness. Here, the simple joy of just being here, simply sitting and breathing. As if the awareness lands on the breath, connects with the breath, and serves, serves, the breath joyfully, the attention surfing the breath joyfully for as long as possible. And if and when it drops, the attention drops, it's okay. Gently relinquishing without judgment, smiling with, coming back, gentle persistence coming back, connecting, attention, awareness, sleeping with the breath, continuing to serve, to be with the breath joyfully for as long as possible. This moment is available, no problem. Again and again, this is our practice. This is our training of our mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ah, release, relax with the next out breath. And connect with the breath, surfing the waves. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
