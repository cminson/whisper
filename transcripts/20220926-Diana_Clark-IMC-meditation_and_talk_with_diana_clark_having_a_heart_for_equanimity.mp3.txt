 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Thank you. So, good evening everybody. Nice to see you all. You know, you're welcome to move chairs or cushions to wherever feels comfortable. You don't have to all be back there. If you want to all be back there, you can, but it's okay to have some people up here too. So, the chairs get sometimes just put wherever they are, and whoever was here before us must have had a circle or something. So, many of you know that we'll start with a 45 minute silent sit, and then I'll give a little talk. So, I'll turn my microphone on at the end. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

I just, I don't have a question, but I just wanted to say I love chanting and I have downloaded the loving kindness metasutra on my phone and it's three minutes long and sometimes I'll use it to fall asleep by and then I also, when I go hiking over at Edgewood Park on the bench, I'll play it and sing it at the same time. Nice! Oh, I love that. I love Edgewood too, so that's fantastic. Fantastic. Yeah, and you know, I'll say that learning it, enchanting it really helps with concentration and kind of like calming and like collecting the heart and the mind too in a way that this can be really supportive. Thank you for sharing that. It's very nice. We have time for another comment or question. Hi, thank you so much. When you were speaking about the equanimity and saying we don't necessarily, we can't ask the larger picture. I would say that equanimity is about seeing the bigger picture. Seeing, seeing the bigger picture. And so I'm a little confused by that just in the sense of we don't know what part. This plays in the larger scheme of things or... Yeah. Because you were talking about the things that came before also, and I was confused about what preceded this episode seems different than my understanding of like, oh, we don't see the whole picture. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, this is a, I didn't really talk about that very much, and so thank you for kind of pointing out that this could be expanded a little bit. So what does it mean to see the bigger picture? And I talked a little bit about saying what preceded it, but also another way to think about it, and this might be related a little bit to loving kindness or these types of things, is that when we're having a difficulty or something that we really like and we're completely enamored with, there's a way in which our kind of like awareness or our, I'll just use that word awareness, just kind of collapses around it. And that's all we can see. Like when there's a pain in the knee, it just feels like that's the only thing, just the pain in the knee. So another way to understand seeing the bigger picture is to recognize, yes, maybe there's that pain in the knee, but there's also this neutral sensation of pressure against the body of what I'm sitting on, and there's this kind of neutral sensation of sounds or seeing light or... So seeing the bigger picture sometimes is just seeing that there's other things happening at the same time, not... In addition to seeing what was preceded it, so there's like a number of different ways we could understand this idea of the bigger picture. Is that helpful? Okay. Okay. Okay, so it's nine o'clock, and it's a pleasure to practice with you all, and may you find some balance, some steadiness, some equanimity, and or a little bit of this loving kindness thing that I've been pointing to you in the rest of your evening or tonight, and always. So thank you. And if you'd like to come up and ask me a question, you're welcome to do that. Otherwise, I wish you safe travels home. Thank you.
