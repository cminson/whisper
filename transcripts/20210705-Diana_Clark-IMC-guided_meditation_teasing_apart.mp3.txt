 Good evening. Welcome, welcome. So of course you guys can't see what I'm seeing here but we're starting to get ready for being in person so things are set up here a little bit differently. Looking forward to when we can practice together. And not to worry, we'll continue with YouTube. Recordings and offerings also. But I know some of you are local and might like to come to IMC. But a warm welcome to everybody whether you're local or far away and whether you're listening to this now or sometime in the future. A warm welcome. So we'll start with a little lightly guided meditation. Taking our seat and just feeling into what does it feel like right now to be sitting here. Maybe globally there's a sense of relief like, oh okay I'm just gonna be sitting here for the next little while. Or maybe there's some restlessness like really am I really gonna sit here for the next little while? Whatever our experience might be it's all welcome, it's all welcome. It doesn't have to be one particular way. It can be helpful to connect with whatever it is we're sitting on. Cushion, bench, chair, couch, bed. Just feeling the pressure against the body. And when we sit and start to settle down a little bit, perhaps the breathing becomes noticeable. This body breathes of course it does. Can we in a kind gentle way rest our attention on the sensations of breathing. Feeling the inhales in the chest or the abdomen or perhaps feeling the air going in and out of the nose. Feeling the expansion, the stretching with the inhales or the coolness of the air. Then of course the inhales are interspersed with exhales. How do they feel? You can focus on just one area if you'd like, the chest, the abdomen or the nose. Feeling the opposite of expansion, a little bit of deflation maybe even though that doesn't sound very inviting but the air being exchanged and then going out. And just feeling this rhythm inhale, exhale. Feeling where there is And when the mind wanders, which it naturally will do, just very simply begin again. We don't have to make it a problem, we don't have to make a story out of it. It doesn't have to mean anything in particular. It just means we were lost in thought and then we begin again. We'll never destroy that, different, different derogations, but we still have to make a particular needs to be happening. Just noticing the experiences of breathing and just allowing the mind to come back when it gets lost in thought. Just noticing the experiences of breathing and just noticing the experiences of breathing and just noticing the experiences of breathing. And you might notice that there is an uncomfortable experience, uncomfortable sensation. In a relaxed, easy way, can we distinguish, can we tease apart? Is there a bodily, physical aspect to the uncomfortable situation? And is there a mental aspect? That is, maybe there's a sharp sensation in the knee and the mind is starting to think like make up stories. I'll never be able to meditate with this sensation. I'll never be able to go on retreat where they sit longer. How do those people sit longer? They must be abnormal or have done it since they were young. When I was young, we didn't sit in a way that was very flexible. But there was that person that was in third grade that was so flexible. I remember she used to play on the monkey bars all the time and be doing all these things. Wow, do they still have those at schools these days? What would it be like to go play on them? I hope they do. Kids should play outside. Right? Here we go. So, there's kind of like the mental aspect and the physical aspect. And we notice that sometimes the mental aspect leads us off. Where I just let us was off into a fantasy. But sometimes it might be, I'm damaging my knee, I better shift my posture, I can't believe this is terrible. I'll never be able to do it. This is so hard. And we're saying things to ourselves that are just exacerbating or amplifying the uncomfortableness. And to be sure, we need to use wisdom and not sit through pain if we feel like we're harming ourselves. That is not what this practice is about. But when there is some uncomfortableness, can we tease apart, can we separate, can we distinguish the bodily experience from the mental experience? And then as best we can to place our awareness on the bodily experience. It's a little bit more steady. So moving slower than the thoughts. The bodily experience is staying here this moment. And now it's mostly moving forward. Maybe the uncomfortable experience is some aversion. Oh, I really don't want this. Why is this happening? Can we tease apart? Can we distinguish the aversion? And often we have aversion to the aversion. So our reaction to the experience. Can we tease those apart? Can we interrupt the aversion train? Can we just be with the one version of aversion? Of course you have aversion to aversion. It's a natural human response. We don't have to amplify it. We can't change it to it at all.
