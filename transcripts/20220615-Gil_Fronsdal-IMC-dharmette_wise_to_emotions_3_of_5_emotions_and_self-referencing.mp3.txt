So hello and we're here to continue on this topic of emotions. And an important
part of mindfulness of emotions is to recognize how some emotions arise out of
an appraisal of the situation, evaluation of the situation we're in. I know I like
to call these secondary emotions that arise from the stories, the judgments,
the meaning we assign to the situation. And I call primary emotions those which
don't require much appraisal, evaluation, assigning a meaning to the situation. If
there's, you know, certain kinds of things can happen suddenly and you're
working in the kitchen and with a knife and the knife suddenly falls off the
counter and maybe towards your foot, there might be a sudden very quick
reaction of fear and response that doesn't take much evaluation. It isn't
like you look at the knife falling and say, oh there's a knife falling, the
point of the knife is heading to my foot. This wouldn't be a good idea to have it
hit me. There's not enough time for that level of evaluation. It's just very
quick or fear that arises very suddenly because maybe a car appeared out of
nowhere right next to you driving fast and oh and and so there's fear. But some
emotions arise because of the evaluation and and sometimes those evaluations
have to do with me, myself, and mine. That the situation is what it is but that
we then refer it to ourselves and we or we or we evaluated in reference to how
we identify ourselves, how we think about ourselves, how we consider ourselves.
And so for example if we have this idea that I'm supposed to be in control then
all the time at every situation then that we bring with us a pre-established
evaluation meaning idea and when the idea of control doesn't work then we're
disappointed or is despondent. And so that's a secondary emotion because in
my vocabulary because it arises not out of the simplicity or the basicness of
the situation we're in but the situation travels through our need to be in
control. We have this idea that I should be capable of taking care of things and
so if we don't take care of it properly then it goes through that idea I
should have been able to do it and then there's disappointment or there's angry
or grief. And so this idea of referring it back to some idea of self and then
emotion arising out of that is not a primary but a secondary and maybe in
being secondary maybe it's not always needed. Maybe sometimes it is but to
be able to consider how this works and to be able to question is this emotion I'm
feeling now. Is it more primary or is it more secondary? And some emotions lend
themselves to being more primary primarily secondary. So for example if
if something like guilt many reasons for guilt but one aspect of guilt is with
the when we have the idea that I am who I am myself I'm wrong or I'm bad. And so
I've seen people who feel guilty for no reason that I can tell that they have
done anything wrong but they have this almost like a preconceived policy that
if anything in the world is going wrong they should say I'm sorry and they feel
guilt or they feel somehow you know something. The anger we can have self
concepts about ourselves and if those self concepts are threatened or are
attacked we can get angry sometimes. There's other reasons for anger but so
I'm sitting here today and maybe I read the news and the news says that self
respecting Dharma teachers should only wear blue shirts not red shirts. And
so then wow you know where is that coming from now I get angry I chose
this shirt carefully and I'm happy and proud of my shirt and and this is
essentially kind of is a broadcasting of my importance as a Dharma teacher to
wear a red shirt and so now someone is saying something different and I'm angry
with them for somehow threatening me or hurting me because I had this idea of
what a Dharma teacher should be like. Or perhaps I read the headlines and it
says that Dharma teachers should wear blue shirts and now I'm in front of
you all of you you've read the same headlines and now I'm afraid because I'm
afraid of the judgments I'm afraid of that now I'm wrong and and I'm gonna be
threatened in some ways all about this image about who I am I'm defined by the
shirt I wear. And sometimes boredom is a sign that the self that we as self
concept we have is not being pumped up it's not being reinforced sometimes when
our concept of self gets praised or it gets criticized then we feel energized
by that maybe we feel a certain kind of joy when we are praised maybe we're
ready to be angry if we're criticized or and or if something doesn't really
support or challenges our status or sense of self but when when nothing
happens it doesn't either either supports itself nor threatens it then
boredom can arise a particular kind of boredom that arises from somehow
evaluating everything through the filter of my self concept and who I am and
how I'm being supported or or undermined by situations so so all these
are different there are secondary emotions that all of these can be primary
emotions in the sense that they can come just from the moment's experience
without going through the channels of my self concepts my self definitions my
ideas of who I am being myself in mind and and but so much of the so many
emotions people have are triggered by some idea that it's threatening or
praising or challenging for some idea work we're carrying around with us of
how things should be some of those ideas are probably fine and maybe
appropriate even but some of them are not particularly the ones that are most
painful have to do the ones where we're attached to some concept some image of
ourselves that we want to hold up or want to defend or we want to use to
create safety for ourselves some idea of self that has to do with status
conceit but I'm better than others and and how that how does I get threatened some
idea that what a self is what a being is we have ideas of what we're supposed to
be to be a successful human being and so if we don't have that success then we
can feel despondent because that's what a good human being is supposed to be
like and so certain these secondary emotions can do very we do very well to
ask ourselves what are we believing what are the stories what are they
evaluations what is the appraisal we're making that has triggered this emotion if
we don't do that investigation we might think that the emotion is a primary one
act this is just built into the nature of the universe that if someone says
something about color of my shirt that that casts some kind of you know character
on who I am and who I need to depend to defend myself or who I am but maybe I
could look at that and see in my mind that you know maybe even if people do
judge a Dharma teacher by the color of their shirt that's their problem that's
their thing to do I don't have to why do I have to pick up what their judgments
are their ideas are I can you know I can be free of that and I'll do where what
I'd like to wear and and let it be that way so I don't know if my example is
very good but the point being that there are emotions that arise that are
primary that are core central emotions that are maybe important to listen to
they have important messages for us and then we have some emotions where the
message what they're about is not really to our best interest they come from
appraisals they come from valuations they come from ideas of self concepts
that are not really well-founded or very useful but when those ideas of self
ideas of whatever ideas I encounter situations with threaten them which
support them which offend them which you know then we can have these secondary
forms of guilt and anger and fear and boredom and despondency or joy or or
excitement or all kinds of things and it's these secondary ones that I'd like
to leave you with today as an investigation and that is as you go
maybe some point through the day a couple of times maybe end of the day
sit down again maybe with a pen and paper or with a friend or something and
going for a walk and review a little bit some of the stronger emotions of the day
and ask yourself did those emotions get triggered by some evaluations some
appraisal of a situation some idea and concept that we carried with us and that
in and of itself the situation didn't trigger an emotion but only triggered
an emotion after it went through the appraisal and was that appraisal that
evaluation some somehow related to your self identity to the concepts ideas of
who you think you should be and how you should be in the world and and then once
you do this exercise then ask yourself is there a simpler way is there a way
to be present for that experience any experience without the filter without
the curtain of these appraisal's evaluations self concepts can we set
our experience free of of the sometimes the incessant ideas and concepts we're
using to constantly appraise situation often in terms of what it does for me
me myself in mind so so I hope this isn't useful for you and we'll continue in
this exploration of emotions tomorrow thank you
