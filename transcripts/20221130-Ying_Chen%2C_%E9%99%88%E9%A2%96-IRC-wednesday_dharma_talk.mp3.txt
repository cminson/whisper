 I want to shout out for the Zoom land also. And just recognizing you're with us together. I want to just make a couple of announcements. Today we'll do a second round of COVID testing. And so it will happen at 715. And so if you have your own COVID test kit, please bring along and use that. And we'll be doing it just like kind of going to the dining hall and we'll be doing that in the dining hall. So just line up at 715 and we'll see what happens after that. No matter how everyone's negative, we'll put up the sign on the door. Okay, so if everyone is negative, we'll put up a sign on the door. So you will find out. And the other announcement is LGBTQIA sitting at 645 today in the walking hall. And so it's optional. Welcome to join if that feels supportive for you. And so I want to do a little review of what we've been talking about so far about this journey that we've been using kind of a journey as a metaphor for this unfolding. And I want to maybe review this from several different dimensions. And that is a dimension of unfolding. And there is an embodied dimension, a somatic dimension. And so this going from meeting Dukkha to shifting the perspective of relationship we have with Dukkha, has embodied effect. And so I will kind of share some words, reflections about that. And there's also the dimension of unfolding from the perspective of the heart and perspective of the mind, and maybe even at the spiritual level. And so I'll speak to each of those a bit. So from the embodied perspective, this journey as we begin, we may begin to notice that we're carrying a lot of unnecessary tension in the body. Maybe it's emotions and thoughts. But from a felt sense perspective of our embodied experience, we can begin to notice how we might be carrying kind of unnecessary stress and tension in the body. And through walking this journey, began to noticing this, this is also a journey of lightening up the unnecessary tension and stress in the body kind of a journey. And I remember as I began my mindfulness practice, almost immediately I would notice how often my shoulders were pulled up, kind of held up. You know, I can blame the working computer industry and it happens. But as I paid more attention, I noticed it's not necessary. I was often holding up, carrying certain kind of a mental orientation with it, kind of trying to get something done really fast or getting really intense in some way. And so my shoulders were held up. But through the practice, I began to notice, oh, this is not necessary. As I learned to kind of just relax and drop my shoulder. And I don't know when and how, but at some point, I began to notice every time I turned to my body, oh, the shoulders are no longer held up. And so, and the body began to learn, lightening up some of the tensions that we carry that are not needed. And this is not to say that this journey somehow would magically manage us to have no pain or no tension. And that's not the point of what this is pointing to. Instead, what it's pointing to is for us to begin to pay attention to how the tensions might be held in our somatic field. That may be unnecessary. And remember recent retreat. I think a girl used this term, relaxing the micro muscles. And I had no clue what the micro muscles are. But it somehow resonated a lot because I began to notice maybe the ways that I didn't pay attention to before, where I was kind of putting a little more stress in it. For example, I would notice in my meditation, my tongue was pressing against my teeth just slightly harder. And as if I'm trying to get somewhere, it's like just a little extra effort there. But if I just relax, it's as if my whole being start to soften a little. And there are many of this kind of micro movements in the body that we can begin to pay attention to. And so in this way, this path that we've been describing allows us to begin to put down some of the tension and the pressure that we carry with the body. And then from the mind's perspective, and this is a journey that goes from cloudiness or murkiness, not seeing clearly, getting caught up, to freedom from getting caught up, and to become clear about the lived experience. We may all have experienced this on this retreat already. Coming to the retreat, often we carry a lot with us, the plans, the expectations, the goals, and can keep us very busy in our mind, in the form of thoughts and stories that we tell ourselves. It also comes in terms of a lot of inner chatter. And so when that is happening, it's hard to really see what is happening right here and right now in our lived experience. But by walking this liberative path, practicing like what you've been doing for this last few days, it's kind of like going through this process that the girl spoke about, the ritual process of leaving behind the big luggages and stuff we put in there. And then there is a lot more space within us. Maybe it's momentary, but feel like, oh, there's not a whole lot of nonstop chatter. There can be a momentary quietness. And when this happens, our mind can feel a bit more clear. It's kind of the clouds get cleared up and the sky become clear. And similarly, that can happen within our mental dimensions of a being. And then from the heart's perspective, I would say this is a journey that goes from maybe heartbreaks, heartaches, to a sure heart's release. And dukkha in some ways could be understood as heartbreaks, heartaches. And I was struck by the Chinese translation of this last link of dependent origination that speak about the whole mass of dukkha. And often this stock phrase, the line, goes to something like, with birth as condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. Such is origination of this entire mass of suffering. And many of the Chinese characters that translate words like sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, despair has that heart character in it. And it's kind of like either something burdens the heart, pressures the heart, or make the heart shake on ease. And so, you know, they sound like just something has a lot to do with our heart, lots of heart-related aches and pains. And yet, as we walk this liberative path, our heart can begin to open. And I often associate to some of the aspect of faith, trust, joy, gladness, that has something to do with the heart. And the constrictions and blockage can begin to be released. And so there is this unfolding that goes from kind of tightening, constricted, and hardened to that is opened and released. And so that's also a dimension that can unfold as we walk this path. And the last one, I say that maybe from a spiritual dimension of unfolding, there is a sense of from not getting in touch or see the spiritual dimensions of our being to open to the potential awe and wonder of our being. And so there's all kind of different dimensions that can open to us as we begin to engage with this liberative dependent unfolding. So today, I am going to continue from where Kim and Gail left off after dukkah, faith, and gladness and joy. Today, I'll be talking about tranquility and happiness. That makes me very happy to talk about this. So let's start with tranquility. And so tranquility, the Pali term passadi, passada, has also other meanings associated with it, like calm, repose, serenity. And this liberative unfolding, it follows pamoja and the piti. And the Gail spoke about gladness and joy or rapture, other translations of it. And the tranquility has a different feel to it. I want to say that sometimes I am aware that people have different associations with the words tranquilizing. And then I just want to put it out first. It's not like taking a tranquilizer shot. This is not what this is. But rather, maybe the adjective or form of this word would be a little more descriptive of where this is pointing to. That is the tranquil, serene, peace, and calm. And this is kind of the feeling associated with this. Passada follows piti as a very natural flow. Often, piti for people can be felt as a very energetic field. And maybe, I think yesterday, the word used for this is something like uplifting. And for me, often, I associate with piti as kind of a bubbly feeling and the delight that you want to skip and jump and dance kind of a feeling. It can be quite exciting. But at some point, you can't do that all the time. It'd be too much. And so the natural flow of this, if we allow this flow to happen on its own terms, the natural flow is that this energetic field will begin to settle, begin to calm, calm down, quiet down. And when the quiet and the calm become predominant and that feels one's experience and body, mind, and heart, then we're in the field of tranquility. I want to also mention that even though we're talking about all of this kind of different aspects of this unfolding, some may feel quite elusive. Maybe the word, the phrase that one of my teachers use can be supportive. And that is, all of this, we're pointing at something. Maybe a hint of it is good enough. Or maybe just a hint of a hint, a hint of a possibility. Maybe that's enough. And so not something that we have to again cook up a big project to kind of work it up. And the passati has a felt sense in the embodied way. And I love the Chinese translation of this term and that literally, and the two characters, qing and, maybe only a few of you know, it means light and peaceful. And so the embodied, the felt sense of tranquility, is that kind of, the body becomes light and like a big cotton ball sitting, even though you're still in the body, but it feels like as if it becomes very light and it becomes peaceful, very content. And even in the midst of maybe aches and pings in the body, the tranquility can be present. Just like Kim was talking about, the joy can be present even when there are something painful. And similarly, even if there are different degrees of a pain and a discomfort, one can still experience the aspect of tranquility. And the pain and discomfort are no longer kind of bothersome or troublesome, they're just there, part of our being. And the mental aspect of this is that the mind can become quiet and still. And so a lot of inner chatters might temporarily fade or could also just be flowing at the surface. They no longer kind of really pull you away all the time. And sometimes the pulling away, for me, was almost as if I'm jumping on a train and just being carried by the train of thoughts. But here, even if there are thoughts, they're not kind of taking you away. And you're still in that field of peace and quiet state of a being. In one of the articles that Gil wrote about the tranquility, I want to share this phrase, this sentence that kind of describes what this may be pointing to. So meditative tranquility is a compelling state that can involve feelings of peace, calm, serenity, contentment, and deep rest. In the body, tranquility is like a deep, clear lake with a wide, still surface. In the mind, tranquility is like the soft, quiet, fresh air over the lake at dawn. Maybe even just for those who the images of this might evoke a certain sense of a feeling, it's just a feel, that clear lake with the fresh, cool air over it at dawn. And when one stays in this field of tranquility, it can be very satisfying and it can also be a very healing place to hang out. And I'll offer another one, a short poem, haiku, Japanese haiku, that may be pointing to some different aspects of tranquility. Oh, tranquility, penetrating the very rock, a sikata's voice. And some of you may have noticed this on retreat. There's sometimes when our mind and heart and body is quiet, the sound all around can feel different than what it's normally sounded like. Either they get highlighted, or sometimes for me it kind of feels like almost as if I had a really crisp edges to them. And so that can kind of get highlighted by a quiet, still mind. And then from the heart's perspective, one may notice different heart qualities. And heart qualities can become visible. Maybe the heart feels tender. Some people have reported that one may cry without any reason. One could figure out why am I crying? But sometimes in this really tender space, the heart can be very tender. One can smile, or one can cry, and all of this can happen because the heart is really tender and soft. And there can also be a sense of pure heartedness. It's as if a lot of impurities that kind of hindered our heart and mind are temporarily put away. And so there can be a sense of a feeling pure hearted in one's being. And the primary way of cultivating tranquility in our tradition is through meditative practices, like what you are all engaged in, on the retreat, or practicing at home. Regular meditation practices and meditative movement practices are all quite supportive. I want to share that in a commentary, it listed seven things, seven conditions that are in support of bodily and mental tranquility, and their kind of conditions for the arising of tranquility. I was reading this list and going, check, check, check for each of us here. It kind of just feels like the environment we're in right here. One is having proper food. We're pretty well fed here, living in a good climate. Pretty good, right? I can do a check. Maintaining a pleasant posture. We're doing the best we can, but I think we're all right. And the next one is keeping to the middle. I sense this, maybe some sense of a balance, not kind of a total out of a balance. I think we're reasonable here. And avoiding violent people. Pretty good. And cultivation of the poor tranquil in body. I think we're in good company, yeah? And resolute upon tranquility. I think the sense I have is that all of you are practicing so sincerely. And so then we're having really good conditions all around for tranquility to arise. So when I read this list, I felt pretty happy. Very good. And so you can probably arrive at a conclusion that what doesn't support the cultivation of tranquility. When we have a really busy body, mind, and speech, it's hard. It's hard to get quiet and settle and relaxed. I know for myself, this sense of getting really busy was a big challenge. I think it's a high-tech job that I was in was quite intense. And I often would run from one meeting to the next without a time to even shake a hand to someone who was introducing themselves or say hi to anybody. And that's really hard to cultivate tranquility in that kind of a busy mode. And we can also be very busy verbally, either through speech or through the inner chatter in our mind. And in Pali, there is this term that speaks to sort of maybe in a way nonstop discursive thinking and inner chatter. And it sounded like inner chatter, papancia. Sometimes I go, papam, papam, papam, papancia. It's kind of like blah, blah, blah, blah. And in fact, interesting enough that I think in different languages, they all have words like this to describe the inner chatter. And I was thinking what was in Chinese, and it sounds like the Chinese, it goes like, wah, wah, wah, wah. Basically doing that nonstop insight. And so all of this can keep us shuffling at the surface level of our being. It's really hard for us to begin to settle down. And when this is not settled, and you can imagine, our mind becomes murky. It's hard to see things clearly. And that's where a dukkha can begin to layer one layer after another. All those reactions build one after another, put a huge burden on our heart, in our mind. And so we learn to cultivate tranquility through becoming aware of what's supportive and what's not supportive. And begin to allow this unfolding of faith, inspiration, and joy to bubble up within us. When our body, mind, and heart becomes peaceful and calm, serene, and there is a natural arising of the sweet happiness, it's kind of like an underground spring springing up. And this is the next element in this unfolding journey. And following tranquility is happiness. And I often associate this kind of happiness, and the Pali term sukha has a kind of subtle quiet feel to it. It's kind of like a gentle inner smile. And it's again this one thing that bubbles up, that may be without need for any reason for it to bubble up. It's just we notice that happiness may be present, and the sweetness may be in the being, and no need to have to explain why it happens and what have you. And so this kind of happiness can be very nourishing and sucing. And as such, it's very conducive for deepening this sense of unification, collectedness. I sometimes use the analogy of this kind of happiness as kind of a few drops of honey into a nice cup of tea. And so not overpowering, but just kind of a little sweetness that sues our body, sooses our mind. But I also know that this word happiness can have mixed associations with it. And often in our broader materialistic world that we live in, happiness is associated with getting some things, gaining things. But this kind of happiness is different. It's actually a quieting down and settling down. I want to use a personal story to share kind of a difference that this may highlight. So I remember once getting a pretty unexpected bonus from work. And you probably had to understand a little bit of a context of where I came from to understand my state of being, a mind. My life up till that point, I was instilled with the belief of not having financial security. And I was never kind of feeling safe in that dimension. And so this big bonus means a lot, not unexpected. And so it was a really big deal. And I remember driving down from my work, I'm working a lab and it kind of sits on top of a mountain, a little mountain from the top of this top of the mountain where our lab is at going downhill is about one or two minutes of a drive. And so at the beginning when I was driving down, I just had this surge of happiness bubbling up. It was quite something. And then by the time I got to the bottom of the hill, I just noticed my mind was already on something else. I got really shocked. I noticed that, what? This is gone already? I thought this would make me happy forever. But it just vanished like that. Not before I even got back to my home. Just got right at the gate of getting out of my company where I worked. So that really shook me. And it was a major lesson I learned about the happiness, the conventional happiness that I had a whole lot of trust in. And so from there, there's kind of a beginning of a long journey of shifting and changing that relationship. I think all of us know this kind of materialistic and gaining and getting kind of happiness. I think I once heard someone saying that they're having some work done analyzing the happiness of getting something. Like if you do a shopping, the happiness often lasts until you put the stuff in the shopping cart. And after that, you're on to the next thing. And with online, it's just a few buttons, new push, and that's it. And yet the process that we're describing here is not dependent on gaining, achieving, accomplishing, getting, or getting rid of. That's the other thing, you know, just only if I get rid of that, then I'll be good. And so it's not dependent on that. Rather, it's a process of quieting and stilling and settling. And when this happens, the happiness just bubbles up without a need for any reason or need for outcomes. And so this can be quite potent. And as such, this would lead to a deeper state of collectedness, which we'll be talking about tomorrow. That is the aspect of Samadhi. And one other thing I want to mention about this kind of happiness is how this happiness may be related to a certain kind of freedom. And freedom, it's not shaken by hatred, hostility, and illness. In Dhammapada, there are these few verses that I'd like to share. I found them quite inspiring. And so it goes to something like this. Ah, so happily we live without hate among those with hate. Ah, so happily we live without misery among those in misery. Ah, so happily we live without ambition among those with ambition. And so there is this kind of freedom associated with this kind of happiness. But in the midst of everything, we can be happy. Happiness can be present. And how do we cultivate this kind of happiness? Well, it's not unlike how we cultivate tranquility. And maybe in addition to that, one thing that will be helpful is to begin to notice what is beautiful and nourishing. That sometimes we may be ignoring or not seeing. And this way we can practice to be happy in a sense. And the reason I highlighted this one because in neurosciences, it says that our brain somehow is wired to scan for danger. And so we can get very habitual in picking out what's wrong, what's dangerous, what's threatening. And that's kind of built into our system. And so it's very important to begin to learn to cultivate happiness through opening to some new possibilities that we may miss. And I'd like to share this line from Rumi about roses and thorns. Some of you may have heard this. When you go to a garden, do you look at thorns or flowers? Spend more time with the roses and jasmine. I want to end today's talk by sharing a poem from a Chinese Buddhist or Taoist figure. I think he's very... we don't know much about him. And his name is Han Shen, and the literal translation of it is Cold Mountain. And he was a person as known as living in around ninth century and lived in mountains a lot of times. You'll be wandering around there and you would leave poetry on the rocks. And his poetry often expresses a kind of tranquility, happiness, and freedom that he experienced. And so here is one. Me, I'm happy with the everyday way, like the mist and the vines in this rock storm ravines. This wilderness is so free and vast. My old friends, the white clouds drift idly off. There is a road, but it doesn't reach the world, might less so who can be distracted by thoughts. At night, I sit alone on a stone bed while the round moon climbs the face of Cold Mountain. Amidst a thousand clouds and ten thousand streams, there lives an ex-scholar me by day wandering the spring mountains. At night, coming home to sleep beneath a cliff. Suddenly, spring and fall have already passed by and no dust has piled up to disturb this stillness. Such happiness, what do I depend on? Here, it's as tranquil as autumn river water. So let's sit for a few moments. Thank you. Thank you.
