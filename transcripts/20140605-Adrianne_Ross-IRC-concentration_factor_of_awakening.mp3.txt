Thank you. This afternoon we'll be talking about the Sixth of the Factors of Awakening,
and that Samadhi concentration. So we're getting closer to chocolate. So following calm and
tranquillity, as Gil was speaking about so beautifully last night and this morning, the mind
gets less and less reactive and we're more at ease, more relaxed. And you can sense that the
mindfulness is becoming more continuous, the investigation is getting a little more skillful,
and their energy becomes more balanced. And then there's some soft joy and appreciation of the
practice. The mind becomes more still. The whole energy system, instead of leaning forward,
is relaxing back, becoming more at ease. And there's a calm rather than a reaching out for
experience, the settling. And so as we're receiving the experience right now, have that sense of
relaxing back, of coming to ease, releasing all the experiences of the day so far, just letting it
all go. And that same sense you had this morning of calm, peace, releasing. The Buddha said, develop
concentration amongst one who is concentrated, sees things as they truly are. So as things become
quieter, more still, more peaceful, we begin to see more clearly how things are unfolding.
There's a stability, a steadiness, a clarity that concentration brings. Sometimes we think of
concentration as tight, efforting, get concentrated. Concentrate is a doing. And yet it's more a releasing
and an opening and a steadying. It's the stability that brings the power to concentration. It's like
we're gathering all the streams of energy of the body, the mind, and heart away from all the
distractions of the world. And we unifying them and bringing them together. Almost like
inters, a laser beam that we're then directing towards experience to penetrate more deeply
and see really clearly into the nature of everything that we're exploring.
Gathering ourselves back into presence from being separated off, disconnected.
So this samadhi then is an integrating in. Once unified, things begin to separate out.
One of the great Thai teachers, Ajahn Lee, talks about it's like putting a rock in a very,
very hot fire. The metals as they become molten then start to separate out into their individual
natures. So experience starts to untangle and separate out and we can see each of the components
more and more clearly. So stability brings us more and more deeply here, right here, this moment.
It's an unshakable heart. It's as though we were on this boat that was kind of rocked, being rocked
by the waves. Slowly we're becoming more and more still, unshakable. And it's a training
that steadies the mind by letting go. As we release the distractions, we're less pulled
and we become more and more stable and calm and centered. One of the analogies of the path,
the eightfold path, is that it's like a bridge from the unsafe shore, confusion and doubt and
greed and hatred over to the safe shore of freedom and liberation. And one pillar of the bridge,
the pillar on the near shore, is seela, is integrity. And the bridge on the far shore
of freedom is wisdom. And there's this big pillar in the middle that's our samadhi practice.
And that's mindfulness, effort and concentration that can go deep down. The middle pillar plunges
through the depths of all the streams of confusion of the mind, all the fast flowing currents of
the mind into this stability. And it's like rooted in awareness so that all of experience
can come and go, and yet there's this stability. Sometimes we can, samadhi is described as one
pointedness, this gathering together into one point. And we can have a fixed object sometimes,
and that might be the breath, or it might be a phrase like buddho, or mantra, loving kindness
practice, the body, certain different objects. There are many, many objects that the Buddha
described to use for one pointed concentration. And they were taught depending on one's personality,
and that's a whole other talk. Or there's momentary concentration, which is on a flow
of changing objects. And that's what we're beginning to do here. We began with a breath,
and now we're including sounds, thoughts, sensations, moods, everything. So it's this
one point that includes all of it, this flow from one object to the next. And I'll talk about that
a little later. Holding our attention steadily on the object, though, whether it's a changing
object or one object isn't clinging to the object. It's not holding on tightly. It's more
steadying the mind by letting go of distractions. So it's this uninvolved receptivity that's just
gently connecting. We can also talk about concentration practice as different meditative
states. It's a pleasant abiding. As we become more still, there's a relief and
feeling of being refreshed and steadied. It's pleasant. And then there are the states of knowledge
and vision. And these are more special states, kind of like special powers, that people who have
very deep concentration can experience. Being able to see and know things very deeply
in other realms sometimes. And then there's insight and wisdom, which is what we're exploring here.
Concentration takes us into deep places of insight and wisdom. And then if we continue that further,
if we look further and further with our clear seeing, then we begin to see not just that
everything changes and that it's not personal. The insights begin to settle deeper and deeper
as the mind is still, so that we realize that we're disenchanted. We don't need to reach for
things anymore. We're freed a little from desire. We're not as reactive. And the phrase is the
defilements are up-looted. So that's the more moving towards the combination of the path.
But whichever form of concentration we're talking about, the concentration that the Buddha was
describing in the Eightfold Path has three particular characteristics. It's always wholesome.
It's always in the service of liberation. It goes into deep, powerful states of one-pointedness.
And then it incorporates the use of mindfulness and discerning wisdom, that second
factor of awakening to develop wisdom in the service of liberation. So it's wholesome,
it's one-pointed, and it's in the service of liberation. So concentration can be
employed for many things, not necessarily skillful. So this is really the wise concentration
of using it for liberation. And we can watch that in our practice. Sometimes we can, when we're
doing concentration practice, we want to get these very pleasant altered states. We want to keep,
or we want to attain some level of absorption. And there's a lot of wanting in it. And if we
can practice with generosity and openness, then there's a release and a deepening of our practice
rather than a contraction and holding that gets in the way.
Because these beautiful states, even though they're really refreshing and steadying and a blessing,
they can also lead to wanting and craving. Bhante Gunaratna says, only concentration untainted by
craving can act as a path factor leading to awakening and freedom. So it's not to be afraid of
them or avoid them. In the early years of my practice, often we were sort of warned away
from states of absorption. You can get easily attached to them. Don't do it. Don't do Jhana
practice. It's not safe. If our minds were going towards that, we were directed away to insight
practice. But over the years of the practice being in the West, teachers have seen how valuable
absorption practice is. If it's done skillfully with a knowing that we can enter these blissful
states and we can let go of them. We just have to be aware. So the wholesome concentration then
brings stability, brings energy, and brings confidence. And from that comes joy. And as the
joy comes, we become more calm and at ease and at peace. And then concentration comes. So the
factors of awakening just lead us in that direction. We become refreshed, steadied,
and then blessed by the powers of concentration. So first of all, we need to notice,
as it advises us in the suttas, is concentration present or not? Is this a mind that's concentrated
or a mind that's distracted? Simply to know. That's the first thing, to be aware. And then
how do we, if it's not there, how do we cultivate it? First of all, just like with investigation,
with joy, with all the other qualities, we need seela. We need integrity. If there's
feelings of remorse or aversion or guilt in the mind, can't settle. So we need to be practicing
in a way that's non-harming. If we're sitting there judging ourselves or speaking to ourselves
in a harsh way, then we won't be able to settle and get concentrated. And that can be sneaky. We
can be judging our practice and not realize that that unwise speech, in a way, is blocking our
concentration. And that if we could be just kind to ourselves and non-judging, then the
concentration would open up. So seela is really important. And then sometimes we begin with one
pointed concentration. We choose the breath as I was talking about. We connect and sustain our
attention on the breath and very gradually the concentration builds. And it's helpful to notice
as we've been talking to build the continuity of mindfulness and to notice if we can keep it for
the whole of the in-breath, the whole of the out-breath. And then not only do we want it to
be continuous, we want our attention to be completely present. If we have a lot of static,
if we haven't quite got into the breath channel or whatever it is, then thoughts are in the way. So
we might have a continuous awareness of the breath, but we're not completely with it. We're paying
attention to the breath and we're thinking at the same time. And we've talked about that. So it needs
to be continuous and complete. And the more complete it is, the more the energy of concentration
can build. And there's a momentum that happens. And it helps to be patient and kind and gently
persevere. And also to be light-hearted, to bring some joy in is helpful. The factors that help us
develop and perfect concentration, there are five factors called the jhana factors. And these factors,
these are qualities that come into balance as we get more and more absorbed in concentration.
But they're also useful if we're not necessarily deeply absorbed. They really help us steady the
mind. And the first of them is called wittaka. And that's simply this connecting. It's bringing
the attention here, now. It's turning the heart in. It's developing a friendly relationship
with our object of mindfulness. It's turning the heart back. Be here. Be awake. So it's like
we're connecting with this ball. We've connected with it. Here we are. We come and connect.
And then the next of the factors is called uchara. And that's the receiving of what we've
connected with. We've now, we're holding it. It's settled into our hand. And then feeling the texture
of the ball. And it's cool and smooth and pleasant. And then after a little while, it gets sticky
and a bit unpleasant. But I'm receiving the changing texture of it. And that's uchara.
So it's a deepening capacity. And we start to be able to adjust a little. So as we're connecting
and receiving deeply in this way, the discriminating wisdom comes in. And it might notice, oh, holding
a bit too tightly. Oh, holding a bit too loosely. I'm about to drop it. So it gently tunes in. It
becomes very attuned and connected and feels the subtle vibrations about, is there too much
tension here? Or is there too little connection? It senses into that the need to adjust so that
fine tuning can happen so we can stay more and more present. And the interest can grow, which
supports us to stay connected. So it's very intimate. And it helps us meet the patterns of, habit
patterns of avoidance that tend to drag us off. Those strong currents in the mind that are pulling
us away, it helps us connect and release those a little more. And we build more and more ability
to say, uh-uh, not now, here. And connected and sustaining the connection. And then from that,
as we do that, we start to actually savor the experience. It becomes very pleasant. And that's
the quality of piti. Joy. So you can see how they're similar actually to the factors of awakening.
The joy comes from holding it. The whole being fills with the experience. It might be that the
whole body is bathed in the breath now and it feels very pleasant. It's the filling up with this
sense of experience. And if we've been doing it gently, if there's been a gentleness to it,
then that's a pleasant feeling. If we've been holding a little tightly and forcing a little bit,
then the piti can be very intense and unpleasant and kind of jarring. And so discerning wisdom
will reveal that and we can relax a little bit and bring more calm in. So there's a
a modification. And then as this pleasantness grows, we start to relax a little more into it.
We're filled up now. We have this sense of releasing and there's a settling and an ease.
And that's the tranquility that Gil was talking about, where the edges of the
vibration starts to soften and there's more releasing and settling. You can feel that now
as I'm talking. That sense of release and here there's nowhere to go. A sense of satisfaction
and ease. And as that happens, the body and mind start to become warm and heart,
more and more integrated into one point. And the word for that is akagata, one
akagata, one pointedness, more grounded, more unified. The mind is becoming more unified with
itself. And there's just this really deep sense of peace and subtleness. And also what happens
with that is the separate sense of self recedes. The referential thoughts start to decrease
and there's just no need for them. We're quite centered.
So the more present we are in that way, the more we begin to see the nature of the body,
the mind and the heart. And we can see what hinders us. We can see the movement of desire
and aversion and doubt. We can see these things moving through, speculating and worrying.
And we're less caught in them. So focusing on a single object in that way integrates
everything together so that we're, and it cuts through the habitual reactivity and obsessing
and worrying and the mind loses its addiction to fantasy and busyness because it's content,
doesn't need to go anywhere. So this profound stillness and calm is very absorbing
and very healing. And the mind is temporarily free from the hindrances.
They're sort of released and there's such a feeling of calm and cool and relief when the
hindrances are temporarily suppressed. But we can suppress what we've been avoiding
and that's not so useful. It is refreshing and healing to have that experience but it is temporary
temporary and it's not getting metabolized necessarily. Larry Rosenberg talks about that
as healing and freeing. But it's like being very calm but the delusion hasn't gone. So we're calm
but deluded. So calm fools, he talks about it. But we're just not aware that the delusion is
lurking in the background as soon as we get up from our sit is waiting for us or whatever it is.
So these great powers of concentration are very helpful, that absorption. But you can also see
an example I heard from another teacher, Martine Bachelot, where she was giving the
the comparison of those autistic savants, those people who have amazing powers of concentration
and sometimes they actually have special powers. They're able to draw or paint or add or do all
these amazing things that are beyond what the usual mind can do. They're completely absorbed
and have these incredible powers in their brains but they're cut off. They've excluded so much
that they're no longer able to really connect in the world and encounter. And so what we want
is an inclusive vision that can encounter the world. The absorption is leading to peace because
the mind's unwavering but it can't connect with anything else. And so it's useful to cultivate
a concentration that is inclusive of everything else. It's less deep but more connected.
So it's a middle way and I'll be talking about that more a little later. So there's calmness
and spaciousness, calmness and vividness, concentration and vipassana. It's that ability to use both.
So the other type of building concentration that we've been beginning to do here is
what's called conica concentration or momentary samadhi. And this is where we're directing
our mindfulness to changing objects all the time. Mind states, emotions, sensations, sounds,
everything, whatever is arising. We've got this continual awareness of everything moment by moment,
whatever's predominant moment after moment and we're not clinging to any one of them. It's this
and this and this and this. And we see that the thoughts come and go. Everything is coming and
going, coming and going and we're connecting with it. And we're developing the ability to shift
between changing objects with an unwavering attention. We're not pulled around so much.
We have this unwavering and our stillness then isn't dependent on suppressing anything.
The stability comes from being with these changing objects. So we're still one-pointed
but we're one-pointed on changing objects. So that's the difference. The same principle applies.
It's continual and it's complete. If it's not complete then we get drawn off. All of a sudden
we realize we've lost it, we've gone somewhere else. Or that there's a conversation going on here
and the breath over here and these little pieces, it's scattered. So it's continual and it's completely
present. We're not anticipating the future. We're not holding on to the past and we're not holding
on to the present either because the present is changing. So there's this flow of experience
and the mind is unified with itself. And when we have concentration like that, we know Samadhi
is flowing like that. It starts to be possible to turn the attention from the objects that are
flowing by to look at the mind itself, to look at awareness itself. And Upasaka Keenanayan was
a wonderful Thai laywoman who had amazing depths of practice. She was a very awake being.
And this is how she describes it. She calls it normalcy when we have this ability, this stability
to be aware of the changing flow of objects. She said, if we're aware right at awareness itself,
without getting involved, the mind can be, can be at normalcy. And by that she means
equanimous. The mind can be equanimous. It's calm, balanced, undisturbed. And we can have a steady
mind in all situations. So no matter what's happening, we have steadiness and balance.
And we're grounded in the body and yet we're open to all of experience.
So the advantage of having a single object as the primary anchor is that it's very simple.
It keeps us grounded. There's stillness, there's stability. And it's easy to come back to,
relatively easy, to come back to the breath and to keep an anchor that's straightforward and simple.
We just, all we have to do is release everything else, but the breath and gradually the stability
will, will deepen and will become still and clear. The disadvantage is sometimes it can get very tight
and controlled. Sometimes people find they get very tense around the breath and it can become
unpleasant. Or we can get into this state where we're quite concentrated, but the mind is kind of
frozen and blank. In one of the Tibetan teachers calls that stupid shamatha,
where you're in this very still state. But there's no, there's no wisdom there. There's no clarity
there. I call it cow consciousness because I have this sense of I'm sitting there sort of chewing away.
I'm not distracted in any way, but I'm not awake either.
So that can, that's one of the, that's one of not the dangers, but one of the things that can
happen when we, with this one object. If you have an open attention with no anchor, that's
more spacious. And for some people that's easier than trying to use one object. And our attention
just has to come to whatever arises. So we don't have to get rid of anything. Whatever arises is
an object. And for some people that's an easier way of the mind becoming steadied. Because all
you have to do, there's no object that's a wrong object. Everything is an object to develop samadhi
with. All you have to know is where the attention is in the moment. Where is the mind right now?
What's happening in this moment? Just this continual knowing, continual awareness. And the
advantage of that is you're not trying to control anything. It's natural and it can become effortless.
The disadvantage is spaciousness can become spaciness. You can get very spaced out with that.
So you can use both in balance. Neither one is better than the other. It's which is more useful
for each of us at any one time. So the encouragement is to practice with each and see which really
helps you get a steady mind. Some people find that they begin with the primary anchor and get some
balance and stability. And then they open up, open it up. And that really helps them. Other people
find it's easier to begin with just paying attention to whatever arises. And they don't use the breath.
They build the stability with whatever is arising. And if they start to space out and get lost in
thoughts then they might come back to the body or to a sound. And so it's really an individual thing
and exploring for yourself what's most helpful. So once we have some samadhi who want to develop
and strengthen it, help it gradually get deeper. And it's supported by all of the seven factors of
awakening. Mindfulness, investigation, all of them help lead to the progression of concentration.
And also it's guided by wise view and wise intention. They really support and help.
Kindness, compassion also support a concentration. And of course having relaxed and balanced effort
supported. And I find that having some trust really helps. If what's getting in the way of my
concentration is I've lost confidence then letting go of limiting beliefs can really help. What are
the limiting beliefs? I can't get concentrated. I've never been able to concentrate. This is not
something that I can do. It's only for other people. My mind is an ADD mind. It just doesn't do that.
And so just releasing limiting beliefs is very helpful. And balance is an art. Finding the
right balance of interest and tranquility. Because both are needed. And so that will change from day
to day in one sitting to another. Balancing tranquility and investigation together. We begin to be
able to discern when a gentle continuity is what's needed and acceptance. And that's what's
supporting concentration. Or when we need to bring in a little more connecting and sustaining.
Intentionally we've drifted off. It's very pleasant but we're kind of hanging out. We've kind of got
a little bit indulgent. This is pleasant. But we could actually connect and sustain a little
bit more and we were deeper. There's more possibility. So this balance of the three
mindfulness investigation and energy lead to a really powerful concentration. And also as joy
comes then it's then there's less in the way of the concentration naturally unfolding.
And as I was saying sometimes we can be there can be too much. In other words we've got we've
got too we've fallen into what I sometimes call a sinkhole. Where there's been a fair amount of
concentration. And it's like we've fallen into a hole where everything is very still and quiet
and peaceful. And nothing. But it's very very still and quiet and you can kind of hang out there for
a while. Ajahn Chah had a nice saying. He said chickens sit on their nests for hours. So it's
like that just stillness. Nothing is happening. And we can also get states that are very
blissful and luminous and beautiful. And we can get attached and drawn to those. Or there can be a
lot of joy and there's too much joy. It's kind of that's not balanced. And so having the balance
of just noticing that and inclining to calm is very helpful. And our investigation quality of
awakening can differentiate between tightness and relaxation between too much doing and between
being and balancing between those. And so that as the concentration starts to flow from this place
it becomes more and more malleable as Gil was talking about that last night. And the mind gets
very flexible, bright and clear. And it's a great feedback loop. The more that happens the more
aware we are of the other factors of awakening. And we can even intentionally call them up.
We can notice oh may there be more energy in the mind. And it happens because the mind is
pliable and flexible. May there be more calm in the mind and the mind starts to calm down.
Just when we have that pliability. But it does take time to develop. It needs patience and resolve
and letting go. Especially of our limiting beliefs. One of the analogies it's like a sloping shoreline
that gradually deepens to a really deep lake. And some people's minds are such that they don't
have to connect very much and they're in the depths of the lake. That's just their personality.
I have friends like that. Their minds just easily, boom, they become deeply concentrated.
Others of us it's more gradual. And it's not to judge that. Even if you feel you haven't
been very concentrated. You have more stillness than you're perhaps aware of. Everyone here is
more still and has more concentration than they had at the beginning of this retreat.
So just to honor that and to appreciate the stillness that's here. Sometimes we can get
into wanting or comparing mind which is not so helpful. So as the stillness builds we gradually
move from a simple calmness to what's called access concentration. A concentration that can
access deeper and deeper levels of being absorbed or jhana as it's called. Or it can begin to access
deeper and deeper levels and insight. And this malleable, peaceful, sometimes blissful mind
can move to either the absorptions or to insight practices. It's like these two paths to calm
and to insight as they're referred to. These two different paths. Sometimes the first path is said
to lead to a pleasant abiding here and now. It's a blameless kind of happiness where the mind is
content and doesn't require all these external things for happiness, content. It's very beneficial
and luminous and still and clear. The difference between the Buddha and the other teachers of
his time was that he saw that it wasn't enough to stop here. In fact he said,
one should not allow the mind to wander without. Neither should Abhiku allow the mind to stop
within. One who is able to be mindful in that way will be able to extinguish all suffering.
So he advised not stopping within or stopping without but continuing.
So it's leading to mindfulness and clear comprehension using our collected, unified mind
so that the feelings and thoughts and perceptions can be known as they arise and seen for what they
are. The power of the steady mind enables us to begin to go deeper and deeper and we can start
directing it towards the nature of arising and passing to see how things are coming and going
and dissolving. We can see how things have an unsubstantial empty nature. We can see that nothing
is can be taken as personal. Everything about us, our body, our perceptions, our feeling tone,
all of it is constantly changing and all of it isn't to be taken as I or mine. We actually start to
really sense that. Whatever we focus on, whether it's the bodily functions or mind states,
we can really see the impermanent nature of it and it's very freeing to have this sense so that
it's as though a concentration, investigation, mindfulness are all coming together
and they're purifying all the obstructions, decreasing the hindrances and they're also
transforming on a very deep level so that we're less identified with all the patterns of mind
and there's less stickiness. It's as though we have Teflon or non-stick mind. So when difficult
mind states arise like say states of inadequacy and self-doubt and we're really caught,
when the mind is clear and malleable in that way, it sees and knows inadequacy arising and
adequacy is arisen. It might sense the contraction around that and then it might know, oh, the
contraction is because there's a believing of those states of inadequacy. Oh, the story is being
believed and then because the mind is malleable and concentrated, that dissolves. The belief,
the state dissolves, the belief in the state dissolves and then the eye that has become
that state dissolves. The eye that believes that state dissolves. So we start to see this
amazing pattern teasing itself apart because the mind is malleable and then there's this,
oh, wow, I don't have to believe my thoughts and stories anymore. I don't have to be afraid of my
mind and when the concentration is there, it's such a relief and then we walk out of the hall
and we're walking along and boom, there we are caught again. Some other state, maybe what happened
is we feel so great, I am so great, I became the great one and then, then, oh, I am the greatest
arose and then, oh, no, I shouldn't have become the greatest. Now I'm the worst because I believed it.
There's just this constant flow, but when the mind has a little bit more malleability,
we can see that happening and that's what I find so amazing. It's not that it stops arising, at
least at this stage of the practice, but it's not as sticky and as the concentration wanes,
the stickier it gets, but once we've had that experience of seeing it not so solid, then we
know that that's possible and the confidence builds. Even if I'm stuck right now, oh, a moment of
stuckness has arisen. Oh, a moment of holding on has arisen and a moment of being unable to let go
has arisen and so we see all that and that just the seeing of that is building mindfulness
and in doing that, the capacity to let go returns and so it's the continuity of mindfulness that is
feeding that possibility of the concentration building and the mind becoming less sticky
and we can build this flexible concentration really from either of those paths that I talked
about, the one object and then becoming more absorbed, the path of absorption or the path
of vipassana insight where we have all those different objects and we can begin with concentration
practice and add insight so the mindfulness and concentration are not separate, they're interweaving
and balancing and supporting each other. It's not an either or, they're a team and gradually the
concentration is deepening and the insights are sharpening and there's an inner stability that
happens so that we're less overwhelmed by the fear and anxiety, we're less shakeable, there's more
capacity, more ability to tolerate difficult mind states.
One of the things though that can happen during practice is that concentration intensifies our
experience and when we don't know that this can happen, it can be upsetting in our practice,
our senses become more alert and things are more clear but we experience things like fear or anxiety
when they arise or a little noise in the room more intensely and it can be called yogi mind sometimes
when little things feel very intense because there are no distractions, we're very much
in the present moment and we haven't yet got the stability, the deeper stability but the mind is
very sensitive and things can be very beautiful and also very intense and so it helps to be patient
and kind when we're in that place and not to feel that there's something wrong with our practice
but just to know that it's normal and that these things are moving through
and you can see in a way how the concentrated mind is so sensitive it sees the slightest impact of
unwholesome things and that's a protection against unskillful action in a way because it would become
disturbing to do something unwholesome because we really feel that ouch that wouldn't be skillful
so that in turn increases our integrity and as our integrity increases we feel safer and as we feel
safer then things start to calm down so it all is this beautiful feedback loop of the practice
supporting itself and would become less and less caught by what the Dalai Lama calls afflictive
emotions and we also as we develop these deeper understandings and
deeper realizations
there's a sense of confidence and capacity that comes there's more trust in ourselves
and we feel and sense more at ease so that when the difficulties do arise in our practice
there's less distress about them there's more the possibility of seeing oh this is an opportunity
to be with this in a different way we know nothing is wrong this is just what's arising
due to causes and conditions and it's possible to be with this to hold it
I was mentioning before that sometimes when we're very concentrated and the mind is very stable
there's an ability to call up so to speak whatever factor of awakening one likes and
there's a lovely Sutta where Sariputra one of the Buddha's most enlightened disciples or
followers is talking about someone asks him about the seven factors of awakening
and he talks about it being like a king having a wardrobe and in the morning he can choose whatever
clothes he wants to wear and in the afternoon he can choose and call whatever he clothes he
wants to wear and so on in the evening so I can choose whatever factor of awakening I want to wear
I can decide oh equanimity is what I would like right now an equanimity will arise or calm is what
is needed and calm will arise and so he had that flexibility that there was a sense and a knowing
and a capacity to bring in whatever was needed to balance his practice and there it would be
and so it's but in our in our practice here it is possible to incline the mind that way
to sense more calm is needed to incline the mind to calm and without the expectation that we're
going to be like Sariputra rats it didn't happen but but just just by inclining the mind we're
open to that possibility of more calm and as our practice deepens that becomes more possible
and so we're gradually as we're sitting here even right now that capacity for peace ease
and stability is deepening that stability of being unshake having the unshakable heart
being fully present for ourselves and our experience and then turning that to see clearly
to look into the nature of things
Bhante Gunaratna says not putting the concentrated mind to good use is like receiving the gift
of the world's finest thoroughbred resource and using it for quiet country rides in the neighborhood
and so we want to put the concentration to good use it's a valuable tool but not in a
striving way in an allowing way and so let's sit for a moment and as you sit
allowing the body mind and heart
to release settle into stillness
releasing all the words of the talk some words that fit for you some that didn't
some words that were helpful some that weren't letting them all go
so allowing the body mind heart
to be spacious still
well knowing
trusting in the innate capacity of mind to become collected unified powerful
so
no you to do anything
just trust
you
