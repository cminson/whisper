 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome everyone to IMC. Welcome those of you who are on IMC online. And we'll sit quietly for the most part for the next period of time. But I'd like to offer you a kind of a radical shortcut for meditation if you're in a hurry. And that is decide what your basic mindfulness practice is. Mindfulness of breathing, mindfulness of the present moment, whatever your basic practice is. And beyond that, if you notice you're doing something else with your mind, don't do it. Just don't do it. And so it can be a relief, this kind of instruction, because it means you don't have to fix anything or figure anything out or review anything and remember anything or fantasize about anything. It's a tremendous amount of things. It's amazing how many things exist that you actually don't have to do. We can celebrate. So figure out what your practice is, do your practice, and then if you notice that you're doing something else, kindly, lovingly, gently, spaciously, patiently, stop doing it. And if the stopping is only for half a second, that's pretty good. And then maybe you do it again, letting go of anything else you're doing except the basic practice. Keep coming back, keep coming back. And if that instruction doesn't work for you and you prefer the slow path, that's completely fine. It might actually be better. So with that, we'll sit quietly.
