 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So for this Sunday morning meditation, I'd like to use an analogy, a little bit of a rough analogy. If you put black duct tape around a light bulb and then turn on the light bulb, there might be no light coming into the room. If you take a little pinhole, make a little pinhole on the duct tape, you get a little stream of light going out in one direction. But if you begin peeling away the tape, you get more and more light going more and more in wider directions. If you take the duct tape off entirely, then the light shines out in 360 degrees all the way around. So if our awareness, our capacity to know and be present, is a little bit like the light, we turn on our capacity to see, turn on the light, the capacity to be aware. But we have something that we're caught up in and preoccupied with. It's like the light can't shine or can't be open fully in all directions. And if we're completely lost in fantasy or lost in distracted thought, it's almost as if the duct tape is completely surrounding the light. The light is only there for itself, it's self-absorbed in a certain way, and all the light's bouncing on inside the bulb. But as we meditate, we learn, we appreciate how limited it is to be caught up in preoccupations and thoughts. Even if those thoughts are grand in nature and have phenomenal, wonderful fantasies of traveling around the world, everywhere, it's still ingrown, inward-directed. As we begin to let go of our thoughts and let go of our preoccupations, there is slowly and steadily an opening up of the light, opening up of our vision, our capacity to see. And at some point it really becomes clear the difference between having it be wide open, all the duct tape off, and when we start covering it again. And that movement of, oh now I'm kind of, it's gotten narrow, it's gotten contracted, it's become even self-absorbed, that doesn't feel so good. It felt really nice to have the awareness uncontracted, unlimited. We might still focus on a particular thing, like the breathing, but we do so without there being a tightening and narrowing. There's more like, rather than the attention going really focused in a tight way, it gets really focused in an open way, kind of like the open palm of the hand. The most sensitive part of the, one of the most sensitive parts of the hand is right here at the center of it. If we kind of get focused this way, you know, tight and focused, we don't avail ourselves of the most sensitive part. But if we're really relaxed and open, then the sensitive part meets our experience, our breathing. And then, so this is an effort to be, an analogy to emphasize the sensitivity, the care, to letting our awareness be open, be wide, be relaxed, be uncontracted, untight, unlimited, you know, unlimited in a sense by the restrictions we put on it, by our desires, our clings, and our versions who get hyper-focused. So if that makes sense to you, then we can practice that. And if it doesn't make so much sense, you don't have to worry about it too much, or at all. So assuming a meditation posture that is relaxed and open, with the chest maybe open, gently closing the eyes, and taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. And as you exhale, maybe there can be a relaxation, that kind of, the kind of maybe relaxation that a flower does when it opens its petals, from being a tight bud to being an open flower. So to relax in the exhale, and let things open up. On the exhale, relaxing the belly, relaxing the chest, softening the shoulders, softening the face. Breathing normally. Imagine that you're turning on the light of awareness, so that it shines 360 degrees in all directions. And then at the center of that is a sensitive spot that's there to meet the experience of the body breathing. Breathing in and breathing out. Being intimate with breathing, but without contracting or getting tight with awareness, without the mind bearing down or tightening up. And this kind of intimate sensitivity is often associated with being receptive. Open, receptive to all things, but with the center of it all, center of awareness, receiving, breathing in and breathing out. And perhaps as you get caught up in thoughts or fantasies, you can feel how you lose that openness, that maybe lose a spaciousness or lose a receptivity. Without being critical of that, relax and receive again, open again. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Are you absorbed in thought so the light of awareness is obscured? What is it like to let go of your thoughts so that the light of awareness is on 360 degrees, very open, present, with its sensitive center centered on the breathing? Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. and that you meet the world with this receptivity, this tenderness, this sensitivity. This is a way that we evoke sentiments of care, caregiving, respect, goodwill for others. And to end the sitting with some orientation, to look upon others, be ready to be present with others, from a place of receptivity, care, tenderness, that inspires or reminds us of our capacity to love others, to be friendly, kind, compassionate. And may it be there through this meditation practice, that we are giving more and more, developing more and more capacity to gaze upon the world kindly, to become a friend of the world, a friend of others. And in our friendship with all beings, may we wish for the happiness of others, for their safety and their help, for their peace and their freedom. And with our friendly disposition, may each of us in our own way and appropriate for each of us, contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy, may all beings be free, may all beings everywhere have their hearts settled and at peace.
