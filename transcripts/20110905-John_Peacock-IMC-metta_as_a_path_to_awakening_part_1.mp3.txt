So all I have to say is welcome to everybody. 
It's so lovely to see so many faces today. 
In a way, it's part of a continuing conversation and that we've been having over the last few days of actually going back to the original text, as Tony said, and trying to discern what's going on in the original text, irrespective of what the traditions, and I do say that in the plural, what the traditions have said to us over the centuries, over this vast history of Buddhism and its growth over two and a half thousand years, because by going back to the early text, we often find something very different from what's going on in the traditions. 
And this is what's quite startling and this is what's quite exciting actually about this work, is when we begin to see what the Buddha is actually saying, rather than what the tradition is saying. 
So on that theme, I'm going to be looking, as you all well know, at metta today. 
Well, metta is going to include the other Brahma vaharas. 
I'm going to probably speak a little slightly less about these, these Brahma vaharas, but we're going to have to look at metta in quite a little bit of detail. 
Having said that, I don't like this to be a monologue. 
I don't like to sit up here just monologuing at you. 
So I do encourage participation, I do encourage people to come up with questions, hopefully questions which are related to what I'm talking about, if you can. 
Because it can go off in all sorts of tangents, and I readily get caught up in the tangents as well, so I'd just like to say that. 
Okay, let's look at the role of metta. 
One of the claims that I, and not just myself, and others are making, is that when we begin to look at the original texts, and particularly some of the oldest strata of the Pali Canon, then we get a very different picture of the role of metta, Kauruna, Upeka, or sort of Medita and Upeka. 
Usually translated loving kindness. 
I'm going to tell you something about that in a second. 
I think this is a rather sloppy translation. 
Compassion. 
Usually translated Medita as sympathetic or empathetic joy. 
Really, what it means is gentle joy. 
And the last one, equanimity, which is a perfectly valid translation of these. 
And we're usually talking about these as being subsidiary practices to the main practice that most people know about. 
The tradition, and particularly Theravada tradition, has had an obsession with wisdom over its history. 
And as has many of the developments within Mahayana traditions, they've got what I call wisdom obsessed, wisdom focused. 
Everything appears to be about wisdom. 
And compassion is mentioned as is metta. 
But they seem to be subsidiary events. 
So much so when you come to this vast tome, which I'm sure some of you might have come across, written in the 5th century by this figure called Buddha Gosa, who's really the founder of the Theravada movement as we know it today, in Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. 
When we come to that, he finds it very, very difficult to place these practices, the Brahma vaharas, which includes obviously their major practice of metta. 
He finds them very difficult to place within his framework, so he sticks them, almost ad hoc, into concentration practices. 
Now, one of the claims I'm going to hopefully substantiate as I go through with you, is I don't think they are concentration practices. 
They can be concentration practices, but primarily I think they are insight practices. 
I haven't got a copy of it with me, which is very remiss of me, but there's two lines within the metta Karanya Sutta, which is this Sutta which is found in the oldest strata of the Pali Canon, as far as we know, which is the Sutta Nipata. 
It's a very, very old text. 
The Pali in it is very different. 
The picture that you get of what the Buddha envisaged as his monastic community and the practices are completely different. 
From what we get in much later, big versions, like the Majna Makhayah and the Degen Makhayah, the long discourses and the middle length discourses, it presents a very, very different picture of what Buddhism was about. 
In this particular text, the metta Karanya Sutta, what we find is the Buddha saying this thing. 
He says these two lines, amongst a lot of other things that he says, he says, there is no better mindfulness in this world. 
There is no better way to live in this world. 
One who practices this will never come to be reborn again. 
It's pretty explicit. 
Now, however you interpret rebirth, I don't really want to get into that one at this stage, but he is making it very explicit that the path of metta is the path to awakening. 
That is a revolution, if you think about it. 
The path of kindness, the path of friendliness, the path of even if you want to stick with the old translation of loving kindness, can be in itself a path to awakening. 
That's a revolution. 
Certainly in Buddhist terms, it's a revolution because primarily, as I've said, the traditions have parroted out over the centuries and the idea that one must have panya in order to gain basic awakening. 
So, that's the premise I'm starting from, that the Buddha is actually claiming we have a path to awakening which is different from the path to awakening that most of us assume to be the path of awakening that is there within the bulk of the text. 
So, awakening, let me just say something about that. 
This is my alternative word and many others, I'm not just the only one who's saying it these days, my alternative word for what is usually translated as enlightenment. 
Those who've been with me for the last couple of days will know I have a particular prejudice against the word enlightened. 
I think it only occurred at the end of the 18th century and into the early 19th century that there was no movement within Western philosophy and Western thought. 
This is not what the Buddha is talking about. 
He's talking about waking up. 
He really is talking about waking up. 
So, actually, when we start talking about awakening, we are offered a challenge. 
We're actually offered a challenge by the Buddha. 
We're offered a challenge to wake up to the way things are. 
Have you ever wondered why kind of metaphorically wake up with bruises all the time? You've been bumped into the same things you've been bumping into all your life. 
Well, it's because you're sleepwalking. 
This is it, you're sleepwalking. 
It's sonambulism, bumping into things. 
You keep bumping into the same lamppost and you wonder why. 
Now, the Buddha is saying, wake up. 
Wake up to the way things really are. 
Waking up to the three facets of existence. 
Waking up to impermanence. 
Waking up to dukkha. 
Waking up to anatha. 
Waking up to the lack of any essence or any fixed notion of the self. 
This is what we're waking up to. 
And meta itself can do this. 
This is what is important. 
Now, before I really get started, I want to present you with an image. 
It's actually an image that was given by a 14th century Tibetan thinker. 
And I don't usually, these days, quote much from Tibetan thought. 
But this particular one, I'll only phoneticize it. 
Longchen Rabjampa. 
He was a great 14th century meditator. 
He is one of the founders of the Ningma School of Tibetan Buddhism. 
Longchen Rabjampa presents a beautiful image in one of his primary texts. 
It's called the Magnauso Kusum. 
The Trilogy of Finding Comfort and Ease. 
I love the title of his book. 
Within this, there is a chapter on the Brahma Viharas. 
In the Brahma Viharas, he starts off with this. 
He says, out of the soil of meta, out of the soil of friendliness, grows the beautiful bloom of compassion. 
To be watered by tears of joy under the cool shade of the tree of equanimity. 
This actually shows you something about the relationship of these four practices. 
But they're not, as I've been saying throughout, actually, the time I've been here, that none of the things that the Buddha talks about are linear. 
We cultivate the soil of compassion. 
We cultivate the soil of meta. 
Out of this will grow this beautiful bloom, this wonderful bloom of compassion. 
However, if we don't cultivate that soil, if we don't actually do it for ourselves and do it for others, this bloom will never come into existence. 
So we spend a lot of time actually cultivating this soil. 
Watering it, manuring it, weeding it, making sure that it's fit for something to grow in. 
And this soil is not a soil of loving kindness. 
And I really mean it quite strongly. 
I often find this word quite weak, loving kindness. 
The actual word meta means friendliness. 
It's actually allied to another Pali word, which some of you might know. 
Which is this mitra, or mitra in Sanskrit. 
Mitra is a friend. 
Some of you might know the phrase kalyana mitra. 
A spiritual friend or a good friend, actually. 
So mitra is the root of the word meta. 
And so we're talking actually with meta, not of loving kindness, but of boundless and expansive friendliness towards all things. 
This is the virtue that the Buddha is really giving. 
He is not asking us to love everybody. 
Which I think is a very wise thing. 
It's almost an impossible task as well. 
We can't love everybody, but we can befriend everybody. 
And that friendliness is a respectful relationship with others. 
And included in that is not just others, but yourself. 
To befriend yourself. 
That really is a big task for most Western people. 
To befriend ourselves. 
To become good friends to ourselves is often quite difficult because we give ourselves such a hard time. 
I was saying to the group the other day that what eastern teachers when they first came to the West were absolutely horrified that how little kindness and how little friendliness was shown towards ourselves in Western contexts. 
This was not necessarily taken as a big problem in eastern contexts. 
Tibetan teachers when they first came here were horrified as were many of the Thai monks, Burmese monks and Sri Lankan monks when they first came. 
But this was considered in their cultures to be something you didn't spend a long time over because it was taken for granted. 
But you actually had a friendly relationship with yourself. 
In some respect, in some form of kindness. 
And so we have to spend quite a bit of time developing metta towards ourselves. 
Holding ourselves in some kind of kindly act of mind here. 
Metta is a distinctly, I would say, dharmic attitude. 
It's really the foundation of the dharmic attitude, the way of being in this world. 
It's an attitude of heart and mind. 
Now I use the word heart and mind as a translation for this word which some of you will know, chitta. 
Often translated as mind, more often than not in Thai, for example the Thai word when they translate it is always translated as heart. 
So they speak about heartfelt qualities. 
I mean so many times in my own training, I used to have Tibetan teachers saying, trouble with Westerners is they're always thinking with this. 
I never think with this. 
Showing that intimate connection between the two, that chitta actually means heart and mind. 
The tradition itself even talks about what's called citta vimutti, the release or the liberation of heart, mind. 
Citta vimutti, I'll write it up in a little bit because I'll say a bit more about this. 
The tradition also talks about panya vimutti, liberation through wisdom or the release through wisdom. 
And then promptly elevates panya vimutti, the release through wisdom over citta vimutti. 
However, the phrase that's being used in both cases is vimutti, liberation, release in both cases. 
One can be released through heart, mind qualities or one can be released through the qualities of, well I don't actually like the word wisdom, but qualities which are understanding and insight as well. 
And rather than see them as both legitimate pathways to awakening, the traditions in general tend to elevate panya vimutti over anything else. 
And so actually citta vimutti gets downgraded to only giving you release into very high deva realms or brahma realms here. 
Now out of this confusing morass, I hope to kind of give you a little bit of a story about this all. 
But first of all I want you just to take on board the fundamental nature of kindness, the fundamental nature of friendliness towards all things. 
This is the distinctly Buddhist dharmic attitude. 
The actual concrete definition or the etymology of the word metta or metta in Pali and I love this word. 
The etymology means to grow fat. 
It means to grow fat, to swell with friendliness. 
You know, you can't keep your friendliness to yourself. 
It's actually this expansive, you're expanding all the time into this attitude of mind which is this fundamental friendliness towards all beings. 
It also has the connotation of spreading out as well. 
So we spread this sense of friendliness. 
And I'm sure we've all come across this, somebody who has that kind of friendliness. 
When they walk in the room it can change the atmosphere of a whole room. 
Somebody who has that gentleness and that kindness. 
I've seen this on many instances when I've been involved in things with the Dalai Lama. 
When he walks into a room everything changes. 
Everything changes. 
There's a fundamental attitude of friendliness. 
We invited him to Oxford about two years ago and he was giving a talk in the Sheldonian Institute. 
I don't know if many of you know, this is a beautiful Christopher Wren building in Oxford. 
Before that we had a meeting with him, a private meeting in the Theological College in Oxford, which is a beautiful medieval building. 
And they'd set it up for him. 
They'd put his little throne there and a place for his translator and everything. 
Dalai Lama walks in, completely ignored where he was supposed to sit, went down to the end of the hall and started pulling out benches from the end of the hall, pulled them out himself and then sat there and went. 
. 
. 
And this is the most funniest thing I've ever seen because there was two professors sat on either side of him. 
He sat there talking, holding their hands the whole time. 
Well, they looked rather non-plussed by this. 
This is not the sort of thing that happens to Oxford professors, by the way. 
Now, for me, that is a demonstration of this kind of friendliness, the friendliness that breaks through, the friendliness that breaks down barriers and actually connects with people. 
I find often that there is a virtue main of the opposite in the Western world. 
Now, I don't know, obviously I'm not so filling with some of the idioms that you have in America, but in Britain, we often make a virtue out of being hard on ourselves and hard on others. 
And there's this phrase I've often heard, look, I've only been as hard on you as I would be on myself. 
Which means I'm going to beat you up because I beat me up all the time. 
And I don't know if you have anything in equivalent, but this is very typical phrase that you often hear. 
So in other words, I'm going to lacerate you because I lacerate myself all the time. 
So there's no self-respect there. 
There is no gentleness. 
There's no kindness towards ourselves. 
And therefore, I project that onto the world. 
Another thing to say about Meta is it's a way of seeing the world. 
If you like, and I'm using this metaphorically, it's an eye that sees the world. 
It's an epistemology. 
It's the way that we understand, the way that we see. 
If we see things through the eye of kindness and we see things through the eye of friendliness, we see a different world than the one that is seen through aversion, through infatuation, through confusion, and all of the fundamental elements of our rather unwholesome psychology. 
So we see, in a way, obviously the same world, but we see it completely differently. 
And this is what the Buddha is saying about developing this quality of Meta. 
Another instance of this is that when we are engaged in practice, I personally feel that there is no such thing as pure Vipassana practice. 
There is no such thing as pure Samatha practice. 
There is no such thing as pure Meta practice. 
What we have is actually a genuine practice which should include all of those elements. 
So actually in Vipassana practice, if there is no Meta there, it becomes very cold, it becomes very brutal. 
It's not a matter, as Rilke, the great Austrian poet once said, it's not a matter of being able to see things. 
You have to learn to love what you see, or in our case, to learn to become friendly towards what you see. 
Now often when we are engaged in meditation practice we are asked to confront some of the most difficult dimensions of our own experience, some of the most hidden, some of the most deepest, some of the most traumatic things, which are there, which can be quite traumatising, can be very, very difficult. 
But if we can learn to hold those in the eye of friendliness, in the eye of compassion, which grows out of this friendliness, then we transform our relationship with what we see there. 
Now I particularly, in particular when I'm teaching Vipassana retreats, I emphasise always the quality of friendliness that we bring to this dimension of beginning to see what we encounter. 
If not, we end up lacerating ourselves, creating bigger wounds in our own minds. 
Now it doesn't work for everybody, but the phrase that I use, some of my Sri Lankan teachers used to use, was that we must learn to befriend what we see, to learn in a way to move just beyond that simple acknowledgement into a friendlier relation. 
And this is because of the fundamental aspect of meditation practice that we learn to comprehend, that thoughts are not our enemies. 
Why do we want to make thoughts our enemies? As I was joking with the group the other day, thoughts should come with a label just passing through. 
They're just moving through. 
Yet, we treat them as our enemies. 
We come into a relationship of aversive relationship with them. 
We come into an aversive relationship, we often repress, or suppress what is seen, what is comprehended. 
And if we repress and suppress, then we end up feeding what is there. 
And that we literally make it grow bigger. 
And as we all know, we can't keep a good repression down. 
It will come out in some point. 
So, better to acknowledge, better to befriend what is there, rather than to suppress what we see. 
Another aspect of meditation is, of course, that it is a Bhavana. 
Now, I don't know if you're all familiar with this word, but this is the word that I'm very keen to point out, is the word that's usually translated as meditation, and I absolutely love the word meditation, even though I use it. 
Because it doesn't really convey what we're engaged in. 
The word Bhavana, which gets translated as meditation, which actually is much more related to Latin and Greek, the word Bhavana means to cultivate. 
We're engaged in cultivation. 
The Buddha came from an agrarian society, so many of the metaphors he uses and draws upon are actually agrarian metaphors. 
He was talking to ordinary people most of the time. 
Sometimes he spoke to the higher echelons of Indian society of his time, but most of the time he was travelling around, speaking to ordinary people. 
So he would speak in a language which they could understand, using images and metaphors drawn from their ways of life, and particularly agricultural life. 
And so when he was talking to ordinary people about what we call meditation, he was talking about cultivating. 
The word Bhavana actually comes from a Pali Sanskrit root, which actually means to grow, to actualise, to bring into being something. 
Meditation can, and I'm sure it doesn't for most of you, but meditation can seem distanced from the object that we're engaging in. 
So for example, if we meditate on it, it might be a nice idea. 
Wouldn't it be nice to be a little bit more friendly? And I'll think about that. 
LAUGHTER Yeah. 
I don't know again what it's like here, but often when we use the term meditation in Britain, people say, I'll go and meditate on it. 
And generally what it means, I'll go away and do absolutely nothing about it whatsoever. 
In this particular instance, we're talking about something again much, much more proactive, and this is really what I'm trying to get through to you, is this is we're engaged in cultivating the soil. 
We are really preparing the soil for these other fundamental qualities to develop in. 
If we don't have the quality of metha, then we don't have the possibility for the development of the other qualities of compassion, of gentle joy, of equanimity. 
These grow out of that soil. 
This is why the Buddha is saying that metha in itself is a path to liberation, because it gives rise eventually to upeka, which can be seen as a synonym sometimes for nibbana. 
For an actual achievement of this poise and balance in this world, being able to see the joys and the sorrows of the world and not be thrown off balance. 
I have images in my own mind of a beautiful ballet dancer, somebody being able to hold their focus, hold the posture, no matter what is going on around them. 
This is the kind of image, it's a modern image, but I think one that's intended by this idea of equanimity. 
This does not come about unless there is some fundamental ground for it to arise from. 
And so we cultivate this ground. 
We prepare this soil. 
And this is what the Buddha is actively asking us to do, to engage in that cultivation, to engage in cultivating this emotion, and it is an emotion, a radiant, expansive friendliness towards all beings, including yourself, not more than other beings, but equally. 
So there's an equalization of self and other in this. 
Again, an idea often very alien, I think in Western contexts, where often we talk about compassion towards the other, often with very little compassion towards ourselves. 
Now the Buddha is saying this is a path to awakening because it leads these final fruition to these big fruition of, as I say, equanimity. 
The Chettavimutti that he's talking about is a liberation of that heart and mind which moves into that way of being, and metta is a way of being. 
Now I'm going to go and return to the history for a second because I think this will make something clear to you that probably isn't very clear. 
We have this odd phrase for these practices with obviously the foundation being, metta. 
Brahma Viharas. 
It has all sorts of peculiar translations in English of the Pali terms. 
Brahma is, well, in the Buddha's time would be considered to be the chief of the Hindu gods, or the chief of the Brahminical gods. 
Vihara is simply a dwelling place, yet we come up with expressions like divine abidings. 
I'm not quite sure what it means, actually, sometimes. 
Sublime abodes. 
Now part of the reason for this is because the word Vihara means a dwelling place. 
Literally, and this would be a literal translation of the Pali here, Brahma Vihara means dwelling with Brahma. 
It literally means dwelling with Brahma. 
In the Buddha's time, if you actually said to somebody who was within the Brahminical, which later became the Hindu traditions, if you said to them, you were going to dwell with Brahma, this would be a synonym for you would be liberated. 
So, actually, even within the title of these practices is the very key to the idea that these are liberative practices. 
Again, the context by the time of Buddha Gosar in the fifth century is being completely lost. 
The understanding of what the Buddha is meaning by calling these practices Brahma Vihara. 
So, Buddha Gosar, instead of understanding it in this way as a metaphor for liberation, actually sees it more literally. 
Actually, if you are going to be practicing these four practices, including metha, then you will end up dwelling with the highest of the Deva gods, the Brahma Davas. 
This is where you will be reborn, rather than seeing it as a synonym for total liberation. 
So, he has kind of missed the metaphor out here. 
He takes it literally in this sense. 
Now, in taking it literally, he is taking it obviously within the way Buddhist cosmology sees the universe, which has demoted the gods by that time and placed them very much within Sangsara. 
So, the practice of the Brahma Vihara actually only leads to a better type of Sangsara. 
That's all. 
I mean, this is really what it's about. 
It just leads to a better type of dwelling in Sangsara and that actually, even if we reach these realms and we practice metha, karuna, mudita, upeka, then ultimately we are going to be reborn in one of the lower realms just once you get to the top, the only way is down within Sangsara. 
And so, he then accords this notion of real liberation to panya vimutti, that we can only be liberated through penetrating wisdom, penetrating understanding, or deep insight. 
These are all possible translations of the word panya, a deep way of knowing things. 
Whereas the Brahma Viharas are relegated to this idea of chettu vimutti, these words I mentioned earlier on. 
This now becomes secondary on his understanding and we now have practices which are subsidiary to the wisdom practices within the traditions. 
However, it's very, very clear that in the early texts, when the Buddha speaks of panya vimutti and when he speaks of chettu vimutti, he is using these as synonymous terms. 
They both, as I said earlier on, just to reiterate myself, they both indicate liberation and not a kind of lesser liberation to that. 
This is the typical thinking that we often get within traditions which is hierarchical, which places one thing above the other, and surprise, surprise, chettu vimutti is something perhaps laypeople might aspire to, but panya vimutti is really the providence of the bhikkhusanga, of the monks and the nuns, but primarily the monks by this time. 
Nobody else can really, really aspire to that here. 
So I think what we get is a much more egalitarian picture that the Buddha is presenting to us, one where it's possible for everybody, because they are now different pathways being offered for liberation. 
Different pathways. 
So some of our practices would also be included by Buddha-Gosa in chettu vimutti. 
They wouldn't lead to ultimate liberation, but they would lead to simple liberation of heart and mind. 
So with this hierarchisation, there is only one type of practice, and I don't mean this in the sense of the modern way that we use this practice, but there is only vipassana. 
There is only the practice of vipassana, which can lead to liberation, and that is this seven-fold kind of, seven-stage aspect of vipassana, which is laid out strictly in the Visuddhimaga here. 
Now, for the Buddha, on the other hand, when we develop this word, which I'm sure we're all familiar with now, it seems to be popping up all over the place. 
Sati. 
This is the Sati centre. 
Sati translated usually as mindfulness. 
Mindfulness or present moment awareness is probably another good translation of this. 
Present moment awareness. 
Now, present moment awareness or Sati, or mindfulness, let's just stick to this, or the right mindfulness that we find within the eight-fold path. 
Right mindfulness for the Buddha is boundless friendliness. 
Boundless friendliness is right mindfulness. 
Right mindfulness, as it's often portrayed, is a kind of looking at something in simple awareness. 
And all too often mindfulness is reduced to being some kind of just simple awareness. 
And usually with the correlate, well, if I simply am aware and watch, well, everything's going to be okay. 
And this is the idea that actually it isn't. 
Not everything is changed by just looking at it. 
Sometimes you have to do things. 
And another aspect of mindfulness that's detailed out in the kyas got together particularly in the Abhidharma tradition and looked at much more detail is actually deliberately forming concepts, which are wholesome concepts, mindfully forming wholesome concepts. 
Here is a mindfulness, here is a conceptual mindfully formed concept, metta, because it doesn't assume you automatically have it. 
We incline our minds in a particular way. 
And as the Madhupinaka Sutta, which is this Honeyball Sutta, which as some of you might know, the Buddha says in the Honeyball Sutta, the way that you incline your mind will become the shape of your life. 
Incline your mind towards Greed, aversion and delusion, and that becomes the shape of your life. 
Incline your mind towards metta, karuna, muditta and upeka, that will become the shape of your life. 
So we shape our lives by the way that we use our minds, by the way that we form our ways of seeing the world. 
So right mindfulness becomes boundless friendliness. 
Boundless friendliness is right mindfulness, and this is the way that we incline our mind, in this particular way. 
And we do it as much as we can. 
I almost consider this a behavioral gesture with the mind. 
This is what we're doing. 
It doesn't always come naturally, does it? In fact, when I teach, when I firstly teach and we have a long retreat at Guy House in England, which is our kind of vipassana center, when I teach the metta retreat, which we do every year usually, which is usually three weeks to a month retreat, people find this practice much, much more difficult. 
Much, much more difficult than sitting and watching the breath, or just watching what is arising here, because it is actually very active. 
You have to be actively engaged in what you're doing. 
Now speak about the practicalities of this, perhaps in the second portion of this, how we're actually involved in this, what takes it out of the business of being a purely concentration technique into why it becomes a technique, which I didn't even like the word technique, but I'll use it in a shorthand way, why we use it in this particular way for the development of insight as well, how we'd use that. 
Now for the Buddha, maintaining oneself in right mindfulness is the same as suffusing the world with universal friendliness. 
That's why the injunction is to be mindful in every activity. 
Every activity of your life, in sitting, standing, walking and lying, what you're doing. 
And it's not a dispassionately cold, as the French philosopher Foucault calls it, cadaverising eye. 
He says often what we do is we look at things in such a way that we cadaverise life, and then we look for its frail nerve. 
So I think it's a very powerful expression. 
So we suffuse the world with universal friendliness, including ourselves. 
A person who has right mindfulness is also a compassionate being. 
And I'll say more about that. 
So if we have right mindfulness, out of it, in some senses, naturally grows from the seed that we plant, compassion. 
We become more aware, and as I say, I'll say more about that. 
We become more aware of the pain, the confusion, the anxieties, the travails of the world that are there. 
If we don't have that, we don't have the friendliness, and we simply see that without the friendliness, it can be overwhelming. 
I find so many people in the Western world, particularly in caring professions, end up with compassion deficit. 
There's nothing left in the compassion-bank balance at all, because it never worked on developing the resources in order to maintain that. 
And the resource to maintain that is the friendliness that we take towards ourselves and others. 
It's also a disillusion between thinking and feeling. 
All too often there's that again dichotomy in the way that we approach things, that we think about life, and then we supposedly emote about it. 
This is the bringing together of this. 
Now, I find this actually something which is in within most Buddhism, but not actually brought to the forefront of bringing our emotional lives in line with, if you like, our cognitive lives, of really beginning to feel. 
When we actually hear the teachings, there is also an emotive element to it. 
I always remember one text, I was sitting in India once, I was reading a text, which was absolutely turgid. 
It was a Tibetan text, and it was pages and pages and pages of long philosophical argument. 
And each Tibetan text at the end of it has what's called a colophon, where the author says something and says where it's written and everything. 
But at the end of it, this text is said, if you have read this text and the hairs on the back of your neck have not stood up, you have not understood it. 
Needless to say, I hadn't understood it. 
Because it's trying to make this bridges gap between thinking and feeling. 
I could follow the arguments, but it hadn't touched me. 
And I would also say that about most of the teachings. 
How much does the teaching touch you? How much does it contact your emotional life? How much does that take just one example? How much does the teaching on impermanence really touch the very heart of your life? So much so that you can feel it. 
Transience, this flow of events that we're caught up in. 
Our own minds and the external events that we're caught up in. 
How much when we begin to understand that do we really experience something emotional about it? And not saying to get caught up in gales of emotion or waves of emotion, but just to be touched by almost the pathos of life sometimes. 
So as I indicated earlier on, instead of trying to feel with the head, which is what we're trying to do, we think with the heart. 
This is what we're trying to do with Mehta. 
Mehta is not, I would say, a lofty sentiment. 
It's not sentimentality. 
Oscar Wilde once said, I don't know if anybody knows Oscar Wilde, he once said in his letter de profundes, he said the sentimentalist was the person who wanted the luxury of emotion without any hard work. 
Which I think is actually really often a lot of what we drop into, which is why I find the phrase loving kindness rather sentimental. 
Friendliness is something we can really work at. 
Really try to enter into and develop, to grow, to cultivate, to engage in this, I've wiped it off the board now, to engage in this Bavarnar which really starts to enter our life as something we're cultivating and growing. 
We sow the seed and we keep on cultivating and keep on growing it. 
So Mehta is active friendliness. 
It's shown in your acts as well, in your day to day experience of the world. 
As I think I was saying to the group yesterday, when we see the litmus test of any of these virtues, and particularly of Mehta and Kairuna, is how well can you deal with the person who really winds you up, the person who really irritates you, the person who you normally just want to flee away from? Can you listen to them in a more friendly fashion? Or be it only for a few seconds or so. 
Let's not put the bar too high. 
This is a graduated path. 
But this is actually really the litmus test behind it. 
And that joking aside, it's those small momentary ability just to change the frame for a second where we see this person, and we can perhaps respond to them in a slightly different way that actually indicates whether we have that friendliness or whether it's still absent within us, whether there is any kind of warmth in the heart, despite the irritation, whether there is anything still there. 
It's also to be pointed out, and this is the reason why I don't like the word love in loving kindness here, that Mehta is not romantic love at all. 
Let's get away from that. 
It's not romantic love, and it's not even what I call Christian agape, this kind of disinterested love. 
Mehta is a feeling of boundless friendliness that arises when the consciousness of self and other is superseded. 
When that distinction, that splitting between self and other, starts to be eroded. 
And we then, of course, are starting to move then into a more compassionate relationship, because actually, as you will hear me say, this compassionate relationship is the ability to begin to see the other. 
That's the start of the compassionate relationship. 
It's also Mehta, the direct knowledge of the stream of life, the flow of life. 
Being able to hold that in the friendlier gaze and the friendlier, a friendlier vision, really. 
And that, of course, flow of life is a ceaseless ebb and flow of things, coming and going, coming and going. 
This is what life is like. 
As I quoted to the group the other day, the poet Rilke once says, we're in this world for ever taking leave. 
We stand here as like bowls. 
He says, bowls of hot liquid evaporating. 
It's a lovely image. 
This is how we are, just like steam coming off hot liquid. 
So, when we begin to contact this ceaseless ebb and flow, we see a moving pattern. 
For those of you who are here in the last couple of days, you will see this, particularly in this moving pattern of interdependences that we're caught up in. 
Now, when the Buddha uses a term for contacting this flow of interdependences, this ceaseless ebb and flow that we're caught up in, he does not actually primarily, and I don't know if anybody has pointed this out to you, he doesn't primarily use the word compassion or the word karuna. 
He uses this word, anukampa. 
Anybody come across this word, anukampa? When you look through the Pali Canon, wherever the Buddha is referring to compassion, very rarely do you find the word karuna. 
You find this word, anukampa. 
And the word anukampa, and it's a Sanskrit version of this, which is anukrusha, which has an etymological meaning, which has two actually, one which I think is more powerful and one slightly less powerful. 
Anukampa means to tremble along with. 
To tremble along with. 
And I think even more powerful is another kind of literal etymology of it, which means to cry out at the crying out of another. 
So we see somebody's pain, and it affects us so much, as if we are experiencing the pain as well. 
It's that complete empathy for the other. 
That only takes place when this self and other starts to break down as this heavy dichotomy that we use in our daily life. 
This heavy dichotomy that we usually live. 
When selfing no longer takes foreground. 
Now in our ordinary relationships, selfing more often than not takes the foreground. 
It's self before other. 
Or if you're caught up in the waves of what I call generating compassion deficit, it's other before self. 
What you're getting in this is balance. 
This is the middle way is the balance again, between the two. 
Now this only grows as I keep on saying, and if nothing comes out of this for you and you take away anything, hopefully this is the one thing that I would like you to take away, is nothing of this sort grows unless there is meta there. 
It only comes out of that field, that soil of friendliness, gentleness, kindliness, and if that isn't present, then even the compassion can take a hard edge. 
Too hard an edge. 
In other words, this is kind of what I almost refer to as, I will go out and do compassion on you. 
You're going to be my object of compassion whether you like it or not. 
So this is softening that whole process. 
This is beginning to soften that process and to open us up to the other. 
Now I just want to say something about that, because in our normal experience of things, there is usually not what I call real relationship, because what is dominating in our interpersonal activities is often me. 
Have you ever noticed that? I came across a cartoon quite a number of years ago, which I've often cited, but I think it was so good. 
It was a couple at a dinner table, and he was leaning across the table talking to the woman across the other side of the table, and it had about ten squares, you know, cartoon squares, and above each of the squares in the bubble above his head went me. 
Me. 
Me. 
Me. 
And it went on and on like this, until obviously he'd finished what he was saying, and he kind of leans back in the chair, and she leans across the table, and above the bubble in her head comes me. 
And he goes, whew! Now, do I need to say any more? You know, this says a lot about human relationship. 
I mean, I don't know anything about the British playwright Harold Pinter. 
Harold Pinter's plays are all about people not talking to each other. 
You know, there's lots and lots of dialogue, but none of it actually comes together. 
And that is because of, in a sense, the egotistical relationship, that there are egotism without relationship, because egotism does not create relationship, it breaks it down. 
There is no seeing of the other. 
Now, if we take the other word for compassion. 
. 
. 
Could you just say the literal meaning of that word once again? I'll say both the literal meanings, I think it's really important. 
The literal meaning of the word Anukkampa is to tremble along with, or to cry out at the crying out of another. 
So it's a very powerful sense. 
Now, when we come to the other word, which is used less frequently, and it's there in the Brahma Viharas, is this word Karuna. 
The word Karuna, again, I don't know how much you know about the languages of early Buddhism, but the word Karuna comes from a root which has two meanings, and this is the root which just pronounced Kri. 
And this root actually means to do something. 
The word Kriya, which means to do something, to be engaged in an activity. 
But it also means to, this is the literal sense of it, to turn outwards. 
The doing here is the turning outwards. 
So real compassion is to turn outwards. 
To turn outwards from your own self-obsessions. 
It's interesting even in the mythology of the Buddha. 
And I do emphasize that the so-called life story of the Buddha is a mythology. 
It's written 500 years after his death. 
So even very familiar hallowed ground such as his name is added 500 years after his death. 
The word Siddhartha, or Siddhartha, actually isn't used in the text whatsoever. 
Even the word Buddha is not used in the Pali texts. 
The only word used generally is Bhagawan, which means it was a simple term of respect, which was Lord, or Tatargata, which is what the Buddha uses about himself. 
But in the mythology, the story is basically that, of course, the Buddha finds it, well, he gains his awakening and he finds it problematic as to whether he's going to teach or not. 
He says, you know, this is difficult to comprehend. 
And I wonder whether many others could comprehend it. 
It's certainly going to be difficult for me to explain and to teach this. 
And then comes along a figure called Brahma Sahampati. 
Brahma Sahampati comes along and says, please teach for the benefit of others. 
And the Buddha literally turns outwards, turns his gaze and sees others. 
What he sees is suffering. 
What he sees is dukkha, actually, not suffering. 
What he sees is the pervasiveness of dukkha. 
And it's that, in that moment, that he becomes a Samyaksambuddhasa. 
He becomes a fully awakened one in that moment of turning about. 
Now, I think this is a lovely metaphor for, in some sense, the generation of compassion. 
Compassion isn't some gooey feeling inside of us. 
It's connected to seeing the pain of others supported by the ground of friendliness. 
But we can learn out of that ground of friendliness to begin to turn our gaze into the open expanse of the world and see the depths and the breadth of dukkha that's around. 
Now, without that, without that grounding, as I've suggested, then it is overwhelming to do that. 
But the real sense of compassion is that movement into the world. 
That engagement with the world, that doing something with it. 
So it's not just some kind of nice, warm feeling that we have. 
It's actually an activity. 
This is why it's also Kriya as well, or Kri in Pali. 
So it should generate activity. 
Generate the desire, the wish to help others in whatever way that that is possible. 
Now, I said a lot. 
I really feel like to pause here. 
I have to press my pause button. 
Because I can just go on and see kind of what issues are arising people out of what I've said so far. 
Because I kind of want to kind of then move on. 
Since I have the mic, I would like to ask you to comment on the. 
. 
. 
It's almost a practice or an appeal. 
You hear it a lot. 
The phrase is, please send meta. 
I wonder if you could comment on that. 
Well, in a literal aspect of it, you can't send meta. 
In the literal sense of the word. 
All you can do is incline your mind towards the meta. 
Hold people in good thought. 
You can't actually send the meta. 
Kind of putting an envelope with a postage stamp on it and putting meta inside and sending it to them. 
You can't do that. 
All you can do is incline your mind out of good will towards that person. 
To wish them well. 
This is actually what it's about. 
Because, obviously, as you know that within Buddhist practice and thought, there is no one in the sense who's going to be the messenger for it. 
There's no God. 
There's no Hermes. 
There's no deliverer of the message in this way. 
But, in a sense, in inclining the mind towards meta, and if there's a number of people inclining the mind towards meta, hopefully things are generated in a much more positive way out of it. 
I don't know if that answers your question, but you can't really send it. 
Hi. 
I was wondering if you could give us some practical encouragement about in those moments when we find ourselves with our habitual tendencies and knee-jerk reactions, how do we be friendly in that moment when it's like, oh, here I go again, and there tends to be, for me at least, judgments and seeing the pattern. 
You say we should be friendly. 
Befriend all of our thoughts. 
We should befriend our thoughts. 
I mean, as I said earlier on, that word doesn't work for everybody, but I think most of you will understand what I mean by that. 
It's to come into an open acknowledgement of what is there without attraction or repulsion towards it. 
So, in other words, even if we don't actively befriend it in this way as I'm suggesting it, we do that, that we accept what is there. 
This is a kind of acceptance that this is how I am at this moment. 
This is the snapshot of me at this moment. 
That's not the totality of you, because at the next moment it will be different. 
And so we acknowledge, we go through a constant series of acknowledgments. 
Let's just take a very practical issue when we are doing ordinary basic practice, focusing on the breath, and your mind drifts off, and it goes off into your habitual tendencies, goes off into the stuff, but we constantly recycle. 
I always think of the mind as being the perfect organic recycling machine. 
You know, it recycles every bit of garbage that goes through. 
So we end up looking at the same stuff occurring again and again and again, and every time it comes up to acknowledge it, to accept it, to be with it, to. 
. 
. 
There are many different ways you can do this. 
You can label it, say, hello anxiety, hello fear, whatever it might be, but to hold it with gentleness. 
I think that's really what it's about. 
Normally there can be the kind of self-critic that comes in, immediately jumping in, I'm a good Buddhist and I shouldn't be thinking this. 
I've been meditating for 20 years. 
Why should I be thinking these horrible thoughts yet again? There's all that kind of self-critique stuff that comes in, and it's really starting to move away from that by just saying, hello, you're here again. 
And it's really the cultivation of what I call a gentle attitude. 
All too often, and this is just my personal opinion about this, too often I think meditation can get into being yet another harsh way of dealing with our minds, a very, very harsh, judgmental way of dealing with our minds. 
Whereas I think the instilling of a basic practice of gentleness, the way that you treat your mind, for example, even when you're holding the breath, you hold it with gentleness. 
I usually describe this as allowing your mind to rest on the breath, rather than focusing on the breath. 
You allow it to rest on the breath, so you allow it to rest on the movement, the coming and going of the breath. 
There's gentleness, but there's also a degree of firmness in doing that, but there's not force. 
And when the mind drifts away, there's no self-castigation. 
This is what minds do, have you noticed? This is what minds are always doing, as I said to the group yesterday. 
Minds, you suddenly discover, have minds of their own. 
They are off doing their own thing, they're playing. 
You want it to be with the breath, but they're off playing. 
But instead of castigating that, you hold it with gentleness and you gently acknowledge where it's gone, seeing where it is, seeing what, for example, the patterns that have risen in the mind. 
Holding it there, perhaps befriending it, if you can use that word, certainly acknowledging it, and then gently bringing yourself back. 
So the whole process is one of kindness, not one of brutalizing the mind again. 
We're extremely good at doing that. 
We're extremely good at doing that. 
And one of the things I think we have to take into account is our Western psychology, in the sense that I think most Westerners want to be perfect at things pretty quickly. 
And meditation is no exception to that. 
If I'm meditating on, I don't know, let's say calmness for a change. 
I want to be calm. 
When do I want calm? Now! It's not that, it's a process of cultivating calm. 
I want calm. 
I've paid my money. 
I've put in my time. 
I want it now. 
And so there's this kind of quest for perfection all the time. 
And actually what the meditative process, I'm sure most of you have gathered this, actually reveals to us is our imperfections. 
Constantly. 
We're constantly having to deal with our imperfections. 
Now in doing that, in having these imperfections revealed to us, we can either treat them harshly or we can treat them gently. 
You heard what I said earlier on, there's no point in making enemies out of your thoughts. 
They just come and go and they come and go and they come and go. 
So better to befriend them. 
Better to come into a friendlier relationship with them, even if you don't use that word. 
Sorry, it's a very long, I'm always good at this, baking long answers out of short questions. 
Do you feel it's useful to explore near and far enemies in this practice? Will you speak more about that? Yeah, it's very useful to explore near and far enemies. 
Particularly I think the near enemies, probably more than the far enemies, I think we know what the far enemies often are. 
The opposite friendliness is kind of aversion and aggression and all the rest of it. 
But the reason why I talked about sentimentality, the near enemy of meta is a degree of sentimentality. 
It looks very much like, and this is the whole point of the near enemies, is the near enemies look like the very thing that you're supposed to be cultivating. 
It's even more explicit in the near enemy of Ulpeca, because the near enemy of Ulpeca is Ulpeca. 
Actually in Pali, it's really interesting. 
They use the same word, because actually the Ulpeca that's being translated as the near enemy is indifference. 
Not equanimity. 
So when we get in a state of deadness and indifference, we could actually say to ourselves, oh, yes, I'm equanimous. 
You're just dead. 
But it looks very much like the thing that's being proffered as the goal of it. 
So it's always very useful to look at the near enemies. 
And that near enemy of meta is being something sentimental. 
I'm having this friendly, sort of friendly, loving relationship with everybody. 
I go gooey and starry eyed and all this sort of stuff. 
And it isn't like that. 
It's much more pragmatic, the whole relationship of it. 
So the short answer to this one is yes, it's very important to look at it. 
Far enemies, I think, make themselves very clear. 
But I think near enemies are the ones to look at, because they're basically sheep in wolves' clothing. 
Just one more, and then I think we ought to take a break. 
I have the microphone, so I guess I get to be the next one. 
I have a question. 
Speaking about kind of brutality in our mind, something that I've noticed that I used to be brutal towards myself is a verse that is in the Mehta Sutra, and I was wondering if you could comment on it. 
And it's the verse that refers to, even as a mother, protects with her life a child, her only child, who should one, with a boundless heart, send Mehta to others, essentially. 
So can you comment on that? Because that's kind of the feeling or the message that I've been getting, is that, oh, I should feel the same as a mother would towards a child, towards others. 
Yes, I mean, the boundless friendliness. 
So this is what it's about. 
The mother, for example, the relationship is interesting in the actual original text. 
It's usually translated as a mother towards her only child. 
It's actually towards her only son. 
Shows you the culture. 
But this is the way it's brought up into the modern translation. 
Now, it's not always the mother is going to have automatic love towards her child, but she might look after it in its frailness and its nakedness and its vulnerability and everything else. 
And I think it's that that's really being put at the forefront of it, not that you have to love everybody. 
This is why I said it's not love. 
It's had this friendliness towards this being, this vulnerable being. 
And I think that is the displacement, then, on to others. 
Now, I don't know how it is with everybody within the room, obviously, but when I began to look at this and started to critique in a way the translation of matter as loving kindness, love is a very difficult thing to feel love for everybody in this way. 
I know it's certainly lauded in some traditions, not Buddhist traditions, but love as being a fundamental dimension. 
But I think in the Buddhist teaching it's actually much more pragmatic in that that friendliness is something we can do, whether it's the vulnerability of your child, even if you don't have a direct relationship with it in the sense of automatically loving it, you still might protect and look after this vulnerable being. 
Equally so, we can do this with others. 
I might not necessarily, as I've said earlier on, like everybody, but I can certainly generate respect and friendliness towards everybody and actually begin to see their vulnerability through that. 
Much of the malice in the world isn't done out of maliciousness, out of genuine maliciousness, and that sounds like an oxymoron almost. 
But it is done out of woundedness, you know, and that's very difficult to see, I think that's really, really difficult for us to see, particularly if we're caught up in it, you know, somebody's really horrible to you. 
It's very difficult often to see that actually what this person is doing to you is out of their own woundedness, not out of any direct sense of maliciousness. 
The meta, I think, helps you to do that. 
It helps you to see the vulnerability of the other, to hold them in a friendlier gaze. 
And I wasn't joking in a way and saying that might only be a few seconds, and let's be practical about this because, you know, our conditioning is so strong it often kicks back in. 
But, you know, even if it's only for a few seconds that you can hold somebody in a different gaze and perceive for momentariness that vulnerability, then you can develop as a feeling of friendliness towards them, perhaps build on that to do it. 
And I think that's really what's meant by that passage within it. 
So we build on this, you know. 
And it's very interesting because, again, actually Buddha goes, it does use that metaphor, you know, of the mother with the child, you know. 
The first of all is the kind of friendliness towards the child, and the koruna is then friendliness towards the sick child, is the development of the feeling towards the sick child. 
You know, the child that's actually you see who's suffering, you know. 
Now, I don't think any of them, it's very interesting that actually in Buddhist texts, love is not at the forefront of this. 
Isn't it? I mean, I don't know if any of you have ever sort of thought about this. 
You don't actually encounter the word love. 
What you encounter often, even in texts like the Dhammapada, is hatred is not overcome by hatred. 
It's overcome by non-hatred. 
Actually is what the Pali says. 
You know, it's often then translated as love, but actually it says non-hatred. 
You know, it's kind of implying something, but I think it's doing it deliberately. 
It's partly the way we negate in Asian languages, and particularly in Pali and Sanskrit. 
But I think it's also trying to get us away from the sentimentality side of it. 
So, that's my gloss. 
Shall we take a 15 minute break? 12. 
12? Yes.
