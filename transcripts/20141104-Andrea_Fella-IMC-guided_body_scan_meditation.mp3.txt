Allow yourself to simply arrive here. 
Sit here in this room and know that you're sitting here in this room. 
It can be very simple to begin. 
Be aware of the experience of sitting and the sounds that are coming in. 
It can be helpful also at the beginning of a period of meditation to allow the body to relax. 
So we'll start with a little bit of a body scan, just opening to the possibility of relaxing various parts of the body. 
So relaxing the head and face and jaw, softening the muscles of the neck and shoulders, relaxing the arms. 
You might also be able to relax a little bit inside the shoulder socket, inside the elbows, inside the wrists, and the hands. 
Relaxing the muscles of the chest and upper back. 
All the muscles around the rib cage. 
Sometimes taking a deeper breath can support this, support relaxing in the chest area. 
You might just take a deeper breath or two. 
Notice how this stretches those muscles and then how they can relax and release on the out breath. 
Then letting the breathing return to normal. 
Relaxing the stomach and abdomen. 
Seeing if there can be a softening of the muscles in the middle and lower back. 
Releasing any tension that you're holding in the pelvis and hips. 
Maybe even possible to relax inside the hip socket. 
Relaxing the legs. 
Including the knees, the ankles, the feet. 
Then having consciously relaxed as much as possible the muscles of the body. 
Sometimes it's also possible to soften any holding you might be doing inside the body. 
So just check in and see if there might be a softening possible or relaxing inside the throat. 
Relax your heart. 
Relax your stomach. 
Relax your intestines. 
Relaxing all the organs inside the body. 
As we relax the body it can support our minds to also relax. 
Also be interesting to explore the possibility of relaxing the mind. 
One suggestion Gil sometimes makes along these lines is just as if your brain were a muscle. 
You can relax your brain. 
Letting go of worries or concerns about the past. 
Thoughts, concerns about the future. 
In favor of opening to just what is the experience right here and now. 
Seeing if there can be a relaxing around that as well. 
No need to have the idea or the attitude of needing to fix or change anything. 
Rather inclining towards opening to whatever is happening here and now. 
Here and now there is this body sitting here with its pressures and pulsing and tension and hardness and coolness and softness and heat. 
This body experiencing itself as a body. 
There is the reception of sound in the ear happening right now. 
This is just the body doing its job to hear. 
One of the things we explore opening to is just what is happening in the mind and body in the moment. 
And some of that includes the ear receiving sound. 
Sound outside. 
Obvious sounds. 
Sounds that come and go. 
Sounds that linger. 
Sounds in the room. 
Sound in my voice. 
Relax and allow the ear to do its job. 
To do its work of hearing. 
We don't need to be in contention with sounds when we are practicing mindfulness meditation. 
If sound is what is being experienced we can simply know sound is happening. 
Hearing. 
Hearing is happening. 
Also present in the moment is the mind's response to experience. 
That it recognizes what is happening. 
It recognizes sounds. 
It recognizes a car. 
That's the mind doing its work. 
The sound is just vibration and pitch and tone and then the mind recognizes car, leaf blower, voice, bird. 
We're not trying to stop that process. 
The mind also often responds, sometimes reacts to experience. 
We like some things, we don't like other things. 
Often related to whether we find things pleasant or unpleasant. 
This also can be known. 
Pleasant sound, unpleasant sound. 
So our mindfulness practice can open to the entirety of our experience. 
It can open to emotions. 
The mind recognizing things, feeling things. 
And open to hearing and bodily sensation. 
Nothing is outside of the realm of our mindfulness practice. 
And we explore opening to experience with as much interest and curiosity as we have rather than needing to have an agenda to get rid of certain things or change things. 
Can you be curious what's actually happening right now? And often it is helpful in our meditation practice to pick one of the various things that's happening in the present moment as a place to settle, connect with experience, to support this awareness of just what's happening here and now. 
That might be sound for you. 
There's a lot of sound happening. 
You can just open to that as a place to rest the attention. 
Or it might be the body, the sense of the body sitting here. 
Or it might be the experience of breath in the body. 
And the breath is always here. 
But whatever, if you decide to choose an experience to allow the attention to rest with, really helpful to encourage that attitude of resting with rather than forcing the mind to stay somewhere. 
See if you can relax into the experience of breathing or relax into the experience of hearing. 
Both breath and sound can be really helpful places to rest the attention because both of them have a lot of change. 
The rhythm of the breath changes with the in-breath and the out-breath. 
And sounds are continually changing. 
Allowing your gentle, relaxed attention to just enter into the flow, if possible, of this changing river of sensation. 
And of course, the attention will lose touch with the experience and wander off into thought. 
It's completely natural that that will happen. 
And at some point you'll notice you'll wake up recognizing that you've been lost in thought. 
And in that moment, you're already mindful again, mindfulness has returned. 
What have you become aware of in that moment? You might be thinking or planning or remembering or perhaps a sound wakes you up or a body sensation. 
And now that you are aware again, there's some level of choice you have. 
It can be helpful to reconnect, check in, see if there's any tension in the body. 
Relaxing again. 
And as it feels supportive to you to reconnect with whatever experience is supportive for you to stay present. 
Off in the breath, but sometimes it can be other experience such as sound. 
Over and over again, remembering. 
If you remember a hundred times in this sitting that you've forgotten, your time will be well spent. 
And in that moment, you'll realize that you're already in your own world. 
And in that moment, you'll realize that you're already in your own world. 
And in that moment, you'll realize that you're already in your own world. 
And in that moment, you'll realize that you're already in your own world.
