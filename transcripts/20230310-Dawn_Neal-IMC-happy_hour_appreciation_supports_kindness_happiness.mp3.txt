 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So again, welcome everyone. It's lovely to be here with you. Dawn Neal, for those of you who haven't met yet. And delighted you're here to practice for Happy Hour. I'm going to just build on for a few minutes before we get started. The reflection Liz gave yesterday on this beneficial feedback loop between gratitude and kindness. Those two tend to build each other, develop each other. And I'd like to add sort of a third element that she briefly mentioned but didn't emphasize, which is appreciation. And it's particular kinds of appreciation actually. So in the Buddha's teaching, appreciation, especially appreciating the good qualities in ourselves or other people, is a really classic preparatory practice, free practice, or loving kindness, or metta. And in our culture, this can be kind of a radically intuitive idea, counterintuitive idea, right? It's helpful not just to notice the good qualities, the virtuous qualities of others, but to also appreciate your own. And that's not a thing about being puffed up. That's not about being conceited. It's not about even about pride. Instead, specific appreciation of the good, or as the commentaries put it, the lovely. Appreciating the lovely can encourage those good qualities to grow, strengthen, manifest more in our own hearts and minds and lives, right? And as I'm blanking on who said this first, I'm remembering it from Rick Hansen, but he was quoting someone. He said, the neurons that fire together, wire together. So appreciating the virtuous, the good, the beneficial, actually strengthens it all on its own, even before you sit down to practice. What's interesting in this is appreciation interpersonally can also help. And can help good qualities grow just by the way we mirror other people, by the way we show up. In contemporary science, appreciation is also well being appreciated for being a key pathway towards meaning in life. And meaning is strongly correlated with joy, purpose, and happiness. So, for example, there's an article and I'm reading here in the journal Nature Human Behavior. A fairly recent article that points to how appreciating, experientially appreciating everyday pleasures, including the everyday pleasures of thinking, helps to form that pathway to meaning. And this is one place of many where contemporary science and the ancient Buddhist teachings kind of come together, right? Because appreciating thinking is a lot easier when what we are thinking is kind, right? Pleasant, uplifting, and appreciative of our own virtues and those of others. When we take time to notice the good, the lovely, and work against the natural negativity bias, that in turn leads to yet another positive beneficial feedback in our hearts and minds. So those are my reflections and to kind of the heart of happy hour, guided meditation. And I will be bringing in this quality of appreciation kind of at the beginning and then we'll move into more of a general kindness practice. So if you haven't already, settle back. Find a comfortable posture that balances ease and alertness. If it's helpful to turn your face away or your chair away from the screen, you're welcome to do that. I will stay here. So you're welcome to look or not look. It's up to you. So starting by just taking stock, maybe going inward, softening the eyes, closing if that feels right, and noticing how these words have landed. Just how are you? How's your energy? How's your heart? How's your mood? Your body? Allowing two, maybe three, longer, slower, maybe deeper breaths in and out, releasing any excess tension, effort, anything that doesn't need to be here with you right now. Just letting it go, landing here. And then allowing the breathing to be natural. Scanning through the body. Really taking in, drinking in all the parts of your body, skin, or touches the air, clothing, the weight or pressure of your feet on the mat or floor, your hips and buttocks and chair or cushion. If you're leaning back against a surface, appreciating the support. And then leaving the body beneath whatever surface you're on, noticing the boundless support of the earth, reaching inwards, appreciating the aliveness in this body, this lifelong friend, your body, always with us. Noticing pulsing, rotating, solidity, spaciousness, warmth or cool. Attuning to movement, to breathing, if that's a natural anchor of attention for you. Sinking in, soaking in the moment. Now turning your attention to the area of your chest. Perhaps noticing any feelings of the breath there and any other sensations there. And now calling to mind. Someone you respect, like maybe even really careful or someone easy. And really intentionally, as you imagine them, maybe picture them or have a felt sense of them. Recall some things that you appreciate about them. They're good qualities. Something beautiful about them or a virtue of some kind. And noticing, celebrating whatever these good qualities are with appreciation. Breathing. Noticing how that feels. Quite appreciating. Celebrating. And as you contemplate these good qualities. Allowing a natural sense of metta, goodwill, kindness to emerge. And sending them this metta. Maybe on the out breath, and perhaps with an imagined gesture. Maybe on the in breath. Or just when pausing. Noticing how this feels in your body and your heart. It's helpful to add phrases to focus these wishes, goodwill. Please use your own or you may use a variant, something like this. May you be safe, happy, healthy. May you be peaceful, easeful, and free. Distilling the phrases to one or two words helps build focus, samadhi, concentration. Safe, happy, healthy, peaceful, easeful, and free. Synchronizing your wishes with breathing. Or allowing them to build their own rhythm. And time to time. Perhaps imagining this other one receiving these good wishes. An expression, body language, or just energetic sense. Thank you. It's helpful to visualize or imagine breathing out from the heart, breathing into the heart. Perhaps sending light to our energy and receiving how it feels, these good wishes. Now turning the lens, the loving lens of kindness, back towards the person in your seat. Noticing the generosity, appreciating the virtue of sending these good wishes. Perhaps regarding this body, heart, and mind. The same kind of appreciation, a loving friend, beloved mentor might. Wishing these good wishes for yourself as well. May I be safe, happy, healthy. May I be peaceful, easeful, free. Radiating good wishes through every cell, every bone, every tissue of the body. Radiating like light through heat, suffusing every corner of the heart and mind. Thank you. It feels helpful and it's fine to include this other one. And then use we. We be safe, happy, healthy. Loves of kindness. Thank you. Thank you. And then move it feels right, allowing the ripples, expanding the rings of loving kindness, outwards, perhaps towards anyone nearby in any direction. It's fine to think of specific people or creature or just allow these wishes to ready to ripple out, touching who they will, anyone in their path. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The next meditation is to let the kindness, the metta, be unbounded, flowing through every corner of heart and mind, through all of experience, outwards in every direction, as far or as close as it wants to go. Radiate like a star, like sun. Save. And healthy. Peaceful. Peaceful. Thank you. Thank you. And now I'd like to take five minutes of this meditation. Feel free to continue what you're doing or perhaps let go and just fast be with the heart and the mind, allowing flow of experience to move through, and outward, all directions, resting in the field, created by the intentions of the metta. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. Thank you. Just like to invite you, if you're comfortable turning on your video, that's great and if you're not, that's fine. But just to stay in meditative space for a couple of minutes and scroll through the tiles, seen or unseen, wishing goodwill, friendliness, metta to the other participants in happy hour. And sending thoughts and wishes to those who are not here right now, who are practicing asynchronously with us through recording. And as you're sending these good wishes, trusting, knowing that you're receiving them from others in this moment. Just feeling that in your heart. Thank you. Thank you for that. So, if anyone feels like chiming in, we have a few moments here just to have any reflections on the practice, questions that came up for you. Anything you'd like to share in the next few minutes, you're welcome to say it. Or if you feel shy to put it in the chat. Since we have more than one screen worth of people. And I invite you to use your demand, just so we don't talk over each other. And I'm going to make an announcement while people are mulling this over. Many of you are regulars here and well practiced in living kindness. However, if some of you are new or new ish, please know that I am offering a five week introduction to loving kindness course that starts tomorrow morning, Pacific time 930 am. And that is through the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies, which I'll put a link in the chat. If anyone's interested in joining your warm light welcome. Sati Center is charging a small registration fee, but if that is a barrier, you can email them and have it waived. So if anyone is welcome. And that is also over Zoom. Any questions or comments about the meditation before we move on to the next set of activities for happy hour? So I have a question for you, which is something to hold in mind as we form breakout groups, and then maybe to share with the group afterwards. And that question is, what are some qualities that you appreciate or admire in others? What are some qualities that you might want to emulate in yourself or that you already do aspire to in yourself? And thank you for the appreciation that came in in the chat. I appreciate that. So holding that question, and I'm going to start to set up breakout rooms. And just to say, this is an optional, optional thing. You do not have to participate. If you prefer not to, you can just stay in this room with your camera, or you can leave your camera on. My camera will be off and I'll be muted. But we will spend about six minutes or so in breakout rooms. Be patient at the beginning because I might need to rebalance them sometimes. The numbers are a little... Wait. Please enjoy your practice. You're on the other side. Welcome back. We have a few more coming back, I think. Maybe a lot more coming back. In about 15 seconds. Meanwhile, does anyone have a question or comments? Look how that was. Welcome back, everyone. Welcome. So I would love to hear any just reflections on how it felt to be in connection or anything that emerged in the conversation that was helpful for you. Anybody willing to talk or text? I'm going to start with you. Yes. Someone raised their hand. Yes. Okay. Three hands. Pietro, then Kenneth, then Andrew. Okay. But the conversation was very lovely overall. Just very brief time, but getting to know each other. I also wanted to share about the meditation. I really thank you for that and how sometimes the heart just opens. I don't know for me, it was kind of strange, but it happened in a way that I was just going through people at work and just going almost like cube by cube. It's amazing how you have people that they're somewhat really like, but some of them are kind of indifferent usually. The heart was just open to them. Or even people that are a little bit difficult sometimes and it didn't really matter. It was just amazing how I could just use the geographic location to expand it. Yeah, just thank you so much for that. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Wonderful. I love this visualization of going cube by cube. Yeah. Thank you, Kenneth. Yes, please. Yeah, for one thing, I've been doing some work with Tara Brock, but I love doing meditation from inside my body. I just I did Kundalini for a long time, but I really, really loved it. And I wanted to add one other thing. I'm a dancer and there's a few people that I that in my community are for some reason snubbing me. And I've tried everything, try to figure out what it was, and I was really upset about it. And I brought spirit in and it calmed me down. I got to this place of I don't give a shit. And that was like a big step for me. It was a step out of that pain and worry and stress about it. So I don't know if that anybody relates to that, but that for me was a positive movement. But you're describing is great, Kenneth, like the movement to equanimity that this practice sometimes can move us there. I don't give a shit. It's a form of equanimity, right? It's okay. It's okay. It can roll off. Yeah, it's an acceptance. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Andrew, please. Hi, everyone. Just wanted to do. First, since I've been a long time meditator, I am doing occasionally go to these events. I want to thank everyone for being so welcoming. And for those of us who are shy or anxious, it was just so kind for everyone to be so welcoming. So I appreciate that. And the second I was going to share is that I learned from, I believe her name is Aya Ananda Bodhi, one of the nuns at Aloka Vihar. About a kind of two phrase loving kindness, which is like, which I adapted with a kind of tick not hon kind of vibe where you breathe in and imagine the heart warming and then breathe out and imagine it being like sunshine going out. And I was kind of riffing with your guidance today, Dawn, and just thinking, I was, oh yeah, I remember that and just wanted to share that. That's all. Beautiful. Thank you, Andrew. And thank you for speaking up. That takes courage for shy people to speak up in this room. Ananda Bodhi does absolutely beautiful meditations. I've been a spiritual friend of hers for many years. She's been a guide for me. So thank you for bringing her name into. Vicky, please. Hey, I really liked today, the, the expression that Kenneth had about breathing out distress and breathing in loving kindness to coddling babies. And I could remember that time, having a little baby and it was really a helpful image and experience that is that is based in the body. It's great. Thank you, Vicky and thank you for that image. That's beautiful, really beautiful. I love the different forms of creativity, people are bringing really heartening, joy making. Anybody else? Yeah, Charles, please. Oh, thanks. Yeah, it gave me the the method of the sit itself. Yeah, there was like a, like a, I guess in the, well I guess it's called Tonglen. I think I've learned it kind of from Pema Chodron. It had that kind of, that kind of feel but almost maybe a reverse, you know, the previous person mentioned, you know, sending out, you know, breathing in spirit sending out distress, and I think in Tonglen you kind of, you know, inhale suffering and, oh, you probably lost me. And then kind of exhale, you know, goodness you kind of, you know, metabolize it and then maybe kind of like how trees do. Thanks. I love the tree image, the visual of that. Yes. So my understanding of Tonglen, which I learned many years ago from Allama in India, is, yeah, the breathing in, the suffering and the metabolizing, letting the heart sort of alchemically change it to kindness and compassion and breathing that out, that's a beautiful practice. And so is breathing in a nourishment and breathing out letting go. Right. I think helpful not to aim any negativity that's being let go of at anyone. Just, that's not exactly spiritual practice, that's something else, right. But the creativity is wonderful. Does anyone else have things they've discovered that they want to share? We have a couple minutes left. I see Vicki, how's it held up? Vicki, is your hand still up from earlier? Yes, I'll remove that. Okay. Okay. Oh, Jamie, please. It all raised mine. Don, I just wanted to say that this evening helped up a streak of every time I have participated in Happy Hour since January 2021, I have felt welcome to my small group with open hearts and loving kindness, and it happened again today. It's just such a magical part of this Sangha, so thank you to everyone who I've been in a small group with and to the two who were with me today. Beautiful. Thank you for that. It's wonderful to hear and not surprising. This Sangha has been cultivating mekta for years now. It's really kind of a very inspiring thing that we have this many people who come together many, many weeknights to cultivate this and share it. It's beautiful. So, thank you for all of you who helped make this happen. I'm looking at some regulars here. And, Neil, perhaps you could put the Google group information in for anyone who might be new. There is a Google group now associated with Happy Hour. Many of you know this, but some of you might not. And most of you it's a way to keep in touch. I'm also looking over at the chat now. Amy, thank you. I felt so much lightness and love in both the sit and in my group. Thank you. There's a lot of love and care in this group. Deep bows to that. Deep bows to that. So, we are just about at times, so I just want to take a moment to dedicate the benefits of this practice. May I practice here together? Ripple through our lives and minds and hearts, outwards and outwards, through every corner of our lives, and to all the lives we touch, and all of the lives they touch, on and on. May all beings benefit from kindness, compassion, goodwill. May all beings be safe, peaceful, and free. Enjoy to be with you all. Thank you for your practice. Feel free to unmute and say goodbye if you wish. Thank you so much. Thank you, Dawn. Goodnight, Amy. Goodnight, Amy. Goodnight, Jocelyn. Goodnight, Dawn. Goodnight, Ray. Goodnight, Dan.
