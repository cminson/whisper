 Bring up any questions or comments or reports about doing either the meditation or the exercises in the handout. No, no. Yes, please? I tried being more aware of my thoughts during meditation. And I found that there's a thought can arise in my head, and I don't even know exactly what it is, or I can't verbalize what it is. I can sort of stop it before I even know what it is. But then I wasn't sure if I should wait until it bloomed into it, the thought that I could name as part of the exercise. It almost seemed like I could end up thinking more by observing my thoughts. Or it seemed I could just let them be those little bubbles that didn't really have names, and just watch them as those little bubbles. Yeah, I think the latter. So what she said is that if she's in her meditation, if she starts paying attention to her thinking, thoughts, she can be aware of the bubble of a thought arising, kind of the impulse to think, before she actually knows what the content of her thoughts are. It's like a little impulse to have a thought. And if she's right there, she can let go of it, and she'll never know what that thought was. It might have been the key to the universe or something. And so if she wants to know if that was okay, or whether she should let her thoughts come up, she can watch the thoughts, because part of what we do in mindfulness is to watch what's going on, be present for things. And I think that when a person can be very mindful and very present for the first impulse to have a thought, that just to be fully mindful of that disengages us from fueling or getting involved with that thinking, and it naturally by itself dissipates, and you'll never know what you're thinking. So if it's just that, that's good practice. However, if you're noticing the impulse to think, and there's some aversion to that, and I'm kind of pushing it away, that's not what the practice is. Okay, well then we can sit in silence too. So take a comfortable alert posture. And gently close your eyes. And even though I've been teaching you to kind of set yourself up for meditation by breathing deeply and various things, none of that's really required for mindfulness practice, because in mindfulness you can just start where you're at and just be aware of what's happening. Sometimes the beginning of meditation is useful to know if there's any particular concerns, preoccupations, which are present for you and which are likely to reoccur as you meditate. And if you know what those are, then perhaps you're less likely to, if you fully acknowledge those tendencies to be preoccupied by those things, you might be less likely to be swept up by them as you meditate, to kind of look out for them. So you might take a moment just to see if that's the case, if there's any strong preoccupations that are likely to visit while you're meditating. And if there are such things, maybe a small reminder that it's a relatively short period of time we're meditating, and these preoccupations can be considered later. So the not now approach. Well, think about it later. There's lots of time later. So then taking a few slow, long and deep breaths into your body, into your belly, connecting to your body from the inside as you breathe in, and then as you exhale, relaxing, letting go of tension, tightness. Some people brace themselves with their body against life, I suppose. If you take a deep breath and just then let go, maybe you can let go of whatever holding back that you have. And then letting your breath breathe itself, not breathing in any particular way, not forcing the breath in any way. Then taking a few moments again to help settle you in, to let your awareness roam about your body freely, just being aware of whatever sensations of the body show themselves, noticing the tensions in the body. And each time you exhale, relaxing some part of your body. Each time you exhale, letting go of your thoughts and concerns, letting go of any tension in your body that's easy to let go of. So then you exhale, let go of your thoughts and concerns, let go of your thoughts and concerns. And then you exhale, let go of your thoughts and concerns. And then you exhale, let go of your thoughts and concerns. And then you exhale, let go of your thoughts and concerns. As you exhale, exhale is a kind of a letting go. Be there for that letting go without forcing it or straining. Let go fully as you exhale. Allow the inhalation to arise on its own. Thank you. And then letting yourself be very simple with your breathing. Feeling where in your body the experience of breathing is predominant. And letting your attention settle there. Feeling the body's experience of breathing in, and feeling how the body experiences breathing out. Thank you. When you notice that the mind has wandered off in thoughts, relax and begin again with your breathing. And it doesn't matter how often the mind wanders away. And what matters is that you begin again when you notice that's the case. And that's what you notice. And what matters is that you begin again when you notice that's the case. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To be mindful is to use the mind's ability to notice what's happening. To notice what's happening with your breathing. To notice what's happening in your body. To notice what's happening with your mind. To stay in the stream of noticing, as opposed to getting involved or thinking about anything at all. Let go of all your concerns the best you can, just moment by moment. You can almost ask yourself the question, what is happening now? What is happening now? Moment by moment, staying alert and keep noticing. Don't be seduced away from the noticing into what you're thinking about. Let the stream of noticing be the expression of your non-reactive awareness that stays alive. Let go of all your concerns. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Notice when you've stopped being mindful. Notice what that's like for the mindfulness to be lost or to stop. And then very gently begin again being mindful, being aware of what's happening with your breathing. If there's strong experiences in your body, be aware of what's happening in your body. Let go of the breath. If there are strong emotional or mood or mental states that arise, know that. If you find yourself thinking, know that. Very gently but persistently maintain the stream of noticing what's happening in the present. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Noticing when you're caught up in your thoughts. Noticing what that's like. Using your ability to notice, to be mindful, to begin again with your breathing. Each inhalation needs exhalation. A time to let go of your thoughts and concerns. Each in-breath and each out-breath. A time to settle into the present moment a little bit more fully. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. As you're breathing in and breathing out, notice if any part of the cycles of breathing might be less clear than other parts. If the end of the exhalation is kind of vague for the awareness, that's the time and the mind is most likely going to wander off in thought. Try to maintain a steady and continuous awareness of your cycle of breathing throughout the cycle. Without straining, just being persistent so the breath helps pull you into the present moment more and more. More and more settled in your body. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. So we'll end this sitting in a couple of minutes. Spend the last couple of minutes appreciating your ability to be attentive and aware, to be alert, wakeful, awake to what is going on. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. Notice how the stream is not being exposed to the noticing. So the idea in mindfulness meditation is to learn to develop a quality of wakefulness, of being awake to what is going on. The opposite of wakefulness or being awake, I suppose, would be to be asleep, which many spiritual traditionists described, is used to describe the basic human condition. Most people are asleep. They aren't literally asleep, but many of us spend much of our days lost in or caught up in our thoughts, our plans, planning, our memories. And it's a significant shift to go from the normal kind of preoccupations of the mind, the mind being preoccupied, and not even know that it's thinking or what it's doing, to being awake and wakeful about what's going on in the moment. And that ability to the mind to be wakeful or wake to what's going on, if you can get a sense of the difference between that, it can really help maybe for you to appreciate then the value, the satisfaction that comes from being awake to what's happening as opposed to caught up with what's happening or caught up with something else that's not even happening at all. So in the practice of mindfulness meditation, it's most common to use the breathing as the anchor for keeping us in the present moment. The breath is always occurring, for the most part, and so you can use that as an anchor. When you're with the breath, you're with the present moment. The mind wanders off. You can come back quite easily to the breath. And as your ability to stay with the breath develops, you're also then developing your ability to stay more and more in the present moment. All the kind of centrifugal forces that pull the mind away from the present moment begin to quiet down, slow down. Your ability to stay present and awake becomes stronger. And with time, that ability then to be in the present becomes more part of your everyday life, not only your meditation life but your normal life. And sooner or later, as people do the meditation practice, there comes a point where they feel that, how do I integrate this in the rest of my life? It's one thing to be able to sit and meditate and become somewhat calm, more centered, more awake, more present for what's happening. But how about doing that in the rest of my life? How about doing it outside of meditation? Some people might realize that the barrier or the line they've drawn between the mind and meditation and the mind outside of meditation is an arbitrary line. It's the same mind, both cases. And so it becomes often a desire to try to live with the same kind of integrity or same kind of presence outside of meditation as occurs in meditation. There might also arise a desire to go further with the meditation. A person can be somewhat present, it's very satisfying to be present, but they like to go much further and not just kind of touch in occasionally, not to be just a little bit calm, but they like to develop the meditation to become much more penetrating into what's happening in the present moment, to get underneath the surface of the ideas we have about the present moment and into what's actually happening. So there are two general ways of developing the mindfulness practice after a person's kind of been introduced to the basic meditation practice. One way is to apply it more in our daily life, find ways of starting to be more wakeful, more alert, more attentive to what's happening in the present moment, to learn to develop, to have a non-reactive awareness to what's happening as we go about our day, to notice what we're feeling when we're in conversation with someone, to notice sensations in the body, to notice our posture, what happens to our posture as we're in conversation to someone, what happens to our tension in the body. To bring our attention to how we do our work, if it's a work that's basically desk work, it doesn't involve talking to people, how do we engage in that kind of work? Are we alert? Are we present? Do we get lost? What happens with our body, with our posture? What happens with our feelings, with our energy? To begin bringing attention to different parts of our life, start noticing more what's going on, to be driving your car, rather than turning on the radio. Maybe you'll find it more satisfying to begin developing sustained attention to the present moment while you're driving your car. I find it very satisfying those times that I do that. And what's interesting is that when I first maybe get in the car, I don't have the radio on, sometimes I'll feel this impulse to turn it on, this compulsion. And I can get all kinds of rationales about why it's a good idea to listen to the radio. But if I don't succumb to that temptation or that impulse, and then just hang in there to drive the car peacefully along, that after a few minutes, five or ten minutes of driving, that whole other sense of presence or sense of well-being or sense of alertness or presence kind of begins to settle in. That wouldn't have happened if I turned on the radio and drove kind of unconsciously. So it can happen while we're driving. It can happen in the normal kind of casual walking about that we do, walking between your car and your house or your car and the place of work or whatever. To walk in a way that's mindful, that's attentive, that's present for what's going on. Noticing what the common tendencies of your mind is. Noticing a common tendency of the mind to not be very present at all, to be ahead of itself, to be behind itself in the past, to be in fantasy land. And to begin maybe appreciating the almost palpable sense of satisfaction that can come from being present in the moment as opposed to letting the mind kind of wander freely in whatever way it wants. Not in a way that's oppressive or kind of forced to pay attention, but to begin appreciating that it's actually quite beautiful, deeply satisfying, to know what's happening in the present moment, to be here for it as we live our life. I don't know if I told the story at the beginning of the intro class, but I'm particularly fond of old photographs. And I noticed that I was fond of it before I understood why. And sometimes I go some places and have these old photographs on the wall that are over, usually they should be over 100 years old. And I like photographs of people a long time ago. And I found myself often looking at the facial expressions of these long dead people and also looking at their eyes. And sometimes these old photographs, they would capture an expression, an attitude, an expression in their face or in their body, or they express something in their eyes. You could see it. Sometimes it would be very sad. Sometimes you'd see what seemed to be very weary, depending on what kind of person, what kind of life they had. Sometimes there was kind of confidence you could see in the face, and where they were standing there. And sometimes a kind of joy and delight and all kinds of things, kind of emotions and feelings. But also sometimes occasionally in the eyes, there was this kind of spark of aliveness. Almost like you could see, well, that person's alive, kind of their eyes are alive. And radiant and kind of taking things in, kind of connecting to the world that they're looking at. And after a while of looking at photographs like this, I think that the reason why I was attracted to it was, I was appreciating that that's their moment to be alive. These are long dead people, but they had their time to be alive. They had their time to be conscious, to be awake, to be with their life. And that was their moment. And it was as valid as any other moment to be alive, and that's how they used it. They used it kind of to look at a camera, that moment. And again, I realize the reason why I'm attracted to this kind of reflection is that it comes back to me right now, that my moment to be alive and conscious is right now. And do I want to live that life and be in it, be present for it, or not? And I can be as, you know, I could be as gone as a hundred-year-old dead person if I am kind of lost in my fantasy and my rehearsing the past or redoing the past. As someone who's long dead, something happens to us, I think. If we get lost in our thoughts, we don't even know what we're doing in the present moment anymore, where there's a kind of a little death that sets in. There's a qualitative difference to our life when we're present and alive for it and awake to it, as opposed to when we get lost in our preoccupations, our concerns, our reactions to life. So these old photographs are kind of a reminder of me to kind of come back to what's happening right now. You know, me right now, this wonderful spark of consciousness, of alertness, of awakeness, which is always here. So many people, so one way to develop the practice after getting some introduction to the basic meditation practice is to begin applying the basic idea of mindfulness, of presence, into our daily life. And some people will do that in some interesting ways. It's one thing to have the intention, that all of us can be awake from now on, thank you. And then it's a setup for not doing so well, probably. But some people will do little things to help develop that mindfulness in their life, little cues that remind them to pay attention, to notice what's going on. Some people I know have used a telephone ringing. Some people have a tendency to feeling that it's very important to get to that telephone immediately, that you can let it ring too long, then, I don't know, is it insulting to the person who's calling or something? But you kind of let it ring for three or four or five times. Let the person kind of breathe mindfully on the other end. And then use that time for yourself to breathe and be present, notice what's going on. And you might notice, as I still notice at times, that I might not have noticed how I'm feeling, or what my attitude towards life or myself is, until I'm reminded to pay attention. So that telephone ring, for some people, is a cue. Oh, let's pay attention for two or three rings to what's happening. Check in with myself. Other people will use other kinds of cues to remember to pay attention. For a long time, I used door frames. Whenever I walked through a door, the door was a reminder to me to pay attention to what was going on with me. Pay attention to my body, my feelings, my thoughts, whatever was happening for me. And it was often a surprise to realize that for the last number of minutes, I basically wasn't here. I wasn't a normal kind of understanding of it being here, but I wasn't very aware of what was going on with me. So door frames, they're kind of a nice time to pay attention because you're actually entering into a new space. So it's nice to enter with some mindfulness of what's actually going on. Some people will take up particular activities, like one activity, and try to be really mindful and present for that activity for one week. And the next week they do another activity. So, for example, washing the dishes, or using the bathroom in the morning, or driving your car to work, or cleaning the house, or some particular activity. This week, every time I clean my house, I vacuum or dust or whatever I do, that that's going to be done mindfully. I'm not going to have the radio on. I'm not going to have to try to multitask. I'm going to really be present for this one activity and try to be present for myself and alert as I do this in a calm way. And I've known some people who did this exercise with light switches. Every time they're going to turn on and off with light switches, it's more like a cue. They're going to use light switches as a time to kind of pay attention to what's going on. Doing these kinds of exercises, some people might call them games, mindfulness games, helps kind of build the momentum of becoming kind of a habit to be awake and present. And you can't infuse different parts of our life with some appreciation of the difference between doing them in a way that we get lost, or not really present for things, versus doing things really present for them, and beginning to appreciate the value of presence. The mindfulness practice doesn't really work so well unless you begin sensing some deep satisfaction, some appreciation for the difference between being attentive and present, versus doing things but not being so present. There's a strong tendency in our culture now to multitask, to do more than one thing at once. And you might pay attention very carefully at the psychic cost, do an hour of multitasking, and then do an hour of doing one thing at a time, and see how you feel at the end of the hour doing it, compare it to two different ways you feel. Does the increased sense of well-being, or sense of being more in touch with yourself, or being less fragmented, that comes from doing one thing at a time, is that something that you value? And it's very easy in our kind of society not to put value on personal well-being because we're not being efficient. It's more important to get a lot of projects done. And I think it's kind of a strange way in which our priorities often get mixed upside down. So in order to begin applying the principles of mindfulness into the rest of our life, it takes some sooner or later, it takes some looking at our priorities. And that looking at our priorities makes much more sense if we have found some deeper satisfaction in being present and being awake, being here, knowing what that is. So applying meditation in daily life, but applying the mindfulness, starting to be attentive and awake throughout the day is part of what we do. The other way of developing the practice is to couple, bring together the mindfulness with concentration. To develop the mind, not just simply develop your ability to be mindful of what's happening in the present moment, but to actually develop that with a strong ability to focus on what's happening in the present moment, a strong, concentrated mind. Because when the mind becomes, it's one thing to kind of be in the present moment for a little while and the mind drifts away and you can come back and mind drifts away and you come back. It's one thing to even sometimes be very calm and feel like you can stay in the present moment for some time. It's another thing to be able to bring a very clear, kind of sharp, penetrating focus on the breath, on your feelings, on your thoughts, really kind of be very present in a kind of focused way, like bringing a magnifying glass on your experience. And that's what concentration brings to mindfulness, it's like a magnifying glass. So developing concentration, and there's two ways of doing that. One way is it happens, as a matter of course, if you keep doing a mindfulness practice, keep using the breath as a foundation of mindfulness meditation, then over time, over the weeks and the months and the years you do the practice, most people find that slowly the concentration built to focus will get stronger. The other way of developing concentration is to go on meditation retreats, to go on one day retreats, weekend retreats, ten day retreats, we have month long retreats, we have three month retreats. But to go on retreats, what happens on retreat is that the whole day is devoted to training your ability to be mindful and be attentive, to be wakeful. And as you develop that ability, and so there's no distractions, there's no need to multitask, there's no need to do anything else, but moment to moment, develop your ability to be present. And that ability to do so constantly on retreat helps develop the concentration. And some people will find that going periodically on retreats, it kind of jump starts, but kind of really has a great help in strengthening the daily meditation practice. So those are the two kind of ways in which a person might want to, if they're inclined, to go further with the practice than just having a simple daily sitting practice, as I've talked about here in the course. So one way is to begin applying it in daily life, and the other way is to go on retreat and find some way to develop the concentration. As the concentration develops, or as the mindfulness develops, some of the wisdom, or the insight, and other people and activities, through the filter of our conventions, I mean, a very simple convention is we have these three different colored lights, red, yellow, and green. As soon as I said that, probably most of you know what I mean, right? And we're slaves to these lights. We don't even think about it anymore. We've been so habituated, right, to, you see the red light and we speed up. Or whatever your habit is. Most people, it's a stop, right? And red means to stop. It's a convention. Nothing inherent in the color red, but it's a convention our society has adopted for, you know, stop your car. What happens with the mindfulness meditation as we develop it, and the mind gets calmer and more concentrated, the mind leaves the world of conventional thinking. And then we begin to see ourselves from a very different vantage point than we can see ourselves from if we're seeing ourselves through conventional thinking. And some of the transformative benefits of the mindfulness practice happens when we can step outside of our normal concepts and conventions about who we are, who other people are, and what the world is like. So I brought some show and tell to make an example of this. So I can hold up a flower, which is a beautiful thing to do. Hopefully you can see the flower. And so you can look at the flower and you can see the flower as it is. And you see the dustness of the flower, just a flower. It's a nice flower. And you're wondering what in the world is Gil up to. But it's a flower. So now what's interesting is if I hold up another flower next to the first one. So now I can say something that I couldn't say before, because now I can say this is the big flower and this is little flower. This wasn't the big or little flower before, this was just a flower. But now this is the big one, this little one. The bigness or the littleness of these flowers is not inherent in the flower. It belongs to the world of our comparative thinking. It's a convention in a sense. There's some truth to it, but it doesn't exist in the flower in and of itself. The flowerness of the flower, it belongs to the world of making relationships between things. Because, you know, you didn't know that I had great psychic magical abilities. But I have such magical abilities, I don't have to use a slight of hand even. All I have to do is pick up another one, and now the big flower has become little flower, right in front of your eyes. The bigness and littleness is not in the flower itself. So again, you might be wondering what in the world am I talking about? Why am I talking about this? It's one thing about flowers, it's another thing about us. Most of the problematic senses of self that we struggle under are forms of comparative thinking like that. And we see ourselves through comparative thoughts. We see ourselves a certain way, and we compare ourselves to other people who are a certain way. And our thing is too small, too big, too long, too fat, too short, too thin, whatever. And we don't see ourselves as we actually are. The humanness of us is like the flower-ness of the flower. But we see ourselves through the convention or the filter of the comparative thinking. And there's so much suffering that happens for many people in this kind of comparative thinking. The example I like to give is when I was in 1967, I was living in a small provincial town in Italy. And I had just come from Southern California. And so I had longer here than anyone in Italy. And I had the only one who had blue jeans. And I was really cool. And I knew it. And so I would go around town with a certain kind of – I was felt a little bit energized. I was kind of like the coolest, hippest kid in town. And I felt good about myself. Thank you. But then at the end of the summer of 1967, I flew back to California. And a lot that happened that summer. And lo and behold, without me knowing it, I didn't have the longest here in town anymore. And everyone else had discovered this wonderful thing that if you put your blue jeans in the washing machine 10,000 times, and tore them and patched them up, then you were really hip. And I just had blue jeans. And all that happened was I had flown across the Atlantic. And now I was comparing myself to new people. And now I felt deflated. So depending on who I was comparing myself to, I either felt inflated or deflated. And in both those situations, I wasn't just resting in the beingness of who I am. But I was seeing myself through the filter of these conventional comparisons that we can make. So many of the ways that we feel bad and struggle with ourselves belong to this world of conventions and ideas. As we allow ourselves to enter into the meditation more deeply, becoming calmer, more settled, not chasing after our thoughts, letting go of our thoughts, letting go of our ideas, then you'll find at some point that you drop out of this kind of comparative thinking, out of seeing things through the filter of conventions. So when you see a red light, you see red. It doesn't mean anything more than just it's red. So don't do this meditation while you're driving. I think you get the idea. And then to have the experience of leaving ourselves alone, not applying all these filters of conventions and ideas, not seeing ourselves through them, but letting ourselves just rest in the naturalness of our being in a sense, or just the ease, speed ease, without applying any comparative thought or conventions, just us in the moment as we are. No need to get anywhere, no need to be anything for anybody, no need to attain anything, no need to reject anything, just to be with things as they are in a very simple and uncomplicated way. To have that, have discovered that ability is transformative, because for so many of us, our life is lived in the conventions, in the comparative thoughts. And we don't know there's any other way. But as you let yourself kind of go day after day, week after week, settle a little bit further, a little bit further, and learning to train yourself not to be living in your thoughts all the time, you'll find this wonderful treasure within yourself of this ability just to be, to leave yourself alone and let the beingness of yourself be there in a way that can feel deeply satisfying, to drop all the masks of who you are, and just be yourself for the first time, perhaps. So that's why I say that as people do the meditation practice, some people describe the process of change as one of feeling increased integrity. And as we feel this greater integrity as being ourselves and leaving ourselves alone, then it becomes, I think, often just natural then to want to begin living that outside of meditation. How then can I live not cut up in all these ideas and conventions and thoughts, but how can I be present in this very simple and uncomplicated way as I go about my life? How can I be in a sense without masks as I live my life? Or how can I be present in a direct way for life as it is? Nothing to defend, nothing to build up, nothing to hide. So in the course of the five-week introductory class, we started off with this very simple idea of bringing mindfulness attention to your breathing. And what many of you probably found is it's not so easy to stay with your breath. The mind wanders off quite easily. When the mind wanders away from the breath, how you bring your mind back to the breath is actually very important. Because some people, and it's very interesting to investigate a little bit, what your attitude is towards the mind drifting away from the breath, drifting away from the present moment when you're in meditation. Is it one more opportunity to beat yourself up, to break yourself? Oh, there I'm, you know, I've done all these different activities and hobbies and whatever in my life, and I've failed every one of them, and I'm going to fail this one too. You know, you can set up your self-criticalness or whatever, or disappointment or whatever. Notice what happens to you, if anything, when your mind wanders off. And just try to be very accepting of it. Just try to bring the non-reactive awareness to that event. And then gently allow the breath, the breathing, to come back to your awareness. There's no need to jerk your mind back or to pounce back on the breath, which some people do. But rather it's a spirit of kind of gentleness or openness or allowing. So paying attention to how you relate to that moment when the mind wanders off is actually very helpful to make the meditation more satisfying and peaceful. To make that moment of mind wandering off and then coming back to be a gentle kind of peaceful event in itself. Not a moment of self-criticism or jerking yourself around. So now I've talked enough, I think, without... I should give you a chance. So any questions at this point or any thoughts, reactions to what I've said? Please. Q. Roberta, comparative thoughts. I have noticed over the last five weeks, if anything, that that has increased to me. And it's made it more difficult to do the meditation than anything because in comparative thinking it's too interior. I just don't want to go there, you know. I just want to be a little freer. And I haven't found that freedom. I've just been finding more and more instead of less. A. Roberta Well, as I said maybe last week, you know, self-knowledge is not always good news. I would encourage you not to get discouraged. One of the things that happens in this process of waking up is we wake up, we notice what our tendencies are, what the habits of mind are, what the common ways of the mind reacting. And sometimes it's not necessarily a pretty picture. But we need to really see it very clearly for us to maybe come to the other side of it. The tendency in vipassana, this mindfulness practice, is we go through things, we don't do spiritual bypasses. So if we notice we have a tendency to be very comparative or very judgmental, then we just want to really be very honest about that and see it very clearly and keep bringing our attention to that, becoming familiar with it, really familiar with that tendency even though it feels so uncomfortable. And that familiarity will tend to lead to increased slowly, acceptance, ease, relaxation around it being there. And then after a while it'll begin to relax itself. A lot of the wisdom that comes from mindfulness practice comes from familiarity. And that's both good news and bad news. Because familiarity means you have to keep seeing it a lot. And the good news is that with time we become free of the things which we're hooked by so quickly. So part of it is to be willing and develop some patience with the parts of practice that are difficult, and self-compensation which is kind of difficult. And it can easily happen to some people that just bringing attention to some part of their inner life tends to activate it. And so it actually gets stronger for a while. It might be fine for you to get stronger for a while, it's part of the process of becoming familiar with it. And so just let it get stronger, don't react to it, don't get afraid of it, or panic because it's there. That's part of the process. I'll just include that in my meditation, thank you. That's one way you can do it. The other way is that if you really feel that you're getting wound up too much and it's just not being helpful at all, you try it for some time, then what you do is you simplify your meditation and only do breath meditation for a while. And what your mind does is none of your business. And just keep trying to stay with your breath, stay with your breath. And then with time, I think the mind will start to relax, hopefully, and the ability to get concentrated on the breath becomes stronger. And the stronger your ability to concentrate on the breath is, the greater your ability to overcome the gravitational force of your normal tendencies. If it persists for quite a while, these kinds of tendencies, I'm talking to everyone here, then there's other things that a meditation teacher might instruct you to do, very careful ways of investigation into the phenomena. And so that's where you might come and talk to me and I might have some very particular advice for you. Yes? In meditation, how many hours a day do people start to think that they're doing it? I have to count it. I suppose in a generic retreat, it's probably around 11 hours, 11, 12 hours a day. When I was in retreat in Asia, I would spend 15, 16 hours a day. I'm wondering, in thinking about often when one meditates, one gets too much of everything that's going on in your mind. And I'm just wondering how one would kind of handle that, as it were, being washed over by these tidal waves all the time, say a month or whatever, or 11 hours a day, whatever it is. I'm just not sure how a human being could withstand that. The mind is quite malleable and the mind can learn new tricks. It can change. It can find release and freedom from some of the things that plague it. So it's quite amazing to me how malleable, how changeable the mind is from its habits. We can spend 40 years with a certain habit and there's a lot of momentum there. And if we just live our normal life, that habit might just continue another 40 years. But that 40 years can be overcome in a couple of weeks. And that ratio of 40 years to two weeks is pretty good deal. What happens is most people, however, don't look at it that way. They just look at that particular day. Oh my God, it's so hard. But it's very rare that someone goes on retreats for a month. It's very common for people going on retreats for the common tendencies of our life to get magnified. It's kind of like what retreat does is put a magnifying glass in our tendencies. So if we have normal tendencies, attitudes towards life, ways of reacting to the world, they might be harmless in normal life or they might be obscure or hidden or not so frequent that they come up. But on retreat, because there's a magnifying effect of it all, it stands out much more strongly. And because it stands out much more strongly, we can begin to come into terms with it, working with it. For example, one of the very painful tendencies for some people is the judgmental mind. And in normal life, it's impossible to go around judging people minute after minute or minute, moment after moment because you have to open the car door, you have to change lanes on the freeway, or you have to answer the telephone. There's all these interruptions all the time. But on retreat, there's no interruptions. And so if you have a strong tendency to be judgmental, the mind gets into it. And so you see that tendency very clearly, and then you can begin seeing, for example, what underlies that tendency. And for some people, perhaps, there is fear that underlies judgment. And if they start seeing the fear that underlies it, they maybe can begin softening or relaxing the fear and finding a level of trust. And you kind of pull the rug from underneath the judgment by finding the underlying level of fear and transforming that into trust. But it's very hard to see that in daily life. But on retreat, you can really kind of see the roots of what actually makes us tick. So I don't know if this is a good answer to you, but the retreats are some of the most amazingly beautiful and wonderful things a human being can do, I think. It's just astounding. So I mean, those of you who have never been on one, there's maybe an out sounding like it's pretty depressing stuff. What happens on retreats is, for most people, is the very best inner person comes out. And even though they're struggling with a lot of things and the waves of all kinds of stuff arise, they're trying to meet that with the very best qualities they have inside of them. And so the person has to become more radiant as the month goes along or the days go along. I gave a talk on retreat, being on retreat, a whole talk on it some weeks ago. When? Do you remember? So I think all our talks, or most of the talks we give here in Palo Alto, are available to listen to on the web. And if you go back and look on the Thursday night talks over the last two or three months, I gave a whole Dharma talk, whole talk one evening about retreats. And it probably is obvious, probably says something like retreat practice or something in the title. And if you want to learn more about it. I'm going off, actually I'm going off tomorrow to teach a month-long retreat. And I'm so happy. Other concerns? Can I follow up with that? So when you're on retreat and that type of thing comes up, I assume that you should turn your attention to it and try to look underneath it or uproot it. But then it seems like it kind of gets complicated and knowing how to do that is not always clear. The idea is that meditation is supposed to be simple. And so we're not actually trying to resolve our issues when we're meditating. Even though many people want to do that, when they're filled with judgment and it's very unpleasant, we often want to get rid of the unpleasant so we want to fix them. What the meditation practice is, is really to bring a careful awareness to what's happening, our non-reactive awareness. And it's very hard for people initially to feel that's worthwhile, it's much more worthwhile to try to fix something. But on retreat or on regular practice, we learn the tremendous power of simply bringing this non-reactive awareness to what's going on. Or we simply learn to let go of our preoccupation with things and come back to the breath. And what you can learn is that there are sometimes ways of getting a new perspective on our life that's different than the normal ways in which we think we have to fix our lives. So rather than kind of going in there and thinking, I'm only going to feel good and whole if I go in there and resolve all my internal conflicts. So let me go in there and do psychoanalysis to myself. What you might find is if you actually let go of all your kind of trying to fix yourself and needs to fix yourself when you be there from who you are, but you simply try to stay with your breath and develop concentration with your breath. The concentration and calm that comes with mindfulness practice can sometimes shift the person's perspective so that the problems the person has is still there. But we feel complete and whole even though they're there. And so most people are so kind of myopic, we're so kind of caught up in our suffering that we think we have to fix our suffering to feel better. And that's kind of being in the world of concepts and convention. But part of what happens in meditation is you learn that you can shift the perspective of how you see your life. You don't have to change anything. You change the perspective of your life. And then you can still be a very judgmental person, but you're much more at ease. Did I tell you the joke about the guy who peed in his pants? There was this executive who whenever he had to go in front of the board of directors for his company, he would get very nervous and he peed in his pants. So the chairman of the board said, you know, we have to do something about this. And so he sent him to a urologist. And then he came back after some weeks and he said, oh, I'm cured. And the chairman of the board said, oh, really, you no longer piss in your pants? And the guy said, oh, no, the urologist wasn't in that day, but the psychologist was. And now it's OK. So, you know, you could take this idea too far. But but the path of meditation, if you if you follow it for a while, you'll see that it kind of operates on very different principles or points of view than the normal way in which we negotiate our lives. And that's part of why it's so powerful. Yes, please. You could give a good check for bringing yourself back to awareness. You're driving in your car, you lost your car and all of a sudden, you know, you want to just come back and be aware you follow your breath. Good question. What I'd like to do is kind of jump, go maybe a little bit different direction than you want initially. Is the moment that you realize your mind is wandered off. That is a moment of mindfulness. And most people overlook the fact that's a moment of mindfulness. It's kind of like that's just kind of that's kind of a free moment. It wasn't there's no effort involved in noticing your mind was lost. So it doesn't seem to count because mindfulness supposed to be effortful. So like a doing right. But actually that moment of simply noticing your mind is wandering away is a moment of mindfulness. And what you can do is appreciate that moment. So what people some people do is they notice the mind's wonders off and they go, oh, shoot, you know, I did it wrong again. Like, let's come back. Where am I? Let's bring that mind back to the body or the breath or whatever. But the moment of noticing that your mind has wandered is a moment of mindfulness. And then appreciate that and then see if you can rather than kind of trying to force yourself to be mindful, promote that natural mindfulness. And that can be in promoting it means kind of like open it up, allow it to kind of become more open to what's happening in the present moment. And when you're driving, it doesn't have to be any particular direction. It can just be more present for driving, which are the other drivers in the road would be happy for. But sometimes for me, I come back to my breathing when I drive. I'm driving and it's, you know, it's relatively uncomplicated driving. I'll just sit there with both hands on my steering wheel and be aware and attentive and, you know, what's going on drive normally. But also kind of be with my breathing and just stay with my breathing. And I find this very, very peaceful and very relaxing because the breath and work and stay with the breath. The breath is like a lubricant for the for my mind and my inner life. So sometimes I do that. Sometimes I do it at the red light. So for me, red light means notice what's happening in my body, bring my attention back to my breath. And so if you go to life, you have a lot of red lights, you can see that as an opportunity. So I don't know. I just wanted to say that what you just said about appreciating the moment when you realized that you kind of lost track was really helpful to me. Because I've heard you say before about practicing in daily life. And I picked something like getting out of my car to walk into work. And it seems like it should be so easy to do. And then I'll be, oh, I forgot. And when I heard you say it that way about appreciating, then when I remembered, I go, oh, good. I remembered that I should have. And then it kept getting closer and closer to the time when I was really, you know, the time of turning off the car. Every time I would be closer to that moment. So it really helped to not get mad and say, oh, darn it. But to say, oh, you know, good. I remembered. And next time. Beautiful. Maybe I'll get there. Great. Beautiful. Thank you. I want to say another thing that helped me just now, what you're saying, that the retreat magnified. I'll have it dawned on me, but I thought I was having lunch at my first retreat. With the recklessness. And I never really appreciated that. That was what I was experiencing. And so now it magnified what you're going through. And that was definitely. There could there can be tendencies we have that are pervasive in our life, but it can be invisible to us. Sometimes restlessness can be that underlying restlessness, which kind of motivates us. Motivates much of what we do, but we don't really see, never really acknowledged or saw the restlessness until we actually sit still and are quiet for a certain amount of time. Another one is fear. I can tell you how many times I've been teaching a retreat. And after four or five days in the retreat, someone's come up to me and said, I had no idea how pervasive fear was in my life. They really saw there was an underlying current of their life. But in normal life, you don't see that. You kind of live on the surface of things much more in daily life rather than deep down and underneath. So let's end with a short sitting. And before we do, I just wanted to say a couple of things. This is the end of the introductory class. I think we have some newsletters out there in the entryway. And there's a list of all the different activities that we do. One of the ways of developing a practice and continuing a practice is to sit and meditate with other people, take advantage of other opportunities of classes and things. Certainly, you can check out that schedule and see if any of that interests you. We have Monday night sittings and talk. We have Thursday. The Thursday ones remain a little bit more practical. If you want practical teachings on meditation, you come Thursday. If you want anything that's mostly connected to Buddhist practice, you come on Monday and Sunday. We have Sunday morning and we have one-day sittings. And there are also other meditation groups in the peninsula, as you can go find. There's a Zen Center in Mountain View. There's one in Redwood City. We have a sitting group in San Jose. It's very helpful to sit with other people. The spirit of our particular community is hopefully relatively informal, where people can come and go as they wish. And you're all most heartily welcome to kind of participate in whatever we have to offer and feel like you're part of our community because you can come and go as freely as you wish. Stephen Browning is here this evening. And Stephen Browning is the senior student who will be available in the library after 8.30. And if you want to ask anything about what our meditation group does and different activities or questions about your meditation practice or questions about what I said today or the meditate, you know, the instructions or whatever, you can come up to me afterwards, but you can also go talk to Stephen in the back in the library. And it also gives you some of you who might be new a chance to meet some other people in the community. So take a comfortable alert posture. Take some really long, slow, deep breaths. So we have emptying, relaxing. And then letting your breath be normal. Place your awareness in the body's experience of breathing. Letting yourself be there with the rhythmic cycle of expanding and contracting, breathing in and breathing out. We'll only have about five minutes for his meditation. So these are the five minutes that you've been allotted to, to be alive, to be conscious. Sit for these five minutes appreciating the aliveness of awareness, the spark of consciousness, which is awake in the midst of whatever is happening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So because I'm going off tomorrow to teach this four-week retreat, I won't be here for the next four Thursdays. However, I've invited a series of very good speakers who will come in, very interesting speakers who will come in and speak. So some of you might like to come back for those Thursdays at seven o'clock. And we meet every Thursday regardless of almost anything. So if you want to continue with the practice, those of you who are new, you're welcome to come back. And otherwise, I wish you all well. And I thank you very much for being part of this course. And I look forward to meditating with you again in the future. Thank you.
