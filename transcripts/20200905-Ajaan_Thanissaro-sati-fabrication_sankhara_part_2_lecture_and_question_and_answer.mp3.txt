Okay, I've started the recording. 
Okay, well, I'll come back everyone. 
Let's start with a brief meditation, what we did last time. 
Start with thoughts of goodwill. 
Begin with goodwill for yourself. 
May I be truly happy. 
Think about what that means. 
You want to understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on them. 
So if true happiness requires that you change your ways, you're happy to change your ways. 
You know what I'm saying? Just may I be happy as I am. 
And then send the same thought to others. 
And it's the same sort of thought. 
You're not saying something may be happy or if someone is behaving in an unskillful way, it means may that person see the error of these are her ways. 
You know, if there's anything you can do to help that person in that direction, I could do it. 
There's no sense of wanting to get some revenge, even suffer first before they change their ways. 
Help you start with people close to your heart and then spread out and widening circles into people you like, people you don't like, people you don't even know. 
And that's just people living in all kinds. 
Maybe we all learn to behave in skillful ways and reap the happiness that comes from our skillful ways. 
And then focus on your breath. 
Take a couple of good long deep and enough breaths. 
Notice where you feel the sensation of breathing in the body. 
And send your attention down near the navel. 
Look at that part of the body, part of the body in your awareness. 
And watch it for a while to see what kind of breathing feels good there. 
You can experiment with longer breathing, shorter breathing, faster, slower, heavier, lighter, deeper or more shallow. 
Now move your attention up to the solar plexus and follow the same steps there. 
Look at that part of the body in your awareness. 
Watch it for a while as you experiment to see what kind of breathing feels good there. 
And if you feel any tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax so that no new tension builds up as you breathe in. 
And you don't hold on to any tension as you breathe out. 
And now bring your attention up to the middle of the chest and follow the same steps there. 
And now up to the middle of the head. 
Here is your breathing. 
Think of the breath energy entering not only through the nose but also through the eyes, the ears and from the back of the head down from the top of the head, going deep into the brain. 
As you breathe out, think of it radiating out from the head in all directions, working through any patterns of tension you may have in your jaws and your forehead around the eyes and dissolving those patterns of tension away. 
Now think of a line connecting from the middle of the head down to the navel. 
As you breathe in and out, think of the breath energy coming into that line, going out of that line, radiating throughout the body. 
Now you're welcome to continue meditating as I give the talk for this afternoon. 
As I said this morning, the Buddha said there are three questions you ask when you're doing insight. 
The first is how to regard fabrications. 
Second is how to investigate fabrications. 
And the third is how to see them with insight. 
This morning we talked about how to regard them in terms of the five aggregates or the three types of fabrication. 
This afternoon we're going to do investigating and seeing with insight. 
Investigating basically means seeing how you actually are doing these fabrications in your meditation, meditating in a way that makes you sensitive to the fact that fabrication is going on, shaping your experience, and at the same time getting a sense of the relative value of different ways of fabricating your experience. 
Now the Buddha taught that if you're going to develop insight, you have to develop insight together with tranquility. 
Either the insight comes first, tranquility comes second, vice versa, or ideally they happen together. 
And his instructions for how to develop both insight and tranquility at the same time are his 16 steps for breath meditation. 
The insight will overcome ignorance, the tranquility will overcome passion. 
And working together this way you get to understand fabrication much more clearly. 
So take an example of the Buddha's instructions on breath meditation. 
There are 16 steps all together. 
I think fall into four tetrans. 
The first tetrad deals with the body, the breath particularly. 
The second tetrad deals with feelings. 
The third deals with the mind. 
And the fourth deals with dhammas. 
These are basically the four foundations of mindfulness. 
So the four establishings of mindfulness. 
The first tetrad, the Buddha, talks about one being, excuse me, discerning, long breathing, discerning, short breathing, being where the whole body should breathe in and breathe out. 
And then finally calming bodily fabrication. 
Now it turns out bodily fabrication, as we mentioned this morning, is one of the three types of fabrication. 
That's the breath, the inner and out breath. 
The question often comes up, why does the Buddha have to use this technical term in his meditation instructions? And the reason apparently is that he wants to get you sensitive to the role of fabrication as it relates to the breath and as it relates to the body. 
So you see the fact that there's an intentional element in your breathing. 
You can let the breath go on automatic pilot, but you can also have some conscious control over the breathing. 
And ideally, you want to see that you can calm the effect that the breath has on the body. 
In fact, it can get so calm that the inner and out breathing stops when you reach the fourth jhana. 
And you realize that that stage of concentration where the breath is extremely subtle, is sort of subtle breath energy permeating the body. 
So suddenly you don't feel a need to breathe in and breathe out. 
There's a much more stable level of concentration and a much more peaceful state of mind than if your bodily fabrication, i. 
e. 
the inner and out breath, is more active. 
Now in the second tetradon, which deals with feelings, he has you breathe in and out sensitive to rapture or sense of fullness in the body. 
You try to find a spot in the body, which is especially sensitive to the how the breath energy feels and allow it to feel precisely the kind of breath energy it would like to feel. 
In other words, you might say you pander to that spot in the body and you get a sense of fullness right there. 
You can allow that sense of fullness to expand. 
And here again, you begin to see that your perception of the breath will have an effect. 
So the next step, which is to be sensitive, breathe in and out sensitive to pleasure, you find the areas of pleasure in the body and you expand on them. 
You try to breathe in a way that maintains them and it allows them to spread through the body and then maintain that sense of pleasure of feeling the body. 
And then the Buddha says you try to become sensitive to mental fabrication, which remember our feelings and perceptions. 
And you see how the role of your perception plays a role in developing those feelings, the pleasure feelings of rapture. 
And the effect that it has on the mind, when the mind is bathed in pleasure like that, its tendency to want to go out and find other things at that moment gets a lot weaker. 
It's a lot easier to stay concentrated. 
And then finally you try to calm, pardon me, mental fabrication, you try to find perceptions that are calming, feelings that are calming. 
And this can take you to extremely high levels of even the formless Janas. 
So here in the first eight steps, the Buddha is already talking about bodily fabrication, mental fabrication. 
And the instructions themselves are forms of verbal fabrication. 
You tell yourself, I will breathe in and out doing acts. 
So breathe in and out sensitive to pleasure, sensitive to rapture, sensitive to the whole body. 
So you've got all three kinds of fabrication present there in those first eight steps. 
And again, the Buddha uses these technical terms, I think, to get you sensitive to the role that fabrication is playing in the shaping of your experience with something as simple as a breath. 
And then you begin to realize that these same fabrications will have an influence on the way you shape your experience outside of the meditation as well. 
Sometimes the question comes up, especially from people who like to focus straight on the mind as their meditation object. 
They say, why focus on the breath? When you die, the breath is going to stop. 
What are you going to do then? And the answer, of course, is, well, you haven't been focusing only on the breath. 
You've been focusing on this process of fabrication as you focus on the breath. 
And that gives you insight into how the mind will be shaping things, not only when you're sitting around with normally living, but as death approaches, these processes of fabrication are going to be very important for you to be able to see and master. 
So you go through the experience skillfully. 
So in the first case, you would use bodily fabrication to get your mind past sensual thinking. 
You get a greater sense of the pleasure that comes that's not sensual, the pleasure that comes from inhabiting your sense of the body. 
And you begin to realize, okay, this pleasure of form is superior to the sensual pleasures, the pleasures that come from thinking about sensual pleasures. 
And you begin to see the value, relative value of different kinds of fabrication. 
This also applies in the third tetrahedron, which deals with the mind. 
The word it says you breathe in and out sensitive to the state of your mind, then you breathe in and out trying to to gladden the mind if the mind has been depressed or if its energy level is low. 
You breathe in and out trying to steady the mind if the mind has been scattered. 
And you breathe in and out trying to release the mind if the mind has been burdened with anything. 
And here again, you use the different types of fabrication, different ways of breathing, different ways of perceiving things that allow the mind to settle down, to get more solidly established, to get glad. 
If working with the breath doesn't gladden the mind, you can use other topics of meditation and do gladden the mind. 
Think about the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. 
You can think about your own generosity. 
You can think about your own virtue. 
Times when you were tempted to do something you knew wasn't right and where you're able to say no. 
And you think about your own wealth worth as a person that comes from that. 
But again, you're going to be engaging in perceptions and feelings as you do these things. 
You'll be also engaging in direct of thought and evaluation as you direct your thought to a particular topic and evaluate it in a way that gives rise to a sense of steadiness or a sense of gladness in the mind. 
So here again, you see the role of fabrication in real time. 
And so you like that affirms the fact of fabrication that you really are shaping your experience more than you had seen before. 
And then at the same time, you see the value of different kinds of fabrication, that the more subtle the fabrication, the better it is. 
So these are the steps in investigating fabrications. 
So that you actually see what the Buddha said about how you are fabricating your experience really is true. 
You can see it in real time and you see the relative value. 
The next step, seeing fabrications with insight, focuses on that last point in the third tetrad was releasing the mind. 
Because here you're going to be trying to get the mind free from anything that's burdening it. 
In the fourth tetrad, the Buddha talks about four steps. 
You focus on inconsency, you focus on dispassion, you focus on cessation, and you focus on relinquishment as you breathe in and breathe out. 
The focusing on inconsency relates to another teaching that the Buddha has. 
Basically, there are five steps for getting past anything that's burdening the mind, anything that the mind is clinging to that it should not be clinging to. 
The five steps are these. 
The first two steps, you look for the origination of that particular state of mind. 
The second one is you look for its cessation. 
The third is you look for its allure. 
What is attractive about greed? What is attractive about anger? And then the fourth is you look at the drawbacks. 
If you go with that particular state of mind, what are the bad effects going to be? And then finally, when you see that the drawbacks way outweigh the allure, that's when you develop dispassion and that's the fifth step, which is escape. 
That's when you release the mind from that particular type of defilement, whatever it is. 
For example, when anger comes, you want to be able to see what is it, how does it originate? This is not simply seeing it arise, but you want to see what's the cause, what sparks it. 
Why do you take delight in it? At what moment is there, the mind says, yes, I'd like to go with the anger. 
Oftentimes we're saying, I don't like my anger. 
It's driving me crazy that I get angry so easily. 
Yet still there's part of the mind that likes it. 
And you want to see that moment when the mind goes for it. 
Then the second step is seeing, okay, when anger comes, it's not monolithic, anger comes and you may be thinking thoughts of anger off and on for a couple hours, but they're not always there for those couple of hours. 
They come, then they go, and then you have to dig them up again. 
The same happens with lust, the same happens with greed, the same happens with envy, any of these unskillful emotions. 
They come, yet you dig them up again. 
And when you dig them up again, then you have to ask yourself, well, why do I want them back? What's the allure? What do I find attractive there? This is part of the meditation that's going to require a lot of honesty on your part, because many times allure is something you're embarrassed about. 
So you cover it up with many layers of other thoughts, many layers of ignorance. 
We're mentioning this morning that when you're meditating, sometimes there's a decision made to leave the meditation object, and then you pretend that you didn't make that decision. 
And then as soon as there's a gap in your mindfulness, then you do go for whatever the distracting thought is. 
And so here again, you'll find that the allure is something you've buried under layers of denial. 
And so what you have to do is you go, you dig up whatever you can see, as what attracted you to that particular thought of anger. 
And then you think about the drawbacks. 
And then if you're able to let go, you say, okay, I was able to let go that time. 
Let's see if I can permanently let go. 
Well, often what happens is it comes back again, and you go for it again. 
You say, well, in that case, it means I didn't really understand your law. 
I've got to go back and look again. 
But it's this process of going through these five steps that you really can get past things that have been dominating the mind that have been placing a burden on the mind and limiting the mind through its unskillful activity. 
Now, to go back these steps a little bit more detail, in both cases of steps one and two, the points to notice are, as I said, the Buddha here is talking about origination. 
He's not talking simply about arising. 
He's talking about the cause. 
And as the Buddha said, the cause is that you delight in something. 
And then from delight, there comes clinging. 
And once there's clinging, there's going to be a state of becoming that arises on that. 
You build up an identity based on that particular emotion. 
It's become your emotion. 
You are angry. 
You are greedy. 
And then you run with it. 
And then if you looked at the article, and you notice, I made the point that when the Buddha is talking about how this origination happens, it starts out in personal terms as a you delight. 
There's an identity there. 
There's a person there that's delighting. 
And then from there, he says, you try to look at it and see it more in more impersonal terms. 
Remember, we talked earlier today about how the Buddha said, when you want to let go of something that would lead to a state of becoming, you have to get back to its raw material. 
And this doesn't apply only to the end of the path, but all the way along the path. 
You want to be able to look at this particular state of in impersonal terms, seeing where there's delight, then it's clinging. 
The question of who is clinging, who is delighting, put that aside. 
At that point, you want to get yourself out of the picture. 
Now, this is not denying. 
It's not saying that there is no self there. 
Because that's, again, that would be not focusing directly on what's actually happening. 
The Buddha wants you to look directly at these events as they're happening before they become a state of becoming. 
This is why I had that long section in the article, basically arguing with the two-truth theory, the idea of being saying that on the ultimate level, there's nobody there. 
The Buddha never taught that. 
For cases in the canon where he actually denounces the idea that there is no, like, say, if one person kills another, denying that there really was a killer or somebody killed, because that's wrong view. 
Instead of taking a stand on whether or not there is a self or whether or not there is a being there, he simply wants you to look at the events that are happening in the mind simply as events without any question of who's there doing this? Or is there nobody here doing this? What is happening? He wants you to look directly at these events. 
And seeing them as events, you begin to detach yourself to some extent from them. 
Because that puts you in a position where you're better equipped to look at the allure and look at the drawbacks in fair terms, in objective terms. 
So those first steps, the steps of the origination and seeing the passing away, those are establishing the fact of fabrication that these states of mind are fabricated. 
There's an element of your intention in there. 
Years back, I was reading a piece by someone who was at a retreat center, and she was talking about how she developed a very strong sense of lust for the young man sitting in front of her. 
And it got so strong that she couldn't even be in the same hall with him. 
She had to go back to her room and meditate. 
And she said the insight that came to her as she was meditating in a room was that this was not her own personal lust. 
This was the cosmic lust flowing through her. 
This is precisely what the Buddha says is not the case. 
You are giving rise to the state. 
It is originating within you. 
And when it falls away, it falls away because of a lack of delight that you suddenly decide you don't want to go with this anymore. 
So there's the delight there. 
The Buddha says that you delight in it. 
But then from the delight, he says try to look at it in personal terms. 
Not to say that that's a cosmic phenomenon that's going through you, but simply you set this chain of events into motion. 
Can you pull yourself out and just look at the chain of events and see how you don't want to get involved? Which is precisely what the next three steps in that process are involved in. 
First you see the allure. 
And then you look at the drawbacks. 
And this is where focusing on inconsistency comes in. 
All three of the what the Buddha called the three perceptions come to play here. 
The perception of inconsistency sometimes called the perception of impermanence, the perception of stress or suffering, and the perception of not self. 
Now some places these are called three characteristics. 
The Buddha himself never mentioned them as three characteristics. 
He describes them simply as perceptions and also as a kind of contemplation. 
You can contemplate inconsistency. 
You can contemplate stress. 
You can contemplate not self. 
In other words, you're trying to see what aspect of this causal process that you've said into motion. 
Where are the drawbacks? You see that it's inconstant. 
So because it's inconstant, you can't get any solid benefit out of it. 
And if it's inconstant and stressful, why bother? And the Buddha says if it's both constant, inconstant and stressful, is it worth taking on? Is it worth identifying as you or yours? Here again, he's not asking you to come to a conclusion as to whether or not there is a self. 
He says simply that, look, this is the process of fabrication. 
You're engaging in this activity, creating this state. 
Is it worth it? Think of all the energy you've put into this greed, all this energy you're putting into the anger, the energy you're putting into lust. 
What do you get as a result? And when you can see that it's not worth it, that's when you develop dispassion for it, and that's the escape. 
Because all fabrications are driven by passion. 
In other words, you do them for the sake of something. 
When you see that it's not accomplishing the end that you wanted them for, then you stop doing the fabrication. 
The fabrication cease. 
And then you relinquish the whole issue. 
In other words, you don't carry around, say, boy, that was really smart of me. 
I was able to overcome that anger really well. 
Of course, what happens then, of course, pride develops. 
He says, okay, that was taken care of. 
And that's a good attitude to be able to develop as you meditate because you're going to need precisely that attitude as the insights get more subtle and then go deeper in the meditation. 
Because after you've applied these perceptions, after you've applied this five-step program to things that are obviously unskillful, then the Buddha says, you turn around and you apply it to the practice of concentration and inside itself. 
For example, in the case of concentration, the imagery, we talked about this morning about the archer shooting the straw man or the clay target. 
The Buddha describes it saying, getting the mind into state of concentration, get really, get really good at it. 
If you try this kind of analysis when the concentration is not yet solid, it'll just fall apart. 
So wait until you get really good at it. 
And then you start looking at it and say, realize, we had this constant state of concentration, I'm engaged in right now. 
It too is composed of aggregates. 
As I said earlier, that there's the form of the body with just the breath. 
There's the feeling of pleasure. 
There's the perception that holds you with the pleasure. 
There are the fabrications that you think about and you talk to yourself, direct the thought and evaluation around the object. 
You find the consciousness, which is aware of all these things. 
So you see the concentration is composed of these aggregates. 
And then you apply the perceptions of not self, stress to those aggregates. 
And then you engage in an active judgment that you would like to turn away from them. 
This is actually a verbal fabrication that says, wouldn't it be better to go for the doubtless? This would be exquisite. 
This would be peaceful. 
In order to be able to get beyond this fabricated state. 
Now, if you can do this skillfully enough, the Buddha says, everything stops. 
You develop this passion for the process of fabrication, the concentration stops. 
And two things can happen. 
Either you can gain full awakening, or when you gain a perception that there is a deathless element there that is there when you stop the fabrication, you develop a passion for that. 
Then the awakening will not be complete. 
This is why you have to turn the perception of not self onto the discernment of the deathlessness itself. 
This is why when the Buddha says, all fabrications are inconstant, all fabrications are stressful, but all phenomena are not self. 
In other words, if you create a sense of self around the deathless, your awakening is not going to be complete. 
So you have to take that apart as well. 
This is where we get back into that image of the mirror. 
You're turning around and looking at yourself and saying, oh, this is something I'm doing. 
I'm adding this unnecessary level of clinging even to this experience. 
The Canon has many instances where the Buddha talks about once there has been an insight that you have to turn around and look at the insight itself since you can let the insight do its work and then let go of the insight. 
This is what that fourth step is in that fourth etc. 
The relinquishment when you dropped everything after having solved the problem. 
As a passage in Angutthara 4. 
194, when the Buddha says, you release the mind from the factors of a conducive to passion and also those that are conducive to release. 
Even things that would give rise to release, you have to let go. 
In Sangyuta 48. 
3 and 4, he actually talks about applying that five step program to the five faculties, which the five faculties are another way of talking about the past. 
There's the faculty of conviction, the faculty of persistence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of discernment. 
And these things are all skillful. 
You need them on the path. 
You need conviction in the Buddha's awakening. 
In other words, that you really did awaken to the principle that our actions are shaping our experience. 
That gives you the motivation for developing persistence and developing skillful qualities. 
That becomes the basis for developing mindfulness, concentration, and discernment. 
But eventually you have to see these things too have their origination, they have their passing away. 
They have their lure and they also have their drawbacks. 
Their lure, of course, is the pleasure that comes from developing them. 
The drawbacks is that they too are fabricated. 
If you want to get to an un-fabricated happiness, you have to let those go as well. 
In Anangutana 10. 
93, Anandabindika is dealing with a group of wanderers of other sects. 
They asked him, you know, what is this Buddha teach? What are his views? Anandabindika, who was a stream-wanderer at that point, says, you know, I really don't know what the entirety of the Buddha's views. 
He says, well, you don't know his views. 
What about the other monks? I don't know the entirety of their views either. 
Well, what about your own views? He says, well, I'll tell you my view after you've told me yours. 
As each of them talks about how their view is either that the world is finite or infinite, eternal, non-eternal. 
The soul is the same thing as the body. 
The body is something different from the soul, that kind of view. 
And he says, in each case, those views are fabricated, and as long as you hold to that view, then you're holding onto stress. 
They say, okay, what about you? What is your view? And his view is basically whatever is fabricated, a stress or whatever stress was not me, not myself, not what I am. 
And they say, oh, well, you're holding onto that fabricated view as well. 
You're holding onto stress. 
He says, no, you hold onto this. 
It'll get you to the point where it forces you to let go of it too. 
In other words, it's a view where you're looking at the extent to which you're fabricating your experience. 
Of course, you look at other unskillful ways that you're fabricating. 
And then when you've taken care of those, then you turn on, you look at this skillful fabrication. 
You say, this too is something I have to let go. 
So this is how we see fabrications with insight. 
As we see their origination, we see their passing away. 
We see their lure, we see their drawbacks, and then we see the escape from them. 
This applies not only to fabrications, unskillful sorts, but eventually, once the path has done its work, you have to apply the same analysis to the path too. 
So here we see the Buddhist teaching strategy. 
He uses both personal and impersonal language. 
Because basically, if he's going to convince you that you want to take on his impersonal analysis of fabrications, you have to see that it's to your advantage. 
And if as long as you're thinking in terms of my world, myself, my energy, my participation in shaping my experience the way I want to, you have to see that this is going to be something valuable to take on. 
So he will talk in personal terms. 
But then from those personal terms, he's trying to look at the processes of fabrication in simply as fabrications and not with the question of who's doing them, seeing them simply as processes in which there is an element of intention. 
It's not something that's going on totally beyond your control. 
That's not the type of causality the Buddha is talking about. 
You are making choices. 
Once the choices have been put into action, though, then you set into motion a whole series of causal factors, you know, not to be imprisoned by those causal factors. 
You have to learn how to see them in personal terms. 
So you're looking at fabrications in such a way that avoids issues of becoming and not becoming. 
You don't get involved in the question of who's there, who's not there, who is your real self, and who are you? Or do you not exist? The Buddha says those kinds of questions are a writhing of views and wilderness of views, contortion of views and then a feather of views. 
So use fabrications. 
Use those fabrications. 
You view the fabrications, then you use the fabrications of the path using concentration and insight to allow fabrications and states to become a disease. 
And then finally you abandon even the fabrications you've been using. 
That's the final step across the flood. 
This is the meaning of that statement by John Fuhring at the beginning of the essay. 
I told the story of the student from Singapore who wrote saying that he was trying to see everything in his life in terms of the three characteristics he'd be engaged in his work, watching TV, whatever it was always in terms of the three characteristics. 
And the Buddha said, excuse me, John Fuhring said, write back to him and says, the problem is not out there and things out there. 
It's not the things on the TV that are the problem. 
It's the mind that's labelling things out there as in constant stressful in our self. 
That's where the real problem is. 
So we focus on fabrications, not just as the fabrications go out, but also look at the mind as it's engaged both in unskillful fabrications and in skillful fabrications. 
They hold on to the skillful fabrications first. 
Don't be so quick to let go of them. 
This is why I said earlier that if you have a desire to practice, be very clear about that desire. 
Don't be ashamed of it. 
But there will come a point where you have to let that go. 
The question is gaining a skillful sense of when to let it go. 
This is one of the main skills of the practice. 
If you think of the image of crossing the flood, if you let go of the path too soon, you fall into the river and you get swept away. 
This happens all too often. 
People say, look at me. 
I'm not holding onto anything. 
It's like getting up on the raft and dancing around and saying, see how free I am. 
And then you fall. 
The other problem is when you get over to the shore and you refuse to let go of the raft. 
You just stay there hovering near the shore, but you never quite get over there. 
In other words, we're not here to arrive at right view. 
We're here to use right view and right view. 
If it's really right, it's going to get us to the point where we have to let it go. 
Now, at the end of the essay, I talked about that image that the Buddha gives us, the pair of swift messengers that come into the fortress, into the citadel, and they deliver their message. 
And they deliver the message that their message is nirvana. 
That's important to remember. 
Their message is not the three perceptions. 
It's not Jhana. 
And also notice they don't stay. 
They deliver the message and they go. 
But they're walking back because you're going to be able to use them. 
As I said, when someone has gained awakening, they still use concentration. 
They still use the practice of mindfulness, but without being joined to it. 
But they use it as a pleasant of abiding and use it for the sake of mindfulness and alertness. 
And they can also use whatever skills they've developed in order to teach others. 
You look at the Buddha. 
I mean, he gained awakening and he didn't drop his insight in such a way that he couldn't pick it up again. 
But he picked it up in a different way. 
There's no longer for the sake of his own happiness. 
He picked it up for the sake of helping other people find a way. 
So remember, when you look at the teachings, we have to remember their original purpose. 
They are there for gaining total freedom. 
They remember the image of the mirror. 
When you see that there are problems outside and there's an issue outside. 
I mean, this applies in all aspects of the practice. 
If they're suffering, you know, what's the problem out there? The problem is, where is the craving? Where is the clinging in my own mind? Now, this is not to say that things outside are not bad. 
Often they can be very bad. 
But what the Buddha is teaching us is that no matter how bad things are outside, we don't have to suffer from it. 
The suffering is optional. 
So in saying that we look inside for the sources of suffering, it's not that he's blaming us for the suffering. 
He's simply saying that here is your opportunity. 
Even though you thrive as you may, you would like to make the world a better place. 
So a lot of things are resistant to making, being made better. 
But that doesn't mean that you have to suffer along with them. 
You are free not to suffer. 
And so when the insights arise, they can help, they can do their work, help you not to suffer. 
And then let the insights go. 
Remember that the messenger is to deliver the message and then they leave. 
That's that final step of relinquishment in the 16 steps of breath meditation. 
The work has been done. 
You can let things go. 
Now, the mind will be engaged in fabrication from that point, but as the Buddha said, it's engaged in a different way for the sense of being disjoined from it. 
There's an image that's given in a sort of printable nun because teaching a group of nuns. 
The image is not pretty, but it's a very memorable one. 
He says, you have a dead cow and you use a knife and you very carefully remove the skin from the cow. 
And then you put the skin back on. 
And the question is, is the skin still attached the way it was before? Well, there is contact between the body and the skin, but there's no attachment because all the connective tissue has been cut. 
So from that point on, you're engaging in fabrication, but you don't have to suffer from fabrication. 
So how that's possible, you have to ask somebody who's totally awakened. 
But remember, the take home for all of this is that the Buddha's teaching is that you should be used strategically. 
And we use fabrication, and fabrication is done for the sake of something, which means there's a desire behind it. 
There's even craving to do the path that's perfectly okay in the steps where that's required. 
It's only when you get to the point where you don't need that particular form of craving, that's when you can let it go. 
Remember, we are creating a path here. 
And so try to do it well. 
When it's really done well, then you can let it go. 
Try to let it go at the right time, not too early, not too late. 
That requires a lot of sensitivity, but that's what we're trying to develop as we practice because an important part of discernment is that you're not trying to just pair it to Buddha's insights, but you're trying to develop sensitivity to that. 
You're trying to develop sensitivity to the way in which you are shaping your own experience right now. 
And now you can do it in a more skillful way. 
As you get more sensitive to your lack of skill in fabrication, you develop new skills in fabrication. 
That's how discernment develops. 
So that sensitivity is the main thing that you have to work on. 
So that's the end of the talk for today. 
Now we have time for questions. 
Power on. 
Line in. 
Do we have any hands? Yeah. 
You can use your physical hand or your hand. 
Jack. 
Yes, Jack. 
Yes. 
Hello. 
Glad to hear this teaching thing. 
Very, very, very practical. 
So you said, maybe I didn't quite catch what you said. 
I thought you said that in terms of how to let go of that final thing, you have to ask somebody who's awakened. 
Did I get that? Right? No, no. 
The answer, the question was to understand how they do that. 
Right. 
You'd have to ask somebody who's fully awakened. 
I'm not there yet. 
Where are we going to find somebody totally awakened? Okay. 
Well, you try to awaken yourself. 
Well, that's a long shot at this point. 
I don't know. 
I know some people did a little more mellow than I at times, but. 
. 
. 
Hey, mellowness is not awakening. 
Okay. 
We'll come knock on your door then. 
Okay. 
One other quick question. 
You mentioned this morning that if there's an entity around who has died and that they're hanging around, that that's not a good state of affairs for them. 
Right. 
I co-facilitate a grief support group at hospice. 
And some of the people who have lost a close, like a life partner that was their soulmate or whatever they call it. 
It takes great comfort in knowing or thinking that her deceased husband is still there. 
And that's some pretty strong evidence, like she holds as evidence, like the houses in the neighborhood burning up north of San Francisco. 
All of them except hers. 
The fire came within 10 feet of her house. 
So she said, oh, he must have been watching it. 
So how do you, or is there a way to help somebody to move on to a higher plane or whatever it is that they're supposed to do? Okay. 
Well, just sit and meditate and basically engage that, imagine that you're engaging that spirit with it in the conversation. 
And say, okay, what is it that you're still holding on to? And then point out, you know, the drawbacks. 
There's a much better life than just sort of hanging around here. 
I had a very strange experience years back in Thailand. 
There was a family, you know, the grandmother passed away. 
And she had buried some money under a tree behind the house. 
And they had started having dreams in the family that she was telling them to, you know, to come up and dig up the money under the tree. 
She couldn't go until they had dug up the money because she was afraid they wouldn't know where it was. 
And so sure enough, they dug under the tree and found this metal box filled with money. 
And then she started coming back into the dreams again. 
She said, okay, I want to go on. 
But one more thing is I want someone to come and chant the Mahasamaya Sutta. 
This is an extremely long sutta. 
Very few people know it. 
And they said, well, we're going to find somebody who's going to do that. 
And they said, well, there's this woman in town named Ratchini, who was a student of Ajahn Phuong. 
She knows somebody. 
She knows this Western monk who knows how to chant the sutta. 
And so they got in touch with Ratchini. 
Ratchini came out to see me. 
And sure enough, I knew, you know, I knew the sutta. 
And so I went and chanted her the spear behind the tree. 
And then a few days later, she came into their dreams and said, thank you, I can go on now. 
You never know. 
She would probably say, oh, I love you so much. 
I've had such a perfect relationship. 
I want to be with you or whatever. 
And I don't know if he's waiting for her to come or whatever. 
I don't know if she's pretty healthy. 
So I don't think she's going anywhere. 
Yeah. 
Well, some people won't let go, you know, maybe with her encouragement. 
I don't know quite how to say that because most of the people in the group aren't so who is to believe such a thing that she does. 
Yeah. 
Oh, come on. 
That's how they would see it. 
I know. 
Anyway, we're good. 
Thank you very much. 
Get her at a private moment. 
Yeah. 
Well, it's zooming. 
So. 
All right. 
Good. 
Thank you very much. 
Sure. 
Okay. 
Hello, John. 
I have a question about the 16 steps of the breath meditation. 
There was a part about fabricating rapture and like your instruction was to find rapture, find pleasure inside the body in a spot and then let it spread. 
But is it, can it also be done like through thinking and like, like a perception because sometimes it doesn't work. 
Sometimes in the body, there is nothing. 
Everything seems calm. 
The breath seems calm, but this point doesn't come. 
So what should I do then? Should I try and look or should I try think happy pleasure, something like that or. 
Okay. 
Well, some people find that just listening to the Dharma gives rise to a sense of rapture. 
And so you can try that. 
Or if there's a Dharma theme that you think about that you find really inspiring, you can think about that. 
What I meant was about having a spot is if there is a part in the body that's very, very sensitive that is easily paint when you breathe in, when you breathe in as a part of the body that feels pain, you try to nurture that part of the body and be very careful around it to breathe in a way that feels good coming in feels good going out. 
You might try that. 
No, in my case, I've got a heart problem right now, but there's a spot in my heart which is very sensitive to any extra pressure. 
So I treat that very carefully. 
And then there's a sense of fullness that comes there when I'm very careful about it. 
And then I can think of that's fullness spreading. 
But you can also give rise to a sense of rapture as you say, mentally by thinking about something you find inspiring that gives a sense of joy. 
And then notice and then allow that sense of joy to go through the body. 
Okay, so for me, the big question here is, am I at the point when I can say no to all the thoughts or should I keep investigating? It's same with the rapture pleasure thing or anything in my concentration. 
So I don't know, like, how do you know where where are you? You test it. 
You're willing to experiment. 
And see what works. 
If you realize, I let go too quickly, then you go back to get up again. 
But if you can associate a particular thought that you find inspiring with a particular sense of feeling in the body that feels full and satisfied, can then switch over to the feeling and try to nurture that by the way you breathe. 
Another way you can do this is think of your hands and think of relaxing every little tiny muscle in both hands. 
So that when you breathe in, there's no tension building up in your hands. 
And when you breathe out, you don't feel like you're squeezing the breath energy out of the hands. 
So and then after all that sense of fullness will develop in the hands is like all the all the capillaries are full of blood. 
And then there's a sense of fullness that will be associated with that. 
And then you can think of that spreading up the arms without a try. 
Thank you. 
I see Matthew has a question. 
Yes, can you hear me? Yes, go. 
Okay. 
Greetings on John. 
Hi. 
My question is about the genres. 
I know, as you were explaining the breath meditation. 
And you described the four parts for the body you had mentioned, reaching the fourth John at one point, and it came into my mind as you were sharing that isn't it the case as we're going through the 16 parts that we have to. 
So in a genre, like a higher genre to or above, do we have to actually fall back to the first genre if we're going to the next part, meditation. 
So that's the first part of my question. 
And then the second part is how important is our awareness of the genres and how does that relate to developing insight. 
Okay, in terms of the first one, you have to remember that you don't follow the 16 steps one through 16. 
Basically, you've got four tracks. 
One track has to do with what's happening in the body as you're meditating. 
The other track has to do with the feelings, mind and Dhammas. 
And you can focus on any one of those tracks, like focusing on with the body. 
Okay, you get to being aware of the whole body breathing in the whole body breathing out. 
Well, there's going to be a feeling of pleasure. 
There's going to be a feeling of rapture. 
So that gets brought in at that time. 
But you don't abandon that third step of being aware of the whole body. 
And then as you calm bodily fabrication, there will be a more subtle feeling of pleasure, which will actually become a mental fabrication. 
That's more subtly your common mental fabrication at the same time. 
That's your common bodily fabrication. 
So you don't have to retreat to an earlier, John, in order to pull in some of these other aspects. 
But then how is it possible to actually recall, okay, this is the next step in the body? Just one second. 
Just one second. 
The next step is this. 
But isn't that actually initial application? Aren't we going back down to initial application? It's pulling us just a little bit and then going back in. 
Okay, so it's like kind of pull out a little to first John and then you go back. 
And sometimes, however, once you get used to this, you don't even have to think about it. 
You will just go in that direction. 
And as for your second question about the John is, they really do give you insight into the process of fabrication. 
One thing I neglected to mention in the talk this morning is when the Buddha talks about the three types of fabrication in relation to the John is, he points out that when you leave the first John to go into the second John, verbal fabrication falls away. 
When you leave the third John to go into the fourth John bodily fabrication falls away. 
And as you leave and go from the fourth Johnny into the various formal states, you drop perceptions of the body. 
So you're beginning to sort of, it's like John Lee has a great example. 
He says it's like trying to get different types of metal out of a piece of pieces of rock. 
Put the rock in a smelter and when it hits a certain temperature at the tin flows out. 
When it's a higher temperature than other metals for copper flows out a higher temperature, the silver flows out. 
And as you focus on this, you begin to see these types of fabrication separating out. 
You think back on the story of the Buddha gaining awakening. 
Remember when he first went to those two teachers, he learned really high levels of formless John is. 
But apparently he didn't go through the first four John is on his way there. 
There are ways that you can get to the formless states by bypassing the four John is apparently that's what happened. 
Because he went back and so now I've got to go through those first four John is. 
And it's in those that you see the process of fabrication. 
As they separate out as you go from one to another. 
So this is very useful as that after all. 
Inside is all about seeing the process of fabrication clearly. 
Okay, so the noticing the John is helps with insight because then we're actually seeing, you know, we're seeing those fabrications more clearly. 
What is the category when are they arising and and well it sounds like what you shared it's more about. 
In that example, what you can see them passing away as you go higher in the John is right. 
So how does that actually relate to to to the wisdom to getting the wisdom or insight into the four noble truths. 
You see the more about you just you just realized the arising and passing away phenomenon through repeated experience. 
It's not just arising and passing away you see you see what what was I doing that gave right that I was engaged in these types of fabrication and how to how was I able to stop. 
Because you remember insight the four noble truths is not just arising and passing away it's origination. 
You see what was I doing that was causing that. 
That's where again the insight. 
Because when you hit when your first hit those these levels of concentration is like nothing is happening the line is just so still and so calm. 
But then you begin to realize oh there's still a level of fabrication and I'm still doing it. 
That's the other reason why they're doing concentration like this is good because it makes you more sensitive to these processes otherwise you would have missed. 
One last quick follow up so sometimes in meditation I can see, like the lights and colors come the calmness comes. 
It appears to be I don't know my my label would be maybe that's second John. 
But in any case my question is when that happens sometimes I'm not aware. 
What was I just focusing on that actually brought about that experience of this what maybe the second John. 
What do we do when when we're we come into some state of concentrate but we don't know how we got there we don't know what was actually the brought that about remind yourself be more careful to look next time. 
Be more mindful. 
Try to be very clear about what you're going to be alert to what you're doing it while you're doing it. 
Thank you. 
Rita. 
Jeff and Rita. 
Hello, thank you. 
I kind of john first. 
Thank you for teaching today. 
I appreciate the day. 
My question is whether or not you could explain the difference between this passion and equanimity in my mind it seems like they're pretty much the same but there probably are some subtleties that maybe you could share a little bit about. 
Thank you. 
Okay equanimity is basically keeping the mind on an even keel. 
Regardless of what comes up. 
Whereas with this passion. 
It's more state that you, you've been passionate about something. 
And finally said gee I've had enough of that. 
He was like the cow this is made with this is grass we've been eating grass. 
That's not that's not equanimity. 
You see you've been engaging in an activity, and you were perfectly fine doing it and all of a sudden you realize oh my gosh this is this is totally useless. 
So the, the equanimous state would be, oh this is grass this is fine. 
This is fine yeah. 
And then the discussion to be like this is grass. 
This is grass. 
But actually they actually have a similar image in the Canon of a blind man who's been given a dirty piece of cloth. 
A nice white clean piece of cloth take really good care of it. 
He's very proud he wears his, he wears this dirty cloth around thinking that it's a nice white piece of cloth. 
And then finally his relatives take him to see a doctor the doctor. 
Nables him to get his vision back. 
He looks at this oh my gosh I've been wearing this piece of cloth I thought it was clean. 
That's dispassion. 
Jerry. 
Yes, thank you. 
Thank you. 
I'm not sure how well I followed some of this, if not all of it, but let's make sure I get, because I don't know if I added my own thing or not that for fabrication, would it be wrong to think of it as just concept not just but as conceptualization or the storytelling that you know the stories that we tell ourselves or we tell others about. 
Is that part of it is how we put the sort of conceptual storyline around our experiences that sort of causing suffering and because it boxes us in. 
Is that what you mean by fabrication. 
That's one of the types of fabrication that would be verbal fabrication. 
If we talk about direct thought and evaluation as being verbal fabrication that's what a storytelling is. 
But it's basically any intentional putting of things together. 
And this can be even just the way you work on your breath. 
So there's no story, there's no storyline about the breath you know I breathed in and then I breathed out then I breathe it in again breathe out again. 
There's not much story there. 
But that too is a kind of fabrication. 
So conceptualization is that off the point. 
It's the intentional element is the important part. 
So, well then I actually am I am confused but confusion will be okay then. 
Okay, I got two quick things. 
I don't know how quick but two things. 
I was here and I was just playing them for nine. 
I forget the name of the novel I was right but I'm up with titles and the subtitle was a non contextual novel. 
So what we're talking about today. 
Well with seeing fabrication simply as processes yes it's true trying to decontextualize. 
And then this morning it was interesting because I've been, I've been sort of extra miserable the last, actually a couple of weeks and sort of a little concerned about it. 
And walking the dog this morning. 
All of a sudden I looked around and I was more awake than I've been in a long time, you know, everything was brighter and clear and moves out and I just stopped and I was about to say, Oh, and I just thought myself and just had the experience of not calling it anything not labeling it not trying to figure out why this happened at this moment but just being enjoying the experience of awake. 
Wakeful is that stepping outside of fabrication and along the path. 
Have you replaced one state of becoming with a different state of becoming just sort of me being right here right now with the moon. 
That's a state of becoming already. 
If I don't conceptualize the I see, even if you don't conceptualize it here I am there's there's it's way in the back of the mind but it's there. 
A lot of this, a lot of these concepts are subconscious. 
So I'm still this I'm still it's an I experience is what you should be on. 
Yeah, and therefore it's fabrication. 
Yeah. 
Interesting. 
Thank you. 
Sure. 
Rick. 
Thank you. 
Hi, I'm Jeff and thank you for your teachings. 
Lots on back there. 
So I'm going to ask some beginners questions. 
Great. 
One of the things I'm just as far as two questions but they're related and one has to do with the concepts of rapture and pleasure. 
I was born in Maryland and there was a guy that used to study your teachings and he introduced me to your teachings around 2014 or 15 and I used to listen to your 40 minute guided meditation start with the meta, going through the body and filling the energy centers and then finally choosing a spot and letting it spread through the entire body and radiate outward and you know into the environment and that's how I would imagine it. 
And then he started talking about rapture and pleasure rapture and I was wondering if because I was never quite sure if that was equated to that sense of energy or warmth or whatever it was. 
What exactly is rapture and pleasure. 
Okay, rapture rapture is large as basically kind of energy that flows. 
And it can have different manifestations. 
Sometimes it's just a sense of fullness that permeates the body. 
Sometimes a chill goes up and down the body. 
Your hair can stand on end. 
This will vary from person to person. 
I knew some people would actually move around a little bit as a result. 
And that can be pleasant up to a point but then the reason is the distinction between rapture and pleasure is that sometimes rapture can be decidedly unpleasant. 
But when people get too wired for the meditation, which is why you want to tune into what is just pleasant. 
In other words, it feels okay being here in a nice steady way. 
So can they go at the same time or does pleasure come at the same time but there will come a point where the rapture becomes too much. 
And then you want to separate the two out. 
The second question is definitely a beginner's question. 
When I first was introduced to this and I was practicing, I was able to experience that to a certain extent. 
And somewhere along the line, and I was thinking about this at like so I may have answered my own question, but I have been finding for the last couple of years that it's hard for me to relax on the end breath and to relax on the out breath. 
You were talking about this earlier and I tend to squeeze. 
And so obviously I'm not going to be feeling that sense of rapture or pleasure. 
Right, right. 
And I don't know exactly what it is that I'm doing though I'm going to have to tell them myself because I just realized a lot of times what I'll do, since I don't necessarily have a bell is I'll say, Okay, so I want to do my abdomen I want to count to do 12 breaths or something like that and then I'll do like six over here and six on the on the sides and stuff like that. 
And I'm wondering if I'm fabricating or trying to control the, the amount of times that I'm doing it like planning planning. 
That's just one possible clip. 
Yeah, but I'm just looking for some clues on how to get back to a state where I can relax. 
One would be one would be I said I'm telling you so I'm going to focus on the absence as long as I feel like it. 
It wouldn't have to be 12 or six whatever just no, no, no numbers at all just as long as it feels good and when it no longer feels good I move over to something else. 
To some place in your back of your mind there's the feeling that if I don't squeeze the breath out it's not going to go out. 
That's why you have to squeeze. 
So just replace that with the perception that says look, the breath will go out in its own I don't have to squeeze it. 
And if there's a sense of fullness in the body that comes in you breathe in say can I maintain that sense of fullness and if any breath is going to go out is it'll go out in its own I don't have to be responsible in the out breath. 
Okay, so when I'm filling up, even the in breath though is the in breath so supposed to just happen naturally or can I if you're going if you're going to consciously participate in what I'd say participate in the in breath. 
And then let the out breath go out in its own without any help from you. 
Okay. 
Because you do you do want to sort of, I don't want to say pump up the breath energy but you do want to, you know, bring more breath into the body because we tend to go around depleted with breath energy anyhow. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
He said you. 
Hello, thank you so much. 
I think I tend to focus on hindrances to inappropriately so they end up increasing like trying to investigate sleepiness and then I get sleepy or worrying about worry. 
It's opposite of appropriate attention. 
I don't know how to think about it. 
Okay. 
Okay, there's a problem here and I just I'm going to look at it for a while and not be too great of a hurry to solve it. 
Because a lot of your knee jerk reactions tend to be as you said to worry about the worry to be get sleepy about the sleepiness. 
In the meantime, instead of trying to make a decision about this, I just want to watch it I want to investigate this. 
What is sleepiness what is worry. 
Without without yet saying that I'm going to have to stop the worry or stop the sleepiness I just want to get to know these things better before I make any decisions as to what I'm going to do with them. 
Okay. 
Okay, so more about stepping back and just say I'm here to I'm here to just understand what it is to be sleepy understand what it is to be worried. 
And then you can begin to see that question about what's the allure why what is part of my mind like this what is my part of my mind like to engage in the worry. 
Why does it go for the sleepiness. 
That question is in the back of your mind, because we're not here just to be okay about it we're we're here to study it so that eventually we can once you understand it then you can do something with it. 
The important thing is you don't just jump in and say well, I've got to do something about this right now and and when you haven't really studied the problem. 
Okay, when Yeah, go ahead. 
So, if I'm understanding correctly. 
There are layers of fabrications and some of them are, you know, we need to have right now and many of them we don't. 
So, I'm just constantly so to two parts in my daily life, for instance, I see something coming up that's not good. 
I just I just going to cut it like, I don't need this right now this is not this is fun so that That's fine and then my meditation. 
I guess the question is like if it's coming up something is coming up and I'm not stable enough to kind of investigate it. 
I'll just cut it. 
But if I'm quite steady then go into it and kind of explore in the drawback and whatnot. 
That's I'm on the right. 
That's. 
Yeah, if you realize that I'm not ready to take this on. 
If I can get around it. 
Yeah. 
Do it but at some point we do need to eventually will you will will need to deal with it but then you have to know when you're ready. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, my body. 
You know the story about the Chinese martial arts master right. 
They're going to have a demonstration of martial arts in this pavilion out in the forest. 
And so the very students go ahead of time. 
And there's this donkey by the side of the road. 
And they decide let's show up our martial arts skill here with the donkey. 
And you know the star student goes up and he tries one move and it gets kicked across the road. 
And then the second students so that's not how you do it's got to be like this he tries another move he gets kicked across the road and end up all the students get kicked across the road by the donkey. 
This is obviously something our teacher has not taught us yet. 
So let's see how he handles the problem so they all hide behind the bushes and watch him and he comes he sees the donkey and walks way around. 
Yeah. 
So there are times when you say I can't handle this. 
I've got to just got to give it a karate chop get it out of the way. 
I'll come back to this later. 
And I just have another unrelated question but so for chanting for me so I guess the I guess the question is like something about benefits of chanting as a lay person if that's a relevant part like sometimes I do like most of the time I'll do half now of chanting and then I'll sit for a long time. 
But other times I just don't want to chant I just want to get into the sitting and is there any benefit of me always chanting or no that's the chanting is there to get the mind in the mood to sit and if you're already in the mood to sit go ahead and sit. 
Christine. 
Hello. 
I two questions one more conceptual and one just if you have any practice advice. 
The conceptual one is deals with that final stage that you're talking about of final relinquishment and while that's not a stage I'm at it still seems useful to me to have an understanding of what's happening there so I just wanted to make see if what I'm understanding is correct. 
Your approach that sort of up this path of being a freedom coming from a kind of ultimate cessation of fabrication has been something that's very useful and a framework that I've applied to my practice for quite a while. 
And it just makes sense in terms of dependent origination that Sankara is there at the first one and that's when that ceases. 
So, I, you know, in some ways, I can conceptualize that the, the freedom the unbinding is a cessation of fabrication, but is the, and again, what you've been saying today is something I've not first time I've considered it but that while the path requires the experience and the skill of that cessation of fabrication in fact, in the final step. 
In fact, fabrication is not the problem that there's can be complete freedom, even with fabrication. 
Okay, first you have to learn how to drop all fabrications. 
Right. 
And then then you'll know how to pick them up again without without having a problem. 
Okay. 
And then there can be, and that's I guess what you're saying I mean the aeronautical fabricating, and yet they're in a state of complete freedom. 
Right, right. 
Okay. 
Okay, the, the practice one is sort of is based around that in terms of my own deepest, or at least how interpret a deepest experience of cessation which happened a number of years ago, was one where at least how a department appeared coming out of it was the sense of fabrication of time had faced. 
And in fact, I was only aware of the experience as I came out of it as I felt the subtle sense of time reforming and experience coming into shape again. 
And it's not an experience at that level that I've had again. 
And I was just wondering if there were any practices that you would suggest that might make that cessation of fabrication of time, maybe more available. 
Well, just what I was saying, which is that you get the mind into a state of concentration. 
And then you, once it's really solid, then you ask yourself, okay, what still here is a disturbance to the mind? Is there an activity that the mind is doing that's causing that disturbance? Can I stop that activity? What happens? And sometimes you go from there to a deeper level of concentration. 
And sometimes you get to the fact, you get to the point where you realize, okay, if I move from here, wherever I go, it's going to be fabricated. 
If I stay here, it's fabricated. 
And we're kind of stymied between you can't go and you can't move. 
Then something may open up. 
Thank you. 
Who's next? Julia, I can go next. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, go ahead. 
Hi, Jeff. 
I have two questions. 
One is that, you know, sometimes you expand your awareness, and then the body seems like have those involuntary uncontrolled movement. 
And I just want to hear your thoughts on that. 
And then my second question is around the, your last sentence in your talk, you said, the sensitivity is the main thing you have to, you have to work on. 
Right. 
And I want to understand how is that related to the, you know, like when we in the deep concentration and stillness, and that is the insight that we gain from, I don't know, level from level one of John or whatever this day might be, right, but sometimes I feel very much related to one of the person asked a question earlier, because you get too certain because they don't know how to get there, sometimes they find it very still, but I don't feel like I have gained some insights. 
So I just want to expand a little bit on your last sentence about the sensitivity. 
Okay. 
In terms of the first question, what kind of movements are you are happening? You can be like you expand your awareness and you kind of just putting yourself in certain, and shaking your head, you could be doing something. 
Okay, okay, if that's, that's basically the energy, the energy has been kind of freed up to move in areas where hasn't been moving before. 
So just let, just think that it's kind of normal. 
Don't encourage it, but don't stop it. 
And then after a while it'll stop on its own. 
And as for the sensitivity, it's precisely that issue of being very clear about what you're doing and what the results are. 
And catching yourself, and sometimes it's like catching yourself out of the corner of your eyes. 
Oh, I just did this. 
So this thought came through my mind, or this perception came through my mind, and that's why this happened. 
This is one of the reasons why having all around awareness is a good thing, because it's almost like these, these thoughts come in or perceptions come in from different directions in the range of your mind. 
And then they will have an impact. 
And if you, if you're focused on one little thing, you're actually missing some of the, some of the activity that's going on in another part of your mind, which is actually more, actually more influential on what's happening right now. 
So try to develop this all kind of all around awareness. 
To expand your awareness. 
Right. 
Right. 
Okay. 
I mean, in some instances, you, you know, do feel the expansion of the body, right, feel up to state and also feel the expansion of the awareness, but still lack of clarity. 
Right. 
Like, oh yeah, I can be still, but where do you go from there. 
Okay, we'll just keep it very still. 
And if there's any tiny little thought that comes in, just, you can see it, you can begin to see it begin to form into a thought you just got breathe right through it, and it breathe right through it and it. 
And that makes you more and more alert. 
So Marsha. 
Yeah, I have a question that go along with the line of chanting. 
So I want to ask about mantras. 
It's very popular in China when my friends know who's practicing Buddhism and know about my diagnosis. 
She gave me suggestions of mantras that I could chant. 
What's the right view of that? I've been staying away from it because I kind of feel like that's not very original Buddhist teaching, but I'm not sure because I didn't get to the bottom of, obviously, that's lots of sutra to read. 
So I just started to read the Pali canon. 
So I want to know from you your knowledge that what's the right view towards mantra. 
Okay, the mantras are words and sometimes the particular sound might have an influence on your body. 
And it depends on when your friend offered you these mantras, what did she say about the power of the mantra? Where did it come from? Healing, like the specific ones that she's trying to find things that tailor to healing disease. 
You might try them for a while and see if it has any impact. 
There's nothing really wrong about it. 
Okay, if so, should I do it in the original language, Josh, because the Chinese translated the monk, the master. 
Well, translate this is one of the things that he said he decided not to translate because he felt that the power is in the language itself. 
But there's always meaning, right? But when people back then say it, they know what it means. 
So for us, when we say it, should we say it as if we don't know what it means, just a sound or should we say it in a meaning way, you know what I mean? You can experiment. 
Okay, do both. 
Always the answer, do both. 
Yes, try experimenting. 
Okay, thank you. 
So I see a few from the chat. 
Jeannie. 
Oh, hello. 
Thank you. 
I have a question about the genres. 
I don't know them. 
I know basically what they are about. 
But would it be important for me to study this and have a deeper understanding of the genres? I think it'd be good just to get a sense of, you know, these are things that the mind can do. 
And then the first John is not that exotic. 
You know, that guided meditation that I give with the breath, getting to the whole body awareness, working through the breath energy in the body. 
That's designed to get you into the first John. 
Okay, I will. 
Now, so see Kate. 
Go ahead. 
Yes. 
Thank you, John. 
I, I study in Thailand and upper country Thailand and the monks have taught me I loved your thing about the hands and relaxing the hands because that's one thing that I find that really beneficial. 
And everything else follows. 
But the question I had the monks there, some of the things I've learned is about the six. 
And I'm, they're different methods and methodologies, but I wanted your opinion on what you think, mainly about, I've been learning or I learned there the 28 breathing points. 
Are you familiar with that? You breathe into different parts of your body. 
And it's really been helpful for me and relaxation because then I get out of my, my head. 
The ties, they don't feed the monkey in your brain. 
And, and also we're, we're taught, which I know is prepared for sitting is the walking and the six very specific six steps that the ties teach there at one of the temples in Chiang Mai. 
And I don't know, I guess my question is just your opinions, your familiarity with that. 
Is that just a specific methodology at this temple is teaching. 
Yeah, it's specific to that temple. 
And the question is, if you find that it, you know, working with these breath points and working and following the breath of their instructions on walking meditation, if it does help the mind to settle down, it's perfectly fine. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
Okay, we've got four more hands. 
Let's, let's finish with the four hands and then we'll be done. 
Okay. 
Well, there are more coming up. 
Yes, go ahead. 
Can you hear me? Yeah. 
Um, is there a good story like the Thai forest? John's about developing equanimity. 
I think it's so interesting how they practice, you know, when they could go wandering around in the old days. 
Any of them or you. 
Do you want a story story about equanimity. 
Well, there's that story about a John cow who was living in a cave. 
He didn't realize there was a tiger that lived deeper in the cave. 
It turns out that when he was away from the cave, that was the times those are the times when the, when the tiger would come in and out. 
And then one night he was doing walking meditation. 
It was a full moon night. 
So he was doing walking meditation outside the mouth of the cave. 
And the tiger came. 
And immediately fear came up into him and he said, okay, which is more dangerous, the tiger or the fear. 
He realized again, my fear is actually more dangerous. 
So he said, okay, I don't care about the tiger. 
I'll focus on my fear. 
And he watched the fear and it was able to get to the point where the fear dropped out of the mind and they got into very deep concentration just standing there. 
And then when he came out of concentration, you know, it was a couple hours later, the moon, it moved quite a bit. 
And the tiger was gone. 
For example, it's okay. 
Let go of the tiger right now. 
I've got to focus on my fear. 
And that's what equanimity is about. 
It's realized, okay, which is, where should I focus my attention now? And things that are irrelevant to that. 
I'm just going to be a quantumist about. 
So, you know, if the tiger ate him, he'd have to be a quantumist about the tiger eating is that's much less dangerous than giving into the fear. 
Okay. 
Yeah, it seems like there's, there's so many fears nowadays, you can get paralyzed by them. 
Oh my gosh. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, inappropriate attention, especially fears for loved ones that you're responsible for. 
Yeah, even worse than fears for yourself, but you have to just drop out. 
Maybe it's a good thing for your practice if you learn how to be a quantumist about it. 
Yep. 
Because you've got to focus on really important to you. 
I think I'd rather have a tiger. 
You got to focus on what you're responsible for. 
Great. 
Thank you. 
So have another one from Jeff and Rita. 
Yeah, thank you. 
So just a little bit more clarity, please on this whole sense of I am and the focusing around how to use this skillfully. 
And I think what is popping into my head is, is it conceit is one of the last elements to leave the mind before it's awakened. 
All day long, you've been guiding us and practicing with different perceptions of how we're seeing I am, how to adjust to a perception of activity, a verb versus now. 
And yet, partly conventionally, and I'm wondering how much part does the, at least my mind still say I am with all of these activities, even if I'm focusing on just activity, and is this action skillful or not. 
There's still this me that's involved in all this so I'm just trying to understand the sort of the correlation between the shift, the shifting sense of self, and then getting it to a point where it's dispassion or to detached enough to be at such a mental place in meditation, where that I am is, is not strong enough. 
It is weak enough to find something different, because it just still seems that that is that clinging that's a, that's a point of a source of such strength. 
And where does that eventually loosen. 
That's probably your last worry. 
Your initial worry is, you know, what kind of do right now that's skillful. 
And if you can see that you're actually creating a sense of self in a way that is unskillful, so I got to take this part. 
See that sense of self as an activity. 
This is why the Buddhist having you focus on your precepts and your practices. 
And then you start saying, okay, even this sense of self is a contract. 
And if it's getting in the way of my doing something more skillful, I've got to, I've got to take it apart. 
And if it's actually encouraging me to do something skillful, I got to hang on. 
Let it be there in the background. 
So when you sit down to meditation, you're still taking this sense of self. 
Do you think that's following you in the meditation, no matter how they deep, we think we're getting. 
If there's still like, I'm wondering the switch between leaving meditation and what's going on conventionally. 
You've talked a lot about the mind being on that post and just how long the leashes are before you get back in. 
It's going to be there until our handshift. 
So the more one is, is working between the meditation and then conventionally the seeding with just the actions of skillful or non skillful. 
Is that in itself seeding the mind somewhere to loosen that grip on the. 
Get your more sensitive to what you're doing and then eventually you begin to see that your sense of self is a kind of action as well. 
So the dispassion, because from this coarseness, say sensuality to finer and finer places of just agitation, seeing just agitation as a source of suffering or say dispassion itself as a source of it. 
Well, there's still suffering in dispassion even. 
So then you go into meditation and you can start on a more on a subtler level, which I guess would be why you say John is so important, because you're not really going to get that finer place. 
You could even be fooling yourself. 
So, as the last question on that is, what would cause. 
What would cause the mind not to let go of the raft at such a subtle point that it's it's a loss. 
Right. 
Right. 
So a very subtle attachment to conceit. 
Yeah, my mind is really good. 
Will it be that clear when you find when it finally recognizes. 
Well, it's funny. 
It's these little voices in the back of the mind. 
They're very quick and very subtle. 
They're like subliminal messages on TV. 
But it's that clear when the mind finally sees that. 
Thank you. 
Maria. 
It's okay. 
I pass. 
Okay. 
And then the last one will be Karen. 
Hello, John. 
Thank you very much for your talk. 
I have a question about attention. 
My interpretation of my attention. 
If I keep it unfocused, very broad. 
I can see better what's going on when I try to zoom in. 
My attention seems to fabricate a lot. 
So when it's almost that I feel like I have to peek at things from behind the veil in order to see them more clearly without disrupting them. 
That's pretty much how you're going to get insights into what the mind is doing. 
Thank you very much. 
Okay, well, thank you for your attention. 
Hope this has been helpful. 
Thank you. 
And I see your video is off. 
That's intentional. 
No. 
It's been definitely different. 
Okay, everybody be well. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Take care. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, feel free to unmute and say hi, say bye. 
Well wishes. 
Thank you. 
It needs to be longer. 
We have more discussion.
