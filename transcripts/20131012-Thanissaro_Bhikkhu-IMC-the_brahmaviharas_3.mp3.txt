The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, are there any more questions on the metasuta we just discussed?
Yes, okay.
So my understanding is, when it says one never again will lie in the womb,
that means if we fulfilling metta, the way it's expressed here,
that we will never, will not come back.
Well, it's that last paragraph, which is more than just the metta.
It's not taken with views.
Yeah, I saw that.
So metta plus...
Yeah, I read that, yes.
What I was meaning is, where does meditation, all that comes in?
Well, the metta is a form of meditation.
Yeah, okay.
We'll be getting further down when the Buddha talks about developing,
say, concentration based on metta, and then adding the factors for awakening,
which include mindfulness, factors for analysis of qualities, persistence,
i.e. right effort, concentration.
This is taking metta beyond just the concentration,
because you're actually adding that the sermon faculties as well.
And that's how you get to the point where you can overcome your attachment to views
and your attachment to sensuality.
And primarily, we'll be looking at the various ways that the Brahma-Baharas are used in the texts,
but one of the primary uses is as a way of getting concentration.
And then from the concentration, you develop the factors for awakening,
which include all the discernment faculties.
I was in a concentration retreat,
and I realized I had difficult time just concentrating on my nostrils.
So what I did, I did metta practice instead.
And that helps also being able to concentrate, right?
Right.
The thing is, there are different definitions of what counts as right concentration.
And when the Buddha is talking about strong states of concentration,
he doesn't have just pointing it on the tip of your nose or at any one point in the body,
full body awareness.
And there may be a sense of center inside the body,
but your awareness fully inhabits the body right during the present moment,
and it's not moving off to any other frame of reference.
So I would question the one-pointedness of the concentration.
It's a very difficult and not necessarily that helpful kind of concentration.
Because you know what happens when you're focused on one thing,
you're ignoring the whole rest of your body, the whole rest of your mind,
and so anything could be going on back there and you don't know.
So what you want to develop is an all-around awareness,
like we were working with the breath today.
That gives you a much wider range of picking up on what's going on,
without being moved by it, which is the important part of concentration.
Isn't that jhana concentration mostly concentrating on one point?
Not according to the Buddha.
If you want, you can look at that book with each and every breath.
Anything else?
Okay, let's go to the next question.
Just on that last piece, you know, the Pali is the parimukam.
So a lot of the teachers like Pao Aok might, for example, have interpreted that.
I mean, around the face or around the mouth.
I mean, that's in the Satipatan and other sutras in terms of where to...
Mindfulness is established.
You can interpret parimukam again, literally according to the roots of the word,
or you can look through the canon and see where parimukam is used.
Another interesting place where parimukam is used is in the Vinaya,
where they say, do not shave your parimukam.
In terms of that, it means your chest.
So the word parimukam could just mean bring it something to the fore,
the foreward part of your body, or bring something to the fore.
So again, there's a question.
When you read a word, is it meant literally or is it meant idiomatically?
But parimukam in the Vinaya means the chest.
You're not supposed to shave your chest hair.
How do you know they weren't meaning about your facial hair shaving that?
Because you have to shave that.
Monks.
Monks, yes.
Well, you would have to shave yours too, I think.
Anything else?
Okay, let's go into the next passage.
There's another place where the Buddha is giving expression of metha.
It comes in the context of the three types of skillful mental action.
The first one is that you're not covetous.
The second one is you bear no ill will.
And this is what you think when you're bearing no ill will.
May these beings be free from animosity, free from oppression, free from trouble,
and may they look after themselves with ease.
I think that last phrase is especially interesting.
It's not like, I'm going to be there for them.
It's more, may they be there for themselves?
And you think about it, which would you prefer?
The ability to look after yourself or have somebody looking after you?
I think people would be happier looking, being able to look after themselves.
And so that's what we're hoping for.
And this is number 12, as the passage I told you about earlier.
This is goodwill for all the creepy crawly things.
Those first four names there are actually species of snakes.
And I think the dark Gotamakas are the cobras.
So the story goes that a monk was sitting under a tree.
A snake fell on him and bit him and he died.
So they got to report this to the Buddha and the Buddha said,
you know, if he had been spreading goodwill to all the four families of snakes,
the snake wouldn't have bit him.
So, and this is the chant.
Goodwill for the weirdobakanas and etc.
Goodwill for footless beings, two-footed beings, four-footed beings, many-footed beings.
May footless, two-footed, four-footed, many-footed beings do me no harm.
May all creatures, all breathing things, all beings, each and every one meet with good fortune.
May none of them come to any evil.
Limitless is the Buddha, limitless the Dharma, limitless the Sangha.
There is a limit to creeping things.
Snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards and rats.
I have made this safeguard, I have made this protection.
May the beings depart.
In other words, got goodwill for you guys, but please go away.
And then it's paying homage to the blessed one and the seven rightly self-awakened ones.
So again, this is an expression of Mehta, which shows again that loving-kindness doesn't quite fit the category here.
It's more, may you be well, may I be well.
In this case, it means, may we go our separate ways.
Back when I first went to Thailand, it was newly ordained.
It seemed like all the cobras in the mountain wanted to come out and check out the western monk.
And the first time I reported it to a John Fluhring, he said,
oh, that's ordinary, we've just got a lot of cobras around here.
And that was happening every day, every day, every day.
I'd be doing walking meditation and it'd be a cobra lying on the side of my path.
And after a while, I told him to this and he said after all, you know, this is not normal.
So he had me memorize this chant and spread goodwill of all the snakes.
And they went away.
Okay.
So when you hear about Mehta phrases, those are the Buddha's Mehta phrases.
The Brahma Vihara is in context.
Okay, the first passage points out that being resolved on freedom from ill-will and on harmlessness,
those are actually expressions of goodwill and compassion.
And it's part of right resolve.
It's a part of the noble path.
Passage 14 points out the way Mehta is helpful in engendering, as it says, feelings of endearment,
feelings of respect leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, and a state of unity.
And being set on bodily acts of goodwill, verbal acts of goodwill, mental acts of goodwill, of the first three.
So in other words, the way you act toward people, the way you speak to the medieval way,
the way you think about them should be expressions of goodwill.
And that helps the group live together.
So this is kind of the social aspect of goodwill.
It goes on just to complete this discussion, that you share your gains, that you've gained righteously.
And your virtues are up in tune with that of your fellows.
In other words, that you are not below them in level.
And your views are also in tune, that everybody basically agrees on the dharma.
When you have these six conditions, the community will live together in peace and harmony.
Talking about harmony, it's interesting that the Buddha says that,
suppose there's a split in the sangha, you have to sit down and get to the root of the split.
Why did this dispute come up?
Now what can we do to settle it?
He says, if you don't get to the root of it and you just try to paper over it, it's not really harmony.
It may look peaceful on the outside, but you haven't really solved the problem.
So in cases like that, you have to dig a little bit deeper and say,
we're not going to pretend things are okay just for the sake of harmony.
You actually have to get to the root of the problem before there can be any genuine harmony.
Passage 15 talks about using metta.
When you reflect on the fact that you have harmed people in the past or harmed beings in the past.
Blessed one in a variety of ways.
Criticizes and censures the taking of life.
This person reflects and says, staying from taking life.
There are living beings I have killed to a greater or lesser extent.
That was not right, that was not good.
But if I become remorseful for that reason, that evil deed of mine will not be undone.
So reflecting thus, he abandons right then the taking of life.
And in the future, he refrains from taking life.
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed, the transcending of that evil deed.
This means basically the Buddha does not have you dwell on feelings of guilt.
Because it's not going to undo the problem.
The best you can do is to decide that you will not do that again.
And this goes with the other precepts as well.
And then having abandoned all that unskillful behavior that breaks the precepts.
Then you keep providing the first direction to East with awareness imbued with good will, compassion, empathetic joy, equanimity.
Likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.
Thus above, below, and all around, everywhere in its entirety, you keep providing the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity, etc.
Abundant, expansive, limitless, without hostility, without ill will.
Just as a strong, contrompet blower can notify the four directions without any difficulty in the same way.
When the awareness released through good will, compassion, empathetic joy, equanimity is thus developed, thus pursued.
And indeed, down to a limited extent, no longer remains there, no longer stays.
Now what he's referring to there is the same thing as the image I gave of the river of water.
Whatever past unskillful karma you have, when you have that limitless mind state going,
the fruiting of past karma does not have an impact on the mind.
So this is one of the rewards of developing good will.
Which is that when your mind is in that state, past bad karma does not have, can't hurt you.
Someone once said that the teaching on karma was kind of a childlike desire to make sure that the world was at the fair place.
Karma is not a fair doctrine. You can get away with a lot by developing good will.
But it means you really have to be sincere in your good will.
And what comes back at you, it's not like if you kill X number of people,
you're going to have to be killed X number of times before you go to awakening, that's not the case.
The results of past bad karma will be mitigated if you develop a more skillful state of mind.
So here the Buddha is basically talking about how if you know you've done things wrong in the past,
you make up your mind that you're going to abstain from that behavior, you follow through with that,
and then you develop the Brahma Biharas to strengthen that resolve, not to harm other beings.
And at the same time it's going to be a protection for your own mind.
Any questions on that point?
Yes.
In Majam in Nikhaya 61, he taught Rahula his son to have, when he does wrong, to have some remorse,
and even to confess it to...
Confessing is different from remorse.
Yeah, but I can't remember the exact words, but I thought the remorse...
You should feel ashamed.
What's that?
You should feel ashamed and loathing.
Isn't that remorse?
It's somewhat different.
You know that study they did of the difference between the shame cultures and guilt cultures?
No.
This was back in World War II when the army began seriously contemplating what would happen
when they occupied Japan.
Would the Japanese cooperate with the occupation or were they going to be sabotaged in the occupation?
So they called in Ruth Benedict to do a study of Japanese culture.
And one of her primary main areas of focus was how children are raised in a culture
that tells you a lot about the culture.
And she came up with the theory that there are two kinds of culture.
We mentioned it earlier, the shame culture and the guilt culture.
And in a shame culture, the way the parents discipline their children,
is don't do that and embarrass us in front of the neighbors.
In a guilt shot culture, they say,
don't do that, it hurts me when you do that.
And she came to the conclusion that Japan was a shame culture
and would cooperate with the occupation, which was true.
So there's a difference between shame and remorse.
Remorse is you just feel awful about something.
I'm a horrible person.
Whereas in shame, you say that was an action that's beneath me.
Well, sometimes we talk about healthy remorse.
That is, you know, recognizing there was wrongdoing and resolving not to.
I'm a bad person for doing this act.
And again, if healthy, shame, remorse, guilt, whatever you want to call it,
the healthy part is when you look at the action, you realize,
that was unskillful and it was beneath me.
I shouldn't have done it.
And the unhealthy one is I'm a horrible person.
No, I can never undo this awful deed that I've done.
So the Buddha's encouraging shame in that healthy sense.
Okay, then let's go on for the rewards of Mehta and Goodwill and the others.
These are the rewards of Goodwill.
You sleep easily, you wake easily, you dream no evil dreams.
You're dear to human beings, you're dear to non-human beings.
Dave is like you.
Dave is protect you.
Neither fire, poison, nor weapons can touch you.
Your mind gains concentration quickly.
Your complexion is bright.
When you die unconfused and have penetrated no higher,
you're headed for the Brahma worlds.
These are some of the immediate rewards of developing Mehta.
That one about dying unconfused.
I've been around a number of people whose virtue was not all that strict
that I'm going to die and they really are confused.
They start thinking back on the things that they've done
and they don't want to think about that.
They think about the future and they don't want to think about that either.
So the mind just starts, a lot of dementia comes from this.
Question.
It seems like the weapons and poisons and all of that can't touch you.
That seems like hyperbole maybe.
Because of course we have images in the suttas of Arahants being killed
and the Buddha being harmed by Devadatta.
If the Buddha hadn't had good will, he might have done an awful lot more.
Say more about that.
If the Buddha hadn't had that good will, maybe Devadatta could have killed him.
The lore is that the Buddhas can't be killed is what the tradition says.
I mean there are many cases where people talk about how an area has been protected
by the good will of somebody.
So even if it's not totally protected, at least the damage that could have been done is a lot less.
And then of course the poison and fire and acid are not touching you.
Which part of you are they not touching?
Your mind.
Yes.
Where's the mic?
You just mentioned something about dementia.
I'm getting to be 70 years old.
Could you explain, do you really feel that there's some meditative helpfulness in avoiding dementia?
The best thing to do is develop thoughts of good will.
Limitless good will.
I mean all four brahmavaharas, if you can, as a habit.
Because what usually happens, I've seen in cases of dementias,
a lot of habits come out at the point where you're getting less and less control over your mind.
And so if you've been developing good habits, those are the things you're going to show.
There was the case of a John Siewat who had a very bad case of brain damage toward the end of his life.
And he wasn't as articulate as he had been before.
At least he was more aware of what was going on in his mind.
And he was still a very nice person to be around.
So dementia will not, it won't prevent dementia, but that dementia will be a more pleasant situation.
Everybody involved, yes.
I've been interested in hearing a little more about dreams.
I know for me sometimes if I'm particularly anxious about something, then I may find that I'm having dreams
that don't necessarily relate to that, but could necessarily be a reflection of the state of my mind.
So I'd just be interested in terms of the longer term effects of meditation and practicing Meda.
Is it really demonstrated that people have, you know, I'm getting fearful about watching any kind of violent shows,
which I just don't do because I think that's, you know, not good practice.
But I'd be interested, I mean, not good experience, but I'm interested to know what more you'd say about dreams
and how Meda may affect dreams and what people report on that.
Well, generally what I've heard reported is that the more, and my own experience has been,
if I go to sleep right after having, you know, spread thoughts of goodwill,
I'm much less likely to have, you know, bizarre and troubling dreams
because you're carrying a good mind state into the sleep.
So this whole thing about, you know, watching a violent movie right before you go to bed,
it's not good, it's not good, no. Or the news.
My only experience with movies is, you know, when I fly on an airplane and they have the movies up front,
or now they have movies all over the place, you know, people's little screens, you know.
And coming back from Thailand last time, there was this particularly violent film
that this one guy was watching two seats ahead of me.
And it really stuck with me for a long time afterwards.
I don't have any other movies to erase it.
Now, I was very sensitive that was where all these images came from.
Whereas if you're keeping, in putting that input in all the time, you know,
what sort of things you're laying down in your brain.
But I have found that when you, you know, very consciously, right before you go to bed,
thoughts of goodwill for everybody.
You tend to sleep better and you wake up more easily and the dreams are different.
Thank you.
I've made a habit of spreading thoughts of goodwill three times a day.
Right when he woke up in the morning, right after he woke up from his afternoon nap,
and then right before he went to bed at night.
Passage 17. The Buddha here is talking to the Galamas.
You know, that famous Galama Sutta.
This is the later part of the Sutta, which isn't quoted quite as much.
In this passage, the Buddha has just described a person developing all four Brahma vaharas
in the way that's described in passage 15.
And then he goes on to say,
One who is a disciple of the noble ones is thus free from hostility, free from ill will,
undefiled and pure, acquires four assurances in here and now.
Now remember, the Buddha is talking to a group of people who have not committed to any teacher yet.
So he's saying, if there is a world after death, if there is a fruit of action,
rightly and wrongly done, then this is the basis by which, with the break of the body after death,
I will appear in a good destination in the heavenly world.
That's the first assurance.
If there is no world after death, if there is no fruit of action, rightly and wrongly done,
then here in the present life I look after myself with ease, free from hostility, free from ill will,
free from trouble. This is the second assurance.
If evil is done through acting, still I have willed no evil for anyone.
Having done no evil action from where will suffering touch me?
This is the third assurance.
But if no evil is done through acting, then I consume myself pure in both respects.
In other words, pure in the sense that I haven't done any evil,
and pure in the sense that I will not be experiencing suffering.
So even if you're not willing to take a stand on the question of rebirth or the fruit of karma,
still acting on the thoughts of good will is a good thing, because at the very least,
there is a pleasant abiding in the here and now, a safe abiding,
and you can look on your actions and not criticize yourself.
By developing the various brahmapaharas, you escape from ill will, by developing good will,
you escape from viciousness, by developing compassion, you escape from resentment,
by developing apathetic joy, and you escape from passion, by developing equanimity.
When I talk about them as an awareness release, that means taking them to the level of jhana.
Passage 19 deals with that image I gave you about the salt in the river.
Passage number 15.
Passage 20 is where the Buddha starts talking about developing the factors for awakening
based on the concentration that comes from the brahmapaharas.
Mindfulness is a factor for awakening, of course, deals with the four establishments of mindfulness.
The analysis of qualities, this is when you start looking at thoughts in the mind
as to whether they're skillful or not or not,
and if they're unskillful trying to figure out a way to get rid of them,
if they're skillful trying to figure out a way to develop them.
This is the wisdom faculty and the factors for awakening.
It's an extension of the principle of what's called appropriate attention,
learning to look at things in terms of skillful, unskillful, or in terms of the formidable truths,
and then the duties that are appropriate for them are formidable truths.
You see suffering and you say, okay, how can I comprehend this?
You see the cause of suffering, how can I abandon this?
You see the path developing, how can I develop this further,
and then as for the cessation of suffering, that's something you try to realize.
So notice that each of these categories carries a duty or a skill that goes along with this.
That's the basis for wisdom.
I think that's one aspect of wisdom or discernment that's underestimated,
that it's in abandoning unskillful things or developing skillful things that you develop your wisdom.
It's not just sort of watching things coming and goings, okay, I saw things come and go, what's next?
This has come, if it's good, what can I do to maintain it?
And learning the techniques and learning how to motivate yourself and all these other issues.
That's when you gain insight into both how skillful qualities can be developed,
as we were talking earlier, the fight that your unskillful qualities are going to pick up or put up,
you start learning how to see through some of their tricks.
Persistence here is equivalent to right effort.
Rapture, serenity, concentration, and equanimity all deal with concentration.
Now, if these are not only concentration, but it's dependent on seclusion, which means concentration,
then at the same time you use that seclusion or that concentration to develop dispassion,
develop cessation to the point of letting go.
Again, this is where the insight practice comes in, insight plus concentration together,
is working on that quality of dispassion that leads to cessation and then letting go.
And then talks about the different things you can develop.
If you want, you can remain a recipient of loathesomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome.
If you want, you can remain a recipient of unloathesomeness in the presence of what is loathsome,
and so on down the line.
In other words, you learn how to make your perceptions independent of reality.
Now, this can be dangerous, but it also means that you learn how to see the extent to which your perceptions
actually add to your experience of reality.
You can look at something and say, you know, this is something that's really disgusting,
and you can see something beautiful in there, or something that's really beautiful.
You can say, well, there's still something disgusting there.
Again, you have to practice this with a lot of maturity.
I practiced the four dilutions in the whip elosives.
Now, this is something different in the whip elosives.
This is an intentional switching of your perceptions.
And it's kind of like learning a new language.
Once you've learned the new language, and then you go back,
you can look at the old language and see how artificial it is,
which is a very useful process.
So if you're really stuck on, say, how beautiful something is,
learn how to look at it as un-beautiful,
and realize, okay, it has both sides.
That helps to free you from the arbitrariness of your perceptions.
I mean, after several years of living in Thailand with no English spoken,
and then coming back to America and having to get back into the groove
with speaking English all the time,
I began to realize, you know, this is a really bizarre language.
I mean, why do we have all these irregular verbs?
Was it designed to fool foreigners or something?
And some of our idioms like pulling your leg.
Could you explain that one to me?
And it's good to get out of your ordinary way of perceiving things.
And so this is what that particular practice is for.
And then it says, okay, if you cut yourself off from both loathsome
and what is not remaining equanimous, alert, and mindful,
or you can remain in what's called the beautiful liberation.
The beautiful liberation is a kind of concentration
that comes from people who tend to be visually oriented.
The descriptions of the John is tend to be physically oriented.
Your sense of the proprioception, the sense of the body as you experience it from within.
There are other types of concentration the Buddha talks about,
which I actually have to deal more with what you see.
Some people close their eyes and this is a very visual kind of experience.
So the beautiful is one level, which is this as far as good will can take you.
And then the remaining ones, compassion can take you all the way to this infinitive space.
Amphithetic joy can take you to the infinitude of consciousness
and equanimity can take you to the state of nothingness.
That's how far they can take you as concentration attainments on their own.
So again, none of them on their own can take you all the way to awakening.
They can take you to these levels of jhana.
To go beyond that, you're going to need to develop some insight and more discernment.
The next section deals with ways of thinking that will help you overcome anger and ill will.
Passage 21 is just there to remind you that there are these three types of fabrication
we talked about earlier, bodily, mental, verbal and mental.
And so these antidotes are ways of dealing with your direct thought, evaluation and perceptions.
And the first one is, if you have trouble even thinking good will for your enemy,
because you know that's supposed to be the standard antidote for anger as you feel good will,
sometimes you can't bring yourself to feel good will to the person.
So this one is for times like that.
You remind yourself that if you are angry, you will be doing something pleasing to an enemy,
bringing about your enemy's aim.
In other words, the person you really hate is going to like the fact that you are angry,
because you're going to do stupid things.
Even though you may be well bathed, well anointed, dressed in white clothes,
your hair and beard neatly trimmed, there you are, Cheryl.
He is ugly nevertheless, all because he's overcome with anger.
Now because when you're angry, you're ugly, okay?
Two, when you're angry, overcome with anger.
Then even though you sleep on a bed, spread with a white blanket, spread with a woolen coverlet,
spread with a flower embroidered, bedspread covered with a rug of deer skins
and with a canopy overhead or on a sofa with red cushions on either end.
That's not an amazing description.
Nevertheless, you sleep badly, because you were angry.
So you're ugly, you can't get any sleep.
When a person is angry, overcome with anger, press with anger,
then even when he suffers a loss, he thinks I've gained a profit.
Even when he gains a profit, he thinks I've suffered a loss.
We've probably seen that.
There used to be a public defender.
They had this case where four kids or five kids were charged with rape.
They had five public defenders defending all these kids.
She was noticing that many times the other members of the team were trying to make a point.
They thought they had scored a point that helped their case,
but all she could see was that it had hurt their case,
but they were high-fiving one another in the fact that they'd made this point.
So there's a lot of delusion that comes in.
You made a really good point, you made a stupid point, you really lost the battle.
But when you're angry, you can't see that clearly.
So this too would be satisfying to your anger.
Excuse me, satisfying to your enemy.
When you're angry, then whatever your wealth earned through your efforts and enterprise
amassed the strength of your arm and piled up through the sweat of your brow,
righteous wealth, righteous legain, the king orders it sent to a royal treasury in payment or fees.
So you're going to lose.
When you're over-pressed with anger, whatever your reputation you've gained from being heedful, it falls away.
Your friends, companions, and relatives will avoid you from afar,
and then you engage in unskillful conduct that will lead to a bad destination after death.
So this is what you think, okay, if I give in to my anger,
I'm going to do stupid things that are going to be pleasing to my enemy.
Do I want to please that bastard? No.
So this is the low level of dealing with anger, okay?
One set of perceptions you could use.
Another set of perceptions.
Thinking, this person has done me harm.
So as you hate somebody, this person has done me harm.
But what should I expect?
That's how you subdue your hatred.
He is doing me harm.
But what should I expect?
He's going to do me harm.
But what should I expect?
He has done harm to people who are dear and pleasing to me.
But what should I expect?
You get the point, right?
He is aiding people who are not dear to me.
What should I expect?
And then finally, you do not get work drop over impossibilities.
The thing about what should I expect?
There's a whole list that Buddha gives of possible ways that people could speak to you.
He said that basically this is the range of human speech.
People can say either kind words or unkind words, timely words, untimely words.
Well-meaning words, words that are not well-meaning, true or false.
This is the nature of speech.
This is what we've got in the human realm.
If you want something better than this, then you're in the wrong realm.
And when you think that way, it's okay, it's not quite so bad.
You depersonalize the sting by realizing that this is the way the human nature is.
Years back, I remember reading someone writing about how 9-11 was such a shock for this person,
because as he said, it burst his complacent Buddhist bubble.
And all I could think, complacent Buddhist?
That's an oxymoron.
But a lot of people do approach Buddhism that way.
They get very complacent.
They think, well, the world is a wonderful place.
Everybody's basically good.
What should I expect?
People are going to do stupid things or harmful things.
Don't think that it's anything unusual.
When you can think in that way, it takes away a lot of the sting.
And it's a lot easier for you to develop skillful attitudes in response to the situation.
In passage 24, it gives a series of other perceptions you might think of when someone is how you overcome the hatred for someone else.
The second paragraph is the one about the water in it.
The first one is a monk who makes use of things that are thrown away sees a rag on the road taking hold of it with his left foot
and spreading it out with his right.
He would tear off the sound part and go off with it.
In other words, you find a dirty rag, part of it is dirty, part of it is good.
You take the good part.
In the same way you treat another person's actions.
You focus on the good part and let the bad part along.
That way you can help overcome your hatred for that person.
Over there is a pool overcome with slime and water plants and a person comes along burning with heat covered with sweat exhausted, trembling and thirsty.
Even though there's slime on the pool, he would jump into the pool, part the slime and water plants with both hands,
and then cupping his hands, drink the water and go on his way.
So you move out the slime and you just take the pure water that's left.
As for the person who has no good qualities, that's the first full paragraph on page 10.
This is the image of the person finding a sick man on the side of the road in pain, seriously ill,
traveling on a road far from the next village and far from the last,
unable to get the food he needs, unable to get the medicine he needs, unable to get a suitable assistant,
unable to get anyone to take him to human tabletation.
Then someone else would come along and feel pity for him and do what he could out of pity.
In the same way, if this person has no good qualities, you think,
and this is what your compassion and sympathy for him says,
oh, that this man should abandon wrong bodily conduct and develop right bodily conduct,
abandon wrong verbal conduct and develop right verbal conduct, abandon wrong mental conduct and develop right mental conduct.
Why is that?
So that on the break of the body after that, he won't fall into a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower ram or hell.
So you have compassion for this person, hoping that this person will behave skillfully.
And that's your compassion for him.
Any questions on any of those passages so far?
Here the Buddha is giving you ways of adjusting your direct of thought and evaluation and your perceptions.
So you can deal with a situation where someone has done something to make you angry,
or someone has harmed you.
Yes.
The question I have is about passage 20 and the beautiful liberation.
And you talked about that in terms of visual beauty.
And I have heard that in the past, that referred to as liberation by the beautiful.
That is to actually enter the states of Janas with practicing the Brahma Viharas to really cultivate a beautiful state of the heart.
And then through that, then contemplate arising and passing away and just passing away and then the unfolding of the insights.
This is the list, it calls this the beautiful liberation. There's another passage where the Buddha talks about seven liberations.
And the first one is that you see forms. One of you see forms and then it's light and then it's beautiful.
And then you go into the formless Janas. And it's an alternative way of getting into the formless Janas.
You see forms, in your mind's eye you see forms. And then the forms go in and then there's light.
You're talking about the nimitta.
Yes, this would be people who are visually oriented when they practice.
Because some people are physically oriented when they sit down and meditate.
They just have a very strong sense of the body when they settle in the present moment.
Other people don't have such a strong sense of the body, it's more visual.
Now it's one of the ways that you can actually get into the formless Janas without going through the form Janas.
And there's a question, maybe that's how the Buddha got into the formless Janas when he was practicing with his two teachers before his awakening.
The question always comes up, why is it that the Buddha, after his austerity, suddenly thought back to the Janas,
he had to think way back to his childhood when he'd entered the first Janas spontaneously under a tree.
And one of the possible answers is when he'd been practicing with his other two teachers,
this was the bypass around the Janas into the formless states.
Okay, so you're taking beautiful to be actually rather literal and visual, not so much the quality of the heart.
What is the word in Pali?
Subha.
Subha, so isn't that desirable, good, ideal, instead of asubha?
Attractive.
Attractive, yes.
So an attractive, you can talk afterwards.
Basically it means beautiful.
Yeah.
It was a name that they would give to women sometimes.
Subha.
Right.
I have some questions, but I can talk afterwards.
Question here.
Is there any analogy between the Arupa Janas, reaching their Arupa Janas through the beautiful
and in the Chula Sunyata Majama 121 it takes you from village to it's increasing non-diversity
is the way to get there.
So how can one think of the beautiful and that guided meditation?
Is there any relationship?
There are really two different paths.
Thank you.
My experience watching my teacher teach meditation was that it was kind of like herding cats for
a while.
I'm trying to bring people into a spot where they're basically there with the body and
their breath is still.
And different people will be coming at that from different directions.
Some people were extremely visually oriented and they had to spend a lot of time working
with their visions before they could come back into the body.
And other people were more into the body, but they had problems with the imbalance in
the elements, a very strong sense of heaviness, great heat coming up in their meditation,
and what not.
My general impression is that until you get to that spot that's on the verge of the
infinitude of space, there are lots of different paths into that spot.
And from there then it goes pretty standard by it.
Where's the floating mic?
I'm finding these passages difficult, so I apologize if somebody's already talked about
this.
So there's a section that says one should do what one can for the person who is impure
and bodily behavior and verbal behavior, but it doesn't, at least not in this section,
doesn't elaborate.
What does it mean to do what one can out of compassion?
Doing what you can is in the analogy.
Like you would feel sympathy for someone and you would do what you could to help that person.
And in the actual expression of how you would feel for someone who has no good qualities
at all is, oh, may this person learn how to abandon unskillful behavior and develop skillful
behavior.
Now you look at the situation, what can I do at that point?
So instead of just dwelling on the fact that you hate this person for being so harmful,
your main emphasis is what can I do to get this person to change his or her ways?
And if you see there's nothing I can do right now, I'll leave that issue for the time being.
But at the very least I'm not going to be out there trying to get revenge.
Okay, so I'm, okay, so I guess it's a much larger issue about even if you don't feel
ill will towards the person, just having the skillfulness to know what to do if anything,
because if a person is acting that whatever that way is, typically there's not much you
can do for them in that moment because when they're acting that way they're in their reptilian
brain and they're not going to, you know.
So you try some things.
I saw a father one time as a child just screaming and screaming and screaming, and it was pretty
quick the father got the child laughing within five minutes, just saying things that the
child couldn't help but laugh at and had got the child out of the mood.
In other words, you distract them from their unskillful mood.
I highly recommend Miss Manners.
Have you ever heard of Miss Manners?
She's worth it.
She comes up with some really interesting ways of dealing with difficult people in difficult situations.
I have no idea where she is now.
She's in the newspaper.
You also get books collected, you know, collected columns and things.
Miss Manners' guide to excretion.
Correct behavior, yes.
I have a question.
Yes.
So in your meditation instructions this morning you talked about spreading thoughts of good will.
I forgot the exact words you used.
But in the suits as we see the most common description of meditating in passage 15 on page 6 to pervade
the one direction, kind of, almost sounds like you're broadcasting meta in these different
directions in all four of the Brahma vaharas.
And then in this tradition most commonly you'll hear about having the different objects and
saying these phrases.
These are all different texts on it.
So I'm wondering if you could say anything about the sutta form here, you know, that passage
and how one would work with that as an actual meditation if that's what the Buddha said,
how you should do it.
Okay, well just think.
Who's to the east of here right now?
And then you just visualize out there.
Who out there?
Is there anybody out there that I have any ill will for?
And if you can't think of anybody, fine.
Just keep us from good will and east and then in the west.
Sometimes east, south, west, north.
Sometimes you see it east, west, north, south.
It depends.
Let's suppose you think about going east and you hit Washington, D.C.
Okay, we've got a lot to think about here.
It's okay, how can I deal with the fact that I don't agree with some of the policies that are being going
over right now.
And you still have good will for those people.
So may they abandon there, may they abandon unskillful bodily behavior and unskillful verbal
behavior and unskillful mental behavior.
Would you like to see any of them suffer?
Yes.
And then after you get over that, you say, what would I gain from seeing them suffer?
And just, it's like that New Yorker cartoon where the witches are around this big cauldron
and one of the witches is tasting the brew.
And she's like, it's too sweet.
You added too much revenge.
That almost seems like a very cognitive type of meditation.
Of course it has to be cognitive.
That's the point we're making today.
You have to think these things through at the same time that you're developing a healthy breath, bodily fabrication.
Because that's the important element.
You do the thinking plus the physical side to sort of realign your physical reactions and your mental reactions to things.
So another way of saying it is tie yourself into a knot thinking about it and then relax that knot.
Exactly.
But you don't need too many knots.
It basically comes down to just this.
If I want to see them suffer, what would I gain?
What would the world gain by their suffering?
Would the world gain a lot more by if they suddenly woke up and say, gee, what we've been doing is really stupid.
Let's clean up this mess instead of making a mess.
That would be a bad thing.
And that expression of compassion and pity for that person is, oh, me, this person abandoned unskillful behavior.
And by trying to get revenge on them is not going to make them abandoned unskillful behavior.
Now you may want to vote them out of office.
That's a way of getting them away from unskillful behavior.
But think of it in those terms rather than getting back at them.
You've got to learn how to frame the issue so there really is...
You really aren't thinking, you know, you'd like to string up the bastards.
But you're saying, I want to have good will for these people so if I ever have to meet them, I will be able to act in a skillful way.
Yes.
So it isn't important when you get down there that you have no...
You're rooting out vindictiveness in the heart.
Right.
Because some people, I don't care if they've changed, I really want this person to suffer like I suffered.
So rooting out that feeling.
Exactly.
I have, I think, a rather naive question.
But suffering is what brought me to this practice.
So wishing for somebody else to suffer in a certain way is wishing for them to go through the process of examining.
I mean, really, some of the people that my ill will goes to are people that seem to live very unexamined lives.
I don't know if that's the root or, you know, that's some of the, you know, root of wanting there to be suffering.
It's like, we'll wake up.
So I don't know if, you know, I could...
Well, I want you to wake up without having to go through suffering.
You don't have to say that, but just say, I want you to wake up and leave the amount of suffering that's going to be required to them.
Without your saying, I want you to go through X amount of suffering before you wake up.
It's maybe conflated to some notion of...
We're not saying may you never suffer at all, because that's impossible.
Right.
But may you suffer around the actions that...
Well, I mean, I'm trying to be, I'm really trying to examine what goes on inside of me when I think about that.
It's one of those things that I can hear these teachings, and yet that ill will just...
You've got to examine it.
You've got to examine it.
And there seems to be another part around, I don't know, maybe social justice or something like when somebody does something wrong.
They're put into prisons or jails, which I've never been in one, but my understanding is they're a place of suffering.
And that even the old idea of penitentiaries, where you would go to be penitent and think about it, has been lost.
That that whole system is...
So culturally, I mean, I live in a culture where if somebody does something...
I'll say wrong.
Well, certain people do certain things wrong, yes.
Yeah.
Other people do things wrong and they don't get punished.
Right.
You know, there is some notion of being taught of people that misbehave, being made to suffer.
So it's hard for me to kind of work my way out of that cultural or...
But it is important that you work your way out, because it's not going to be helpful to you in your dealings with those people.
Because you don't know how much this person is going to have to suffer before they're going to change their ways.
And you don't want to be in a position to say, well, I'm going to try to determine the amount of suffering they're going to have to go through in order to change their ways.
Just try to think, maybe there's a possibility someplace that...
I don't want to name names, but suddenly would wake up and say, oh my gosh, this is really stupid, or an incident would happen.
And just leave that to their karma, but you want the general direction to be, my involvement with this person is going to be, I want them to change the way to see what's wrong about their behavior.
Now, if there's anything I can do that would be effective, I'd be happy to do that.
Okay, so that kind of thing is part of goodwill.
That's part of goodwill, yeah.
It's not just though, you know...
Because remember, compassion is not only for people who are currently suffering, but for people who are caught doing the kinds of things that will cause suffering.
Either now or down the line.
And empathetic joy is not only for people who are currently happy, but also for people who are doing something skillful.
Yes.
Ajahn, a follow-up to the previous questions.
What if you're dealing with a difficult person, and when I examine myself, my intentions are mixed.
So the course of action that I can take to stop this harmful action, or at least mitigate this harmful action.
I mean, it is, if I could take this action, it will stop it.
However, the other part of my intention is sweet revenge.
I recognize this.
Anything else that I need to do after I recognize this?
Talk to sweet revenge.
Talk to sweet revenge.
And tell sweet revenge, hey, this is pretty miserable food.
This is where you can start using perception.
I mean, what would revenge look like if you were on your plate?
What would it look like if you were on your plate?
And how would you be eating it?
Is it something you would eat politely with a knife and fork?
Or is it something you'd be gobbling down?
And if you could just imagine it as a kind of food, and what would it do to your system?
And then that becomes revenge.
That's not so.
Or you think about what it looks like in other people.
So revenge may still be there, but it doesn't have to have that big a voice in your deliberations.
Well, I recognize that sweet revenge is not good for me.
But it's the impulse of kind of being drawn to that.
You know, just being attracted to that.
Because it's like, all this harm that this person has done to me, now I can stop it.
It's good, I stop it.
It stops this person from harming other people as well.
But it's just recognizing it, but kind of like, ah.
Finally got through.
Yeah, kind of almost wishing this person for once can see it and see what they've done.
And just almost, if anything, apologize.
Apology is not revenge.
Well, just wanting them to see what kind of harm they've done.
To feel somewhat cognizant.
So you want them to feel the harm.
I know they'll feel the pain before they, so they apologize.
I'm sorry.
No, just for them to understand what they have done.
I don't wish them ill will as in I don't want them to suffer.
But I want them for once, you know, this person to know, oh, I done a bad thing.
Instead of keep thinking, ah, this is great.
Well, that's not sweet revenge.
Sweet revenge is I want to see this person squirm before they.
That's revenge.
And it's saying, look, I want this person to see the harm they've done and to realize it and to apologize.
That's actually the step toward their reforming their behavior.
So you look at the different voices and learn how to sort them out.
The one that said, I'd like to see him squirm a little bit so he can give me some satisfaction.
I want to see visual proof that he realizes the hurt that I've been feeling.
That's revenge.
And I would like that light bulb to go on in their head.
Thank you.
Okay, passage 25 talks about different attitudes.
What's interesting about this, since you should develop goodwill, develop compassion, develop equanimity,
pay that person no mind or attention, or reflect on the fact of his being the product of his actions.
His federal one is the doer of his actions, the heir of his actions, born of his actions, related by his actions.
And as his actions, as his arbitrator, whatever action he does for good or for evil, to that will he fall heir.
It's interesting that in the commentaries, or the later canonical parts, they equate equanimity with this reflection on karma.
Whereas here in the sutras, it's two separate reflections.
In other words, that one reflection of the action is, I don't have to get revenge.
His actions are going to get the revenge for me, which is not necessarily the most skillful thought,
but it helps to get you over the hatred.
Passage 26 gives a perception of how your metta should be like earth.
Suppose a man would come along carrying a hoe in a basket saying, I will make this great earth be without earth.
He would dink here and there, scatter soil here and there, spit here and there, urinate here and there, saying be without earth, be without earth.
Now what do you think? Would he be able to make this great earth be without earth?
The monks say, no Lord, why is that? Because this great earth is deep and enormous.
It can't easily be made to be without earth. The mad would reap only a share of weariness and disappointment.
And here the Buddha is saying, in the same way you develop good will.
First you remind yourself, as I said earlier, there are these five aspects of speech.
In other words, this is what human speech is like. Sometimes it is timely, sometimes untimely.
True, false, affectionate, harsh, beneficial or un-beneficial with the mind of good will or with inner hate.
Other people may address you with any of these ways.
In any event, you should train yourselves. Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words.
We are made sympathetic to that person's welfare with the mind of good will and no inner hate.
We will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will.
And beginning with him, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will.
Equal to the great earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free from hostility, free from ill will.
That's how you should train yourselves.
In other words, you try to visualize your good will as being as enormous as the earth.
And no matter what they can do, it's not going to be without good will.
So again, this is a perception you hold in mind.
This is the quality of good will you want.
You notice in this case, instead of starting with yourself as the first object of good will,
you start with the person who is arming you.
And then from that person, spread it out to everybody else.
This business of starting with yourself and then going to a loved one and then a more neutral one and then further out the line.
That actually comes in a book called the Bhadisambiramaka.
It's a very late edition of the canon, which some canons don't even include.
And then finally, here's the killer analogy to keep in mind.
Even if bandits were to carve you up savagely, limb by limb with a two-handled saw,
he among you who let his heart be angered even at that would not be doing my bidding.
Even then, you should train yourselves.
Our minds will be unaffected and we'll say no evil words.
We'll remain sympathetic with the mind of good will and no inner hate.
We'll keep pervading these people with an awareness and build with good will.
And beginning with them, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness and build with good will.
Abundant, expansive, limitless, free from hostility, free from ill will.
It says, if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw,
do you see any aspects of speech, slight or gross that you could not endure?
And they say, no.
It says, then attend constantly to this admonishment on the simile of the saw.
That will be for your long-term will for unhappiness.
In other words, if someone is saying nasty things to you, you say,
well, at least they're not carving me up savagely limb by limb with a two-handled saw.
Any questions on those images?
Notice how the Buddha is using perceptions and ways of framing your thinking to help you think about a difficult situation,
to make it easier to maintain your good will.
And what good will heremeans is, oh, may these people stop doing evil things.
It's like those kids who grow up in the inner city,
who learn to be comedians very early on as the way of disarming the gangs.
I was reading about this one stand-up comedian who said that's how I actually got started.
He was small and weak.
He knew there was no way he was going to fend off the gangs,
so he learned to tell jokes that would make them laugh, and then they'd leave him alone.
Yes?
Or maybe a comment, I'm not sure.
I'm now thinking more about you're saying that these are the development of skillful perceptions,
and you just choose, I'm going to perceive things this way and sort of train the mind to have that rut.
It seems to relate, I'm finding a way to relate it to dependent origination where one chooses,
this is the stuff that happens before contact, right?
You're training your mind to start to see things in a particular way in order that what happens later is more beneficial.
Right.
Can you say a little bit more about that?
Well, you think about what comes prior to contact in dependent horizon.
You've got ignorance followed by fabrications, and these are the fabrications.
And then from there it goes through name and form, or consciousness, name and form, and then you get to the six senses.
And so building up to that, and name and form includes intention, attention,
what you're paying attention to, where your intentions are with regard to this.
And so all this is going to have a shape.
So it's not a matter of, I mean so many people think meditation is just kind of being with the present without trying to change the present at all.
And that's not how the Buddha taught it.
The path is a fabricated path.
There are putting together these ways of thinking that would be conducive to putting it into suffering.
So what you're doing is you're doing the process of fabrication and intention, attention,
not out of ignorance but with knowledge.
That's what turns it into a path.
And then the path will then yield in the unconditioned.
I see that the way I described it wasn't quite correct, but when you describe it, it sounds clearer.
These are fabrications that come from actually seeing meeting experience or intending to meet experience,
not with ignorance but with knowledge.
And then that produces, of course, a different set of conditions.
Right.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Added those for partiality.
Partiality is the opposite of equanimity.
Okay, this first one is why the Buddha is not so high on love.
The word I translated here is affection can also be translated as love.
There is love, affection is born of affection, aversion is born of affection, affection is born of aversion,
aversion is born of aversion.
And it goes down in those four categories I talked about earlier.
If somebody you love, other people act nicely to them, you love them.
There is someone that you love, someone acts cruelly to them, you hate them.
Someone you hate, someone acts really cruelly to them, you like them.
And if it's someone you hate, and someone acts nicely to them, you hate that person too.
And so basically this is the problem with this, is that once you have this love and affection,
it's going to give rise to hatred very easily.
And it's all pretty arbitrary, which is why you can't trust it,
which is why the Buddha never said develop limitless love.
He always said limitless good will.
Passage 28 comes from a longer sutra in which a man has just buried his child.
It's on his way back from the charnel ground.
He didn't bury him, just took him to the charnel ground and left him there,
and then came back and comes back to see the Buddha,
and complains to the Buddha that he's suffering a lot,
and the Buddha says, yes, a lot of suffering comes from dear ones.
Those who are dear.
And the man says, how can you say that?
Joy and happiness come from those who are dear.
And we're talking about someone totally deluded.
Here he's just lost his son, he's been crying,
and all I can say is happiness comes from the dear ones.
And so he goes off and he talks to some gamblers,
and the gamblers say, you're right, happiness comes from dear ones.
There's no suffering that comes from dear ones.
And so the guy goes off saying, I agree with the gamblers.
Where did this get to the palace?
He came to say to you at that point that it was not a follower of the Buddha.
And he turns to Queen Malika.
He says, this Buddha of yours, do you hear what he said?
That dear ones bring us pain and sorrow.
What do you have to say to that?
And she says, well, if the Buddha said it, it must be true.
And he says, everything he says, if the Buddha said it must be true,
get out of here, so he chases her out.
So she goes, sends a brahmin to see the Buddha.
Basically they say, what did you mean when you said that suffering comes from those who are dear?
And the word for dear here is related to the word for love, those who love.
And so here the Buddha gives some examples.
Once in this same Savatiya there was a woman whose mother died.
Owing to her mother's death, she went mad out of her mind.
And wander from street to street, crossroads to crossroads would say,
have you seen my mother? Have you seen my mother?
It's through this line of reasoning that maybe you understood how sorrow,
lamentation, pain, distress, and despair are born from one who is dear,
come springing from one who is dear.
And then there's a mother, a woman whose father died, his brother died,
her sister died, her son died, her daughter died, her husband died.
There's a man whose mother died, father died, brother died, sister, son, daughter, wife died.
And then the final one, once in the same Savatiya there was a wife who went to her relative's home.
Her relatives, having separated from her husband, wanted to give her to another against her will.
So she said to her husband, these relatives of mine, having separated us,
want me to give me to another against my will.
Whereupon he cut her in two and slashed himself open, thinking dead, we will be together.
It's through this line of reasoning that maybe you understood how sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair
are born from one who is dear, come springing from one who is dear.
So in other words, the people you love, you're going to be parted.
Parted from and you're just going to be suffering, and it can be extremely intense.
So this is one of the drawbacks of partiality.
Passage 29 is interesting because the different Buddhist traditions take it in a different direction.
From an inconceivable but beginning comes transmigration.
The beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.
A being who has not been your mother at one time in the past is not easy to find.
A being who has not been your father, your brother, your sister, your son, or your daughter at one time in the past is not easy to find.
Now notice in the Tibetan tradition they say you use this contemplation as a basis for good will.
In this tradition they say long you thus experience stress, experience pain, experience loss, swelling in the cemeteries,
enough to become disenchanted with all fabrications, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released.
The contemplation is that you have suffered a lot with all these beings over this time.
Because even if there was a good mother, brother, father, brother, etc., you suffered over the loss.
And as we all know that not every relationship with your father, brother, sister, or son, or daughter is a positive one.
So there is that suffering too.
And you think about it, this is an awful lot of suffering.
So this is a contemplation for developing Sangha.
The remaining passages are passages on how to deal with grief over the loss of a loved one.
Here Patajara, who has lost a son, recalls what the Buddha said to her.
You don't know the path of his coming or going, that being who has come from where, the one you lament as my son.
But when you know the path of his coming or going, you don't grieve after him, nor is that the nature, for that is the nature of beings.
In other words, his coming and going is just a normal part of things.
Unasked, he came from there without permission, he went from here, coming from where, having stayed a few days.
And coming one way from here, he goes yet another, from there.
Dying in the human form, he will go wandering on.
As he came, so he is gone.
So what is there to lament?
And that her response is pulling out completely out the arrow so hard to see, embedded in my heart.
He, the Buddha, expelled from me, overcome with grief the grief over my son.
Now today, with arrow removed, without hunger, entirely unbound,
to the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, I go for refuge to the sage.
Just thinking about the process of transmigration and wandering on,
you begin to see the difference between a stranger and a member of a family,
and between a member of a family and a stranger, gets smaller and smaller.
And this member of your family, you know, you didn't know where he came from, you don't know where he's going.
Just like two ships that pass in the night.
Here's another woman who lost her daughter.
Jeeva, my daughter, you cry in the woods, the Buddha is saying to this woman,
come to your senses, Uberi, 84,000 all named Jeeva have been buried in that channel of ground.
For which of them do you grieve?
Just think about how many people died.
So again, it's funny, the contemplation of the universality of loss
makes your individual loss a lot easier to bear.
So she had the same response.
Here's one word, Sarabhuta has died.
Now this passage I included partly because the Chinese has a version which really, I think,
slanders the Buddha.
In the Chinese version, the Buddha says, Sarabhuta died,
I didn't know which way it was north or south, I lost all my bearings,
and it showed that the Buddha had a humane side, I guess.
But in the Pali version, it's Ananda who loses his bearings,
and the Buddha who calls him back to his senses.
So they come to the Buddha and said,
just now, June the 9th was sent to me,
Venerable Sarabhuta has attained total unbinding,
here is robe and bowl, bowl and robes.
It was as if my body were drugged, I lost my bearings,
things went clear to me on hearing that Venerable Sarabhuta had attained total unbinding.
But in Ananda, the Buddha says, when he attained total unbinding,
did he take the aggregate of virtue along with him,
did he take the aggregate of concentration, discernment, release,
the agreement of knowledge and vision of release along with him?
In other words, the things that are really valuable in life,
has the death of that person removed us from life?
Well, no.
He says, no, Lord, it's just that he was my instructor and counselor,
one who exhorted, urged, roused and encouraged me.
He was tireless in teaching the Dharma,
and helped to his companions in the holy life.
We miss the nourishment of his Dharma,
the wealth of his Dharma, his help in the Dharma.
But Ananda Havana, I already told you,
the state of growing different with regard to all things,
dear and appealing, the state of becoming separate,
the state of becoming otherwise,
what else is there to expect?
It's impossible that one could forbid anything,
born, existent, fabricated and subject to disintegration,
from disintegrating.
Just as if the largest limb were to fall off of a great tree,
composed of hardwood, standing firm,
and the same as Sarabha,
which has attained total unbinding from this great community of monks,
composed of hardwood standing firm,
what else is there to expect?
It's impossible that one could forbid anything,
born, existent, fabricated and subject to disintegration,
from disintegrating.
And then the Buddha goes on to say,
you should remain with yourself as your island,
as your refuge by taking the Dharma,
of practicing mindfulness as your refuge and island.
What is ironic is that previous to that,
when Sarabha Buddha was still alive,
passage 33,
just now as I was withdrawn in seclusion,
this train of thought arose to my awareness.
Is there anything in the world whose change or alteration,
with whose change or alteration,
there were to arise within misar,
lamentation, pain, distress and despair?
Then the thought occurred to me,
there was no change or alteration,
there were to arise within me,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress and despair.
When this was said,
excuse me,
Venerable Nanda said,
Sarabha Buddha, my friend,
even if there were change and alteration in the teacher,
whether it arise within you,
no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress or despair,
and Sarabha Buddha agrees
that that would not be the case.
There would be no sorrow within him.
Still, I would have this thought.
And a great prowess has disappeared.
For the blessed one were to remain for a long time,
that would be for the benefit of many people,
for the happiness of many people,
out of simply for the world,
for the welfare, benefit and happiness of human and divine beings.
And this is the interesting part of the exchange.
Shirley said,
Venerable Nanda,
it's because Venerable Sarabha Buddha's
eye-making and mind-making and concede obsessions
have long been well uprooted,
that even if there were change
and alteration in the teacher,
within him no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress or despair.
Now it's interesting,
Nanda is equating grief with
your sense of eye.
It's my loss.
My sense of concede,
or that's making a sense of eye.
So when you have that sense of grief
impartiality to someone that you're missing,
you have to say,
what in me am I identifying with
that's causing me to feel this?
Because that's where the grief
can be rooted out,
by rooting out that sense of attachment
to that particular eye.
So even though we regard
love as a good thing,
it sets us up for a lot of sorrow.
And the way beyond that is to overcome
this sense of eye and mind around
the people that we love,
the sense of identification with the love.
Now this doesn't mean, of course, that we are
told to one another,
but just that sense of
particularity, that this is the person
on whom might happen, it depends.
That's setting you up for a suffering.
And that's what you've got to work on.
Any questions on that?
So I've heard it taught that
of course there is
physical suffering that
is required in some way
and then we don't add the second and third arrow.
And then there's still
the question of is there any mental
suffering that is required.
And sometimes I've heard it said that certain forms
of grief are going to happen anyway.
And then the task is again
not to add these additional arrows.
What would you say about that
relative to this sutta which implies
that grief, even that, disappears?
That's what it says, even that grief disappears.
Because that element of grief wherever it is
is there's going to be
an element of I in my making there
which is not necessary.
Yeah, that's what I was
catching on.
Then this additional statement
that he says he would make, oh what a great
being has disappeared.
There seems to be some sense of
concern there that
because the Buddha was helping so many beings
this is a loss in a sense
for the whole.
But that would not be called a form
of grief exactly. That's not really a form of grief.
It's just a statement of fact.
Yeah.
There was a
I was talking with Larry Rosenberg
one time. He was telling me how when he was in
Korea
the monks and the nuns there
kind of like classes, all the monks and nuns
who came to the monastery at the same time
had a sense of kind of it was their group.
There was this one elderly nun who passed away
one time and there was one monk who was still left
from her group who just really
started crying during the funeral.
And so Larry asked him about this.
You know, advanced beings
didn't cry. And the monk said it was just
I felt like she was my sister
and it's like losing a sister and we
practiced the Dharma together for so long.
It was just a natural response.
And years later
he went to see a John Suat
and he told the John Suat about this
and the John Suat said
that was a sign there was still something lacking
in his practice. And then he went on to talk
about how when he was a young monk
studying with a John Fun who was a student
of a John Mun
he kept thinking about what am I going to do
if anything happens to a John Fun. I'm going to be
totally lost. I'm sort of dependent
on him for his instructions and his kindness
and his encouragement.
And then by the time a John Fun finally did
die by that time a John Suat's practice was
much more advanced. It was more like
a loss for a lot of people
but he himself didn't feel any personal loss.
And what was interesting for me
was Larry's reaction to that. He didn't
like what a John Suat said.
It sounded heartless or maybe
in denial.
But I think
knowing a John Suat and he wasn't in denial
but there was part of us that feels
uncomfortable around people who don't feel grief.
A John Chai has an interesting
statement. He says
our hunts are like crazy people
except they're good crazy.
The remaining statements
we don't have much time so let me just give you a
quick.
First off
you develop
in passages 35 talks about how you
use these various qualities
goodwill, compassion, empathetic
joy, equanimity
as a basis for concentration.
And then it's followed up
by using
the four establishings of mindfulness as a
basis for concentration. This is a really
important passage by the way.
It shows that the Buddha doesn't draw a clear line
between mindfulness practice and concentration practice.
The establishings of mindfulness
are the topics of
John of practice.
However,
skip to passages 37
there's a case where monk enters
and remains a certain peaceful awareness release.
This would be any of the states of
concentration that come from the
Four Brahma Maharas as a topic of
concentration. It tends to the
cessation of self-identification.
That's sagaya.
But as he is attending to that cessation
of self-identification, his mind doesn't
leap up, grow confident, sat faster firm
in the cessation of self-identification.
For him the cessation
of self-identification is not to be expected.
In other words, you don't automatically
get that insight just by doing the
Four Brahma Maharas.
It gives the example of a man who
were to grasp a branch with his hand,
smeared with risen, his hand would stick
to it, grip it, adhere to it,
in the same way you're still holding on
to this practice of the Jhana
based on the Four Brahma Maharas.
However, if you
can get your mind to
leap, having done that, then
you get it to leap up at the idea
to leap up, grow confident,
step fast and firm in the cessation
of self-identification. Then
release will be something to be expected.
Similarly with ignorance for the next one.
So this is the
passage that shows that doing the
Brahma Maharas is not enough. There's
more that needs to come.
For the sake of awakening.
Pasha's
38 is the one where
Sarabhuta is talking to
Dhananjani.
As he's dying,
as Dhananjani is dying, and then
teaches him the way
going to the Brahma worlds by developing
the Brahma Maharas.
And then at the very end, the Buddha
chides him and says, why, Sarabhuta, when
there's still more to be done, having established
him in the inferior Brahma world, did you
get up from your seat and leave?
The thought occurred to me, Lord, these Brahmins
are set on the Brahma worlds. What if
I were to teach Dhananjani the Brahma in the path
to union with the Brahmins?
And the Buddha tells him, Sarabhuta, Dhananjani
the Brahma has died and reappeared in the Brahma world.
So he misses chance to get him to awakening.
So again this...
Similarly with passage 39,
this is how you instruct someone
Dhananjani
who's on his deathbed.
First, reminding them to gain confidence
in the Buddha, Dhamma, and the Sangha
and in their precepts.
Ask them if they're concerned with their wife and father,
their wife, excuse me, mother and father,
wife and children.
Make sure to remind them, okay, if
you feel concerned for your wife and children,
you're still going to die. If you don't
feel concerned for them, you're going to die.
It would be good if you abandoned concern for your wife and children.
And then you take them up
to the various levels of the heavens,
up to the Brahma world.
If you should say, my mind is raised above,
this is next to the last paragraph,
my mind is raised above the devil's
wielding power over the creations of others
and is set on the Brahma worlds, he should be told,
friend, even the Brahma world is in constant
and permanent sub-included in self-identity.
It would be good if having raised
the mind above the Brahma world, you brought it
to the cessation of identity.
If he should say, my mind is raised
above the Brahma worlds and is brought to the cessation
of identity, then I tell you Mahanama,
there is no difference in terms of
release between the release of that lay follower
whose mind is released and the release
of a monk whose mind is released.
It can happen at death that you actually
attain the waking.
But not if you get stuck on the Brahma worlds.
It passes four day talks about
developing concentration out of these
four Brahma vaharas.
And if you die within that attainment,
then if you are a noble one,
you don't have to return from it,
but if you are not a noble one,
you fall back down again.
41 and 42 talk about
how to develop discernment
based on concentration.
Let's look at
42.
Okay, you've got this awareness,
fabricated and intended.
That's how you contemplate it.
You look at this in terms of the fabrications.
And we've talked all along that this is what you've got to do.
You've got to fabricate these states.
And as you get more and more used to it,
your conscious sense that they are fabricated
begins to fall away because they come
so much more easily.
And then once you've got them really solidly there,
then you have to go back and remind yourself
this is fabricated. It's still dependent on conditions.
If I want an unconditioned happiness,
I have to go beyond this.
So again, there has to be some insight
into the process of fabrication.
And it's easier if you are conscious
of the fabrication that gets you there.
And it goes on to say,
whatever is fabricated and intended
is a constant subject to cessation.
Holding that perception in mind,
staying right there, you may reach
the ending of the affluence. In other words, become an Arahant.
Or if not, then through this very
Dhamma-passion, this Dhamma-delight,
in other words, you have a taste
of the deathless and you immediately latch
onto it.
There's a sense of identification that gets
built up around that.
This is one of the reasons why we have to say
that even the unconditioned is not self,
so that you can peel your
attachment away from that.
Through this very Dhamma-passion, Dhamma-delight,
and from the total wasting away of the first five fetters,
you are due to be reborn in the purebodes.
There to be totally unbound,
never again to retain from that world.
That can be done either with good will
or compassion or empathetic joy
or equanimity as your topic of
concentration.
So, Rao wrote it to you
through the last passages.
Thank you.
Can you clarify a small confusion?
In
40 something, there was the reference
to the cessation of identity.
Is that the same as released from the
fetter of conceit?
The conceit that I am?
No, it's actually the release
from
identity.
There's a hand back here.
Hand over here.
You're going through these fairly quickly
in the end, and I did notice there was
one point at which you did mention
Sambhwaga.
I had never thought of that in terms
of cultivating the Brahma-Baharas,
but are they included?
Yes, Sambhwaga is great
for equanimity.
This is what the human condition is like.
Especially when you're dealing with feelings
of being partial towards a particular
person and seeing that person suffer.
Sambhwaga can help pull you out
of that intense personal
pain that you feel over that.
So, is Sambhwaga
akin to equanimity?
It can be used as a help to equanimity,
yes.
If it's not balanced with basada
or a sense of confidence that there's a way
out, it can get very depressing, so you've got
to balance those two.
There's a question back here.
Could you clarify
what
developing equanimity
towards a person looks like?
I think I have a sense of equanimity,
but I'm not sure if I know the practicality.
Okay, suppose you've got a family member
lying sick in bed
and you've done
everything you can for them, and they're
still sick in bed there.
You say, I can't let myself get worked up over
this, because it's not going to help
them.
One of the monks at the monastery, his father
was dying, and the grandmother was in the room
sobbing and sobbing and sobbing, and he said,
can you please get her out of the room? This is not helping the father.
So he said, okay,
what can I do right now
to help this person? A lot of things I'd like
to see the person get out from bed and be able
to walk around and be healthy again, but it's not
going to happen.
So you have to be equanimous to that fact.
Okay, I'm not going to let my mind get
worked up over that.
And they said, okay, given that, what can I do?
So that would be what equanimity would be.
And we have
lots of cases like this now with the media.
I mean, you see all this suffering from all over the world.
And part of you
says, gosh, you'll be horrible if I've just turned
my heart away from that.
But if you leave your heart open
to all of that, then you get debilitated.
You get
so depressed and you can't do anything.
You say, okay, this is not helping.
I've got to be able to focus my energy
where I can make a difference.
And develop equanimity
for everybody else.
Yes?
When you go
through the whole of this
just to
get the concentration,
mindfulness,
equanimity,
and empathy, everything,
you have to be in the Brahma Vihara.
You have to be what?
In the Brahma Vihara.
You're working toward having a Brahma Vihara
by developing these qualities.
But at the end stage
when you're going to be in the death stage,
you are going to
be
detaching completely from this
Brahma Vihara.
Brahma Viharas are not awakening.
You try to let go of
even whatever sense of identity
that there might be within those states.
But as in any form of concentration
this gives you a foundation
for looking at where in the mind
am I still holding on?
Where in the mind am I still
trying to fabricate something
to gain a higher level of happiness?
These are very refined levels
of fabricating happiness
and then protecting that happiness.
You usually use the equanimity
to protect that happiness.
Is that quite reliable?
And that's why he says
you look at it and see this too
is fabricated and intended
and you incline your mind
to something deathless.
But it doesn't die.
Can you hear me?
Concentration seems to be
a great problem nowadays.
Concentrating on things
and some people
tend to lose it
a lot more than they never get it.
And I had a lot of it
I think I'm losing it.
So what's your best advice
to get back into it
or make it better?
Get the book with each and every breath
and look at the breath
and meditation instructions there.
And then you can compare
the way you're concentrating
you can compare that
and see what you're missing
in your practice.
Thank you.
There are lots of copies over on the table over there.
You got a question here?
So in a room where somebody is dying
would the person who is dying
be the trump card?
What do you think of most?
Like you said, the monk saw
this is not helping.
You mean the person who is dying, right?
For the time being this person
is going through a lot more right now.
You have a big determining effect
on where they're going to go.
Did I lose you
when I raced through all those passages?
Yes, question.
Aja, may I ask you a question
about karma?
Earlier
in the morning you had a metaphor
about a field, a different sea
sprouting.
Given that we don't know
where we'll end up, right?
Tomorrow we could be homeless
and we'll have you next lifetime.
We can make
our best effort now
but I feel almost a little overwhelmed
with the thought that
even though I'm doing the best that I can
or I'm making an effort
God knows what mind state
am I going to have in the next lifetime.
Well the best you can do is the best you can do.
And so you say
well I don't know
the particulars of where I'm going to be
or where I'm going to end up
but I do know that I will need more mindfulness
and I'll need more discernment.
Those are things I can work on now.
I think for me it's a little scary
because when I was brought up
I had almost aversion to
Buddhism.
Even though I'm Chinese
I have aversion to Buddhism.
I'm thinking boy, in the next lifetime
none of these habits
sticks.
These skillful habits
you try to develop.
Just remind yourself the good things are never lost.
So they may not come
exactly when you want them but they're there.
The more good energy you put into things
the better the energy you're going to get out.
So I have confidence in that.
That's what balances the Sanghwega when you see
oh my gosh this is huge and anything can happen.
Okay there is a path out
there is a
people, reliable people
have been following this path
and they all say it really works.
So keep that thought in mind.
And the other thought the Buddha has
you keep in mind is they can do it
they were human beings, I'm a human being
why can't I?
Keep that thought in mind.
Yes.
I'm just trying to remember
I thought there was a
Suta where the Buddha
sort of lamented the loss of
Saraputa.
That's in the Chinese canon.
Is that only in the Chinese?
Right.
Okay.
It also seems like
if you do lose somebody close to you
there is a natural
sadness that doesn't have to be
suffering.
Obviously
my father passed away
it wasn't
I mean I see there is the connection
my father
but
you don't have to necessarily suffer
it's like
storm clouds come and go
to some extent
there is going to be some natural
sorrow but you don't have to suffer over it
no?
Well the sorrow doesn't have to be there
it's an interesting thing.
I think in my own case having lived around
a lot of the forest of Johns
and seeing them dealing with the death of a teacher
the death of a student
and it's just
a matter of fact.
I guess my experience was
my father did die
a couple years ago
and they had a service form
in the Episcopal Church
and at the end of the service
they had some happy song
that they wanted to play
that they did play
that was kind of like now he's going to be in heaven
or whatever
and not believing in that
myself
I kind of felt that that song was really
inappropriate for how I felt
and I wasn't overwhelmed
with grief but I was definitely
it just was not how I felt
and I couldn't really get behind that
choice.
Well you're facing with the inevitability
that it's not something you celebrate
I mean even in Thailand
where they tend to be pretty equanimous in the funerals
the funerals are a lot less grief
stick than they are in the States
still they don't play happy songs.
Thanks
that makes me feel better.
Yes
I can
give a
testimony and thanks
to the practice because
when my father died
in gosh when was that 99
he was very similar to what you describe
with the monk he was very easy for me
to accept that this is his time
it wasn't so easy for other members
of the family
but it was very clear with him
and also when my mother died
Cheryl and I were both there
and some of my siblings
and it seemed like the ones that could accept
that this is their time were there
and the ones that couldn't weren't
what was more difficult was
dealing with the family afterwards
but nonetheless I was there for them
and I feel very grateful
for that
practice was a huge part
of that experience
and that was a long time ago
I meditated for quite a while
before then but not so much
in this tradition
and it was very moving
still very touching
It says in the
rewards for the prom of ours
that
one is dear to human beings
and so
doesn't mean then that you're causing them to suffer
if
being dear or feeling dear
actually causes attachment and suffering
The attachment is their business
It's not that you go around being nasty to people
so they don't get attached to you
but
you can be dear to them and they can
deal with you in a way that's not so attached
that's their skill or lack of skill
but in terms of the reward
that comes to you
they're less likely to do nasty things
John Lee was going to be making some amulets
The Buddhist year
2500 was in 1957
and so there were lots of celebrations going on
all over Thailand so he decided to have a celebration
at his monastery
and they made amulets to hand out
and the question was what kind of amulets are they going to make
and in Thailand they have several kinds
there's ones that will protect you
by just creating this
field force around you that protects you
from bullets or dangers and everything
then the metta amulets will make
people like you
and so he decided
how about the best protective amulet is one
where you spread metta
people are going to like you, they're not going to kill you
so it's protection against
developing animosity basically
is what we're talking about
if you have good will for other beings
it's much less likely for them to develop animosity
for you
Thank you
Everybody content?
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you for your attention.
