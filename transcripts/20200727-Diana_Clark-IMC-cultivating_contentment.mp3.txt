Good evening again. 
I'm smiling. 
I'm always smiling when I start this. 
It's a. 
. 
. 
Maybe I shouldn't say I'm always smiling. 
I don't know if that's true, but I'm happy to be sharing the Dharma in this way and to be meditating together and to see your chats, even though I'm here in the room alone, to recognize that we're practicing together. 
And tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about contentment. 
When we meditate, there might be moments, maybe really short, fleeting, maybe a little bit longer, in which we don't feel a need that we have to change things, we don't have to alter things, we don't have to express something, we don't have to run away from something, or we don't have to invest some special meaning to a particular experience. 
Instead, we can just let them be what they are. 
Because we have a certain amount of contentment. 
We have a certain amount of feeling like, okay, things are okay. 
Doesn't mean they match our preferences exactly. 
Doesn't mean that's just what we always wanted, but without we don't have a strong feeling that things have to be differently. 
Instead, there's a sense of feeling of satisfaction, not feeling dissatisfied, or that things don't need to change. 
Our immediate experience doesn't need to change. 
If we think about it, of course we can think of all the things that need to change. 
But that right, that very particular moment, for example, feeling the pressure against the chair or the cushion against the body, that moment when we notice that, we notice, oh, it doesn't need to change. 
Maybe it's a neutral feeling. 
And tapping into that, that things don't need to change. 
They don't need to be different. 
Have some contentment about some satisfaction with the way things are. 
It's associated with being settled without the agitation of leaning forward, always wanting more, I want more, I want more. 
That feeling of dissatisfaction, contentment is when that has been quieted and maybe even gone away. 
And sometimes this agitation that we feel with always wanting something to settle, and sometimes it's really obvious. 
When you have this really strong craving and you are willing to go through great measures in order to satisfy, that might be an agitating feeling, agitating the sense of it's not settled. 
And usually when we have those types of agitated feelings, it's not when we have access to our greatest wisdom. 
Instead it's when we're trying to get to what we want. 
But in the same way of agitation being subtle or obvious, the contentment might be subtle or obvious. 
Maybe there's a mixture of experiences and maybe the contentment is only a portion of it or a small sliver of our experience. 
But it's easy to be dismissive because contentment isn't flashy, it doesn't sound so compelling or it's not impressive necessarily. 
We might think like, no, actually a source of lasting happiness is if I go get that object if I buy this thing, if I have this experience. 
Not recognizing that actually some contentment can be a source of happiness, of some real happiness. 
So happiness is often talked about associated with getting what one wants. 
This is what Madison Avenue wants to convince us that huge advertising industry is trying to convince us you'll be happy as soon as you acquire this whatever it might be. 
Whereas contentment is more associated with not wanting in the first place. 
Because have you ever noticed, let's say this, I've certainly noticed. 
If I have pizza, I love pizza, I eat pizza, I feel satisfied. 
Then I want pizza again. 
It's not like it ever ends. 
There's not going to be any particular ending. 
There might be a moment of satisfaction, but a person is hungry again soon enough. 
Whereas cultivating a sense of contentment is a little bit more steady, not quite as fleeting. 
And it's associated with more a shift in perspective. 
So as I was saying, not so much that we have exactly what we want, but our being okay with what's there, with what we are already experiencing. 
And if you've been meditating, you probably recognize that what we can change, what we can influence is our perspective, our views. 
The stance that we take towards an experience, we can't acquire everything we ever wanted. 
That's not under our control. 
But we can't be influential with our perspective. 
And so contentment, rather than getting a bazillion dollars, is more about not feeling like you need a bazillion dollars, but still feeling okay, feeling that sense of wealth. 
And there's a quote from the Dhammapada, a really popular collection of verses that goes like this. 
Freedom from illness is the foremost good fortune. 
Contentment is the foremost wealth. 
Trust is the foremost kinship. 
Nibbana, that is freedom awakening. 
Nibbana is the foremost happiness. 
So this recognition that contentment, to have contentment is a great wealth. 
It's a treasure. 
So I want to emphasize that contentment is not complacency. 
It's not putting up with tolerating like, okay, well, I guess this is all I can get. 
It's all that's available for me and just having a certain amount of resignation or passively accepting everything as it is. 
It's not what contentment is. 
It's not a disappointment kind of with a smiley face on top of it. 
Instead, it's the feeling like tapping into, I use this expression, tapping into, feeling into, yeah, okay, there are some things that are all right and not being dismissive of them and not being a Pollyanna and saying there aren't difficulties that are also arising. 
So contentment can feel like a booby prize, like something that, okay, I guess I have to settle quote unquote for contentment. 
If we're always striving for this bubbly kind of happiness, if this type of happy birthday type of happiness, or something that is feeling really energetic and effervescent, so contentment might feel like a booby prize. 
Or if we're filled with greed and craving and we need to get something, then contentment might feel like horrifying because we won't be able to get that thing that's going to be a source of lasting happiness, we're so convinced of it. 
Or if we're accustomed to grumbling and complaining and that's somehow of how we connect with other people through this kind of mutual, this outrage or a feeling of self-righteousness to have a sense of contentment can feel somehow like a failure maybe, or if the way that we're identified is that things are not right and we have to complain about them. 
Or often if we are filled towards aversion, towards others, angry at them, or have some ill will or hostility towards others, contentment can feel like a booby prize, or it can feel like we're letting people get away with something. 
If we have a sense of contentment, our feeling agitated is a way that somehow, in some kind of way of thinking, somehow allows them to feel the, I don't know, the dissatisfaction of whatever it is that they did. 
So we can learn something about ourselves if we query a gentle inquiry or we investigate. 
If we have any aversion, any resistance to this idea of contentment, this quiet sense of satisfaction, things are okay. 
I don't need more. 
I don't need more right now. 
I have all that I need. 
The thing is truly lacking at this moment. 
Again, I'm not saying that there aren't difficulties or that there aren't injustices or things like this, but this precise moment, as I said in the Guide to Meditation, I'm breathing. 
I'm not in imminent danger. 
I have enough food in my belly. 
These types of things. 
In this way, things are okay. 
If we're under the enchantment of craving, then that, which, let's be honest, is pretty common for many of us to have this feeling like, oh, I just need this and I need that. 
And it certainly is promoted in our society and is certainly encouraged, I would even say. 
But when we have this sense of craving, what we want, in some kind of way, it feels like it's sprinkled with fairy dust. 
Like, okay, this thing has some, at this moment, feels like it has some kind of magical quality that it's either like cast a spell on us that we think that, yes, okay, this will make us happy. 
I know it. 
I just need this thing or experience or whatever it might be. 
But these cravings, this sense that we need to have something else, arises from this sense of this feeling of insufficiency. 
I'm not enough. 
I don't have enough. 
I need more. 
And this is suffering. 
What's fueling, not feeling contentment is suffering. 
So contentment is a type of not suffering. 
And to not be dominated, not to be controlled, not to be pushed around by this feeling that I need to have more is a type of freedom. 
And in this way, contentment is a type of freedom in that there's an openness, a spaciousness allowing for the way things are. 
Not insisting that things be different, that we have to have something else. 
So whether it's during meditation or in daily life, we can ask ourselves, just very briefly, we can ask ourselves, what in this moment is truly lacking? Truly. 
What do we believe we need? Can we do with less? Do we really need all of that? Do we really need it right now? Can we do with less? What do we truly need? What is truly lacking? And can we also maybe honor our commitments to non-harming? We don't want to harm ourselves. 
We don't want to harm others. 
Sometimes craving can create the foundation, create a basis in which there might be some harming. 
And I'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment. 
Before I do, I want to say that recognizing that we really want something and that we have craving, that we really find ourselves leaning forward, is not a personal failing. 
It's part of the human experience. 
In fact, some evolutionary biologists would say that, you know, evolutionarily speaking, it has some benefits in terms of that those people that were looking for better conditions, better food, better protection from danger, are the ones that survived and passed on their genes. 
So of course we kind of inherited this feeling like, well, maybe there's something even a little bit better out there. 
So I don't want us to feel like, okay, if there's this feeling like I need something more, is a failure. 
But instead I'm inviting the opportunity or the reflection for us to apply a little bit of mindfulness, some attention, some awareness to that experience. 
And see if we can dial it down, dial it back, this feeling that things are lacking and I need to have more. 
And instead can we incline the mind towards what's okay. 
And incline the mind towards some contentment. 
So not only to help us alleviate some of this suffering, but contentment in some ways can be a foundational practice that can support this discovery of greater and greater freedom. 
Some of you may know that a common way to describe the Buddhist path to awakening is with the Eightfold Path, or sometimes it's summarized as to have three trainings. 
The trainings in ethics, the trainings in meditation or mental development, and the training in wisdom. 
Sila, ethics, samadhi, meditation, panya, wisdom. 
So contentment can really support all three of these limbs of practice, these three aspects of practice. 
We need all three to find the greatest peace and happiness. 
But if we think about the relationship between contentment and ethics, imagine how a person's ethics would be if they had a feeling of contentment. 
If the person was feeling like, I have enough, how would their ethics be? Chances are that they would behave in an ethical manner in a way that doesn't harm others, in a way that doesn't harm themselves. 
For those of you who are familiar with the five precepts, these are ethical guidelines, training rules, that one of them is to not take that which is not given. 
But if you have a sense of contentment, of course you wouldn't do that. 
Another precept is to honor the commitments that people have between each other and other people and not to do sexual misconduct, not to jeopardize or not to respect those commitments. 
But if you have a sense of contentment, you wouldn't do that. 
And it might be if we think about it as sense of contentment, you wouldn't kill living beings, you wouldn't lie. 
And you wouldn't have a feeling of wanting to get intoxicated. 
So in some ways we might see how this contentment can be a real foundational practice for ethics. 
And for contentment also can really support meditation in the sense that this contentment, that is not being content, is often associated with thoughts about what we used to have in the past, or what we want to have in the future, or what other people have. 
But a sense of contentment is more about bringing the attention back here to the present moment and to see what's truly lacking in this moment, in this moment. 
So rather than being lost in thoughts about what others have, or what we used to have, or what we want to have, practicing with contentment, having familiarity with that helps us to be here in the present moment. 
And it also promotes a sense of being settled. 
Being settled with not having the agitation of always wanting more. 
And so in this way the mind is less fragmented trying to find something more. 
And instead it can be a little bit more collected, and a sense of wholeness and steadiness. 
And also it's recognition that contentment is a certain type of happiness. 
It's not the bubbly happiness, but it is a sense of maybe ease, comfort, an absence of a certain type of agitation. 
And happiness and comfort and ease are great support for concentration. 
This real settledness and a real collectedness. 
So contentment in this way supports happiness which supports concentration, as well as supporting concentration directly. 
And then for the third training, the training in wisdom, if we are investigating, exploring our relationship to even the whole idea of being content, or where we can find contentment, where does it show up in our meditation? Where does it show up in our daily life? If we're doing this inquiry, what it throws into highlight, all the ways in which there is discontentment, all the ways in which there is dissatisfaction, that might become really obvious when we start to initially investigate. 
Like, where is it okay? Maybe we first see where it's not okay. 
This discontentment is dukkha, dissatisfaction, stress, not feeling like things are quite right, like things need to be different somehow. 
I think many of you know that our relationship to dukkha, suffering, difficulties, dissatisfaction, our relationship to that, our experience to it is a foundational teaching, a foundational practice, and the Buddhist path to awakening. 
The Buddha said that the first noble truth is there is suffering, kind of recognizing that there is dissatisfaction, discontentment. 
And he also said that, of course, there is the absence of suffering, and it's possible to be without that. 
So contentment can be a way in which it can help us to explore the four noble truths, for those of you who are familiar with that, the truth of suffering, the truth of the arising of suffering, it could be one way to translate the second, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering. 
So practicing with contentment can be a way in to practicing with suffering. 
It's kind of like looking at it on the other side. 
And also to address that we shouldn't be content with our suffering. 
But that's not the teaching here, is that we should just notice that things, that there is suffering and then be content with that. 
So part of the practice is to notice how and to have a wise relationship with contentment and with discontentment. 
When is it time to take actions, to make adjustments, to make changes? And when is it time to cultivate contentment? So without cultivating being a malcontent. 
So it's a balance to notice the suffering and to notice the absence of suffering. 
Again, recognizing that there's a spectrum, suffering is a big giant spectrum and contentment is a giant spectrum. 
And noticing the shift between these two different poles. 
So there's a number of practices we can do to help us cultivate contentment and to develop and to notice it. 
And to support this shift in perspective. 
Away from things are terrible and I need something more. 
Away from that towards. 
. 
. 
I guess in this moment I'm not truly lacking anything and I can tap into that and allow that experience to support me. 
Allow that experience to support some wisdom to arise. 
So one practice would be to explore when you feel the least content. 
Might be when you're in a hurry. 
Might be in the midst of when you're in a spending spree, shopping spree. 
Whether it's online or in person. 
You might notice the agitation that goes with that. 
Might be when you're on the internet and you're searching, searching, searching. 
There's a certain type of agitation like, okay, there's going to be something here that's going to make me feel better or is going to scratch that itch in some kind of way if I just click on this and then I click on that. 
So this one practice is just to notice when you feel the least amount of contentment. 
That can help provide some clues about how to cultivate contentment. 
Another way of course is to meditate, to have a meditation practice. 
Sometimes when we just sit down and notice that we're okay, we're going to bring our attention to the sensations of breathing, for example. 
That activity alone interrupts the train, the power of the craving, of that desire for something else, and might be a way in which we can halt the train of the movement of craving wanting more. 
But also meditation, especially mindfulness meditation, can help us learn about our desires. 
The more that we meditate, the more we might learn about them and gain some ease or some recognition, like, oh yeah. 
When I'm searching on the internet for something, I often also start thinking about food. 
And we just might make this connection or we might notice when we're sitting, we might notice, yeah, I have a lot of desire, a lot of craving. 
And it feels like I can feel it in my bodily experience and my posture leaning forward. 
These are just examples I'm making up, but all of you might find your own way in which meditation can help increase your sensitivity to which you can notice. 
I want to step back from the desires and let the contraction that comes from really wanting something, allowing that to relax. 
Something else that we might do to support a sense of contentment is a practice that's not specifically Buddhist, but a practice that can really support a sense of happiness in so many different ways. 
And that is a gratitude practice. 
It is on a regular basis to notice what we have appreciation for, what we have gratitude for. 
And I'll say for me personally, when I started that practice, just at the end of the day to jot down three things I was grateful for, it really highlighted for me all the wonderful things that I have in my life that somehow I wasn't really appreciating that I was dismissive of or not really valuing. 
But then when I sat down to really think about what am I grateful for, I realized how valuable they were and a sense of contentment started to grow. 
There's a number of different ways in which we can practice gratitude. 
But also just recognizing that often we feel better, I'll use this generic language better when things are simpler, that often more, more, more doesn't lead to greater, greater, greater happiness. 
We've probably learned that lesson in our life in some form, at some time. 
So is there a way in which we can remind ourselves of that lesson and help support a sense of contentment, recognizing that getting more doesn't necessarily mean we're going to be happier. 
And then this way, the more contentment that we can cultivate and develop and tune into, the more we're able to show up in the world without craving, without demanding that the world give us something. 
Instead, we're freer to give others. 
And in that way, we conserve the world in a way that honors ourselves and honors others, not because it's coming out of a sense of need, but out of a sense of generosity. 
So again, may our practice together be for the benefit of all beings everywhere. 
All beings without exception. 
Thank you.
