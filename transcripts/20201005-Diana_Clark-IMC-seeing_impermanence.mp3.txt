Good evening again.
So tonight I want to build a little bit on what I talked about in the guided
meditation, that is the changing nature of our experiences.
I'll start here that in the biography of the Buddha, such as it is, there isn't
like one concise autobiography. Instead the Buddha used a little bit of his
biographical details to make a point. So he didn't tell his life story in order to
tell his life story, he just used it as examples to help support his teaching.
So some of the passages that are preserved are that the tradition holds.
Of course we don't know the veracity of these things, but the tradition holds
that there's some stories around the first students of the Buddha. Of course
there wouldn't be any Buddhism unless there were some students who heard the
teachings and preserved them. And if you know the story of the Buddha's awakening
you know that he practiced with these five ascetics doing some extreme self-mortification
or asceticism and to the point of starvation. And the Buddha discovered
that didn't work and he went off a different direction. And then after he
became awakened he wanted to teach them. He wanted to find those group of five
ascetics again and to share with them what he had discovered, what had helped
him become awakened. And of those five ascetics one of them became awakened.
It's the first touch of awakening or first experience of awakening
when hearing the Buddha teach. His name was Kundanya. And right after his
Kundanya's awakening experience he exclaims whatever is subject to arising
is subject to cessation. Whatever arises passes away. So he had, this is
like the first thing that he said after he had this awakening experience. So
clearly there's some importance there about seeing the arising and passing
away. And then interestingly, so after teaching the five ascetics, interestingly
the Buddha then teaches Yasa, who is like the exact opposite of the five
ascetics. He's a rich merchant and living a very opulent lifestyle. And
conditions are such that he and the Buddha's paths cross. The Buddha gives
him some teachings. Yasa, just like the Kundanya and the other ascetics, has
some awakening experience. And he exclaims the same thing. Whatever is
subject to arising is subject to cessation. So clearly there's something
about seeing this arising and passing. And another pointer to the importance
of seeing the arising and passing is in the Satipatana Sutta. Some of you may
be familiar that this is the primary discourse, this is the primary teaching
of the Buddha, where creating the foundations for mindfulness are discussed
or taught or shared. It's kind of a long sutta, long discourse that has a
number of different practices in there. But there's a refrain. There's kind
of like the chorus, you might think, that gets repeated after each new
instruction. And in this refrain, in this chorus, gets repeated, I believe
13 times in this sutta, is the instruction to notice the nature of
arising and passing away. So it's more like the nature of arising and passing
away. So this includes that we can notice that maybe we don't have to be
mindful of every precise moment of when something arises or the precise moment
when something passes away. But we can notice, oh yeah, this was in here a
minute ago. Or wait, this is here, what happened to that? So there can be a
little bit of a retrospective analysis, this recognition that things are
arising and passing, even if we're not noticing the exact precise moment when
a particular phenomenon has arisen or passed away. But the instructions are
to notice that they have the nature to arise and pass away. So of course,
if you've been in the Buddhist scene for a while, you'll know that I'm talking
about impermanence and nature. And generally when we think of impermanence,
or often I should say, we focus on the challenging aspect of it. That is that
we're up to lose those things that are important to us and that are dear to
us. Or maybe when we think about things that are impermanent, it implies that
they're all going to end at some time. But there also are some real benefits
that can arise from when we see the arising and passing away, when we see
the impermanent nature of things. And sometimes we might overlook this
positive side of seeing things. And one benefit, of course, is that it puts
things in perspective. I know for me, when my father died, it put a lot of
things in perspective, kind of like my priority shifted, the way that I thought
about things shifted. And if you've had somebody in your lifetime, maybe you've
had the same experience. So recognizing that the impermanent nature of
things can really help us appreciate what we do have. And also it can be
a wake-up call for us to think about our priorities and maybe to articulate
maybe a little bit more clearly what's important to us. And the Buddha knew
about this when he was talking to a king. He gave this simile. And talking to a
king, he's not going to give the usual Dharma talk that you should meditate a
lot and practice renunciation, right? That's a king isn't going to do that.
Instead, he gives this simile. What do you think? If a person were to come to
you from the east and say, great king, you should know this, I am coming from
the east and there I saw a great mountain. High is the clouds coming this
way. It's crushing all living beings in its path. So do whatever you think should
be done, great king. And then another messenger comes from the south. And then
another messenger comes from the west. And then another messenger comes from
the north. All of them are saying there is this great mountain. High is the
clouds coming this way, crushing all living beings. And then the Buddha
asks the king, so what would you do if you received these four different
messengers that were saying this? And the king replies, if such a great peril
should arise, such a terrible destruction of human life, what else should be
done but to live by the Dharma and to do wholesome deeds? This is very different
for a king whose commentary says that he had, before receiving this teaching from
the Buddha, was just sentencing some criminals and was doing something that
was not usually what we think of as wholesome deeds and living by according
to the Dharma. So even this king recognized that of course these great
mountains are death or time, some way we might understand it. So in this way
that recognizing impermanence and other benefit might be that of course it allows
growth and development to happen. If everything was perfectly static, there
would be no ability to practice and to gain some skills and learn and gain
some expertise and on some level this seems so obvious and maybe it shouldn't
even be stated, but it's fundamental to human growth, this quality of
impermanence. But maybe one more thing that I'll say here is about a benefit
is that the things that things change prevents things from becoming stultifying
or static or we might feel like that we want some security, we want some
stability, we want things to just quietly settle down and to be stable.
But we often might also discover that when we do manage to find some temporary
security or some steadiness or some stability, before too long that very
security might become claustrophobic or kind of a prison or stultifying,
stifling and then we might all of a sudden be desperate to escape from
if things were always the same, always the same. So it brings some freshness
and it brings some energy or some dynamism into our life and to our
experience. But maybe the greatest benefit arises from seeing impermanence,
seeing anicha on deeper and deeper levels. Some great wisdom kind of
arise. So what does this mean to see impermanence on deeper and deeper
levels? I can say that what I was just talking about is what we might see
in our daily life certainly doesn't require any meditation practice and
certainly isn't unique to Buddhism to recognize the changing nature of our
experience. But just as Kondanya and Yasa, the first students of the Buddha,
first followers, if we sit with our experience and we begin to examine it,
what we start to see is not just the content of our experience, the agitation
or the settledness or maybe the sadness or the excitement or maybe the longing
or love, happiness, all these things that flow through our experience.
Not only do we start to see the content, the details, but we also start to
see the underlying quality as I was talking about with the instructions
with the Satipatana Sutta. So if we rest in the space of awareness that
knows the play of experience, but we're not lost in our experience or we're
not always reactive to it that instead of the I like this, I don't like that
or I need more of this, I need less of that, not because that's wrong
particularly, but because that's not where freedom lies. Instead we're just
getting pushed around as the things are changing. And it also puts us at odds
with the way things are. If we're always trying, like I want more of this
or I don't want any more of this. Because the way things are, if you pay
attention right, and is that they're rising and passing away. So our
experience can be like a river of experience of things that are moving
through as opposed to like grabbing on and pushing it away or maybe like
pulling it closer. We can see this like a flow of experiences. So often we
can see that in daily life. Maybe we can see that in our meditation. But also
in our meditation practice, we might start to notice when things arise. We
might, when we're doing with the Satipatana Sutta, the discourse on the
establishing of mindfulness, the instructions to notice the arising and
to notice the passing and both arising and passing. It's very common that in
the beginning what's most predominant is just to notice what's new, what's
fresh. Like, oh, that pain in my knee just grabs our attention and becomes
compelling. And part of the reason why it becomes compelling is because it's
new. It's just a reason. It's compelling because it's uncomfortable too, but
the new things tend to grab our attention in the same way that when we
open up our awareness to the pain, attention to the experience of sounds.
It's like the new sounds that we see are the ones that grab our attention.
And we just, at the beginning of practice, we just tend to avoid or simply
not notice the endings of things. Away things are passing away. Yes, sure,
things are arising, but of course things are passing away also. And they just
don't escape our notice. Like, it's a little bit of out of sight, out of mind.
Or we're so busy with what's new and maybe a distraction that we don't even
notice the endings. And maybe even with the present moment, or I'm sorry,
with in daily life, some of the experiences that we might notice with
impermanence, we might think, well, okay, yeah, driving my car. I see that I'm
doing all these different experiences. They're all changing. The visual field
is changing, but that mountain over there isn't changing. But of course, I mean,
if we think about it, right, every time any being, any creature, any person
walks on the mountain, the dirt, the gravel, it's only going one way, right?
It's going down, downhill with gravity. So of course, there's a way in which
mountains are also kind of like ending also. So even those things that might
feel really stable and don't catch our attention because they're not arising,
but we might not even think that they're ending, that they're ceasing.
So we can, as part of our meditation practice, to counter this unbalanced
view of where we're only seeing the beginnings of things, we can intentionally
set the intention to also see the endings, to see the passing away.
And we might not see that precise moment when it's passing away, but we can see
maybe just like a few moments later, oh yeah, it's no longer there.
Kind of with a little bit of memory, just notice this kind of retrospective, oh yeah,
this used to be here, and it's no longer here.
And then as the mind starts to settle and get even more quiet, perhaps being on a
retreat, perhaps having experienced some concentration, we notice something else
as our recognition of impermanence gets even deeper.
And we might notice that things are in constant, as well as being impermanent.
I understand impermanent as meaning things are going to end, but we could say
in constant, this means that they're not steady, that there's a flashing in and
out of experience, there's a fluttering, there's a flickering.
And so with a really steady mind, we can start to see this, how things are arising
and passing and arising and passing, that there's nothing as solid as it might seem
with the ordinary, nonmeditative mind.
And this word, anicca, which often gets translated as impermanent, could just as
well be translated as inconstant.
So to see the lack of stability or the lack of steadiness and all of our experiences
and in some way we could also understand that all objects we could classify as
experiences, because how would we know there's an object unless it was being
experienced, like either through the visual eye, through the visual field,
or maybe it's experienced as a thought or it's an idea.
So sometimes what I'm pointing to might be a little bit more obvious when we're
not meditating or maybe at the beginning of when we're still getting settled with
pain.
There might be a way in which the encouragement when there's some uncomfortable
feelings, uncomfortable bodily sensations to bring our attention to them,
we can see that and bring our attention to them and to notice is it stabbing,
is it throbbing, is it cold, maybe it's hot.
And exactly where is it, is the area in which those experiences are arising,
is it getting bigger, is it getting smaller, or does it have really precise
boundaries, and we might notice as we do that inquiry, as we look into this
experience of pain, it's not so easy.
Maybe what at first experience seems like it's this really dull, throbbing
sensation when we really rest our awareness there, when we have a little
bit of inquiry, we realize, oh, it's not as solid.
There are some areas of the body that aren't throbbing right there and maybe
some areas that are, and maybe it's not quite so clear exactly the circumference,
the perimeter of where that experience is.
So when we try to pinpoint it with some real precision, it might seem kind of
slippery, like, oh, it's here, oh no, it's over there, or it feels like this,
but wait, it's like that.
So as our mind starts to settle, we start to see that actually all of our
experiences are like that, that there's some flickering or flashing, or maybe
even pixelated, or some kind of not the solid and stable way that things are
experienced with our ordinary, with our way that we are maybe driving our car
or going around the neighborhood or something.
And then maybe with this experience, but there can be even some deeper
recognitions of impermanence that really help support some wisdom,
unless the recognition that, oh, all of these experiences are flickering,
they're not as solid as I was thinking they were when I tried to pinpoint them,
they're not really there.
Well, what is solid?
What is steady?
And we might discover that it's only concepts, it's only ideas that are
steady, that are solid, that are stable.
It's only our ideas about things, about experiences, it's only the concepts,
it's only the labels that we put on them, that's the only things that's stable.
Again, a good example is this word pain, pain.
It's the same word, maybe we could say it with some different inflection, pain, pain.
But it's just, it's the same word, but that word gets placed on top of such a
broad range of experiences, and these experiences aren't steady.
So it turns out that this is so, what's true for all of our experiences.
So when that mind is really settled and really quiet,
we can see that it's only our concepts that are steady.
And usually when the mind is this quiet, means that there's concentration,
and when there's this level of concentration, there's also a sense of well-being.
They go together, that you can't have this level of settledness in the mind.
I'll use this word concentration, samadhi, unless there's also some certain amount
of well-being, some happiness, some equanimity, some ease.
And then when there is that level of ease, and this level of well-being,
and this level of settledness, it's only under those conditions that we can start
to see how things are really not as stable.
This is part of the reason that some well-being is an integral part of
meditation practice.
So that seeing the unsteady nature of our experiences,
that our experiences have the nature to arise and pass away,
is not disturbing or uncomfortable, but we see it with a mind that has some understanding
and can take it in as some wisdom.
And that can really support us on our way to greater and greater freedom,
because it becomes so clear, oh yes, if everything is changing, flickering,
flashing in and out of experience, we might have to see this ten times,
a hundred times, a thousand times, and concentrated mind and concentrated mind.
If things are not as steady as we think they are,
then it just doesn't make sense to hold on to them.
It just doesn't make sense to be clinging, to grabbing, to be attached to them,
because they're changing.
And then it's just natural, it's just natural that there's a letting go.
And then with this letting go, there's greater freedom.
And the more the mind is able to let go, the greater and greater freedom there is,
until there's the complete letting go that is awakening.
And then like Kondanya and Yasa, the first Buddhist students,
can say, oh, everything that is subject to arising is subject to cessation.
So may you, whether you see that impermanence in your daily life,
whether you see just the arising of things, or maybe you see sometimes just the passing of things,
or maybe you start to see in more deeper ways with a quieter and quieter mind
that might not be available until you have some opportunity to do some extended practice.
But may it be an opportunity for you to notice that it just doesn't make sense to hold on to those things that are changing,
and for us to let go, and to feel the freedom that arises when we let go.
Thank you.
