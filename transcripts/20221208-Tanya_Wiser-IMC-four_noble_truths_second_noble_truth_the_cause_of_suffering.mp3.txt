The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Thank you for coming today. So this is our second class in the series of the
Four Noble Truths. Last week we talked about the first noble truth and today
we're going to go to the second. The Four Noble Truths are kind of the
the basis, what we really need to understand and see clearly our own
practice, our experience, our inner life, our life in community. There is this
sentencing in the Sutta, so it's Sariputta, the chief disciple of the Buddha.
He was talking to a group of monks and he said this, friends, just as the
footprint of any living being that walks can be placed within an elephant's
footprint, so two all-wholesome states can be included in the Four Noble Truths.
It's kind of, from there we start and we go back and forth. We may go deeper in
other teachings and things like that, but the Four Noble Truths remain kind of
the basis and you're listening to them now and maybe in the future you'll
listen to them again and something else comes up. It's incredibly rich. It's a
very deep teaching. It sounds very simple but there's a lot to reflect, a lot
to learn, a lot to understand in them. So I would like to share some of the
teachings from Sylvia Burstein, the way she talks about the Four Noble Truths.
So she says, we talked last week about the First Noble Truth, about Dukka, the
suffering, being annoyed, being stressed, anxiety, all kinds, different kinds of
suffering, different levels, let's say, of suffering. And she says, life is
challenging for all beings, everybody, our bodies, relationships, all our life
circumstances are fragile and are changing. We are accommodating all the
time. That's kind of the reality of Dukka in her words. The Second Noble
Truth, the cause of suffering is the mind's struggle in responding to
challenge. And we'll go deeper on that one today. The Third Noble Truth, the end of
suffering, a mind that doesn't struggle, a mind that is at peace, that is, is
possible. And the Four Noble Truth is kind of the medicine. What is it that we
need to do to be free of suffering? And that is the the Eightfold Path. So just
with this short introduction, maybe we could start the meditation. Thank you,
Tanya. Everybody okay if I take my mask off? That was great. I'm just gonna
repeat those. Can you make me a teeny bit louder, I think? How's the volume, you
guys? Is it loud enough? Okay. So life is challenging for all. Our bodies,
relationships, all of life circumstances are fragile and changing. We are always
accommodating. The Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering is the mind's
struggle in response to challenge. So feel your body, we'll go into a
meditation. Feel your feet on the floor. Maybe lift your shoulders and roll them
back a bit. Make sure your arms, our hands are resting comfortably. With the next
inhale, let your body rise up, lift up, stretch up. Feeling yourself rising up to
the present moment to meet right here, just this, just this space, this body and
this moment with whatever emotions and thoughts and sensations that are
happening here. So with this idea that we're always accommodating and that
life is challenging, see if you can bring to mind some small way that life is
challenging for you right now. Small. So on a scale of one to ten, a one or a two,
maybe a three, not a ten. So there's the challenge and then there's our struggle
to be with that challenge. See if you can feel into the struggle and as you hold
that struggle, just notice the way that you might struggle a bit in response to
this challenge and see if you can feel that struggle, get a feel for the
pattern, the pole. Three patterns I notice in myself are a pattern of puddling or
sinking in sort of like a this is hard and every bit of me just falls into this
is hard. That's one pattern. Another pattern is this is hard and there's a
refusal or a distancing feeling. So it's not puddling. It's maybe armoring in
response. There's a distancing or a repressing energy. These are two extremes
that embody that struggle with whatever it is that is difficult and there's
everything in between. So just with that as a reference, see if you can't stay
with the same struggle or maybe choose another one again, three or under on the
trigger scale, not big, tolerable and be curious. Trying to bring to mind that
struggle like I have a broken leg, just in that simplicity and then there's the
reaction to it. The Oh, that means I can't drive the car or I can't believe
maybe I'll never be able to walk again, hike, run. That's the struggle with the
challenge. See if you can't feel into the energy, the dynamic of how you're
relating to one of the many little struggles in your life. And if the
struggle starts to become a four or a five or above on the trigger scale and
sort of imagine bowing to it and saying, I'll come back to you. I need to
choose something little right now. Maybe open your eyes. Maybe put your hand on
your heart. This is hard. And notice that in a way sometimes the hard stuff is very
magnetic. The mind just really wants to stay focused on it. So just see that
magnetic energy that pull that draw the way it keeps pulling us back. Feel that.
Witness that. Without being it. And see if you can't soften just like in a warm
bath softening around all of this that's happening in your mind. No need to bring
up anything else. I think you've probably done well enough. Just focus on how to be
soft around it. Breathe in with softness and breathe out with softness. Breathe in
caring. And breathe out caring. And let's do a little body scan starting at the top
of the head. Just above the head. This first standing with him alongside the
body taking it in the sense of caring and wise eyes. Imagine a warm light. Maybe
golden like warm honey. Imagine that the way that you are seeing and feeling the
body is like warm honey. Sweet. Gentle. Sort of let it the awareness slowly
glide down on the top of the head down through the forehead and the side back
of the head, the ears, eyes, cheekbones and jaw. Taking some breath down the chin, the
neck, sides of the neck, back of the neck, tops of the shoulders, collarbone down the
front of your chest, down the back body. Let's take in your time. Scanning, touching
with this warmth, the body, moving as slowly as you need down the arms. With
each exhale just invite a little bit of softening, a little bit of relaxing. And
the belly and the lower back, the hips and the bottom, the thighs, knees, shins and
calves, ankles and feet. Breathing into the whole body now, feeling it expand with
the inhale, contract with the exhale. And feeling the earth under your feet, the
sense of groundedness. So being soft and relaxed, but here, upright.
Imagine in your mind's eye, what it would be like to stand tall and relaxed. Next to
you, whatever is difficult in your life. Maybe imagine what it's like when somebody puts
their hand on your shoulder or the stands beside you, the support in this caring, but
upright way. The sense that nothing needs to happen right now, just being in this way
with whatever is going on, is all that's needed.
Breathing in and breathing out.
Feeling the flow, the changing nature of your experience moment to moment.
Changing nature of sound.
Just allowing whatever comes up in your meditation now to come up. Just witnessing.
Nothing needs to happen. Just holding this calm and upright presence in the middle of it all.
Letting whatever comes into the mind move through in its own way. Imagine there's nothing
sticky, nothing, no magnetic energy. It just can slide through. Nothing to hold on to.
And then when you notice some holding, some tension, what am I trying to hold on to?
A feeling? A thought? The way I wish it were? A memory? Can it be held on to?
Maybe it becomes transparent, dissolves and feeling the breath and the body right
here.
Feeling the feet, the support of the earth.
And when you notice tension or stress in the body, in the mind,
in the heart, see if you can't stand at its side witnessing with kindness and confidence,
strength. I can be with this too.
Right here, right now, in this moment, I don't need to do anything. Just be aware.
And it's okay if it's not okay.
Right now, I'm feeling like I'm just being walked around.
Everything is okay.
Just in this moment, even the weird honking horn was just fine.
It's like a flat tire or something.
Again, just noticing if there's any tension building up in the body, it just kind of keeps coming back in my body, the breathing in and inviting it to soften, inviting a little let and go with exhale.
And over and over again, just softening, allowing and meeting, standing up to meet, whatever is happening.
It's like a flat tire or something.
In the last few minutes of the meditation together,
let me just check in and notice, reflect on your journey.
You've all had a very different journey than everybody besides you, but you've all been on a journey.
The different things that have come up, the feelings, the energy in your body may have shifted and changed.
See if you can't just sort of get a feeling for where you've gone, journeyed.
What's different?
When you think back to the difficulty you first thought of, the challenge, notice how it is to think of it now.
So we'll take a couple of minutes just to reflect on how was that for you.
Anybody have anything that they're willing to say or share?
There's a mic there and a mic there.
Great.
I was too comfortable, obviously.
I never thought I would doze off so audibly.
I have to say, from last week's class to this week, regarding the tone of voice that you had mentioned,
what tone are you bringing in, I am more mindful of that.
Throughout my journey or my meditation journey, I find that I've been wanting to sit longer in the morning
as opposed to the evenings because it helps me start my day because I feel like my days are...
I'm just trying to get ready for the day.
So this sitting was nice and even with the car horn that's happened before at IMC
and just trying not to get bothered by whatever.
But yes, thank you.
Thank you, Ann Rose.
Yeah, great.
Thank you.
Thank you for having us here.
Also, thank you for your comment that all of us had a different journey
and we are all here meeting at the same point.
I have some poetry which I will try to make like a close English, essentially a couplet,
make an approximate English translation of that.
The two hearts are beating but the music is the same.
The sound is the same.
The songs are different but the instrument is the same.
So when you talk about the journeys are different but the instrument is the same.
So I just wanted to present that.
Thank you.
Thanks so much for the meditation.
I was surprised when you invited us to pick something that was just like a one or two
and then I think the invitation was to let go of the struggle a little bit
and wow, I was so surprised how good it felt to let go of the struggle.
And then also it was about my students that I work with
and then just like what came to me was just like I can let go
and just trust that they're going to figure out how to do this.
And that's so much, it's just so much more loving
than the other way that it could be of like this like holding on, we have to do it.
So anyway, so thank you, that felt really good.
I also had this little thought pop in about my family
and I thought, my gosh, there's such like worry carriers, if that makes sense.
Oh, I love that term.
Yeah, and I love them all the pieces but it's such a thing in my family to worry.
Anyway, maybe when that comes up, that invitation to let go of the struggle
could be a really good, just a good place to go.
Thank you.
Sandra.
Okay, so repeating from the second from Cynthia Perstein's,
the cause of suffering is the mind's struggle in response to challenge.
Thank you for the meditation.
I couldn't find the two, I went to 10 immediately like, oh my gosh.
And I think it's the reaction to the struggle of the mind
is what the impali is called tanha that literally translates as thirst.
It's also translated as hunger, desire, craving.
Thirst works very well for me now in this moment of my life.
And you will find the translation that really expresses where you are,
how it feels for you.
So we have the challenge, the mind struggles, and then that thirst.
The challenge, and the three of them is kind of the way things are, really.
We kind of control the challenges in our life, they're going to happen no matter what.
The way our minds work, because we're just humans, we're going to struggle
and it can take different forms.
And also that desire for things to be well,
for we want to be, we want to live with ease, at peace,
so that thirst, that hunger in a way is kind of natural.
Gregory Kramer says that the clinging, the grasping
is what makes the bridge between that thirst and the suffering.
So in reality, those three, like, okay, that's the way things are,
that's the way your brain works, that's part of our human nature, isn't it?
But is that what comes after that, that clinging, that I have to fix this?
This needs to be well, and we can see it in many aspects of our life.
That's really what brings the suffering.
And for me, it works like to break things in pieces.
It's just I'm a scientist, so I guess it's just the way my mind tends to go.
But yeah.
And what we want to be at ease, to be well, there's really nothing wrong with it.
The problem is that I personally am a doer and a fixer.
Every time my mind's a struggle, I want it to be, like, that's my default to go.
So we cling to things, I wanted it to be perfect, I wanted it to be well,
I don't want to feel bad, I don't want to be uncomfortable,
I don't want to be cold, things like that.
And we also cling to what we do to achieve that.
We cling, we grasp, even grasp the fear that we're going to lose it when we get it.
And we even cling to the fear of not getting it.
So that's a little like convoluted, so I'm going to give you an example.
I was thinking of how can I convey, so I'm going to bring an example of my life
and maybe you'll find something in yours.
When, for me, going to college, it was very difficult.
We were in a very tough economical situation, so it was very hard.
I had to work and all that.
And then finally I came to this country and I was able to find a good job
and found economical stability.
And I wanted to make sure that my kids didn't need to go through the same struggle that I had to.
So I worked 24-7, I burned myself to exhaustion.
But it's like, yeah, because I need to make it right for them.
So they don't need to go through the same.
So that in itself, that I wanted to achieve, I think it wasn't too bad, isn't it?
I think we want to provide the best.
But it became kind of an addiction for me.
So I worked it hard and I worked it on the weekends and I worked it late at night.
But yeah, I have to do this.
So I got addicted to the way I was trying to achieve that.
And the fear of not being able to provide, oh gosh, it's my motivation, I kind of let go of that.
And then the fear of not being enough, not achieving enough.
Because then it becomes very convoluted, isn't it?
It's not only one thing, we tend to mix a lot of things.
I'm a woman and I need to show that I need the validation.
I need to show them that I can do this, isn't it?
It may be a little too extreme, but I can see all these phases of what is clinging in that part of my life.
And then probably you're going to find your own examples as well.
But I think, again, it's not what we want that is wrong.
It's not, it's the way we, our attitude, how it becomes an obsession almost.
And we don't notice it very easily because that's the way things are.
And then there are much simpler things and we just simply don't notice.
Like when I got here earlier and for some reason the thermostat was 72.
Faragati was like, oh my gosh, he's so hot.
Like I started going, where is, how is it?
I was trying to remember how to, like, wow, this is, where is it that we're going to talk about today?
So we see it, it's every day, we see it in the small things.
So yeah, it was kind of interesting.
So that thirst that we feel, that tanha, the Buddha gave us three main big groups.
The first one is the craving, the desire for sense pleasure.
The next one is hunger for being, for becoming, and the third one, hunger for non-being, for non-becoming.
So I'm going to try to, my example, I want to make sure I have the right time.
All right.
So desire for sense pleasure.
Who doesn't love a nice meal?
Who doesn't love a nice song?
Looking at a beautiful landscape and piece of art.
Pleasurable touch, like a nice, warm shower.
A pleasurable state of mind, feeling content and relaxed, yeah.
Who doesn't love a nice relaxing meditation?
So it's kind of that sense pleasure.
Again, it's not in itself what the thing that we decide that is wrong, that we shouldn't be enjoying it,
or the sinful or anything like that, it's more how we relate to it that is going to bring us that,
I want it, I want it, I don't want to let it go, and that's what brings us to suffering.
I think something that's quite interesting is the desire is usually the way we engage with the world.
We come here because we want to listen, we want to, I don't know, cultivate our spiritual life
when I come to this community where we feel okay, welcome.
So yeah, that's kind of the way we go around in the world.
But how are we going to do it that really bring us the suffering in itself?
And then what is also with the desires for some sense pleasure is the aversion that we have for pain.
Like if you have some work to be done in your mouth at the dentist, that you're thinking for a week that,
oh gosh, that's going to hurt.
It's also a little bit what's involved into that part of clinging.
And now for the hunger for being or for non-being rather than going into too much talk about it.
Maybe give you some examples.
So you get to work and you have been assigned a certain parking spot because you are the employee of the month
and then you arrive at there's somebody parked there.
What the lack of respect and work and they don't know that I am the employee of the month.
Like that desire to be seen, to be known, isn't it?
Or you want people, the pain of our personalities, isn't it?
You're very good at making jokes and things like that.
And somebody is not laughing at your joke or the comment that you just did.
Like, oh, wow, I'm that person.
You need to laugh at my jokes or things like that.
And even like we just had the elections in November and you think very,
you have very strong position about that proposition and you voted against it
and rallied your friends and all that and the proposition passed.
Wow.
Like all this, my opinion, my political beliefs, my religions believe we really,
we identify so much with those.
One that I found quite interesting first when I came to this country is how some people feel offended
when I said happy holidays and not Merry Christmas, for example.
It was taken very personally.
It took me a little while to figure that one.
And then on the other end is this desire for not being seen.
Like that team building event and that all the group is invited and oh gosh,
it cannot end soon enough.
I don't like those.
I mean, I end up enjoying it at the end, but it takes me like a week of preparation.
There's something about all those things, I just don't want to be seen in that context.
We don't want to be seen.
Please, Earth, open up and eat me up.
So in a way, I mean, you can read more about it,
but I thought that maybe that give us a little bit of a sense.
Sometimes we want to be seen and it's part of our nature, isn't it?
We live in communities.
We belong in communities.
We will not belong.
And sometimes we don't want to.
Yeah, sometimes we just don't want to be.
We want to be there.
I want to be mindful of time.
Okay.
Yeah, so what I wanted to say sometimes when we talk about the clinging
and thirst and hunger and all that.
It sounds like addictions to our desires.
It sounds like very major, isn't it?
But it's not.
We see it every day.
It's in our daily life is, I don't like this chair.
I wish I had, I don't know what.
It's the little things that sometimes can make a difference.
You know, in a daily life, in a daily day in our life.
Last week I was going to the conference for work and I wanted to see the talks that day
and our water heater broke.
So, and so when they fix it and then they had to shut off the gas and then the air heater,
the heating system in the house just died.
So I couldn't go to my, it was like, oh my gosh.
That's, can I bring my practice into that?
And I think I handle, okay.
I was like, okay, I wasn't too miserable.
But it's in our daily life is every day is in traffic is coming here is going home.
It's yeah.
So don't don't think that because, okay, maybe I don't have those addictions.
But think little, think in the small things.
What bothered you this morning?
Where is, where can I see those ideas, those, that clingy, that thirst?
Where is it that is coming from?
And what is the suffering?
It's not big, big suffering.
It's just I'm very annoyed by it.
And that doesn't feel good.
So I'll stop there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So one of the things I was thinking about was the, what is clinging, you know,
when it's more subtle, what does it feel like?
Or when it's around something that's still sort of pleasant, right?
Oh, I'm going to buy that thing and I, you know, push the purchase button, right?
And, or I'm thinking about what I want to buy, right?
And it's that, that, you know, there can be something you like.
And then there's this like, and you can, oh, it's pretty, it's nice.
And then there's something that comes in that's a little like sneaky.
And it kind of puts you into an automatic pilot mode.
I feel like I get disconnected from my present moment when I get caught
in that kind of wanting something.
So there's, there's the hunger, right?
For a piece of, you know, peanut butter, rice cake or whatever it is.
And I'm hungry and I need to eat.
And that's fine.
And that's great.
But there's something then if I get clinging to it and I get fixated on it,
it's like I, the word that comes to mind is like being in an elevator, right?
Like I'm no longer really connected to my experience.
I'm more like on a ride.
Does that make sense?
There's a way that we can get kind of caught in it and we get disconnected actually
from ourselves and from the present moment and even from the peanut butter rice cake.
We might be eating it, but we're not really tasting it because we're in this craving, right?
So I wanted to sort of, you know, talk about it in that subtle way too
and how it disconnects us.
You know, when we get into that clinging, we're, we're, we're grabbing onto something
and really there's nothing we can grab onto truthfully, right?
We can't really grab, make anything permanent or stay the way it is or become what we wanted.
It will or it won't.
It's just sort of its own thing.
But there's that struggle that we get caught in that brings us into relationship with the world
that's actually really quite disconnected from the present moment, the world, ourselves.
So noticing what it is, whether it's that tension or tightness, right?
In our bodies when we're clinging, that's a huge cue to me.
But it also is a sense of disconnection that is a cue to me that I'm clinging.
So that's inherent, that's inherent in the clinging.
So I'm getting to know what, how it manifests for you when you are grabbing on.
So that's, that's like, get really curious about it in the subtle little ways.
Start to study it.
I think we all know pretty much the big ways.
I really want that job.
Damn it.
That was my car.
You know, whatever it is, like there's the big ways.
We know that, right?
We get upset about it.
But the little ways are subtle and insidious.
And they can just permeate our lives and pull us away with our, my phone's not out, right?
But this constant pull to the phone, to the phone.
And then there, you know, it's like, oh, I'm lost again, right?
It's that word I'm using today as the elevator feeling.
You get in an elevator, you push the button and you're on the ride, right?
And you're stuck.
But it's kind of like that enveloping feeling of being consumed by something.
And then you get out, you know, okay, oh, okay, I'm off.
You know, so get to know what that is for you and these small, small ways, not just the big ways.
Be curious, curiosity is your, is your friend when it comes to working with dukkha, with clinging.
It's the, you know, understanding the cause of why we're suffering, that clinging.
We've got to be curious, what am I clinging to?
It might be that I'm clinging to the idea that I'm going to feel better,
because I don't feel very good for some reason, or I'm anxious, or I'm afraid, right?
Or I don't like myself today.
So that's that part we need to sort of, you know, get curious about and soften around.
Be gentle with yourself.
You're human.
And, you know, Sandra said this, but it is, this is the condition.
We wouldn't survive.
We wouldn't be alive if we weren't hungry.
It's part of life.
All life is consuming, all the time.
Little amiibos, you know, amiibos, you know, everything is consuming.
And that's, that's part of it.
But how do we be conscious consumers of life?
How do we be awake and not try and get more than we need?
Take what we don't deserve or, you know, get in this battle.
So a gentleness, softness, a curiosity around it.
Seeing that it's normal, don't make yourself a bad person around us.
And really pay attention to the times your desire leads to well-being versus pain or more difficulty.
That's a huge cue to you to notice when we're kind of getting caught in an unskillful direction versus a wholesome direction.
But, but we've got to stay awake long enough.
We get on the elevator.
We're in this space.
We get off and then we're off to the next thing.
Don't run away so quick.
Pause.
Check in.
Oh, how did I feel when I got on the elevator?
Do I even remember?
And what's, what am I, how am I feeling now?
Do I feel better?
Do I feel more hungry?
Do I feel disconcerted?
You know, what, what's happening for me here?
Don't run off to the next thing because it, it is relentless.
You know, this consuming energy.
So let me see if there's anything else I want to say.
Yeah, I think that I'll just say moving away from suffering and toward liberation requires us to let go of unskillful actions, unskillful thoughts and unskillful intentions.
What helps us let go is seeing that they cause us suffering.
That really helps us let go to see how it's hurting, where it leads us.
Taking the path toward freedom requires us to take responsibility for our thoughts, attitudes and behaviors.
It's really helpful to ask, is this serving or harming myself or others?
Is this serving or harming?
So, in the last moment before we moved to small group kind of conversation, anything that I could say that would be clarifying or helpful?
Was I clear?
Yes, Ann Rose, just find a mic please.
It's on.
So like the moment where you talked about Tanya, the elevator, like how do you know when you're caught?
Because I know I'm stepping into that elevator multiple times a day.
Yes, indeedy.
You know, but I'd like to, I'd like to get out, you know.
Yes.
So, I think that the, so you're asking how do I know I'm getting on the elevator?
Essentially like you're asking for how do I stop myself from getting on the elevator?
Yeah, well I think for me it's starting to wake up when I'm probably already on the elevator or getting off the elevator.
Later, not at the beginning. That's what I would say for me.
Not all the time, but over time it's waking up and then pausing when it's happened, giving myself enough space to the mind to consciously acknowledge, oh, I just did it again.
You know, okay, how does that feel?
Okay, and then when I have the energy to even go like, okay, can I go back another step? What happened right before I got caught?
What was going on for me? And I may or may not have an answer, but being curious about it actually is starting to teach the mind to pay attention.
And so we start to grow our interest and our mind starts to just tune into these things. And then we start to combine and couple, oh, wanting this with the pain afterwards because we've consciously connected the two.
Does that make sense? Okay.
Thank you.
We have habits. We have patterns. And yes, we have to catch ourselves, I don't know how many times when we're leaving the elevator, but at least we're catching ourselves.
And then maybe we start identifying like, oh, I tend to do this. So in a way, kind of start making mental like a little positive that when I get there, I know I need to pay attention.
Like right now, holiday season shopping, be very aware. Like you, like you go to the websites where you're going to find your gifts. It's like, order early because transportation, blah, blah.
I mean, the world out there wants you to be very thirsty and very clingy. So, okay, so I need to pay attention when these things happen. And we need to get caught many times before we notice. That's the way it is.
That's the only way we learn. Yeah.
I like that.
Thank you.
When you were talking and something that, you know, a lot of people can relate to your talk about like taking out your phone and being kind of like addicted to it and stuff like that.
And it made me think a lot about like just triggers and how we like deal with triggers and not necessarily like it could be like big triggers or even just like little things that trigger us down this like negative rabbit hole.
I guess my question is around like, in some ways, you know, the advice is like we should remove those triggers. So like, don't use social media, for example, is like the obvious one that we hear a lot.
Or, I mean, sometimes the triggers can even come from like books or like talking to certain people or like watching certain TV shows and stuff.
And sometimes it makes me also wonder, like, is removing all triggers like, I mean, obviously in certain cases where there's more serious effects involved like PTSD and things like that.
Is it, I would say a different scenario, but for like smaller triggers is removing them helpful or is like being able to not go down the negative rabbit hole.
When you see that trigger, does that serve you better?
Or is there like no right answer? I don't know.
Yeah. Do you mind if I answer this one?
Yeah, it's a really important question.
So there are times, but this call, this does call for discernment, which is what you're pointing to. There are times when removing the triggers are possible and necessary.
But we can't do that with everything. It's not possible.
And one of the things that I had sort of suggested in the guided meditation was, you know, can we just stand next to something?
The trigger, whatever it is, can we imagine being alongside it and not collapsing and not rigidifying either?
And, you know, just sort of that's something to practice. And that's what we're doing in meditation.
We're cultivating the capacity to be uninvolved, to allow things to come up and go and move through us and just like realize actually it will all kind of come through and go on.
I just can sit here. I'll be okay. But it's getting up and running off and fighting with this and that and trying to do this and that that gets us in trouble.
So discernment is necessary. We can't get rid of all the triggers. In fact, triggers aren't, you know, triggers are really just associations.
And our brain is an association organ, prediction organ. It just, that's what it, we've got this, you know, library of experiences that our brain pulls on to associate.
And so it's not possible. But let me say one more quick thing here, which is we can work on also adding what we're associating.
We can add things like if we have a trigger, we can start to build other experiences around that resourcing experiences, positive experiences, empowerment experiences, recognizing, oh, I can sit next to this and it's not going to kill me kind of thing.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Talk about this clinginess and the elevator experience. Have you come across people who, like, in that same sense, try to be like, God like, or like, I can give an example that let's say,
who are always kind of in this clinginess or elevator experience, they are always measuring that, oh, this person did a sastang pranam to me.
Sastang is essentially all eight, you know, body parts touching the ground. That is the way of bowing to someone. Whereas she or he did not even touch my feet or whatever.
That is like one form of salutation. So, and like, like this, she or he does not love or respect or whatever, this person.
So, constantly, like, you know, in this, like, how I view this, this is like, you know, in the Masilev pyramid, that's like the low self-esteem, like, they're constantly evaluating in this elevator sense, oh, you know, I don't have this respect,
I don't have this, that the eating thing or thirst or whatever. Constantly looking for that, satisfying that, have I presented my question?
I think you're talking about somebody who's hungry for being seen or feeling better or they're constantly comparing and judging.
Yeah, and, yeah, and it's like, like that, you know, it's like the uncontrollable tongue, which is like, I don't know.
Uncontrollable.
You know, the speech.
Speech, oh.
There are many ways that those things happen. Like, always trying to be very well dressed and very nice hair and the last, I mean, there are many ways that we can express that.
And I think is what we're trying to do ourselves. We can do the work ourselves, isn't it? We can do the work for others. And it's hard to notice it.
There's a lot of conditioning that has gone into that.
So I think the best we can do is do it for ourselves.
Try to teach it to other people. I think you need to be there at the right moment.
Probably it will happen. It could happen, but yeah, it's like the person that doesn't want to be seen, that wants to be invisible and maybe, I don't know.
So in some way, I think we all may be able to relate to that. There's been moments in our life where we just don't want to be there.
We don't want to be put on the spot. We want to be invisible.
So, but it's hard to notice it. It takes courage to do it.
Yeah.
That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's essentially, yeah, I mean, especially in smaller circles, you know, kind of when we are operating in a very small circle of people that say we are like, I mean, we are, I guess, we don't have a choice
of not being far away. And which means that so I have to be, I have been in Bali.
So I'm more superior to this person. I have been in seeing this pyramid.
So I'm to be more well-traveled and whatnot. So it's, it's, I just wanted to make that presentation. I mean, because I am unable to comprehend sometimes that that that first hunger to
all that, you know, that Godly status, you know, that it's really a clinging to an identity, you know, it's just we all, it's whether you want to be dressed up identity or you want to be smarter than other people identity or you want to be better because you've
traveled more places like it's all identity. Those are, it's very, and we're trying to make ourselves create some self that's elusive and vulnerable. So it doesn't really work. So we, but we keep trying.
Right. And so it sounds like somebody's, you're describing as very uncomfortable person and trying to make themselves better, or trying to make other people feel bad to make themselves feel better.
I'm not sure which way it is, but it's, it's clinging to an identity. Right. Yeah.
And also when we satisfy those desires, when we achieve those things, the satisfaction, the, the well-being lasts just a little bit. It's not, it's not the happiness.
It's just the moment and when that clinging, it's, it keeps kind of reinforcing itself because we need more of it, more of it and more of it to, to be well. So, yeah.
So should we, yeah, let's go to the, well, I think we need to consider maybe, maybe you want to choose, you know, one of these things that we can do.
These things that we can just discuss it here and then maybe because we can't really do the breakout groups.
Exactly. Okay. So what I would like you to invite.
Yeah, you know, that's a good idea, Richard. He just suggested having everybody circle up for this part.
Yeah.
And then we'll come in and we'll just do kind of, yeah.
Just stay off the blue line because that's the camera. Just, yeah, there you go. Thank you.
And so I'm going to maybe read something, like ask, invite you to think of something in your life and see what comes up and perhaps something that we didn't touch too much was about the satisfaction that we get out of it.
So think of a moment and try to maybe something recent today, this week.
So you, so now you can see in retrospect that, wow, that was a moment where I felt that, that thirst, that hunger, that craving for something.
And you were able to get it. You got what you wanted. Things were done the way you wanted it. Like, that's the way you got it.
So I would invite you to think about how did it feel to get it and did it last?
And perhaps did it open you for more? It didn't make you a thirstier for more?
So that's, that's one thing.
And also, not to be so focused on the thirst part and the clinging part, maybe you can also think of a moment, even a small thing where you were able to let go, to let things be, to be content to what was happening.
And how does that feel? Even a small thing, how does it feel? How does, how does it feel in the body?
And like, if you could contrast both, what do you see?
And so let's, let's take those two. If anybody would like to.
Anybody have an example? I could share a little one. I'll just to help you get started if you need to help.
So I, I need new glasses. And, you know, my prescription changed, right? And so, you know, if you wear glasses, it's like, oh my God, what frame, what color, what, you know, the weight, you know, plastic or the nose things, all these things, right?
And so I, I, last pair of glasses, this pair have been okay. I don't love them, but they're okay, you know.
And so it's like, and I've gotten a few pair that I really didn't like. So I was like, okay, I got to really try a lot of different glasses here.
And then I ordered some try on at home glasses and I ordered some at the, I actually ordered them and I didn't like them and I took them back.
And so all this like energy and trying on, looking, well, taking pictures, what do you think of this one?
And then I was like, you know, I have this old pair of glasses that I really like a lot.
And when I finally settled on just using that frame and getting new glasses, it was like, oh, that was contentment. That was like such a relief rather than that seeking, trying to find the right pair.
So I don't blow it again, right? And end up with glasses I hate and hurt my nose or whatever.
But why didn't I think, why wasn't that the first choice? I don't know. But I got there. Thank God.
Anybody else want to share something?
Great.
I don't know if I have an example. Oh, sorry. I don't know if I have an example for both.
But one thing that, so recently I've been taking a break from working and I'm taking some classes.
One of them I'm taking is in ceramics, which is something I love doing and it's like, it's been great.
And I definitely have felt like a new feeling of like, I'm excited to like wake up at 7am and go to class and on a weekday, which is like, I don't think I've ever felt that way before.
And so that's been great. But I think it's something around what you're saying where it's like, we have the clinging even when it's something good.
And I find myself sometimes like in class and like, this is what I've been looking forward to like all weekend and I'm here.
And then I just get into this mode of like, I need to like do everything and I need to like, like, you know, get as much as I can done and I need to like make sure I finish all these pieces.
And then I'm like, oh my God, like stop breathing normally and I'm trying to get everything done in time.
Even though it's like something I really enjoy doing. And I like don't let myself take a break.
And so I've been trying to be better about that and like stop and be like, I don't have to get all this done right now and I should like make sure I'm actually enjoying what I came here to do.
So yeah, I think that's an example.
That's very good. Thank you.
Yeah, as you were talking, I didn't I had that, you know, in the airport, they have those flat escalators where, you know, you get on.
It's like being on that thing, right? You're pulling your, you know, you're getting really fast and it's that what you're describing, right?
Maybe you're in this doing this great thing, but somehow you're like, crabbing, reaching, trying to get next next and you lose.
It's like going by so fast, you're not even there. You're not even enjoying it anymore.
Yeah, because the mind, this is where the mind, that's why I feel like the elevator escalator thing.
It's like, we stop being here. We get in this head, we're imagining things.
We're imagining what we want. And then we're relating to that instead of what's this.
Yeah.
I think too of the friend of mine, so she stopped working in the company because she wanted to go more into cultivating her spiritual life and such.
And it was so confusing for her because like she was saying is like when the work we do is we are so overwhelmed all the time that when we have a break,
we only know overwhelmed or vacation. We don't know anything in between.
So she was like, she didn't know what to do. Like I have time. I don't know. It was very, yeah.
Yeah. And then like, okay, no little by little, I mean, it took time, but yeah, we need to relearn to enjoy.
Yeah.
And maybe that was like also, yeah, it's also a good example where like, yeah, when I left, I was like, I was not having a great time at the company I was working at.
And I was like, once I quit, my life is going to be amazing. Like all my anxiety is going to go away.
And I'm just going to live like the best life ever and at least like temporarily, you know, and then when I quit, I was like, why do I feel worse than what I did before because it's like,
now I have more mental space to worry about all the other things in my life that I was like probably not thinking much about when I was working.
I don't know if I understood the question correctly, but I think the way I'm trying to interpret it is not taking so much like catastrophizing the things and just noticing that there's no permanence.
Whether things are really horrible or really great, you know, that will come to an end and am I, you know, sort of transfer to one extreme or the other and just trying to be okay with going through the motions and knowing that it'll change either for the worst or, you know, for the best again,
and just trying to be able to like navigate that more regularly and sort of contently.
Yeah, it's to avoid the addiction for it.
I mean, the desire, the one they have in it and okay, it's gone, you got it.
Enjoy it.
Let it go.
It's gone.
Like no, not falling to that cycle that more and more like, yeah.
So sometimes I'll notice myself sort of going down like a spiral of catastrophe.
Oh, this is so horrible.
Now, now I'll lose my job and my car will break down on the streets and homeless and or something like that.
But I'm trying to maybe more so find a way to if I have learned that behavior or mental way of thinking, how can I become my best cheerleader instead of being my worst critic and trying to cultivate that more into not having such a cleanliness to either, you know,
something catastrophizing or even something great that is going wonderful.
Yeah, and I think it takes courage for us to face those things because it probably is coming from something that happened.
Maybe when we were children or something like that, isn't it?
Like, okay, where is that?
Like, I know my catastrophizing.
I know, like, but it's taken me a long time to even see in it.
Like, like, why am I going? Like, what is this coming from and getting curious with time?
It was a curiosity.
And but with that kindness, with that softness, isn't it?
Where is this coming from?
And like naming the dragon so it loses its power in a way.
I'm not sure it's on.
You talk about the enjoying each moment or taking time to have be with each moment.
And since you talked about that, you are a scientist, I also wanted to talk about this concept of time dilation or like sometimes people even in poetry,
they talk about, you know, time seems to have frozen, which means like if people are having a good time,
then they say that, you know, it's like a time has dilated or time has just stopped.
And they just want to be in that moment.
So I can give two examples.
One, let's say going back to the mountains in like Swiss Alps, which reminds me very much of, you know, James James Bond 007.
And, you know, it's like Shelton and Glotterbrunnen and those places.
And just, I mean, time, I mean, last, the session before last, I had also talked about like someone like Gregory Peck of Indian cinema,
like there are some pictures from that, those places.
So when I have traveled to those places, the time just seems to have stopped. I like Zurich and Bern and all those places, you know,
I still can feel that joy and happiness that I had.
And like in the immediate present, I have to make some presentation for some teaching some music, talk about some music.
So every small breaks I have, I listen to some pieces, I will prepare some and then, you know, maybe make some notes or something.
For me, those times, you know, they just stop, then and there.
It's like the time has stopped that those pieces I'm enjoying so much that whether now or in my sleep or, you know, I'm kind of enjoying that.
Even if that moment of presenting to my audience has not yet come, but even while I'm being prepared, I am enjoying that moment.
So that comment about being happy in every moment or essentially dilating the time, even if the time is like only, you know, short duration.
But it can be prolonged that it can be like eons or ages or whatever.
So to bring us to that conscious, that is, I don't know if I am, that is how I want us to feel and I try to view things that way.
So I've given two examples, one of like, you know, the being in the mountains and...
I guess I would just say this, you know, it's a very philosophical question, but also time is a concept.
And there are ways of stepping out of conceptual time to not be relating to life in that same framework in the practice.
I think it's possible to have experiences.
But the main thing is that I think the absence of clinging, the absence of clinging is a spacious feeling.
Everything, there's so much generosity in it.
Everything can just be.
We don't want the tree to be closer or different or there's just so much generosity.
And so that also has that timelessness feeling.
So I don't know how else to answer you, but I think it's a great thing to question our relationship with time and notice how we're relating to what's happening affects our sense of time.
Does that feel like enough?
I think we need to shift.
It's actually about time to end.
So we don't have too long, but time to do our dedication of merit.
Yeah, so coming here together definitely, we hope that is of benefit for you, but also to keep in mind that what we do here benefit the people around us, our families, our friends, the people that we cross in the street, we get out.
And like we're thinking about these things that has been here today has repercussions.
And it's not only we don't only do it because it's nice, but really to maybe share this with other beings, with all beings.
And a practice that Tania introduced me to is we forget is easy to forget the pain, the suffering that is out there, isn't it?
And sometimes if we can bring some of it into our minds and maybe offer the benefit of the practice today to those people, to those causes, to those countries, whatever it is that can open your heart.
Now, I don't think we're going to circulate the microphone today, but maybe bring it in your mind and bring it to your heart.
And may the benefit of our practice today be shared with every being, that everybody, every being is free of suffering and its causes and that every being may live in ease and peace.
Thank you for your practice today.
