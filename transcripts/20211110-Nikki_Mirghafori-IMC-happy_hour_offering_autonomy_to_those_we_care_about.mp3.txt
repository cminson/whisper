 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Okay. So, hello. Hello and welcome to this edition of Happy Hour, everyone. So for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to consider this practice of granting others autonomy, granting others their autonomy in our hearts, in our minds, with a sense of well, goodwill for them. So it's a practice of, I think one way to think of this practice is a practice of equanimity. But maybe tonight I'd like to invite us to lean into it as, you know, you care for someone, a friend, a relative, maybe a child, and this, I've heard, comes up a lot for adult children, especially when they're all grown up, and yet you care for them so much. It can also come up with parents when we grow up and we want to care for our parents. There's such a sense of care and love and metta. And we just wish it would be different, right, for them. We just wish, gosh, they would make different decisions or if it wasn't so hard at this point, we somehow want to make it all better, make it go away, make the pain go away, make the difficulty go away. And we really want that. We care for this friend, for this child, for this parent, for this other being. For this other being could also be a pet, could be a four-legged friend or an animal. So we want so much to make it all go away. And yet, and yet, and yet we know that by really wanting to make it all better, it doesn't work for them. It doesn't work for us. We can step on their toes. They might feel belittled as if they don't have a sense of autonomy. And so how to manage, how to manage holding with a sense of care and love, not with aloofness, not with, oh, okay, I'll just turn away and not look at all, but the sense of care and yet respecting, respecting their autonomy that every being, all beings have their own journeys and their lives unfold their lives, our lives, all of our lives, unfold according to causes and conditions that have been set in motion even long before we arrived, with our genes, with our experiences. And of course, the decisions that we make are part of those causes and conditions, but not the entire picture. So, so this is an invitation tonight to practice, engage with this practice in the way of continuing to love and care for this being. And also honor, appreciate the path that they need to go through as it needs to unfold for them to perhaps learn the lessons they need to learn through the challenge, through the difficulty, through the dukkha, through the suffering that might be presenting itself at this moment and continue to care, continue to care. So, so with that, as the frame like to invite us to engage in this practice. So let us, let us begin, let us settle, as always into our bodies and into this moment, arriving, first arriving, arriving, arriving, letting go of all the words, becoming tuned, sensitive to what is here right now, relaxing, softening the body to become more aware, more present, more attuned to what's here with the breath, with the sensations of the body here. Now. Now. Now. Letting the breath be received. The abdomen, sensations of the breath, lowering the center of the gravity from the head to the abdomen. Now. Now. Letting go, letting go of thoughts as they come up. Go of thought, thinking. Thank you. Thank you. Thoughts not now, not needed right now. Please, please come back later. Leaning, leaning into. Ah. The sense of being present, aware here, the body and the breath. You. Here. Just here. Deliciously just here. Now. Receiving the breath received the abdomen. Just connecting, connecting as if it's a cleansing, as if it's a cleansing of the heart, the mind, the body to connect with each in breath, each out breath. Terrifying, refreshing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Noticing the sense of well being with each and every breath. Noticing as much well being as there may be, maybe a tiny bit. Thank you. Thank you. This is a moment where you are driving to your heart space, a being whom you care about, an object of your affection. Perhaps it's going through a challenging time, or there are some challenges in their lives, and part of you wish you could make it all go away. bringing that being into your mind, into your heart space. And first, first appreciating with gratitude the goodness, the friendship you've had, the relationship you've had. Just the goodness of this person has brought into your life. For this being could be a pet. Just taking time first to appreciate your connection, the goodness of it. Choosing to focus on the good. Of course, relationships are always a mixed bag. Choosing to focus on the good in this moment. Bring forth the goodness. Appreciating their good qualities. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciating the sense of care, good will, kindness, warmth you have for them, however it shows up for you. Maybe it's love. This is the goodness. This care, this metta for them. This feeling coming forth from their sense of appreciation for them. Thank you. Now allow the sense of care, this metta, to meet the challenge they're going through in their life right now. Allowing metta, this care to be expressed as compassion. When good will meets pain, suffering, it becomes compassion. Oh dear one, may you be free, may you be free from what is challenging right now. I wish you well, I wish you ease. I care, I care for your pain, I care for your sorrow. I care for your sadness, disappointment. May you hold your suffering with ease, allowing compassion to arise from metta, which itself arose from appreciation. I hold you with care, may you have ease. I hold you with care, may you have ease. May you have well-being, ease, in the midst of this challenge. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now, allowing practice of compassion, karuna, to transition to practice of equanimity, upekka, bringing to heart, letting the heart still be warm with care, and appreciating, appreciating that this being, the unfolding, the unfolding of their life right now, is happening, de-cording, to cause and conditions. Which you may or may not understand, which actually we do not understand, all the causes and conditions. The Buddha said, that's one of the imponderables. If you try to understand all the causes and conditions, your head will explode. So keeping this person, this being in mind, with care, I care for you. I care for you, and I cannot. Take away all the suffering. May I accept and see that all beings have their own journey. All beings, all beings have their own journey. I care for you, I care for you. But I'm not in control of your happiness and unhappiness. I wish you happiness, I wish you well. But I have not been able to, and I cannot, make your choices for you. I wish you well, I care for you. Whether or not I understand it, whether I understand it or not, things are unfolding according to a lawful nature, according to causes and conditions. I care for you, and I offer you autonomy. I gift you, in my heart, I gift you a sense of autonomy, to grow, to learn, to have your own journey. And I continue to hold you with care. May I accept that all beings have their own journey. May I accept that things are as they are for you right now. Continue to care and accept things as they are. Any of these phrases or nuances that work for you, you are welcome to use. Thank you. I care for you, but I cannot make your choices for you. Thank you. I love you, and I offer you autonomy on your journey, on this human journey that we are both on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I care for you, and in my heart, I offer you autonomy for the journey you are on. Thank you. Thank you. I care for you, and I respect that all beings have their own journey. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For the last moments of this practice period. Feeling, feeling into our care, our metta for this being. It's a spacious care. They're happy, they're sad. We care. This care is so spacious, it's enough space to hold the conditions of their life. Present unmoving, stable, equanimous, radiating care. A sense of spaciousness in our heart, stability in our heart, body, and mind. So we can be more available to support the care without being contracted. May all beings everywhere. Taste, goodness, and freedom ease, feel cared for, including ourselves. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. Ah. So, so what we did was we started. We started with appreciation. Actually we started first by arriving, landing with the breath, with the body. I invited to feel into the breath, the sense of nourishing, cleansing, refreshing to really connect with the in breath and out breath. I wonder how that worked for you if anybody wants to comment on that. Then we brought in someone we care about, might be going through a hard time. And with that being, we started with appreciation, with gratitude as a way to prime the heart, prime the heart with goodness. And then with that appreciation, then we opened up to Metta to care, the goodwill for this being. And from there, the Metta touching into the challenge they're going through right now, Metta plus suffering equals compassion. Practice turned into compassion practice, Karuna practice, feeling, feeling, holding the suffering, the pain with well-being, with a sense of goodwill. And from that, we turned into our final destination and hung out there for a while, which was this practice of equanimity, offering autonomy, continue to care, to love, to be present for the being and offer them autonomy. So, so many, so many different, unique path we took this evening and different from the path we've ever taken through this practice before and always a new path. Isn't it fun? Always a new practice. Never a dull moment at happy hour. So I would like to invite you if something opened up, if you, something you discovered in your practice, you like to offer this insight, this gift into the Sangha, or if there's a question, if something didn't work. So it's all good. You're invited, especially if you haven't spoken for a while. You can raise your zoom hand, or you can type in chat. If you type to me alone, I won't read your name. If you type to everyone, they'll read your name, or if you don't even want me to read your reflection, you can say private as you type it to me alone. Claire, please. Thank you so much. I had to get my hand up this is very personal and I don't know if it will interest anybody but me, but you gave me an answer to something that I've been worrying about all day. I, early in the morning I ran into someone who's a dear friend who has cancer. And I listened to her and talked to her. And then I left, and as I left, right after I left I thought, you know, I really should invite her to meditate, because I believe it will help her. But I got busy with other things. Anyway, it came back to mind later in the day, but I have learned and it's related to this in the last year that I have tended to be not overbearing, but too involved with people's problems. I don't like it, actually, pushes them away. And so I thought to myself, no, you know you're just repeating that old pattern. So maybe you better not and you know you just reinforced what I had sort of gotten to this was would not be helpful to her. That would be helpful to me, but not to her. And it was just beautiful and it was absolutely perfect. Beautiful. Thank you, Claire. Thank you so much for this is beautiful and, and I love how you said yeah it's helpful to me, because then feels like it reduces and that's the case for us right because it reduces our anxiety when they are when they feel less bad like oh yeah you meditate Oh you feel better I feel better but can we be okay with our stress our Dukka our concern for them and and and offer them autonomy. Exactly. Oh, beautiful. Thank you Claire and I saw hearts in the chat. Yeah, appreciating what you shared. Beautiful. Thank you. Right on time I heard you this morning Claire. It's great. Lydia says I often find in Nikki's guidance so timely. Oh, that's, that's sweet isn't that. It's pretty wild right things. I have to say I've often found in a various times when I've listened to Dharma talks myself and various offerings. Things can be timely so I appreciate that, that it does feel timely. Both for Claire and Lydia. Thank you. Thank you for those gifts. And the floor is open. If any other reflections questions. Any other discoveries. Abraham. Thanks. For many years, my brother has been the source of what to do for me. And, and I've done a lot of loving kindness for him and it's been really wonderful. It's just, I went to see him today, so various reasons, causes and conditions he is very separated from the rest of the family I'm the only one who goes to see him. And it's hard. And the previous time that I went to see him I was just really going like wow I don't know how much longer I can do this. What do you get out of meditation, why do you go on retreat, you don't do anything that kind of a miss and throw a real grump. And so just to do equanimity you know, I see your suffering he's really suffering. And just connect with my compassion for him, and just leave it be at that was very timely today so thank you for doing equanimity I needed it. Thank you Abraham, thank you so much for sharing the story of your practice with with your kin with your sibling with so much heart. Yeah, thank you. Beautiful. Oh, look at all those hearts going. Yeah. And zoom. Beautiful. Thank you, Sangha. And with the practice of equanimity and care, because equanimity is not a loop, it definitely has a sense of care and and well being going to turn into practice into small groups. One more reflection, Elaine says I really like them. I really like to mentally say to myself the phrase. I cannot make your choices for you. This is really helpful when I am doing my best to care for others. Great. Beautiful. Yeah. And so many phrases and see which one really works for you for for this particular person or being could be unique and that's the one that really connects so thank you Elaine for showing the one sharing the one that's connecting for you right now I cannot make your choices for you. When you're doing best, the best to care. So, with that, we are all invited, dear friends, to practice in small groups in groups of roughly size three. And we'll start with 15 seconds of meta for another. And then, to share as much as little as you wish from what came up for you as a gift to your fellow practitioners and care for yourself care for each other. And, yeah, I think that's all I want to say. So, the rooms are open, take care of yourselves take care of each other. Here you go. Okay, everyone, the rooms are closed, everyone is back. And we have just a few minutes for any reflections. Questions, comments, complaints, especially if you haven't spoken in a while, or tonight. All welcome. What did you discover in the practice or in the conversations. Mary, please. So for me, the person who came to mind was my long term partner, and how much I really believe that I can keep him healthy and happy, and he will not die before I do. And I think that is just, you know, I'm obsessed with it. And I always have been, and we have great humor about it. But I encountered how equanimity about his dying is worse, it is harder for me than equanimity about my own dying. And I know I want to go before you. And, and to have compassion for myself in that stuck place. Oh dear heart, dear heart. Yes, dear heart, your mind wants to control right. Yes, control life who wants to control death. I want it this way. Make it all. Oh, dear heart, dear heart. Yeah. Yeah, part of the human condition we want that right of course, especially with the big things, especially with the big things, especially only the one you named. Yes, this is, I went to go before you or just, yeah, so common. Thank you for gosh thank you for bringing that in Mary, thank you for sharing that. And also, the humor and the compassion for yourself. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. And thanks for letting it be witnessed. Thank you. Yeah, so powerful is really the both with Mary's comment and, and every time a any of you really share something about your practice and allowing others to witness it both supports others. And there is such a beauty and graced being witnessed by other human beings by other caring consciousnesses like yes yes we see you we see your gift we see your beauty we see your challenges. It's, it's, it's so different from practicing on our own alone with with our own stuff when we share it just something shifts, I think profound happens so. So thank you for for offering sharing. Mary says it is so freeing to sit in equanimity, especially at the end of the day of work. Yes. What a great point. Come in to end on after a day of work sitting in equanimity there's a sense of ease right more flow, but I feel to having practice with you, because of course I always practice with you when I leave these practices. So, so thank you all. Thank you for the gift of your practice the gift of your being and cultivating your heart your mind your being for the sake of yourself and all beings come in contact with you directly and indirectly. And you all be well, you all be free and happy. Thank you.
