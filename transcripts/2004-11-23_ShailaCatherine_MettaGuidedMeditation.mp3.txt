 Begin by feeling the breath. Just sensing, with the beauty of acceptance, all of the qualities of being alive. Just being able to feel. Feeling your own presence. Feeling the experience of the breath. Feeling the body. The capacity to feel heat and coolness. Vibration and movement. Being able to have an intention for the good. Take some action toward that aim. Set in the Buddhist teachings that it is rare and precious to attain a human birth. Feel the worthiness of simply being you, alive now. And begin to generate aspirations of kindness and care towards your life. Towards the preciousness of this birth. May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm. May I be happy. Just as I am. May I be healthy, free from physical suffering. And may I live in this world with ease, free from conflict. Begin your own phrases, sensitive to the quality of loving kindness. Regenerating loving kindness with yourself is the primary focus. Let the meaning of the phrase is deep in. What is true safety? What is the deepest happiness? What does it mean to be free from pain in a world where pain is inevitable? Not to think discursively, but to let each phrase touch you so that you contemplate what this quality of loving kindness actually is. Sensing its boundless nature. And extending the arena of loving kindness towards a benefactor. Taking a moment first to connect with that sense of the benefactor. And then letting the benefactor into your heart. And extending the loving kindness towards dear friends. And becoming sensitive to any quality of lightness or ease in the mind. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. And bringing in a neutral person to offer loving kindness to somebody who we neither have strong attachment towards nor aversion towards. Any natural caring that arises. Any natural caring that arises. And now including somebody who is difficult. Somebody who you have had some difficulty with, some conflict or some judgement towards. And consider that this person too wants to be happy in just the same way as you do. Just as I wish to be safe and free from harm. So may you be free from harm. Just as I wish to be happy. So may you be happy. May we be healthy and strong, free from pain. And may we live with ease. You might use the person's name, you might say you, you might use the pronoun we. May what works for you to help welcome this difficult person into your field of kindness. What helps you connect with those that are difficult. What helps you connect with those that are difficult. What helps you connect with those that are difficult. What helps you connect with those that are difficult. What helps you connect with those that are difficult. What helps you connect with those that are difficult. And then returning to the category of self. May I be safe and protected from harm. Let that wish wash through you. May I be happy, free from mental distress. May I be healthy, free from illness and pain. And may I live with ease in the world. As if there is an intention of kindness within you. And bring your awareness to feel the infinite aspect to kindness. Its potential to meet all beings without distinction. And begin to allow that quality of metta to radiate out from the center of your being. What's those that are near that sit in this room with us. May we all be safe and protected from danger. May we all be happy. May we be healthy and strong. And may we have ease of well being. Allow the loving kindness to fill the room so that all beings, the people and the insects alike are filled with this experience of kindness. And let that loving kindness expand to all in the city. Let all the people, the animals, the dogs, the cats, the birds. May all those in the city, in the vicinity be surrounded by love. And let the kindness extend yet further to a wider region, perhaps the entire Bay Area. Sensing the multitude of beings that live in this area. The birds, the seagulls, the fish in the bay. The people that are hurrying from here to there. May all these beings, those that we know and those that we don't know, live in safety, in happiness, free from pain, free from conflict. And allow that kindness to naturally extend further. Slowly expanding across the continent, across the ocean. Surrounding every living being with loving kindness, with good will. So that we bear no ill will, no wishes of harm towards anyone or anything. May all beings live with love. And extend that love through the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere to the east and to the west. Towards people that you know and people that you don't know. Cultures that are familiar and cultures that are unfamiliar. All forms of life. Is the quality of mentor that holds nothing back. That extends kindness impartially. May all beings everywhere be safe and protected from inner and outer harm. May all beings everywhere be happy, free from mental distress. May all beings everywhere be healthy and strong, free from physical suffering. And may all beings meet their needs in this world with ease. Using your own phrases and your own rhythm to extend kindness towards all beings without distinction. Thank you.
