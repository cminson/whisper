Practice Note: Investigating E ase

For me, t he concept or experience that is the central 
reference point for the D harma, for practice, for 
mindfulness, for finding a life that brings freedo m to us 
all, is the idea of ease . How can you live a life of greater 
ease? How can you be more at ease as you go through 
your life or through any experience or  situation?  
 
Part of the investigation of ease is to un derstand how 
we feel uneasy. How do we lose our ease? If you have 
a modicum of ease – it doesn’t have to be much – 
notice  what you do to sacrifice , give up or lose  that 
ease . Many people don’ t reflect on this. They wake up 
in the morning , and maybe they su ccessfully get out the 
door without feeling too stressed , but then at some point 
in the day, they get caught up in some sort of unease, 
stress, distress , or some psychological  or emotional 
challenge. The transition from being relaxed to not 
being relaxed c an happen very quickly , without a clear 
understanding of what’s going on. A function of 
mindfulness practice is to see what happens in the  
transition from having a mod icum of relaxation, to being not relaxed – to notice ease and then unease. W hat 
happens there?   
 
What have you done? What is your role? What is your 
contribution to the loss of your ease? What idea have 
you picked up? What emotion have you stepped into or 
embodied , and have let carry you along? What beliefs 
are operating? What desires ? What wishes and 
expectations are you carry ing? What is happening in 
that transition? You will almost certainly have a role.  
What’s that role? If you can see what you are 
contributing , then you can ask this great question:  
Whatever you believe, whatever you want, 
whatever you don’t want, whatever you’re expecting  
– is it worthwhile to give up the ease you had?   
 
If you ask yourself the question , “Is it worth giving up 
your ease ?” and grapple and struggle with it, then the 
hope is that one d ay, you might come to the realiz ation , 
which is a p araphrase of the Buddha’s  realiz ation , that 
nothing whatsoever is worth losing your ease over.  
 
Isn’t that a remarkable thing?  You can still live a 
responsible life and take care of yourself in the world , 
but mayb e you don’t have to lose your ease in doing so. 
I offer this  as your theme for a whole year. The theme of 
looking at ease, the loss of ease , and your relationship 
to the loss of ease. What do you do? What goes on for 
you? Use the si mple idea of ease as a m irror: a  mirror for you, a mirror for the Dharma and a mirror for greater 
peace throughout the year.
