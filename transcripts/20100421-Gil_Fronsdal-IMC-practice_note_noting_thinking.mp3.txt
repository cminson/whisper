One of the very  useful things to be mindful of is 
noticing, as quickly as you can, when you start 
thinking in meditation. Or if you are constantly 
thinking, notice that. But, in the course of your sitting, 
or your walking, to very clearly name, or note, 
‘thinking ’ when you ’re thinking. To have a very clea r 
acknowledgement, recognition, “Oh now I ’m thinking. 
Here is a mind that ’s thinking. These are thoughts  or 
images, t hat are bubbling up. ” 
 
To have a clear recognition of it when  you are not 
living in the thoughts – you’re a little bit pulled back. 
It’s a bit like you ’re viewing it, as opposed to being in 
the thoughts. And then to be  content that if you ’re 
recogniz ing that you ’re thinking, you ’re being mindful. 
You don ’t have to stop thinking. You don ’t have to be 
at war with your thinking . But to have a very clea r 
recognition, “Oh I’m thinking, ” and to be ready and 
alert enough to do it as often as you need  to. 
 
Sometimes if you ’re following the breath, which is one 
of the core p ractices, it ’s easy to get focu sed on the 
breath, but in the background to have this constant 
churning of thinking about things. And so the very 
simple naming it, “Thinking, thinking ” – being  alert 2 enough to notice when t hinking comes into play again, 
“I’m thinking, thinking. ” And if all you did, in the course 
of 45 minutes of sitting, was just to note, ‘thinking, ’ 
and let go of it, it would be a very significant session 
of meditation.  
 
One of the reasons why it ’s so powerful to note 
thinking is that thinking lies at the foundation of many 
of our problems. It ’s one way to address al l your 
problems – say your problems are a building, like a 
ten-storey building – you could take care of all the 
problems that are on the tenth  floor, the ninth  floor, 
and the eighth  floor. Or you can just pull out the 
cornerstone , and the whole thing comes crumbling 
down. Maybe that ’s not a very nice image , but to be 
able to see thinking and not stay involved in the 
thinking  – to step back  – is like pulling the corne rstone 
out from a lot of things;  it makes life a lot easier. You 
might try it.
