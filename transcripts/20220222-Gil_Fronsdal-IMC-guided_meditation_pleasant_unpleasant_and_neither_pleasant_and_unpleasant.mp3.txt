 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning, everyone, and welcome to 0200222222. That's truly a Tuesday. And happy to be back here. And I had a nice visit with my father. So to jump in, we're beginning with the topic of feelings, feeling tones. And to be very simple about it, the idea, the theory in Buddhism, is that all experiences have three tonalities, three feeling tones. They are either pleasant or they're unpleasant or they're neither pleasant or unpleasant. And one of the reasons this is significant is that one of the primary ways in which the mind gets activated to be for and against things, to move towards things and move away from things, is whether they're pleasant or unpleasant. And exactly a relationship to what is neither pleasant or unpleasant is variable. And so if we bring attention to the pleasant, unpleasant, neither unpleasant nor unpleasant, it gives us a...and if everything has this quality, everything has characterized us somewhere with this tonality, that we can...if we notice that, we notice we have a big handle, big perspective on noticing how we react. So in this meditation, as we're sitting here, and if you would...maybe notice, as you do your regular meditation practice, mindfulness practice, whether the experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neither, those two. But more importantly, notice if there's even the slightest little movement for or against, or moving towards or moving away from. Just that very simple, what is the response in our system? Our somatic, our psychological, psychic, psychological system. And can you notice the ever so slight or very great movement away from or towards, away from the unpleasant, towards the pleasant, or being in favor for the pleasant? Oh yes, that's good. And being...have an unfavorable reaction to the unpleasant, or that, oh no, not that again, or something. And as I said, it can be very subtle, it can be a slight shift in the texture, or the size, or the strength of the awareness, and it could get shut down on one side and kind of open up in the other. Or it could be quite strong, the whole body can move, or the mind can get spin out into kinds of thoughts and reaction one way or the other. So let's begin with that, and then I'll talk more about it. So taking a comfortable, alert posture, and gently closing the eyes, and then scan through your body to see... there are probably pleasant and unpleasant sensations in your body as you sit here. And scan through your body and just calmly recognize the pleasant and the unpleasant ones. And as you do, do you notice any simple movement for for and against, wanting and not wanting, moving towards, moving away? What is the response to being aware of pleasant and unpleasant? Scanning around your body for the pleasant and unpleasant, and just not lingering any one place for long, just like an inventory. And then bringing your attention to your breathing, taking some long, slow breaths, and if possible, breathe in a pleasant way. So long, slow, gentle, deep breath, in, and a long exhale where you relax and let go. And letting your breathing return to normal. Continue to, and exhale, maybe breathing in normally, but ever so slightly exhaling longer than normal. And in the exhale, letting go, relaxing the face, the shoulders, the belly, anywhere in the body. And then exhale, and exhale, and exhale, and exhale, and exhale, and exhale, and exhale, and then letting your breathing turn to normal completely, and tuning in now to the simple experience of breathing. And noticing, are there parts of the breathing that are more pleasant? Maybe some that are unpleasant. And are you kind of equanimous either way, or is there in fact some very simple being for or against, wanting or not wanting, moving towards or moving away with what is pleasant and unpleasant in the experience of breathing......... And if other things in your experience come into awareness besides the breathing, be mindful of whether it's a pleasant or an unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant experience. And also see if you can notice any, if there are any ways in which you are responding, reacting to the pleasant or unpleasantness of it............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
