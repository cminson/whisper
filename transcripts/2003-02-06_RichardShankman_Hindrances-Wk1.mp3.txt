 Probably most of you know, but some of you may not be aware that this is starting tonight as a five-week series on the hindrances. So some of you may know that or some of you may have just dropped by for the normal Thursday night sit, but that's what it's going to be. And so it'll be the normal format. Let me just give you a little overview of how we're going to do it. It'll be the normal format of starting with a sit. We'll do the half-hour sitting. And then it's going to be a mix of I hope we'll mostly have a lot of rich discussion. There'll also be some talking and teaching. Tonight of all the nights will be more weighted towards. I want to set the sort of the foundation. So I've got certain material I want us to cover tonight to make sure we're all clear about sort of the basics and we'll see how much time there is for discussion. There's going to be some homework for those of you who care to do it. I'll hand out. I've got a couple of handouts here. We'll give out in a little while. Just like the sitting practice, I would encourage people to take on the homework practice. It's not anything you have to study or learn. It's just some practice to do. Because whatever we learn and talk about and study, my opinion of it anyway is that it's really of no use unless it's directly applicable. We can put it into practice. It has a direct effect on the quality of our lives. It comes down to this idea of looking at our lives as really just one constant stream of either wise and skillful action or sometimes not so wise and not so skillful action. Wise and skillful meaning that it's leading towards more freedom and more happiness. Well, my name is Richard Shankman and we could go around, I guess it's a big group and I don't know if we won't take the time tonight to go around to everyone's name. Well, what I would say that the real answer about, I don't know if you heard what he said, he was kind of making jokes, because I know Steve real well. He said, well, you should give some credentials. Why should people listen to you? That's actually a deep question. Because if you know the Buddha himself, many of you are familiar with this famous sutta discourse called the columnist sutta, where some people are asking the Buddha. You didn't realize that. But anyway, asking the Buddha, well, you know, all these different teachers are coming through and they're all saying, well, this is the way it is. This is the truth. I'm this fully enlightened teacher. I know how it is and all those other teachers, no, no, they don't have it right. And then another teacher would come and say, no, no, no, that guy, he wasn't right. I'm actually the one who's enlightened. It's like this and they're all saying opposite things, different things and it's real confusing. How could you know which is right? And so I can't quote it exactly, but this sort of the the sentiment or the essence of what he was trying to convey was that you don't go by somebody's reputation and you don't go by, you know, just because like he would even say about himself, you know, just because I'm that he didn't call himself the Buddha. He called himself the tathagata. Deferred to himself with the tathagata. So just because the tathagata says, you know, no, no, you don't go by that. You don't go by it even because you think it sounds good. That's not a good reason because our minds aren't free. So we don't know what colors our thought process. And you go to this whole list, he goes, what you really do is you watch it someone who's teaching. So we won't have an opportunity to that because it's kind of like if you're living with someone and you're around them a lot. But you would really observe them. Are they putting the teachings into practice? Right. How do they live? You really investigate their teachings and you put it into practice and you see what the result is. Kind of that's the sort of the idea. Now that's a little tricky because it'd be possible to get on a wrong track and you might end up years down the road before you've put in the practice and realize it was actually harmful. So, you know, we're going to be have some discrimination around it. But in general, and it's a great introduction actually to the hindrances that we're going to talk about. Because the whole idea is you can see for yourself. It doesn't matter if you know if I don't even know what I'm talking about or not. The analogy some of you have heard me use is the clothes shopping analogy, but it's great. So when you go, I'm not much of a clothes shopper myself, but for those of you are, you know, you're shopping for clothes and so you're there and there's the rack and all the clothes are hanging there. So if something looks interesting, you take it off and try it on. How's it fit? How's it look? If you like it, you keep it. If you don't like it, no big deal. Stick it back on the rack and just keep moving along. It's the same thing for this. Is it helpful? Is it wise and skillful as applied into one's life towards leading us towards freedom, liberation, more happiness, whatever we may have in mind that we want. If so, you keep it. You use it, apply it. And we're going to get to do that over this and four more sessions over the next these weeks. Actually, that's why you do the homework. And look to see. We're actually going to take the Buddha's exact advice on the Kalama suit. But to answer the question really is that, yeah, I just I think if you're around long enough you tend to bubble up and so Gil invited me and asked me to do the series on the on the five hindrances. I live in Santa Cruz and I teach around here and there in the Bay Area. And I've been meditating for a while. So that's the answer. Okay, so let's take a side check. So what we're going to do is we're going to be a mix of there's going to be some talks like some teaching, discussion, practice. Next week, I'm planning to actually bring, it's not going to be a sutta study evening, but we'll take a little bit of the time. I don't want to take too much of it. Actually bring some of the sutta's and actually look at the original discourses and how they talked about how these teachings were actually passed down in these original discourses in scripture. So we don't get to look at some. You can have them. Some of you may be familiar with those scriptures, earliest Pali sutta's and some of you may not. So that'll be kind of interesting just to look. There it is right there where there's the Buddha talking. So we'll just do a mix of a lot of things. Any question about their comment? So tonight I wanted to do kind of an overview of just what are these things we call the hindrances and we'll actually talk about them to an overview. Next week, then I'm hoping we'll start to actually then go, since we've done some homework and we'll have some discussion, we'll actually start going into them one or two weeks night for the remaining four and really go into them deeper. So if if you're around long enough in the meditation world, in the Buddhist world, it doesn't take long before you hear the basic say meditation instructions, right? We start working with the breath and we develop a little concentration or we try to and we develop mindfulness. In the service of as skillful means, wise and skillful action, of learning to let go or to not cling to anything, right? We talk about not clinging. The first noble truth is that there's this unsatisfactoriness or suffering. The cause of it is clinging to things and then this the second noble truth is that the cause of the clinging is desire. That's one of the hindrances we'll get to in a minute and that there's an end of that, there's a freedom from that grasping and clinging. It's a really, you know, just conceptually it's quite simple. There's quite a bit contained in that. The idea being, we could do a whole day talking about not clinging and what it means about the teachings of emptiness and not self and all that stuff. But the idea is that any time we cling to anything, we identify anything as a sort of fixed sense of who we think we are. It's a setup for suffering. That's what doesn't mean we're necessarily suffering, but it's setting the seeds of condition, the conditions for suffering. So as we let go of clinging to any fixed thing that we have to be or any fixed way life has to be, we're just more open. If you want us one way to think of it, it's just a more harmonious openness to the natural expression of just life as it is without us getting in the way. And we're just more in harmony, in flow with life. It's kind of one way to think about it. And so that's why often the meditation instructions of mindfulness are whatever is predominant in awareness. We just meet it with mindfulness. And there's no judging about what the experience is. We're not saying, oh I can only have these experiences and they're okay to arise. But these are experiences are not okay to arise. We're saying that whatever the experiences is that we're not looking to the experience to be any set way, in pleasant or unpleasant as a matter. We're just finding a freedom that's contained in the midst of any experience. So it's more about our relationship with the experience. So if that's true, why do we select certain range of experiences and put this label of hindrances on them? Because we're going to go through this list. There's these five hindrances. I'm going to give you a hand out. We're going to talk about them. There's certain experiences or certain mind states that we're giving a special category. We call them hindrances. That's kind of not good, right? All of a sudden, wait a minute, that's that's kind of a disconnect from when we're saying fully just open to whatever is present in the moment without us being able to see it. So there's kind of a difference there, right? So we're going to talk about that a little more. I just wanted to kind of put that out as something to be aware of. So if the teaching is about, you know, the Buddhist summarize is teaching in one sentence. He said, nothing should be clung to his eye, me or mine. And he goes on to say, well, I'm not going to be able to see it. And he goes on to say one who knows that, you know, knows the whole Dharma. And by knowing the Dharma one is fully liberated. And he goes on and on like that. Very simple. A lot contained in that, but it's kind of simple. So that's it. Don't cling. No big deal. But if we say don't cling, obviously we can't do it, right? You can do it in the moment. But once the right conditions come together, we'll be hooked right in. And we're lost. We label certain states of the mind and the heart hindrances because those are the mind states that tend to hook us. That's the problem with them. It's where we tend to really contract around them, get identified with them, get caught in them suffering. That's the idea. So we want to pay special attention there, even though ultimately we can say whatever they're empty, they're not self. It's just a changing flow of experience not to be. But we have to look there because that's what keeps us from seeing that. So. And let me see here. So what I want to do is I'd like to hand out the first of the two sheets. I'll hand out the I'll hand out the homework sheet separately, but let me just hand this sheet around. So I made 40 copies. I didn't have any idea how many of you there. I thought that'd be a lot extra. And I counted exactly 40 people. It just I think happened to work out. So we'll see. And if we're short, then I'll make more for next time and you can just, you know, if you would just share. But I want to keep one. So that's 39. So. So. So. Does anyone not have a sheet? So we actually had some extra. So we have one extra. Two extra. Did you get one for yourself? Do you want one? Okay. Oh, so we had a few extra. Great. Great. So what I did on this sheet was so you'll notice I put some poly names on here. The poly is not important at all. It doesn't matter. But I put it in there because some people do like to know that. And I've actually my experience has been so so so the poly was the language that this particular set of these sutas these discourses were preserved in. So it's been around for several thousand years. So some people like to know that a little bit just to kind of connect them to the tradition. That's fine. I've found that for some people it's actually a turnoff to put the some aversion. The second hindrance actually comes up for them when they see the poly. And so but if that's true just forget about the poly. It's like that clothes shopping thing. It's just not for you and it's no problem. Okay, don't worry about it, but it's there just for people who'd like it. And if anybody's interested offline there's on the pronunciation. Well, I could show you a couple a few simple things on the poly pronunciation another time. So the first what I've done here is on this list there are these five hindrances. So let me just list what they are. The first one in the sort of the classical list it says sense desire. And that's this word chunda that come as the sense, but it's desire. It's qualities just you know, you could substitute greed grasping clinging wanting I put underneath over on the other side craving which is the tunha. It's holding on to things. All right wanting that's the first hindrance. The second one is the opposite. The first one is actually pulling something towards us wanting to hold on to it. It's the senses this motion pulling towards me. The second one is the opposite. It's of pushing away. There's an experience that I don't want to experience. So they call it ill will aversion hate. The third one is what's traditionally called sloth and torpor and in the poly here the tinnum midha is actually the opposite the tinnas the torpor and the mid has the sloth but that's just how they list it. But sloth and torpor is uh, well, you can see under the qualities of it heaviness dullness sleepiness. I think there's probably not a person a meditator alive who doesn't know that one, you know in meditation, right? The mind is just dull or you're falling asleep. You just can't focus. It's just feels like a thick blanket just over your mind. Sloth and torpor and then the opposite of that one is restlessness where there's too much energy and that's the one when you're say, for example and these aren't just in meditation they're in life, but say you're sitting in meditation and you don't think you can sit there another moment you're going to jump out of your skin. Okay I don't have to make too big of a deal about it. It's just a hindrance arising. It's just restlessness. Remorse is kind of connected into that's this other word, kukucha. C has a ch sound even if in poly because remorse can be a thing that can stir us up. We'll get into this more about some of the things that can fuel us. Sometimes if we've got a lot of energy and maybe there's something going on underneath it that's on the mind. Oh that person said this to me today and I shouldn't have. It's we can think of it remorse might be kind of a it's a generic term so that can fuel a lot of energy and restlessness when there's things stirring up the mind. Okay and then the fifth one is doubt. Doubt will that's the last one we're going to talk about and the last and the fifth Thursday we'll really spend some time on that one because that's really insidious. So those are the five hindrances. Now if we look down below I'll just don't worry about the antidote side we're going to get over that and talk about that in a little bit. Under the simile there is a suta that we'll just take a brief look at next week and I just thought it was interesting that they it gives us flavor of the hindrance so for the desire the craving the clinging that that first simile it's the image is if you want to see your reflection in a in a pool of water that's just still perfectly still you can look and see a reflection very clearly or another image is if I want to see to the bottom if the water is just clear and still so if we want to see things clearly if we want to see the places where we're getting caught where we're identified where sufferings arising right the word the pasana is traditionally we tend to translate it as clear to see clearly the pasana comes from the polyverb pasati which means to see the ve actually has the I don't really know the etymology but Andy Olinsky some of you know him he's a poly scholar he says it's kind of like it's a pulling apart the image is if you've got these weeds and you want to see to the ground and you put your hands together and you plunge your hands down through the weeds and then push them apart you can see to the ground it's that pulling apart to be able to see deeply into something that's the vipassana to look deeply into the nature of ourselves and the nature of reality and when we can see things clearly what's really going on we're not caught up into in the surface appearance of things and we're not caught in in illusion or delusion that's another way that things get talked about so we're trying to see clearly so the image is that pond then to see clearly so once again the hindrances are these energies or mind states where we it tends to cloud over so that desire is likened to the water being mixed with all different colors we it colors our perceptions of things you know so there might be someone we look at and we really have a lot of interest or attraction it like colors our entire attitudes our our just everything has changed our relationship with them that person might change it's colored everything someone else that we don't have an attraction to maybe it's it hasn't we're just kind of neutral maybe it hasn't added so it's just kind of a way they talk about it's like it's like it's colored everything the aversion is like boiling water you still can't see your reflection or see to the bottom but it's different and that i have this it's like if i'm boiling with anger or just the energy's coming up it's hot it's painful okay the sloth and torpor not this one i really like it's like water covered with moss right that's exactly it's just just just thick it's it's it's yeah or it could be like the water filled with algae and just mucky there's no clarity the restlessness is like water agitated by wind so if a wind blows across the surface it's like too much energy and makes a ripple it's all agitated and then you know it makes sense and then the doubt is like muddy water we just don't see things right it it will get a lot more into this doubt but it uh the actual quality of our seeing has been maybe we can talk about a little more if we want but an example i have is um i remember being this has happened to me more than once on retreat it was near the beginning of the retreat i hadn't really settled down deeply and then i really had this just deep everything was going fine i was meditating oh and i remember that's right i was in this place back east and these geese flew over and they were kind of just had this this longing echoey haunting honking sound that they would make as they're flying off into the distance these geese and i kind of got in this wistful space and next thing you know that kind of turned into this longing and then i got into this loneliness it just kept spiraling down down down and before long i was just in this despair and depression and i was in a long retreat i did you know no i wasn't going to be getting out of there anytime soon and there was nobody to talk to and i just was so you know you know an hour ago it was great now just this this mind state arose and it colored my whole perception and the thoughts were you know i'm nothing my life is nothing i'm nobody no one would love it's just all that stuff started coming and it was in the moment it's real it's like it's there's mud it's colored over the the perception of everything so you see it through that lens of doubt this meditation it what's it good for nothing's you know my life is hopeless is really it was just you're in this pit of despair just to give an example right it was painful over time you know it took some time it was a few hours and it was you know suffering and everything and then it it changed and later on that night and the next day and i was fine it didn't seem hopeless well you know everything was great what which one of those was real you know it's not real or not real it's just that was the experience then then it was this experience in that moment it feels real we're in it we don't see clearly so when we're caught in it we're identified with it we suffer so we'll learn the ways we're going to talk about well how do we work with these hindrances then what are the ways to work with so let me just stop for a moment that's just a quick overview any thoughts or comments or questions yeah well i would put confusion uh under doubt you know it's just another there's a lot of different ways but confusion would you could call it doubt it would fall in that broad category yeah so doubt you know these are generic terms they cover a lot so for example the first one of sense desire you know we use these very strong uh words it's like sense desire gosh it just sounds so strong and like greed you know that's such a strong word but you know also include just the minor things of there's very subtle versions of it and they may not be a problem because they're not very strong so it may not be a big deal but it's even a slight wanting if we're caught in it it's a hindrance so confusion would be an interesting one to talk about uh we have to look like what's in the confusion if we're really not if we're not if we're confused let's see um well we're not seen clearly we don't know which way to go uh we're just kind of stuck right because that's the feeling i get when i use the word confusion i don't know you might have other feeling about it okay but maybe that'll be something good for us yeah so i'm hoping we can maybe then we'll have some more discussion if you care to later you uh feel free to bring it up and we can play with it and explore some of these things and then the question is when we're in confusion what do we do what can we do how do we approach it we're going to get into specific strategies later on today i'm going to lay out just some generic strategies that we can talk about yeah in working with the hindrances if i apply them to my meditation practice uh then i i sort of think of them one way but i sort of get the feeling that you're saying that these are hindrances to just sort of our daily life throughout the day and and i'd like to have some idea yeah yeah i'm not drawing a distinction between the meditation practice that they are so life is there is a distinction between meditation practice it's very specialized right in our normal daily life we're not sitting there with our eyes closed or if you do as you know styles with your eyes open and it's a very special practice but it's just a moment of experience just like life each moment is just a moment of living and being it just happens when we meditate it's a life it's a moment of moment and being that looks a certain way you know you're sitting a certain way right so now we there's reasons why we want to take specialized time because in order to develop the qualities of mind we need to see clearly and in order to develop the qualities of mind so we're not so hooked by these difficult mind states we do need to develop a certain amount of stability of mind and mindfulness and so we want to cultivate that it's just like we go to the gym to work out you know when you're walking around the day you're using your muscles but we want to specifically really work on them so we do special exercises here we're working on the mind we do special exercises so in that sense there's a difference between daily life and meditation of course that's true but in a broader sense um i'm just lumping them all together is just life so that would apply to meditation practice all of this applies anything that applies to meditation practice applies to any other time right that's how i would say it does that is that's what do you think does that satisfy you or not quite but maybe you'll answer in the next yeah well well what do you think yeah go ahead but the things i'm thinking about are i'll give you examples then in that i may have doubts about something about my profession about you know some interaction with a person and um then it sort of has to gel in my mind it's not a big issue for me right um but somehow it'll work out but in my spiritual practice then um then i can see these support inspiration faith and dharma yeah are very appropriate right right right i understand so i don't and i don't understand how to apply maybe maybe faith and dharma is something i should apply all day long well that could that's true too i don't know it but then the second example would be on slop and torpor was you know if i take a nap on sunday afternoon i sleep a little bit longer than i supposed to i'm gonna wake up and i'm gonna really feel heavy dull and i don't have to develop some energy some way and it usually takes a half an hour an hour so i don't think that that's a very difficult state i know it's going to happen and okay but if i'm in a meditation situation and i start developing that then i'm just going to be nodding right yes right there's a distinction i understand yes that's a great distinction thank you for bringing that up because you point to something that's very important so um i would like to propose that this isn't like i don't think it's an official dharma teaching anywhere it's just me saying this all right so i'm just that's the caveat here i would like to propose that all of the buddhist teachings all the practices the entire path is only about skillfulness it's all summed up in what's wise and skillful that's all we need to know that we need to know a little more than that sometimes you know it's what does that really mean and how do we apply it but you could summarize it in that way here we are we we are live we exist we're in this thing called the human condition so moment by moment what are we going to do each moment we're going to do something we're going to think something we're going to say something we're going to do something so it's all about what's wise and skillful and what's wonderful about that is then there's no right or correct action that we can give as a general rule in every situation it totally depends upon the specific situation who we are what we bring to the situation what is needed that's the reason that the buddha taught many many practices and it's the reason also why when people would come to the buddha sometimes he would maybe you asked a question sometimes the buddha would answer just give a direct answer sometimes he would just refuse to answer sometimes he would just say well you should go off and do whatever you you think is right so you didn't have a fixed doctrine he was trying to in that moment for that person for that situation give what he thought was wise and skillful and helpful so it's the same thing in our lives so the way to take this this teachings on the hindrances is if it's not a problem and if it's not a big deal well then that's not the time to be thinking about the hindrances we'll be thinking we'll be dealing something else so for example if we're taking a sunday afternoon and whatever and you know it's sunday i'm sleeping in i'm gonna sleep later i know it's gonna make me tired but so what i can hang out on the couch i can watch the game i can do whatever i don't know whatever you do go it's not a problem we're not suffering in that moment uh we may not need to deal with i don't know or if you're at work you're using this word doubt i'm making a i am making a distinction or the teachings make a distinction between what you might call discrimination and maybe having to get clear about something so someone said something and you're not sure if it's the right course of action or i'm not sure exactly what you're referring to but it could be you know anything like that is this right well i'm not sure you need to go through a process to figure it out i guess you could call that a doubt but it's just a process of getting clear and everything that to me is different than sort of our a deep personal doubt that undermines our ability to function as human beings or undermines even our faith that is this practice going to work it's it paralyzes this kind of doubt gets us more into confusion indecision we don't know what to do it just cuts the legs out from under everything it's a different it's different than so then in that situation we need to approach it differently so actually does what is that okay that actually brings me then to how do we work with the hindrances or let me just say this how do we work with these experiences i don't want to call them hindrances there's just these experiences that arise they're not always a hindrance right is restlessness always a hindrance if you've ever sat in meditation with strong restlessness i mean really like a real attack of restlessness it's pretty it's hard to do i've sat down to meditation sometimes and it wasn't even a decision next thing i know my body's just just up and got up and it's moving it was just so impelled by so much force so restlessness is strong it's not necessarily a hindrance right could be a hindrance or it could just be an unpleasant sensation arising we don't view it as a hindrance right so maybe we this list is called the hindrances but i would say that the qualities on here uh move in and out of of actually being hindrances really we're going to talk about that's what we're going to get to in just a minute yes so yeah no it's just a list yeah yeah right so so it's just a list and it's five different kinds of qualities there could be other qualities maybe that don't map onto this possibly that's fine so this is not meant to say that every difficulty you've ever had in your life could fit in this although although well let me just give it a shot at something here i would propose that well first of all one if any experience that we can take one of the qualities that's described to it in this teaching is is that that they could that any there's an experience and then it can either have it can either have a pleasant unpleasant or a neutral quality to it there's the experience itself and then there's the pleasantness itself or there's the experience and the unpleasantness or sometimes it can be a neutral this right i would you know maybe someone's got something else to say but i would i'm suggesting that there pleasant unpleasant and neutral which is different than desire and ill will we're going to get to that in a second but the pleasant unpleasant and neutralness itself there's no experience that doesn't have one of those kinds of qualities about it it's either pleasant or it's unpleasant or it's neither one of those two it's neutral there could be another thing but you know we could you know think about it but i'm i'm i'm going to make a bold statement here that that's true no experience that's not either plus sometimes it's subtle and we can't tell and maybe it's kind of neutral so and and by the way you don't have to agree or disagree i'm just putting that out there i'm just want to sort of put that and let it sit there for a minute and as it is this cooks because this is all going to cook and maybe tonight or in a week or a couple of weeks we come back and if we're cooking then maybe something great will come up and we'll have discussions and people somebody might say no that's ridiculous and we'll get it that'd be great actually i don't mean to be looking over to you when i'm saying that's i was just looking around but really as we're going to kick this around and that's that's the point okay let's just say that's true and it is true okay that's all right where we get hooked is because the way we tend to live our lives is many of us most of us most of the time is what is it that we want our lives are set up to to be happy we want more of the pleasant and less of the unpleasant right whatever that means whether it's physical sensations experiences thoughts mind states feelings like i'd like to feel happy or to feel good i don't want to feel bad feeling bad is unpleasant whatever that means so what happens is if we it's if we can just be present mindfully with say i'm sitting in meditation say there's knee pain it's unpleasant if i can notice it i can still be actually quite free i can there's the pain itself there's the unpleasantness doesn't mean i'm hooked necessarily still not a problem when i'm hooked into this it becomes a hindrance when the aversion kicks in because when things get really strongly unpleasant we get in aversion to the unpleasant and conversely if it gets very pleasant so for example tonight i just happened to be having a very pleasant meditation i was kind of getting into it and it was like i just didn't i kind of didn't want to stop i was looking at the and i actually did have a little clinging i wanted to take one more breath i was just having a real nice meditation one more of those you know and so i was kind of it wasn't that big of a deal but a little bit i was kind of clinging to it wasn't that strong so i didn't suffer that much there was the breath there was a kind of pleasantness to it and then i was clinging on to that pleasant i wanted a little more that's when they turn over into hindrances right so the reason we start labeling these things as hindrances is for this exact reason we want to start noticing when we get hooked in the experience when we're not able to be free and it's not about the experiences about whether we can be free with it and any experience and by the way there's not a should we're not saying you should be free you should be mindful no should there's never any shouldn't any of this stuff that's great we just want to acknowledge that when we're hooked we suffer and we need a lot of compassion it's not a should we just got caught in that time we weren't able to be present with it we've got caught that we're in aversion now okay so we could all make extreme examples of like let's just take the first one sense desire here i want we want to look at it in the more extreme cases because that's when we tend to get hooked right if it's just like boy that chocolate chip cookie looks pretty good and you want it that's a little wanting maybe it's no big deal you eat it you don't eat it whatever we really get strong when we get into more desire and craving we all can experience the times when we have it we can't get what we want we're desiring it we're craving we want more we're holding on it's unpleasant right it's suffering same thing if there's something difficult going on if we're in aversion it's the aversion itself that's causing the suffering it's not the experience it's the ability to be present with the experience it's that's a version that's when we're suffering so we can always look to see if there's suffering you don't have to look i mean we know when we're suffering the problem is we get in an automatic reaction when there's suffering rather than seeing it as a friend just like a good friend would come up and you know put their hand on her shoulder and say you know hey richard i just want to point out like um i think you're kind of whatever and kind of steer me in the right direction because i think you're heading down you know you think that's not so good maybe you want to do this that's all suffering is it's just telling us that somewhere there's some grasping and clinging or there's some aversion there's some experience that we're not able to be with in a free way we got hooked somehow so we're suffering right if you have whatever i don't know a broken leg just make up some example if you don't think it's supposed to be any other way than it is it's not a problem i mean that sounds a little i guess that's not such a good example because i mean really it is true right you don't think it's supposed to be any other way which would be well not clinging to suffering you mean clinging to experience go ahead just explain i'm sorry like seeking out the suffering because it's more almost you know how people keep creating suffering right but some people create suffering uh you know it could be just an unconscious pattern that's not seen so we're just it's like anything when we're not that's why we do mindfulness practice if we're not if we're aware of something we have a chance of freedom if we're not aware we're just at the effect we don't even see what's going on we're just living unconsciously and it's just playing out like i'm just a machine it's it's just not comfortable with the change also that's clinging right because of the chain well it's not well yeah i'm still not clear exactly just say people aren't comfortable with change i'm saying that even if they have an aversion to the suffering that they still choose it sometimes you know because are you saying i just want to make sure understand you saying like for example sometimes like i'll just here's an example i've had times in my life where i've been in a particular job or a career that i was pretty miserable and i stayed in that unpleasantness because there was some fear about making a change like i might move is that the kind of thing you're talking about right but then where where there's a few things going on there is um just unpleasant well the job is just the job i mean unpleasant is totally in my mind but that's another thing but so i'm there's the difficulty suffering around the job there's the wanting to get away there's aversion to that situation there's fear i may not be aware of it there's some fear there's something that that staying there's whatever i think might happen that fear is more unpleasant than this unpleasantness right so you know it's all just driving me so there's just a lot of different levels i'm still caught maybe there's some clinging to security i'm not saying we shouldn't do that we all want to be secure so you've got a lot of things going on at once yeah they were having a multiple you know there is such a thing people kind of make a joke but it's called it is a multiple hindrance attack that's when it gets bad where you get like several of these at once so a perfect example is so example is like i'll just take about a meditation so i've had meditation before where maybe you're on retreat and you've been sitting for a long time and you've really kind of gone deep and you're maybe you're blissed out or something like that so that was that sitting it was just wonderful you're like all these experiences are coming it's fantastic a lot of you experienced that stuff yourself i get up from the sitting i do walking practice i come back the very next sitting i'm just in hell where did that go so first i'm clinging because i'm trying to get back instead of being here with this first i'm clinging on holding on trying to hold on and get back to that other experience so i'm clinging i'm in a version to sitting here now with sloth and torpor so i'm also having the sloth and torpor itself which is a hindrance and i'm in a version to it so i'm kind of in clinging and i'm in a version and you know you see you have kind of a multiple attack and that's when you're just really suffering yeah and it's like undeserving that you fall into like a big doubt yeah so maybe that's the thought of things so um you know you can have more of these at once and as i said we're going to go down into these more but i just want to kind of give the idea that it's here's another way to think about it it's it's sort of a some people think it's kind of silly but i think it kind of works that if you think of yourself or think of the mind as being very just stable clear still when i say still everything's still going on but you're not getting jerked around by it and there's just kind of a stillness right just resting deep within yourself free right and then the hindrances come when that when the mind is not when the experience it doesn't matter what the experience is but when the mind gets hooked in and is jerked around so if i'm pulled out towards something and it really has got me or when i'm pulling away from something there's this movement it's trick around or if i'm going up with like it's restless or i'm pushing shoved down it's sloth interprets i'm being moved in these directions right it's taking me off my center and then doubt so i don't know what you all think about that because i think i hope people will you know some of you will may or may or may not come for all of these but you know we're going to talk about more and have more discussion time i want to look over here which says antidote and let me just put this part out and then we'll kind of end it for now we're going to get into those antidotes but basically the way we work with the hindrance remember it's all about what's skillful what's needed in the moment there's no one approach sometimes what's needed when when a hindrance arises there's no antidote we just need to observe it mindfully it's possible observe it mindfully it's possible to have say for example something unpleasant arising in experience and have aversion to it and be perfectly mindful of the unpleasantness and to see the aversion arising and so we might work with it mindfully we don't try to make it go away the hindrance we don't try to make the experience go away we don't try to make the unpleasantness go away and we don't try to make the aversion go away and we just bring our mindfulness and get to know it what does it feel like and just can i be free and you know and happy in the midst of this if it gets too strong and we're not able to do that then we take a different approach and then we want to take an antidote all right every experience i don't want to get this too much i don't know if any of you come on the sundays but uh i happen to be sitting in that for gill this sunday and one of the things i'm going to talk about is so i don't want to repeat if they're going to come and get the same thing but it's going to get into this idea of you know of experience we all have an a line and whatever the experience is if it's crossed the line it's too much we can't work with it we just can't if it's on this side of the line we can work with it and the line moves and changes day by day over time if the pain's too strong it's not about being mindfully present with it we got to like alleviate the pain we cannot work with it so it's the same thing in working with these hindrances and that's kind of pointing to what we're going to get into it's really the art of knowing you know you know well where's the line it's not a crisp line it's fuzzy and the closer we get to it sometimes the harder it is to tell but certainly getting to know these states of the mind and heart very well so that they don't run us and so that we can know when we're on this side of the line and we can make some choice whatever the choice is whatever the choice is and we're on that side of the line to know it and that's the time once again when we need the compassion and we need to know it's not about we just can't work with it we don't even go there it's a coping mechanism at that point what are we going to do it's too much and for the hindrances there's some antidotes we can look at then in those cases does that make sense just the basic idea any other thoughts for now questions i'm going to hand out the homework in a minute but and talk about it a little bit get the basic idea of these hindrances and yes so the hindrance is basically something we need to get real close to online yeah i think that's a great way to think about it and it gets back to you said and also what what what you were saying also is that some things come up and it's actually not a hindrance it technically i guess falls under this list but in the moment it's still coming up but it isn't a hindrance it's unpleasant we don't like it but we're not caught is it really being a hindrance but if it gets strong enough it turns into hindrance the exact same thing which was just some experience is now a hindrance because it's actually we're hooked and so all of these tend to hook us and that's the exact reason why in vipassana practice sometimes the instructions are given about you know working with mindfully with the experience and then sometimes we're given the instruction that every once in a while instead of noticing the experience notice the pleasant unpleasant or neutral quality because sometimes we don't see that we've got some aversion going or some clinging and by noticing the pleasantness or unpleasantness you can help us see oh i'm clinging some here i'm in aversion okay so as i said next week we'll um get out the homework this one is about working with desire greed clinging um let me hand it out and we'll talk about it a little bit and you know if you don't do the homework nobody's going to know but i would just uh So if you have a version to doing the homework, notice that. That's what's arising then? Ill will. It's just a hindrance arising. So we'll just, you can read it yourself, but I'll just kind of go through it. The whole idea is this one's going to work with, and I use the word desire, but it's, you notice the stack that came back here was thicker than the stack of the first one that went in. That's interesting. So I just put down this, I don't know the one single word. It's really, it's the clinging. It's when desire gets strong and we're really, the grasping, the clinging for that pleasant there. So, you know, to notice when it arises. And then notice what was the object, what causes it? Was there some object we wanted? Some like, you know, I said external objects such as a car or a person, whatever food. Was it a certain sense experience? Do we want a certain taste or a certain touch? Was there a mental feeling like I wanted to just feel whatever? Notice any stories. We just want to get to know this. We actually want to become very intimate with the experience. Don't pick the real strong ones. You could do that, but if you just get lost off in it, you might, so you can play with mild ones, play with strong ones. And actually try to notice, this one's kind of going to, we'll see what comes up for people in this. Notice what pulls you into the desire. There's something that's kind of, what is that? We'll talk more. I don't want to say more. I've got some thoughts about the different kind of things that it could be, and you'll see for yourself what it actually is for you. But there's something that's got us hooked, depending on the object, depending on what it is we want, there's a hook. Can you find that desire itself? Is it somewhere in the body? See, if we can learn to get freer around the desire, we don't flip over into the cleaning and the craving. If the craving comes up and you're actually feeling hooked, we'll use that interchangeably with the desire itself, too, which is really a hindrance. Noticing the pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral quality itself. And then just to notice, how did you work with it? Did you mindfully notice it? Did you try to use some kind of antidote? Did you just give in to it? What happened? And I should have added on here, then, how did you feel about it? If you gave into it, but think you should have worked with it mindfully, then do you create another suffering around your judgment about yourself, just to notice all these things? I guess the last thing I should have done is just talk briefly, since that one is on desire, craving, clinging, greed, grasping. See the antidote there on that one? Impermanence, or I love it when they say foulness. So an example would be, say there's a person that's particularly interesting to you. That's kind of a weird example, but I guess maybe... Okay, that's a good example. Somebody's interesting. You can notice when you're really attracted and everything, and so that's funny. Maybe you don't want to do this foulness game with that one. But you could, if you wanted to do that as an experiment, say what happens when you think, for example, that, you know, if you just go like, here's just this bag of skin, right? You go one-eighth of the inch in and it's just a gooky mess. It's a gooky, it would be just, you took that one-eighth inch off and you would be repulsed. But wrap it up in a bag of skin and, you know, so, and really look, dude, you know, what's, you can get it, we could go on and on, there's all these practices around foulness, right? And it's an antidote to the craving. All of a sudden, it's not so interesting anymore if you really kind of want to get into it too graphic because it's gross. So, but anyway, that's an example. Or impermanence to really contemplate on, you know, oh, I really want to get this stereo, I'm going crazy. It's nothing wrong with wanting a stereo, but you're really, you know, suffering around it. You notice that, you know, impermanence maybe, it's not foulness wouldn't be so appropriate, but it's not going to ultimate, it's not going to last. So maybe you can work with that, you know, is this really going to give me the ultimate happiness? Stuff like that. So I hope we'll have some good discussions and I also hope we'll have some, maybe people might have some things, some really, I don't know if we'll get controversy around it, but, you know, but. And as I said, I'll bring some sutras next week. Hopefully we'll have a little time to do that, but I don't want to eat up too much of the time. Any last, I'm done for tonight. Any last, anything? Yes. I did an exercise similar to this just before Christmas. I had two hours to kill in a shopping mall. The sights and the smells and the food and the people and all that. It's a very interesting experience to watch the sires arise and then you watch them and then you go away and get distracted from those smells. I had thought maybe something to do, we're not going to do it, but work with it because there's an oven here I thought I might get something like whatever, like chocolate chip cookies or I don't know whatever, bake them. And then during the meditation have fresh smells come up and we can then, and then we could actually work with it. Or I had some ideas for the Falmus version one too, but. So what I would, it's exactly nine o'clock now and we're going to, what I'd like to do is I'd like to take, I always think it's nice to end with a little loving kindness. So what I want to say is I'm going to make it very, very short, maybe literally a couple of minutes. So it'll be a little short and if you need to leave, please just leave and don't feel funny about it. And for those who want to stay for a couple of minutes. And so to do this, I would invite you to just find whatever posture and really to be as comfortable as your body will allow, whatever that is. As comfortable as your body will allow. And then if you have been disconnected, if you've been more out in thinking and up in thoughts and out, your consciousness has been out, then to just bring it back in and connect using the body, connecting into the body. And just connect with your whole experience of the mind and the heart, emotions. And just whatever you find there could be restless. You could have some of the hindrances arising, maybe you're in some aversion or you are happy or sleepy. Well, just whatever. Notice, I invite you to notice your relationship with that experience. And can you just be present not having to do anything, not having to change it? Just allowing it, allowing yourself to just fully be, to fully express in its own way. It's a practice of deep self-acceptance. It's an act of great meta, of great loving kindness and compassion for ourselves, just to allow ourselves to be, whatever that is, without a judgment. And if you're not able to do that, then send a little loving kindness for that. The place that really isn't able to be with this. And then from that place of self-acceptance, just to start actively then sending some meta, some loving kindness towards yourself. And if you find it useful to use some of the phrases, you can use your own phrases or some of the simple traditional phrases that you hear all the time, such as, just a simple wish, may I be happy. And may I be free from suffering. And then you can stay with that, or if you would like, you could then extend your awareness out to all the people here in the meditation hall. And sending that same meta to everyone, just as I wish to be happy, may everyone here be happy. And just as I wish to be free from suffering, may everyone here be free from suffering. And then finally, for those who wish, to extend your awareness out into the community, out into the world. And sending that same meta in all directions, everywhere, encompassing all beings. May all beings everywhere be happy. And may all beings everywhere be free from suffering. And then to end with this short prayer from the Buddha, from his Mettasutta's Discourse on Loving Kindness. Let none deceive another or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child, so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings. So good night, and I hope you have a good week.
