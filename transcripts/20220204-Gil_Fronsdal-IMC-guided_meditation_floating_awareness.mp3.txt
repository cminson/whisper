 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.Adiodarma.org. Good morning. Good day, everyone. And one of the things that we are doing in doing satipatana practice, practice of establishing awareness, is learning to not only pay attention to the details of what's happening the moment, for right now we're doing the body, breathing, body activities. But we're also beginning to understand the other half of the equation, the awareness part, how we're aware. And in a sense, the activities we do can be a mirror to how we are, and also how we are aware. It's possible to be aware in a contracted way, in a tense way. It's possible to be aware in a complacent, you know, hardly committed way. And it's possible to be aware with a very relaxed, open, but engaged awareness. So for this purpose, I want to do a small exercise with you. And that is if you would open your eyes and find some spot, maybe a small object or something. And if you would kind of fix it, look at it, but really kind of stare at it, fix your attention there in a one pointed way. And just look at the object without wavering, just lock onto it and just look at it. And don't let your eyes kind of waver or shake or anything, just hold your attention there. So very focused, very intent. And as you do so, notice what's happened to your breathing. Notice what's happened to your body. Notice the quality of your mind. So now, relax, maybe take a moment to close your eyes and breathe deeply and relax. And then open your eyes again and look at this object, but rather than fixating your attention on it, let your eyes kind of float in your eye sockets and just look at the different parts of it. Maybe trace the contours of it, kind of look at what will be the bottom of it, the top, the sides. Just let yourself kind of wander and aim your attention. So you're still kind of centered on the object, but you're kind of floating, swimming around your attention on the object or with the object there. And now, notice your breathing. Notice your body, how it feels. Notice what your mind, your awareness, is it the awareness, tight or contracted or is it more spacious and loose? And so, I don't know if this exercise worked for everyone, but generally when people fixate their eyes to focus on something, it tends to create tension. It's kind of an unnatural thing to do, to hold the attention fixated like that. And it takes effort and work and certain kind of tension. What's more natural for the eyes is to kind of constantly be on the move, gently, relaxably, maybe not so much. We don't necessarily realize that the eyes are kind of dancing around slightly. But what's nicest for the eyes is to have the eyes move so it takes in the object of attention from different perspectives, different angles, different parts of it. So the eyes are not fixated. The eyes are quite loose and soft and flowing around the object. As the mind gets tense, as the mind gets fixated or preoccupied or afraid or angry or desirous, the mind tends to lock up or become tighter or more fixed like the fixed eyes. And with mindfulness, mindful awareness, the awareness gets loosened up and we allow awareness to kind of certainly focus on the breath, on different objects, but we are kind of floating with it and taking it in in different kind of angles and ways. So just with the experience of breathing, for example, we don't hold the attention on the breath. Rather, we place the attention in the area where we experience breathing and we allow the different sensations that come into play to do their dance, to appear. And awareness kind of floats between it and moves around it. It's all with the breathing, but the awareness is kind of as loose and relaxed with the breathing. Maybe a little bit like a, if you were floating, maybe on a rubber mattress, rubber boat or something on a, just floating and relaxing, laying on top of the ocean with gentle waves coming up. You're right there with the waves, but the waves come and go. You're not fixating on the ocean. You're allowing the waves to lift you and drop you and you're feeling all the different contours of the wave as it moves through your body. And this kind of attention allows for hopefully a deeper sensitivity to our experience. And as we continue to do this practice, we are actually looking for or awakening a deeper sensitivity to our sense experience, the physical experience of what's happening, and beginning to allow the awareness to rest on it or stay present, but in a way that's soft and relaxed, it kind of floats on top of the different things that appear and disappear. So, to gently lower your gaze with your eyes still open and lower, and have your eyes kind of looking down at about 45 degrees, not looking at anything in particular, but just gently letting the eyes kind of subtly move and roam and be relaxed, not trying to see anything, but just kind of, maybe things are even a little bit out of focus, that's okay, so you're not fixating on anything. And now if it's comfortable, gently close your eyes. And now with your awareness, let your awareness float around your body in whatever way the body calls, whatever way awareness wants to travel, whatever, just gently, slowly, relaxedly, the awareness is centered on the body, but loose and relaxed, just floating between different sensations and experiences. And as the mind, the awareness floats around, if you notice any tension, if it's easy enough without fixating the mind, relax the tension, maybe allowing awareness to slide down with the relaxation, along the relaxation. And then settling your awareness on your breathing, the sensations of the body that come into play as you breathe, whether it's the movements of the belly, the chest, sensations in the nostril, or some broader global experience of the body breathing. Rest in those sensations in that area and let your awareness gently, almost not out of choice, isn't like you're doing it, almost as if the natural tendency for awareness to float and move, floats and moves within the experience of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the breathing, but orienting itself on the breathing. As the sensations of breathing change, so the awareness floats on the change. As awareness naturally, loosely floats, it sometimes floats between sensations. Maybe there's no rhyme or reason of which sensations you pick up at any given time, but be oriented to the sensations of breathing in a relaxed, loose way, perhaps allowing for a growing sensitivity for how the body feels, experiences, the details of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. Floating on the sensations of breathing, as if you have all the time in the world, no hurry. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. If the mind wanders off in thought, notice if the mind is fixated or tight. If it is, relax the mind. If you wander off in thought innocently, kind of floating off into some kind of thinking, then float the mind back to the breathing, gently settle back in again, awareness resting on the waves of sensations, developing a heightened sensitivity to the body's experience of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing. So the mind is not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing, but it's also not fixating on the sensations of breathing, as part of this meditation while you're still sitting quietly. I would like to read the section of the text that we're studying this week. And the reason to read it while you're still meditating is that the primary way down through the centuries that people have encountered this text is not as something to read and study, but something to listen to as it was chanted, or something to participate with by chanting it. And chanting repeatedly the same passages over and over again has a very different effect on how we learn and how we're changed than studying. So because it's closer to this chanting way of taking in the text, I'd like to read it now as the end of the meditation. A practitioner is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning, who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away, who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending the limbs, who acts in full awareness when wearing clothes and carrying their plates and silverware, who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming foods, tasting, who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating, who acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling, falling asleep, waking up, talking and keeping silent. In this way, one abides observing the body in regards to the body, internally, externally, and both internally and externally. One abides contemplating the body and its nature of arising, its nature of vanishing, and its nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else awareness is established. There is a body just to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and lucid awareness. And one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. This is how a practitioner abides observing the body in regards to the body. And may it be that each of these activities we do, that they're infused with an aspiration and orientation to do so for the benefit of the world. That somehow we're developing ourselves, cultivating ourselves to be caring people for this world. Somehow we are also orienting ourselves to a life of caring for self and others and making this a better world for all beings. May all beings be free and happy. Thank you.
