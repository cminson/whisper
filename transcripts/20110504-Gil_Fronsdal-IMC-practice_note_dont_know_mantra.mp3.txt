Here’s a suggestion for practicing this morning. I think 
that for many people , one of the common challenges 
around meditation is your own thinking  – getting caught 
up in , or pulled off in the world of your thoughts . It’s a 
common movement in meditation to let go of your 
thoughts and start on the breath again , or some other 
way of relating to it differently. That can be effective  
sometimes , especially cumulative ly – just letting go and 
coming back.  
 
But sometimes it’s useful  to have a trick to help you 
disengage from the allure, the pull, or the force of 
thinking. I want to offer you a little mantra that you can 
use when you’re thinking a  lot. It can help to pull you 
away from it, and to not be so glued onto it – to be 
willing to step back and open your mind broader or 
wider than it sometimes is w hen it ’s locked in to a 
particular thought. So when you recognize that you’re 
thinking , add  to that thought, maybe at the end of the 
sentence , the mantra : “Don’t know.”  
 
When  you’re pulled into the world of thoughts  – and 
even if you’re confused about thi ngs – there’s a feeling of: “This is true .” “This is important .” “This is how things 
are.” Or, “My judgments are true.”  But just add , “I don’t 
know. Maybe, maybe not, I don’t know.”  This can  often 
pull the rug out from underneath that which gives 
thoughts the authority to grab us and hold onto us.  
 
So you might experiment  this morning to see if salting 
your meditation with the phrase “ Don’t know” free s you 
a little bit from that world of thinking. I hope you enjoy 
your morning here. Thank you.
