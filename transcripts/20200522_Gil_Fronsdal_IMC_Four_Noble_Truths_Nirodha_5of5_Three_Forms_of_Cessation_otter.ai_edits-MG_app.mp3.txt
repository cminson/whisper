This week, we've been talking about the third noble 
truth, the truth of the cessation of suffering. And the 
most common way in which this formulation appears in 
the suttas of what's usually called the Four Noble Truths 
appears without the title Four Noble. It says, for 
example, someone understands, or one should 
understand: suffering, the arising of suffering, the 
cessation of suffering, and the practice leading to the 
cessation of suffering.  
 
And then, because in the so -called first sermon of the 
Buddha, h e goes into some detail, and he calls it the    
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 2 - Four Noble Truths: the noble truth of suffering, the 
noble truth of the arising of suffering, the noble truth of 
the cessation of suffering, and the noble truth of the 
practice leading to the cessation of suffer ing. Because 
that's considered the first sermon, it's often given a lot 
of emphasis. And there's explanations there about what 
each of these are. And those explanations are  treated 
as being definitive like this is the true definition of the 
Four Noble Tru ths. And the Four Noble Truths are held 
up as being the central teachings of the Buddha.  
 
Paradoxically or oddly enough, the Buddha very rarely 
actually explained the Four Noble Truths in the suttas. 
For some reason, either he didn't talk about it much, or 
it wasn't preserved all that he talked about. There's only 
five places where he explicitl y explains what these are. 
And people who do text critical work say most of these 
appear to be later interpretations, the product of later 
editors. And so it seems like the Buddha didn't teach 
much actually about the Four Noble Truths. And it's kind 
of sho cking to hear - so much so that some scholars 
say that he actually didn't teach the Four Noble Truths. 
But what he did teach over and over again, is that there 
is suffering, there's the arising, the cessation, and the 
practice leading to the cessation. So in the so -called 
first sermon of the Buddha, that is taken, understood or 
interpreted to be one of the most common ways of 
understanding the Four Noble Truths. And I think it's fair 
to say it's the idea that suffering has a cause, and that    
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 3 - cause is craving , and with the cessation of craving is 
the cessation of suffering. It's a powerful teaching. It's a 
powerful interpretation. And in all kinds of areas in our 
everyday life, it's just useful to consider, "What's the 
cause or what's my contribution to the su ffering I'm 
having?"  
 
If I look deeply in to see my contribution, there's 
something probably that is a compulsion, a drivenness, 
a thirst for something, something we can't really stop, a 
drive that we can't stop. That's represented by this word 
craving. A nd, and it can be very useful to look at that 
and see where we're compulsive, see where we are 
addicted, where we're attached, and then to experience 
letting go of it, or having it come to an end, and feeling 
how wonderful that is. That's great. And in all  kinds of 
areas in everyday life, in situations, this is a useful 
analysis.  
 
As people meditate, the Four Noble Truths are 
interpreted different ways as the mind gets quieter. And 
one of the interpretations of the second Noble Truth is 
that it has to do w ith the conditions that come together 
to cause suffering. And there's lots of conditions that 
cause suffering. And some people who emphasize 
conditionality don't give necessarily pride of place to 
craving. Sometimes people give pride of place to 
ignorance.  Ignorance is the primal condition for craving, 
for suffering itself. And as we meditate, we are relaxing    
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 4 - the conditioning faculties of the mind, the ways in which 
the mind is thinking and conceiving and  constructing 
our world that we're doing.  
 
Meditatio n is a process of stilling that and quieting that. 
And we can quiet it to a great degree. So we're not 
really thinking about the external world anymore. We're 
not really thinking much of anything. Just a lot of peace 
and settledness. A lot of suffering can  disappear when 
all the constructive, conceiving aspects of the mind, the 
memory aspects of the mind, have quieted down. And 
it's kind of like taking a shower and becoming clean. It 
feels so good to go back in the world when you're clean. 
When meditation h as been that inner shower, then we 
come back into the world cleaner, fresher, with fresher 
eyes, not carrying the burden of our preoccupations. 
And often that's when we see much more opening in 
life, and see much more freedom in life then.  
 
And because we 've relaxed the conditions, not 
necessarily the cause of our suffering, but sometimes 
the cause turns out to be only one factor that 
contributes to suffering, the so -called central cause. 
And just relaxing deeply doesn't give that cause enough 
strength to really be troublesome for us. So that's a 
second interpretation. And so here the cessation of 
suffering has to do with the cessation of these 
conditions.  
    
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 5 - And as I'm saying, the deeper the meditation goes, the 
deeper the stilling of these conditions is. I t's quite 
wonderful. As the condition gets stiller and stiller, and 
quieter and quieter, that conceiving mind, the 
constructing mind that's interpreting things, telling 
stories, and labeling things kind of quiets down. And we 
start living in the flow of di rect sensations, direct 
experience, the comings and goings of sounds, taste, 
smells, touch, body sensations, thoughts, and all that. 
And this coming and going of stuff is quite phenomenal.  
 
I want to tell a little story from the suttas in my 
interpretatio n of the context for the story. It's not there in 
the suttas. A bunch of monks were sitting around the 
campfire and just telling one yarn after another about 
the great mythological miracles associated with 
Buddha's life. And they're outdoing each other wit h 
stories about, you know, when the Buddha was born, 
he came out and immediately walked seven steps. He 
was conceived immaculately. The gods received him 
and held him up so he wouldn't have touched the 
ground. And the stories, the cosmological mythological  
stories are just quite phantasmagoric, fantastic. And so 
they're going around and they're talking about this. 
Actually Ānanda, the Buddha's disciple, is saying all 
these wonderful miracles, and he's saying, "This is a 
wonderful miracle. This is miraculous ." And then at the 
end of all these miracle stories, what the Buddha says 
is kind of like the climax of the story or the punch line.    
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 6 - All the earlier part is a setup for what the Buddha is 
going to say. And the Buddha says, "I'll tell you, what is 
a miracle . When I have a thought, I see the arising of 
the thought, the persistence of the thought, and the 
ceasing of the thought. When I have a feeling, I see the 
arising of feeling, the persistence of the feeling and the 
passing away of the feeling. When there a re 
perceptions, I see the arising of the perception, the 
persistence of it, and the disappearance of it. That is a 
miracle."  
 
So, all these miracles about the Buddha's miraculous 
so-called powers, that's not really that important. What's 
really important is the ability to really see or be present 
for the flow and the change of how things come and go, 
arise and pass, and all that. And what that does is to 
see, to really see, "This is where freedom is found." To 
let the flow unfold, the coming and going unfo ld, and 
release the holding on to it, the pushing, the resistance 
to it – to open up to the space at the end of the ceasing. 
Before there's an arising, where there's nothing to hold 
on to, nothing to cling to. In a sense, to kind of fall into 
that space and  experience the freedom of the heart and 
the mind. The radical letting go.  
 
And so here, this third interpretation of the cessation of 
suffering  has to do with that. It's seeing two things: the 
arising and ceasing, the inconstant nature of things, to 
be in that flow. And to see that there's where freedom is    
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 7 - found. That there's profound liberation to be found in 
being in that flow and not stopping i t, not resisting it, 
and just allowing it to move through us, without any 
movement of clinging or holding, or contracting, or 
craving itself.  
 
The deepest liberation that the Buddha over and over 
emphasized, comes from this deep meditative 
experience of i nconstancy. We see this in a particular 
chapter of the book called "The Connected Discourses 
of the Buddha," that's a chapter on the truths. And 
there's three different ways in which these so -called 
Four Noble Truths are presented.  
 
The first presents it only as, "This is suffering; this is the 
arising; this is the ceasing; and this is the practice for 
the cessation of suffering." And those who really 
understand this, really penetrate this, become the first 
stage of awakening. Rather than having a four sta ge 
model of awakening, this text has a two stage model, 
and this person is called a trainee, because now they 
know what the practice is about. Someone who  has let 
go deeply, and experiences deep freedom in the world 
of inconstancy, knows this freedom the B uddha was 
talking about. And they know they know how to train 
now. They know what it's all about. So they're a trainee. 
Someone who does a training, of really resting, and 
flowing, and repeatedly kind of letting go into this 
inconstant flow of experience.     
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 8 -  
At some point, they become fully awakened. At that 
point, this text says, "This is the noble truth of the 
arising of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of 
suffering , and the noble truth of the practice leading to 
the cessation of suffering. So t wo levels of this, one 
without the title "Noble Truths" and one with the title 
"Noble Truths." One for becoming the first experience of 
liberation, and the other for becoming fully liberated.  
 
The Buddha was fully liberated. And they wanted to 
describe wh at it’s like, someone who's fully liberated 
like a Buddha, that no longer meant that he became 
reborn. Because as the centuries went along in 
Buddhism, the idea of not being reborn became 
increasingly important in these texts. And that's where 
this first s ermon of the Buddha was born, was to explain 
that issue, how the Buddha doesn't get reborn. And the 
text specifically says, as I said last week, it's the arising 
of suffering and craving that leads to rebirth. And the 
cessation of suffering is the cessatio n of that very 
craving that leads to rebirth. That first sermon of the 
Buddha then has become the primary reference point 
for what the Four Noble Truths are.  
 
But in fact, there's something more profound, more 
important in these texts than that particular  sermon. 
And that is, seeing a thought as it arises. Seeing it as it 
persists, and seeing when it passes away. Seeing a    
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 9 - feeling when it arises, persists and ceases. Seeing 
sensations. Seeing everything as a flow of inconstant 
phenomena. Easier said than do ne. But the result of 
this is liberation. And that is described.  
 
The people who are liberated are the happy ones, the 
peaceful ones. There's a wonderful experience of 
happiness and peace and delight that can come from 
liberation. And that's the other side of suffering: to go 
through suffering to the other side, and come  out and 
really taste and experience a profound form of joy and 
happiness that comes with a cessation of suffering. So 
that's nirodha , the cessation of the third noble truth.  
 
And in the next week I'll do the practice leading to the 
cessation of suffering , the fourth of the Four Noble 
Truths. So , thank you so much.
