Dharmette: Self and Not -Self 
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I’d like to  offer a few words about the issue of self and 
not-self in Buddhism. There can  be a tendency among 
people , when they hear the Buddhist teaching  about 
not-self, to interpret it as meaning  to dismiss the  self – 
that it ’s not important  – or that any kind of self -concern 
or self -referencing is really not appropriate. T hat there is 
no self here to be concerned about , so you are 
suppos ed to just  be something like a not -self, and h ave 
no desires. But in the world , when people have no 
desires, they are usually depressed rather than 
enlightened.  
 
There is something very profound about the Buddhist 
teachings and insights into not -self. But it is not at all 
meant to be dismissive of you, as though you’ re not 
important. I would say that it’s the opposite in  
Buddhism. Buddhism recognizes the  tremendous  value 
and importance of each person. To appreciate your own 
importance is part of the task of this practice. Who you 
are, and your well -being , are very important. You’re an 
important person.  
 
What is less known – because ther e is very little mention of i t – is the word self  in the Pali tradition , atta, 
which means  someone who is developed . Someone  
who is spiritually mature is called a mahā -atta, a great 
self. Gandhi was called Mahatma, meaning a great self. 
Our well -being is important. The idea is to relate to 
ourselves as important and  valuable , as opposed to 
relating to ourselves as if we don’t count. In this 
tradition, everyone is important  and valued.  
 
The practice is meant to turn us towards ourselves with 
appreciation and  value  – even when we find ourselves 
feeling inadequate or bad.  It is important to turn towards 
that, and to meet it with maturity, uprightness, and 
clarity as if we are important. As we  turn toward 
ourselves as  important,  and if there is conceit, sooner or 
later we will know  if we’re caught up in a sense of self, 
or if we are attached to identity issues, and we will see 
very clearly how that limits us. If we really take 
ourselves as important, then we wouldn’t be caught up 
in thoughts of being important. That concern just 
dissolves. It’ s like , if you only feel safe by  putting on lots 
of armor, then yo u might be safe – but real safety is 
when you realize you don’t h ave to wear the armor 
anymore, a nd you can relax, just be there.  
 
To be able to create a sense of presence or attention , to 
be able to let go so that we don’t even need a self -
referencing point of view, then we don’t ne ed to have an 
identity that we’ re holding onto. We can have an identity, but we don’t hold on to anything. We are 
important , and it is important to pay atten tion to 
ourselves. This is the locus  where you will discover your 
freedom, where the greatest maturity as a human being 
will arise.  
 
There is an exp ression in Buddhism called the 
bodhimaṇḍa, which is the place of enlightenment. 
When the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree, that was his 
bodhimaṇḍa , his place of awakening. The teaching is 
that wherever you are is your bodhimaṇḍa . If you turn 
toward yourself as if you are important, if you do that  
well with mindfulness, then the need  to be important will 
dissolve, just as the need for safety dissolves when you 
are feeling safe. The need to be an important person 
falls away when you relate to yourself as important , and 
you relax. You don’t have to puff yours elf up. You don’t 
have to inflate yourself. You can just be.  
 
I would like to suggest that , when you hear Buddhist 
teachings  about not -self, those teachings are being 
offered in a context of tremendous respect for yourself 
and who you are, and a sense of the possibility of who 
you are. As we accept that, live by that, and have 
mindfulness practice, then any extra way in which we 
are caught up in self , or are conceited (positive ly or 
negative ly), will begin to dissolve in time , because  it 
won’t be needed anymore;  we see that this  is all a 
limitation.   
If you do hear the teachings that there is no self, you 
don’t need to be confused about the self. You can be a 
self. Please be a self . And be a strong and upright self. 
Value yourself. Consider yourself as an efficacious 
person.  
 
Use mindfulness practice with that attitude of being 
important and valuable to begin to shed all the extra 
ways of hang ing on and get ting attached to concepts of 
self, and all the extra ideas  that we add on top  of that . 
They aren’t really needed. Eventually you will find that 
you will feel so important , that you don’t have to think 
about it anymore , and you don’t have to burden other 
people  about being an important person. It doesn’t 
matter to you  anymore  if people see you as important or 
not. Your sense of happiness is not dependent on being 
an important person  for anybody , including for yourself. 
If you feel confident and relaxed about who  you are, you 
just show up to be here.  
 
In a sense , the teaching of not -self arises for people 
when they begin shedding all the unnecessary 
attachments around who they are. It is not meant to be 
a teaching to diminish us, or to leave us empty -handed 
in some way that makes us  feel diminished , or feel like 
we can’t show up, or stand there on our own two feet, 
upright, independent , clear, and confident.  
 This is not mentioned very much here in the West for a 
number of rea sons, some of them sociological – maybe 
because of what happened here in the West in the 
sixties and se venties. Here , it is very rare that Western 
dharma teachers use the lang uage of the warrior  in 
talking about this practice. In the ancient world, still to 
this day, there is much more warrior language. The idea 
is that you enter the practice with the dignity  of the 
ancient warriors:  uprightness  and strength  – and you 
practice with that. You don’t practice with being an 
amoeba , which just collapses into itself , or gets pushed 
around. You don’t have to adopt the warrior language , 
but I offer it as a corrective to any kind of idea that not -
self means you are supposed to be wishy -washy , or not 
quite here,  or you don’t count.  It is the warrior who 
discovers that the re is no self here.  
 
Please consid er yourself important, valuable – each and 
every one of you . And with all the voices and ideas that 
somehow diminish you or undermine that sense, turn 
toward them  gently, kindly, respectfully, and question 
them . Let that part of you that can turn toward it  and see 
it be your strength. Don’t identify so strongly with the 
diminishing voices you have.  
 
In summary, I think that Buddhism teaches that you are 
really important. Please remember that.
