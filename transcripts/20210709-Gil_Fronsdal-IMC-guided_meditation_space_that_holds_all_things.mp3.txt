 So welcome to this meditation session. And unequivocally here we are to acknowledge the location that you're sitting in, to acknowledge what is supporting your weight. Where the pull of gravity meets a surface. And to really feel like you're here. And one of the opportunities in meditation is to recognize the space that's around everything. That whatever we sense, whatever we feel, whatever we experience, whatever we think, that there's a way of seeing it in its own uniqueness as a particular manifestation. And with around which is the space of awareness. Around which it can exist just in itself as it is. In a way that can be seen as respectful for the uniqueness of it, for the momentariness of it. But also allows us to not get involved or caught in it. And allowing each thing to exist like a star is allowed to exist in the vast night sky. So different sensations and different bed and a feeling tones, thoughts and whatever. There's a way of being open, relaxed with awareness. To see it by itself. Just without diminishing its value, you can add the word just. It's just a feeling, just a sensation. It's just a thought. It's just a sound. And that just maybe is to allow you to recognize that whatever unique situation, event comes into awareness. There can be the space of awareness around it. There can be a gap between what we're aware of. And how we react to it. How we think about it. How we feel about it. The gap that space between them is a space of freedom. The gap and freedom, the space between the way in which we identify with stuff or assume there's a self, makeup idea of me, myself and mine. Maybe it's okay that you do so. But there's a space, a gap, a pause between each thing. And each thing is independent, free of the self making we do. So gently closing your eyes and taking a few long slow deep breaths. Relaxing as you exhale. If you take a deep inhale, maybe your torso chest expands out into the space around you. And inhale it recedes. Letting your breathing return to normal. And on the exhale, continue to take a few moments to relax the body. Softening in the face, the shoulders, the belly. And becoming aware of the simplicity of breathing. That whatever sensations are present in your breathing, exist in the, it's surrounded by the space of awareness. They exist as particular points of sensation, places of sensation, outside of which those sensations are not seen or felt. The sensations that make up the edges of your body. Beyond them, there is space. In a certain way, kind of way inside of them, there is space. And you might be thinking about what's happening. But there is a space or a gap between your thoughts and the experience. It's possible to know the experience in its own simplicity, as distinct from thinking thoughts. The space around each phenomenal experience might also be characterized by silence. A sweet silence. Or a stillness. And as you breathe, perhaps breathe through and into the spaciousness here. The silence that's here. The stillness that's here. So you don't deny anything. But each thing, each experience can exist within the space of awareness as itself. Thank you........... If you focus on the objects in a room, you might not notice the space that's in the room. If you focus on your thoughts and your feelings and sensations, you might not notice the space that holds all that. We tend to not notice the space. But that's where we can find freedom. Notice the space around things. Breathe with it. Relax into it. Let the space help silence the mind. Relax. Relax. Relax.
