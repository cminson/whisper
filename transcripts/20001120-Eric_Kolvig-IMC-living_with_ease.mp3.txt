I'm glad to be with you again. I came here to give a talk just about a year ago and really enjoyed our evening together.
So I'm glad for the invitation from Gil to come and talk again.
I'm grateful to call Gil a friend and someone with whom I have talked.
The great Zen teacher Shinryu Suzuki Roshi once said that to give a Dharma talk is to make a mistake on purpose.
I think I think he meant in part that that hearing a talk like this can do a little bit of help for us.
But ultimately our freedom comes from actually practicing the Dharma.
But I also feel that in a way it's always a mistake when when someone tries to share the purity of the Dharma through a personality that's unfinished.
So whatever mistakes I make this is basically an unfinished project here.
Whatever mistakes I make tonight I apologize for ahead of time.
I'd like to talk this evening about a subject that that has become in recent years compellingly important for me.
And it may have some application at least some people here.
And I'd like to start actually with a fairly grim passage from a great work of literature.
You may know Leo Tolstoy's novella the death of Ivan Ilich Ivan Ilich is is dying of cancer.
And he comes to a late discovery very close to his death to a late discovery about his life.
So I'd like to read a passage from from this from this novella.
It occurred to him that what had appeared perfectly impossible before namely that he had not spent his life as she as he should have done might after all be true.
It occurred to him that his scarcely perceptible attempts to struggle against what was considered good by the most highly placed people.
Those scarcely noticeable impulses which he had immediately suppressed might have been the real thing.
And all the rest falls.
The professional duties and the whole arrangement of his life and of his family and all his social and official interests might all have been false.
He tried to defend all those things to himself and suddenly felt the weakness of what he was defending.
There was nothing to defend.
But if that is so he said to himself and I am leaving this life with the consciousness that I have lost all that was given to me.
And it is impossible to rectify it what then he lay on his back and began to pass his life in review in quite a new way.
In the morning when he saw first his footmen then his wife then his daughter and then the doctor.
There every word and movement confirmed to him the awful truth that he had that had been revealed to him during the night.
Then he saw himself all that for which he had lived and saw clearly that it was not real at all but a terrible and huge deception which had hidden both life and death.
This consciousness intensified his physical suffering tenfold.
He groaned and tossed about and pulled at his clothing which choked and stifled him and he hated them on that account.
But actually the Buddha said that one of the forms of suffering one of the exquisite forms of suffering that we can experience actually is to come to the end of our life
and look back and feel that we had not lived our life well that we had not used our life well.
It's a faith that I really hope none of us will have but it's a it's a I'd like to talk this evening about one aspect of our lives that actually can prevent us from making the right choices.
For example for to make an effort with our spiritual practice and to come to deeper levels of liberation and freedom.
And for me what has what has triggered this reflection over the last few years of my life is actually one of the phrases from loving kindness practice.
I'm sure that many people here are familiar with with Metta or the loving kindness practice in this terabyte of the past and the tradition.
And the the four phrases of Metta that I was taught by my teacher very traditional kinds of phrases and there are many variations on these phrases.
But the first if you're extending loving kindness a sense of friendship or connection toward yourself is to make the wish may I be happy.
The second is to make the wish for yourself may I be safe from inner and outer harm.
The third is may I be healthy and body and mind.
And the fourth is may I live with ease.
Sharon Salzburg translates that fourth phrase as may I live with ease of well being.
And it struck me a few years ago that I wasn't living with ease.
And it seems like it's it might be actually quite important.
If it's included in these wishes of loving kindness practice.
It's not easy to live with ease in our particular society.
Do you have a sense that you have lived with ease today this Monday.
November 20th 2000 or that or do you have a sense that you might live with ease tomorrow.
For me it's a struggle actually.
And as I've come to reflect more and more on that very simple phrase may I live with ease.
It's it feels to me there have been times for me as if it's a thirsty person contemplating water.
You know it's very important.
It has felt very important to me.
And it's very important I think in terms of our spiritual practice.
Like to to read a passage from the Buddha.
Without giving up six things of followers.
It will not be possible to dwell practicing mindfulness of the body as the body.
He's going through the four foundations of mindfulness which is the center of our practice to practice.
Mindfulness is feelings as feelings to practice mindfulness of the mind is the mind.
To practice the objects of mindfulness of the objects of mind as the objects of mind.
Which are these six that prevent us from from actually pursuing our spiritual practice.
To be fond of activity to be fond of talking to be fond of sleeping to be fond of company.
To lack control of the senses to be immoderate in eating.
So I just want to focus on the first of these six obstructions to our practice to be fond of activity.
I feel that we live actually in the most hyperactive and overstimulated culture in the history of the world right now.
It's very hard to to to avoid overactivity in our lives.
Maybe this doesn't apply to you. It has certainly applied to me in my life.
And it's really interesting to to to this is one one expression that I love by a friend of mine Diana Winston earlier this year.
The Buddhist Peace Fellowship brought out its newsletter Turning Wheel was about time and the use of time.
And Diana Winston wrote an article called Speed and I'd like to just read a passage from this and perhaps you can relate to it.
I don't have time to write letters. Read books. Visit my friends.
Play with my little brother kiss touch sigh dance relate eat ice cream make music pray smell meditate take a walk.
My God make it all stop. I don't have time and it's running out and I'm running fast and furiously and I wanted to stop.
Ouch it's painful. Why won't it stop. Can't you make it stop. My God what's wrong with this country. Have we all gone crazy.
Are we insane. We've lost touch. We've lost touch. We've got to stop this endless running about all I want to do is slow down.
This is all one sentence. No punctuation. All I want to do is slow down just crawl into bed and rock myself to sleep.
I'm not this craziness. Not this crazy running about. I am so tired. Please somebody you have got to help me stop.
I think it's hard. You know. And it's always the reality within us in our own psyches and our own hearts and minds has had it connects to and reflects the external reality in which we live.
So it's been useful for me to really look in this heart and mind and see why do I keep too much over activity in my life that prevents me from making the right choices in terms of what is really important to me.
And it feels important because I would like to come to the end of my life and look and reflect back and say oh yes I use this life well.
I made the right priorities in my mind. I made the right choices. I don't. I don't feel it's so easy to do that in this culture.
And I find at times that I allow this mind to be distracted by all kinds of activities and connections and interactions and media.
I allow it to be distracted because there's a way in which there's a kind of fear of silence. A fear of stillness.
A fear of what might come up in the silence and stillness. A fear of the kind of pain that might be covered up by all the activity.
Beneath the restlessness can be feelings of fear or anxiety or despair or desire that are really unpleasant and difficult.
The internal reality and then there's the external reality all of the enormous forces that that affect us in our lives.
We live in a culture of great materialism and consumption.
And so for many of us we feel obliged to work very hard to make more money to get more material things to use in our diminished leisure time.
And for many of us I don't know if it's so true here in the Palo Alto area. It's certainly true in New Mexico where I live.
Which is a very poor state that many people in our society and our culture are actually forced to work more.
But in the 1950s for example it was fairly common for one person to be a wage earner in a family and to support a whole family that way.
It's very very rare now for that to happen.
So people are actually with the growing difference in wealth in our society.
Many people have to work more jobs. They have to work more time.
They have less time.
There was a tremendous effort had to be made enormous effort over decades to give us the 40 hour week which is now disappearing.
The average is now 52 hours actually for people to work and it's not unusual for people to work 60 or 70 hours a week.
I don't know for those of us who have great hair. Do you remember 30 or 35 years ago when the sociologists were all so terribly worried about how automation would create so much leisure time.
We wouldn't know what to do with ourselves and they were sort of debating what are we going to get people to do when they have so much leisure time.
Whatever happened to that.
We also live in a in an age of enormous massive amounts of information coming into our lives much more than in the past.
It's hard to hold a clear sense of direction in the midst of all that information.
A psychologist in Los Angeles Rex Julian Bieber said the mind's hunger for information is like the body's drive for food.
The brain is a junkie for sensory stimulation consciousness abhors the vacuum.
When we have more information and less time and hence less reflective knowledge there isn't very much room for wisdom in our lives.
So it's interesting to see the influences of a world which is moving faster and faster. Again for those of us who are older you may remember Tothler's book Future Shock.
You know that the world is going to speed up and there's going to be more and more change. Clearly Future Shock is here now.
And we someone also was writing about the writing about the boomer generation and saying and saying we boomers invented the the remote control for television sets.
And we invented attention deficit culture.
You know it's so much with that sense of speed and the sense of actually staying focused on things is is more difficult.
It's literally true. I read a newspaper a while back. It's literally true that the television networks are getting concerned about that little space between the end of the television program and the commercial.
It's less than a second but they think it causes anxiety for the viewers.
Really they're going to try to find ways to eliminate that space. You know I could go on and on about this the subject but it's really our our our external reality has really changed over recent decades and it affects our lives.
It makes living with ease more difficult. And so it takes more of a of a real clear and conscious decision.
And I'd like to just suggest briefly because I'd love to have a discussion about this.
If you're interested to maybe suggest ways in which the Dharma can be helpful to us in terms of making clear choices around this this whole subject of too much activity too much too much too much.
There's one way sort of the deeper way in the midst of all this change in activity.
The Buddha said that there is a reality which is changeless.
The Buddha described Nirvana or or in Pali Nirvana he said profound peaceful free from all troubles luminous and uncreated like an elixir of immortality.
And and in another passage the Buddha said bliss. Yes bliss my friends is Nirvana that was which is unchanging.
And then Edward Concey says that Nirvana is permanent stable imperishable immovable ageless deathless unborn and unbecome that it is power bliss and happiness the secure refuge the shelter and the place of unassailable safety
that it is the real truth and supreme reality that it is the good and the supreme and the supreme goal and the one and only consummation of our life the eternal hidden and incomprehensible peace.
If we have any sense of that unassailable safety and of a reality which is our which is our our deepest reality which is of that which is unchanging.
It gives us a very stable place from which to view the immense changes in our world the coming and going the overstimulation.
So I think the Buddha's teachings hold out that perspective.
And then on a more practical level I think it can be really useful for us to actually make choices in our lives.
And this is something that I have been doing for myself. I've really made this a practice in recent years is actually to say and to be in a break to be very conscious and to say about every single activity and every single relationship in my life to say does this really serve my liberation.
Is this really important.
And perhaps it is. You know that many of us are in circumstances where we're where it is important.
You know if you happen to have a job and and some kind of intimate relationship and to be raising children and to be involved in a spiritual group and you know you may be juggling a great many things in your life where you say this is absolutely important.
I make this choice and I will stay busy for this phase of my life and that's perfectly fine.
But I have found in my own life that there's a way in which I sort of make unconscious choices.
And very often you know when we're when we're we're living in a world where there is so much stress in our lives very often what we do is to to find ways to self medicate simply to to relieve the suffering of the stress.
And so it's possible to turn to to alcohol or to drugs or to sexual addiction or to television or to whatever it is that we need in order to relieve our pain from being stressed out.
It's a bit like you know the the theory of in macrobiotics they say that if you eat red meat which is very young then you're going to have to eat sugar which is very in.
And their suggestion is let go of the red meat let go of the sugar and find a more balanced way in the middle.
If we are living highly stressed lives then we have to balance that out often with behaviors or habits that aren't so good for us.
I was talking to a friend just two days ago on Saturday who was saying I get I get home I'm so tired the only thing I can do is to lie on the couch and turn on the television.
And she says I have to do that you know as an antidote to a life that is too stressed out.
So for me it's been very useful to say is is it useful for me to reduce the stress is it useful for me to make choices about the activities of my life.
Is it useful for me to simplify is it useful for me to practice some form of renunciation that actually is nurturing for me rather than a deprivation.
And I have found it has been actually.
Yeah it's just that that that for me to make to make the choices of letting things go from my life that I once I bring.
The clarity of mindfulness and awareness really to you know to make to catalog the activities of my life the relationships of my life to say does this is this really serving.
And to be able to let many of those things go in a way that doesn't feel like a deprivation it actually feels like a gift and a nurturing to myself.
So I find myself living a simpler life with more happiness.
Because I've chosen to let go of many things in my life to really simplify.
It has been useful to me and I find that for myself at least then there's space there's more space for me to do that which is really wholesome like to have a regular yoga practice and and to to find space to do meditation practice every day.
To to get the exercise that this body needs which in the exercise tends to fall away if I get too stressed.
To maintain a certain level of of emotional and mental health.
By reducing the stresses in my life just to and nobody nobody can make these decisions for us each one of each one of us has to make the decision ourselves.
But it feels to me important actually.
If it feels important actually to take that phrase seriously may I live with ease.
I don't know it just sounds so good to me.
So if if if it feels a problem there's much more I could say on the subject but.
If it feels appropriate if you don't mind I'd just like to do a very brief guided loving kindness meditation directing that loving kindness toward ourselves and feel free to get plenty comfortable.
This practice is actually about enjoying yourself.
So be as comfortable as you want to be.
And if you would just bring your attention inward to your excuse me to your body sitting right now.
And if you would bring your awareness to the heart energy center in the middle of your chest just behind the sternum or the breastbone.
Feeling whatever is there in this moment.
And then if it feels appropriate just to to to send your breath through the heart center breathing through the heart center as it were this practice opens the heart.
And then directing a sense of of of benevolence and connection and kindness and friendship toward yourself.
Just to to extend the wish silently breathing through the heart.
May I be happy may I be safe from inner and outer harm.
May I be healthy and body and mind.
And then just to go back over the same ground in a slightly different way.
To have that wish may I be happy and then is it possible to actually make the commitment.
If being happy is important to you to make the commitment to yourself I will do what is necessary in order to bring myself happiness.
And then to make the wish may I be safe from inner and outer harm.
And if being safe feels important enough to you to make the commitment and I will protect myself in wholesome ways.
And then to make the wish may I be healthy and body and mind.
And if it feels appropriate if having that kind of emotional or mental and physical health are important enough to you to make the commitment I will do all that I can to support my mental and physical health.
And that means making choices.
And then to make the wish may I live with ease.
And if living with ease seems important to make the commitment to yourself and I will do what is necessary in order to come to some ease in my life.
I'll be easier on myself.
Thank you.
I'd like to to end if I can find it here with a poem actually that may be very familiar to many of us.
And if you know this poem intimately please listen to it as if you're hearing it for the first time because it's really apropos.
Wonderfully apropos of this subject.
It's a Mary Oliver's The Summer Day.
Who made the world?
Who made the swan and the black bear?
Who made the grasshopper?
This grasshopper I mean the one who has flung herself out of the grass.
The one who is eating sugar out of my hand.
Who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down.
Who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.
Now she snaps her wings open and floats away.
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
I don't know how to pay attention.
How to fall down into the grass.
How to kneel down in the grass.
How to be idle and blessed.
How to stroll through the fields which is what I have been doing all day.
Tell me what else should I have done?
Doesn't everything die at last and too soon?
Tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?
So thank you.
Any comments or questions on the subject of living with ease?
Please.
I was curious about, for example, someone stressed out, goes home, watches TV.
To them that's trying to be at ease.
Realizing it's not something I want to do the way I want to go.
I'm not going to turn TV on or do whatever I usually do.
There's going to be a lot of stress at that time.
I guess like a wood draw symptom almost.
What's the wise way of, I guess, being compassionate with yourself to go through that rather than just try to cut it off.
Make a big project.
I would say go gently.
You know, it's my sense, it's not true for all of us, but my sense is that often we'll go home after a day of stress and turn on the TV in order to as an antidote to the stress.
A more fundamental way of working at it is to reduce the stress so that we don't have to seek out the antidote.
I spent years and I spent basically a decade doing a whole lot of meditation practice back in the 80s.
I would go off and do really long retreats, months and months.
I would come out and then re-engage in my life and take on the work and all of it and get horribly stressed out.
I would go off and to retreat again and I'd go back into my life and trying to adapt myself to this crazy life.
It took me a long time, a slow learner.
Some people are one, some dogs are one episode learners.
I'm not a one episode learner.
It took me a long time.
I came out of retreat and I said to myself, I can change my life.
Instead of adapting to it, I can actually change it.
It's taken me a long time to do that, but I think it just may be in terms of how to be compassionate with yourself in terms of that process.
It's not to do it in any kind of abrupt and willful way, but really to be reflective.
To really take stock of your life and say, what is really serving me and what isn't?
What is really necessary and what isn't?
And then very gradually to let go of the relationships that may not be so wholesome.
To let go of the activities that may not be so wholesome in a gradual kind of way and see if it's working.
You'll know if it's working if there's more of a sense of balance and ease in your life.
Does this make sense? I mean, it's not.
It's very general guidelines, but I think it's a good project.
It's what I wanted to do.
Please.
I got turned down my hearing aids.
I have the perfect solution.
I'm not stressed.
I'm not all these things you were talking about.
Right.
Because I'm retired.
Sounds good.
Sounds good.
You should be sitting in this chair.
Anyway, it's very helpful to be retired.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
Please.
Yeah, it's actually.
I was the resident resident resident teacher of the Pasana communities in Santa Fe and Albuquerque.
And I was basically the pastor of those communities.
And I loved the work, but I also traveled to lead retreats around the country and I found I couldn't do both and I burned out.
You know, I get too stressed.
And so I left that work and I've actually moved to a really remote place in southwestern New Mexico, very beautiful place called Silver City.
And friends and I are just in the process of founding an intentional Dharma community where we will we're a number of Buddhist practitioners will live and practice together.
And so far there are three of us.
We don't have property yet, but we're we're underway and we hope to grow to maybe 14 or 16 people.
And it just feels like to me like just the right thing to do in my life.
And I understand, you know, we don't we don't have a great history of success of of living in community in this country.
But but I feel like the Dharma actually has been a very powerful vehicle for intentional Dharma community for over 2,500 years in the monastic tradition.
And it's just a question now of our translating we feel of translating into lay people living together and practicing together.
So we're kind of we're calling it a kind of lay monasticism.
You know, we're basically intending to practice the Eightfold Path together.
So so it's it's just in its nascent stages.
But I have a kind of idiot optimism about it.
You know, if we meet in three or four years, maybe I'll have a different perspective.
Please.
Yes, it is. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, great.
Wow. OK.
Please.
Yeah.
Right. That's exactly true. It's exactly true.
And I think you're right. The more that we're able to maintain mindfulness, the more that we have actually are able to develop the qualities of concentration.
It's possible to bring a kind of stillness and balance into the midst of activities.
But just about any mind has its limits.
Please.
Please.
Right.
Is there any moment except that instance rather than kind of plan the end column when we do or say that's the only way that I know.
He's just briefly aggressive.
It doesn't stay very long.
It's eloquently put and it's if we are not identified with what is happening, it doesn't have the same impact.
My teacher Joseph Goldstein often describes it this way in very graphically.
He said normally we relate to our experience like this.
And he said a liberated mind relates to experience like this.
I think that's what you're describing is with that sense of without identification than the work moves through you.
May you have many more moments like that.
How do you deal with the requests of people who come and say we really need you to do this.
It's it's a it's a again I mentioned that this is a work in progress and and you know I'm probably many people people who are drawn to serving others as I do in my work as a as a teacher of the Dharma.
Our codependent personalities you know where we don't have very good boundaries.
I'm learning that it's been it's very difficult at times.
You know because people call me with very very real needs.
And if I'm able to if I have I'm learning that if I have the strength I really want to be available to them.
There are times when I'm learning to say at this moment I can't help you.
You know I can help you tomorrow.
It's hard. It's very hard.
You know and I find that as I grow older and I have more skills there are actually more and more demands.
So it's not as if the demands are diminishing over time they're actually increasing.
So you put your finger on the biggest challenge for me.
And but I'm finding I'm learning to be more balanced with it and it's an enormous blessing in my life.
I would I would go into the communities that I was serving absolutely stressed out and give a Dharma talk.
You know and even if even if the words were right even if my understanding my intellectual understanding of the teaching that I was sharing was right.
The energetic on the energetic level I was not giving them and I was I wasn't modeling for them.
You know a life of balance and ease. And so it was a kind of it's been very useful for me to to do much less.
You know I have pretty good energy tonight.
You know as I speak so that the energy is not the energy of constriction and anxiety.
So so it's a it's a really important question.
We can't we we as individuals cannot be there for all beings all the time.
And no one to find a way as the question here was how do we be compassionate to ourselves.
It's a very important one.
That's it. That's a vast topic.
But thank you for raising the issue even.
Yes.
I just I'm sorry. Please go ahead.
I left it.
I took a huge $25,000 to actually do my work.
I have to create the QJ channel and actually I'm doing hospice work right now.
It's just a wonderful wonderful profession.
And it puts me in touch with that the essence of what it means to live.
I find that you know not having enough money raising two kids and all the stresses of dealing with what you're talking about.
You know just the pull of just so many people in need.
Right.
And the emotional kind of things in the moment of my day.
I mean I can have a great meditation in the morning and one at night but in the middle of that day there is this
I wonder how one can come to that place of where there's this tension and be able to kind of let that go somehow.
Where there's this feeling of being full of the post and which causes a lot of stress.
Right.
So the day and rather than trying to you know like you're saying let the work kind of go through you.
Yes I do.
I do.
And I think my guess is that we could get many suggestions from from this group.
Just just one small one is that I have a friend who's a meditation teacher who sets her watch to beep.
And when it beeps on the hour if unless she's deeply engaged in something she just stops and breathes for 15 seconds.
Just stops for 15 seconds just to breathe.
And she finds that that really helps her in terms of you know it's not we can sit and sit for 45 minutes in the middle of
working in a hospice but it is possible to take a moment to stop to come back to our bodies to breathe.
To find a kind of balance and to let go of the tension.
It's also really useful to watch what the what the intentions are that lead to our actions.
You know it's it's I find for myself the the degree to which I'm responding to people's needs out of anxiety or not wanting to
disappoint them or whatever causes a kind of stress the degree to which I'm actually responding out of a place of compassion
makes it really easy that compassion is an enormously sustaining quality of consciousness and for most of us compassion
and that kind of anxious not wanting people to be disappointed or whatever get mixed in together to be able to distinguish
between those two strengthen one and reduce the other you know the Buddha says says cultivate what is wholesome
abandon what is unwholesome the degree to which one is able to do that it's possible more and more to have a kind of
sustained wholesome energy of intention in the midst of the demands of a day.
Again each one of these questions is something that we could really go into for hours so but thank you for raising it.
Just a final final thing we're just about.
Well I know it's often that I seem to have an assumption that when the mind is alert the body is also alert i.e. tense.
I'd like to try to disconnect those right right.
Just a real quick story when when my teachers went to Barry Massachusetts looking to start a center in the mid 70s
and they came to this Catholic former Catholic monastery and it was this huge place and they thought could we ever fill it.
It became insight meditation society. They were really nervous.
This was Sharon Salzburg and Joseph Goldstein and Jack cornfield and others and they went into the little town of Barry Massachusetts
to the town common and they were trying to think should we do this shouldn't we.
And they found the statue on the town common that had the motto for the town of Barry Massachusetts which was tranquil and alert.
And they said OK we'll do it.
That's it. It's really a quality of holding tranquility and alertness at the same time.
So a tense body is not an alert body necessarily it's just so just to remember the two qualities and to hold them in balance.
Thank you very much. This has been fun.
