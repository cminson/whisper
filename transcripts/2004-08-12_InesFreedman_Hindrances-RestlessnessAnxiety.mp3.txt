 Good evening. Today's hindrance is restlessness and anxiety. Some people call it restlessness and worry, and some translators call it remorse. First I'd like to review briefly what the hindrances are. They're the major obstacles to meditation and liberating insight. Their essential desire of greed, aversion or ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt. These hindrances are universal. We all have them. Development of the mind is twofold, through tranquility and through insight. The mind has to have a certain level of calm and tranquility to be able to see clearly. Learning to work with these hindrances is essential for developing a mind that can clearly see the nature of reality. If you turn your attention inward, any time that you have even the slightest bit of disease, a lack of something isn't quite right, it's a hindrance present. Learning to recognize these hindrances, both on the meditation cushion and during daily life, is a powerful tool for keeping our minds balanced and healthy. For instance, let's say you're underdressed and just a little cold, and in a situation you can't do anything about. The hindrance of aversion can arise, wanting the cold feeling to go away, the mind insisting it shouldn't be this way. When aversion is present, one contracts away from what is, one tightens. By noticing and then letting go of the aversion, we may still experience the discomfort of the cold, but we can relax the part of the mind that insists it shouldn't be this way. One of the trickiest aspects of working with the hindrances is that they block concentration and weaken discernment. Discernment is the ability to make skillful judgments. This makes it difficult to realize what's skillful. One needs to have a strong sense that the hindrances themselves are unbeneficial states of mind before one can work at abandoning them. Yet while one is overcome with the hindrances, they impair one's ability to see that they are in fact unbeneficial. For instance, when one feels anger, it's hard not to feel that that anger is justified. Or when you're worried, it's hard not to believe one needs to worry. As the mind gets quieter, the hindrances can become subtler. But this is why it's called practice. And the more we're in the habit of noticing the hindrances, the easier it is to see them as they arise and then let them go. It's important to have a friendly relationship with our hindrances. If we struggle with them, we only increase the agitation or aversion. Some of you have heard this poem. It's a beautiful poem by Rumi that I think expresses this really well. It's called the guest house. This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival, a joy, a depression, a meanness. Some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all, even if they're a crowd of sorrows who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture. Still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes because each has been sent as a guide from beyond. According to the dictionary, restlessness is the quality of being ceaselessly moving or active. A feeling of agitation expressed in continual motion, the inability to rest or relax or be still, a lack of patience, irritation with anything that causes delay, being fidgety, uneasy. Restlessness is unpleasant, so there's a tendency of the mind to push it away, to not want it there. The mind is restless and restlessness is further enhanced by struggling against it. Anxiety is defined as a vague, unpleasant emotion that's experienced in anticipation of some often ill-defined misfortune. Restlessness of the mind tends to show itself in restlessness in the body, in meditation, by wanting to shift positions, by tightness, by tension. In daily life, in almost anything we do, from the obvious tapping your fingers, tapping your feet, overeating, biting your nails, that it could be anything we do to keep busy because we just feel restless, turning on the TV, even reading a book. The Buddha likened the hindrance of restlessness to a churned up water surface, ruffled by the wind, disturbed and covered with waves, so the person looking at the reflection would not be able to know or see it as it actually is. In the same way, restlessness prevents one from clearly seeing what is. The suttas say that any unwholesome state of mind has both restlessness and delusion. Restlessness is part of every hindrance, but when you're looking to identify a hindrance that's present, look for the most obvious or noticeable. For example, let's say you're meditating and start fantasizing about what you'll have for dinner. Restlessness is present, but if your fantasy becomes real enough that you start salivating, then that becomes desire. If your mind starts shifting, well maybe I'll have some ice cream later, maybe I'll bake some cookies, and I can eat a couple and bring them to work tomorrow, it might be that restlessness is more prominent, but more than one hindrance can be strongly present at the same time. In meditation, we often call that a multiple hindrance attack. Restlessness and anxiety can take many different forms, worry, planning, physical restlessness, self-judgment, regret of the past, nervousness, remorse. What these different forms have in common is that we're either regretting or judging the past or worrying about the future. Peace and happiness can only occur in the present moment. If we're remembering the past or worrying about the future, we're not experiencing the present, but we're lost in remembrance and projection. Worry is fear of what may happen in the future. Anxiety is a nonspecific fear of what will happen. We often get lost in regret of the past and self-judgment. We dwell on thoughts like, I shouldn't have said that, I made a mistake, or they didn't like me. Regretting the past comes from actions with either committed or omitted, and is a major source of restlessness in meditation and daily life. When we pay attention to how much of the disquiet of the mind comes as a result of past actions, the imperative to live a life of integrity becomes more and more compelling. Planning is useful at the right time, but planning can easily become worry. When one becomes concerned if the plan will materialize, that's worry. We often find ourselves planning and re-planning a coming event, a conversation, often in the same useless loop. Lack of exercise can cause a physical restlessness we often don't recognize, especially among those of us who work sitting in front of the computer, or just very sedentary most of the day. If we pay attention to our bodies, we'll get up and stretch or take a walk. If we don't, the body itself becomes restless. Too much coffee or other stimulants can also cause a physical restlessness. For many of us, it's probably not a good idea to sit and meditate after a couple of cups of coffee. Suppressed emotions can also be a source of restlessness. When we don't pay attention to our emotions when they arise, we tend to either act them out or to suppress them. Suppressed emotions often simmer underneath unnoticed, except for pervasive feeling of restlessness. Boredom comes from aversion. The mind likes stimulation. When stimulation is very low, it can cause a somewhat unpleasant state of mind. What we notice we're bored is because we don't like the state of low stimulation and we want it to go away. So the mind becomes restless, therefore increasing stimulation. If we can notice the unpleasantness of the unstimulated mind and make it the object of our attention, it just becomes another meditation object that comes and goes. The most direct way to work with restlessness or any of the hindrances is to be mindful of them, to transform them into the object of meditation. In mindfulness meditation, the object of meditation is not important. Mindfulness is. It doesn't matter what you pay attention to. Any object is worthy of attention and the hindrance is a great object of attention. In meditation, when you notice the mind won't settle, notice it. You can use the mental whisper to name it. Restlessness, restlessness. Turn your attention to it. What is this restlessness? How does it feel in the body? What parts of the body are affected by it? How does restlessness feel in the mind? Try not to judge or condemn it. Don't push it away. Like all phenomena, it's conditioned and impermanent. It will come and go. Be curious, investigate it. For instance, let's say I'm meditating and I remember I have seven calls to make this morning. I may start thinking about them. I notice them that my attention has drifted and I bring myself back to the breath and again the thought comes up. What if I don't have time? I have an appointment. I force my attention back to the breath. Maybe I should call Kathy first. After bringing the attention back, I might notice the repetitive nature of these thoughts. Then I recognize, oh, I'm worrying, worry, worry. I rapidly might rush back to my breath, but I notice attention and I realize that underneath I'm judging myself for worrying. So then I notice judging, judging. Then I open my mind to the quality of my mental state and I see how I'm tense and contracted. I stay with it and as it becomes less compelling, this time I gently return to the breath. Restlessness can be unpleasant. Try to stay with it and experience it without getting cut up in the content of its story. Don't push it away. As Jack Cornfield suggested, if restlessness gets very intense, think to yourself, I'll be the first meditator in America to actually die of restlessness. Surrender to it. Don't struggle with it. Don't resist it. Don't be in a rush to get rid of it. Just notice any resistance to experiencing restlessness. There are several different approaches to working with restlessness. One that has been useful to me and can also be used with any unwholesome mental state is the RAIN formula. R-A-I-N, RAIN, for recognition, acceptance, interest, and non-identification. Let's say I'm cooking dinner for some guests and I'm worried about everything I have to do, shopping, cleaning, cooking. The first step is recognition. So I name it, worry. I might also be judgmental about it and I think to myself, I'm not supposed to be worrying. I'm supposed to be enjoying this. I then recognize judgment. The next step is acceptance. I accept that I'm worrying and that I'm judging myself for worrying. I do this with the spirit of openness and non-resistance. No need to reject the worry or judgment. For me, one of the significant benefits of meditation practice has been to become much more comfortable with being uncomfortable. In mindfulness meditation, we're training the mind's ability to stay open and present and balanced through all the experiences that may happen internally or externally. It's possible to stay balanced with a very restless mind. The next step is interest. To examine what's going on with interest and curiosity, how does this worry feel in my body? How does it feel in my mind? Is it changing? And the final step is non-identification. The worry or judgment is just the mental state. It comes and goes. It's not who I am. I am not this worry. Many times, just the very first step, recognition, is all that's needed. A moment of recognizing restlessness is a moment of mindfulness. In that moment, however brief it might be, restlessness is suspended, which calms the mind. The moment of accepting the restlessness calms the mind some more, as we're no longer in conflict with our restlessness. This allows us to investigate it, to be curious about it, which further calms the mind. And if you investigate deeply enough, you see that all that restlessness, all that anxiety is not self. Restlessness can come at varying levels of intensity, and different methods might be useful at different times. One common antidote for restlessness is concentration. When restlessness seems too strong to simply observe, try counting your breaths until the mind comes back to balance. Concentration cultivates calmness and tranquility. A common method is counting the breaths 1 to 10 and back down to 1. If you lose track, you start all over. So if you've counted 3 breaths and you've already spaced out, just start over. It doesn't matter how many breaths you do. You just go back. A happy mind is not restless. Metta, or loving kindness practice, is often taught using four phrases that will repeat silently. For those of you who haven't done it, some common phrases are, may I be happy? May I be peaceful? May I be well? May I be safe? Focusing on loving kindness towards oneself helps with restlessness in two ways. It's a form of concentration practice which alone calms the mind. And it also inclines the mind to kindness and acceptance. A related practice, sometimes used for the cultivation of happiness, is smiling. Smiling has a direct effect on calming the mind. For some of us, at first when we try it, it may seem contrived. That with practicing it, we can soon recognize the benefits of it. You often see the little statues with a little half smile. I said try it if you've never tried that, like just a very slight smile when you're sitting, when you're meditating. And see how it feels. Another approach we've already touched on is the investigation of the body. Experiencing the restless or anxiety in the body. Where do you feel it? Do you feel it coursing through your body? How does it feel? Notice tightness, vibration, oscillation, tension. Sometimes expanding the focus of attention is very helpful. One can shift attention from using the breath as an anchor to listening to sounds. Not trying to identify them, not trying to bring them in, but just the ambient random sounds that enter consciousness. By expanding the focus outward, the mind can feel less constricted. Just by sitting still and not moving, the mind itself begins to quiet. A good analogy is taking a glass of dirty water and shaking it. You see all the particles, you can't see through it. At first the water is very murky, but if you just let it sit there, the particles just settle to the bottom and the water again is clear. When restlessness is overpowering, sometimes what I call skillful bargaining can be useful. I'll just pay close attention for five breaths. I personally have a very strong planning habit. Often just noticing it makes it go away, but sometimes it's more compelling and I'll ask myself, is this planning necessary? If yes, then I ask if this is the appropriate time to plan now. If I'm meditating, the answer is usually no. But sometimes the planning is very compelling. I'll take a moment to decide on a later time to do the planning. I'll say to myself, when I'm done meditating, I'll sit down and write out my plan, or I'll call so-and-so. But I decide on a very specific time when I'll deal with it, and then let my mind rest. The mind gets habituated by any recurring unskillful thoughts. It forms a groove in the mind, so it's very important in development of mental clarity to actively discourage unskillful thoughts. In the suttas, the Buddha suggested five ways to work with distracting thoughts, if they don't go away with simple attention. The first is substitution, or to reflect on a different object. For example, if you were judging yourself negatively over something you've done in the past, or regretting something, you could substitute it with thoughts of loving kindness. May I be happy? May I be peaceful? The second method that's described for working with distracting thoughts is to reflect on the disadvantages or the drawbacks of those thoughts. If you were focused on something you didn't like by yourself, you could reflect on how that makes you feel, how contracted that state is, and how you're conditioning your mind in the habit of judging, and that doing so has no beneficial effects. The third method is to ignore it, just pay no attention to it. The fourth is to reflect on the removal of the source of the unskillful thought. Now it's a little harder to follow. You reflect on stopping whatever triggered the thought. What's the cause of this thought? Let's say you're judging someone as being loud and obnoxious. You look back and see that when they initially spoke to you, you found the tone of their voice unpleasant. You reacted with aversion to the unpleasant experience, and this triggered the judgment. Can you let go of their verse of reaction and just see it as unpleasant? If the first four methods don't work, this one is really the method of last resort. You can use suppression. The suta says, quote, with clenched teeth and the tongue pressing on the palate, restrain, subdue, and beat down the mind with the mind. Using this method, you might willfully say, I refuse to judge myself. That may sound like it's at odds with the idea of accepting what is, but sometimes with repetitive thoughts, we just keep doing them and they get habituated in the mind. So it's very important with something that's so repetitive to just stop it, and that's when something like this can be useful. To let go of restlessness, it's important to see it as an unskillful mental state and to move to a skillful mental state instead of moving from something one doesn't like towards something one likes. You don't want to get rid of your restlessness out of aversion to it. You want to get rid of it out of understanding it, understanding that it's not a skillful place to be, not just, I just don't like how that feels. In terms of weakening the general habit of restlessness in our lives, the sutas speak about six things in our general life that are conducive to the abandonment of restlessness and anxiety. The first is knowledge of the Dharma. This could manifest in many ways. One of the ways might be having a phrase that comes easily to mind when we find ourselves anxious about the future, such as, there's nothing to hold onto as me or mine. If we're tempted to act unskillfully, we can think about karma and the effects of our actions on ourselves and others. The second factor conducive to the abandonment of restlessness is reflecting on it, just staying aware of it. Pay attention throughout the day. Are you anxious? Are you leaning forward or are you relaxed? The third factor is practicing moral conduct. A great deal of the restlessness we experience comes from our unskillful actions. When one's behavior is skillful, there isn't much to regret. Most restlessness comes from regret of the past or fear of the future. The fourth factor is having a mentor or mentors. The sutta says, associating with those mature in age and experience who possess dignity, restraint and calm. Having teachers who set good examples, who you can watch and see the way they act, see how mindfully they act. And it sort of rubs off being around them. The fifth is noble friendship. Having friends who are aligned with your values. The sixth is suitable conversation or right speech. Most of the things I tend to regret are things I've said. These different approaches can be useful in meditation, but they can also be useful for working with restlessness in daily life, even if we're very busy. For instance, let's say I'm working on a project where I need to make several decisions. I find myself worrying about the results of the decisions I haven't yet made. Will so-and-so be upset? What if it doesn't work out? When I do that, I'm doing nothing helpful in making the decision. When I finally remember to apply mindfulness, I recognize that I'm worrying. Often recognizing it is enough to let it go. Other times I find I'm judging myself, maybe replaying what went wrong last time I did a project like this. And how unhappy so-and-so was with me. I may become mindful of self-judgment but may not be able to let go of it. Sometimes a few moments of metta or loving kindness can be useful. May I be happy or may I be free of suffering? Sometimes I'm rushing on a project. I get interrupted by the phone, people walking in, and I find myself tight and tense. Sometimes smiling can help me relax. Often just taking a few deep breaths to calm the body is helpful to restore balance or stretching or taking a walk. Sometimes when the mind is so restless it can't concentrate on the job it has to do. Skilful bargaining might help. I'll work on this for only 10 minutes just so I get started. This approach is also often helpful for people who are trying to establish a regular meditation practice. You make a promise that every day you'll sit on your cushion and meditate even if it's only 5 minutes. Just noticing restlessness, the worry or anxiety is the beginning of letting it go. The moment when we're mindful of it, we're in the present. In mindfulness, all objects are worthy of our attention and there's no need to reject them. Freedom is about letting go of clinging. To paraphrase Joseph Goldstein, it matters not to what you don't cling. There was a somewhat controversial book that was written in the late 80s called Holding Time. It was a book on child rearing, ways to work with children's temper tantrums and other difficult emotions. The therapy consists of a parent holding the child when the tantrum begins. The first stage during holding is one of confrontation as the child protests being held. Stage two is rejection as the child struggles to get away. As this happens, the parent kindly expresses their feelings and concerns to the child. At this point, the parent uses their strength and tenacity to prevent the child from breaking away from the embrace. As the struggle intensifies, there's eventually a dissolving of the struggle as the relationship becomes tender and intimate with intense eye contact, touch and conversation. This is the final stage of resolution and is marked by feelings of closeness and contentment. The idea is that you will not be making the baby angry by holding. Instead, you will be allowing the baby to express their anger. When a parent can stay present with their child's emotions, it gives the child permission to experience them. In the same way, we can hold our own difficult emotions with our attention, with kindness and compassion and tenacity and allow ourselves to deeply feel our difficult mental states and emotions. I'd like to end with this quote from Ajahn Chah from a still-force pool. Try to be mindful and let things take their natural course. Then your mind will become still in any surroundings like a clear forest pool. All kinds of wonderful, rare animals will come to drink at the pool, and you will clearly see the nature of all things. You will see many strange and wonderful things come and go, but you will be still. This is the happiness of the Buddha. Are there any questions or comments you'd like to make? Is it okay to have a paper next to me during the presentation? Any other questions? I have some for you. Did any of you, when we did the sitting and I recommended that you don't move, was that something that changed your sitting for any of you? How did that go for you? I'm kind of at a place in meditating, wondering about sitting in this way and keeping still or using a chair. I think it's good to explore that. When you said that to me, I could focus on the pain in my middle back and work with that and say that and then go back to focusing on my breath. That was a good thing for me to practice and try on. Did anybody else try that? I couldn't quite hear. I can tolerate the uncomfortable feeling, which is good because I don't want to tolerate discomfort at all in real life. You said you have inversion to practicing at home? Right now, yeah. Okay. I'd like to hear from you. What do you usually do when you're restless or anxious in your daily life? What are some of the things that you might do? I don't know how it feels in your body, how it feels in my body, how I'm breathing, how I'm holding myself. That's a skillful way of working with it. How about any of you? Go ahead. Oh, something. I try to write. Usually, there are some things in the mind, so I try to figure out what is it that I'm listening to and usually follow the music to. I try to write. I dump. Mental dump on the paper. In fact, I just write on it, so. That's great. Yeah, writing is a really excellent way of working with restlessness in daily life. How about any other unskillful ways besides eating that you might use? Daydreaming. Daydreaming. Yeah, that's real common. Reading trash and alcohol. The one thing I'm not sure if it's considered unskillful or okay. Like, if you're a fan, it gets really over-building. Sometimes I can just like, if I can't, I can't take my family down. I'm not just a lay down or a fine man. Kind of with the down sort of meditation. That sounds very skillful. I can't imagine anything not skillful about doing that. How that we're all, instead of mentioning write immediately when you get up, which is really fascinating when we do it, if I start, I'll like say, I'll start talking to my partner or I'll fix him. I'll do lunch or get up to talk to him and then I'll like, I'm not working with him, but even then I'll do the laundry or do a spill of papers, do anything. And then just get myself to the end. Once I'm conscious, I just don't want to do it. So I guess I'm going to try that five minute technique again that needs to work to get me to do that. When you find yourself listening to someone who goes on and on about something you have no interest in, how do you usually feel? Who wants to share that? Irritated. I always want to interrupt them. Mm-hmm. Usually it's something I try not to respond and wait for a break. I mean, I don't mean like not to respond to the front end. I don't nod and yes, I'm here, I do nod, yes, I'm here, but I don't have any comments that I might bring it on. And when there is a break, you know, the person that's going to be saying what they're saying either change the conversation to something I want to be going through or something that's both of us are interested in and not just something that's going to be fine with my music. So now they go ahead with your change subject and they now go on and on about that. So what do you do? If I'm with more than one person or in a social situation or a situation with other people, it's a conversation to find someone else to talk to. If it's somebody I know fairly well, I don't have. I'm kind of just trying to breathe, you know, and just kind of like somebody needs to know, you know, whatever. Just getting to me, just try to listen to this. Yes? I'll oftentimes ask them a question. Something that engages me about what they're saying and sometimes some of my mutation will take place and all of a sudden, whenever I'm listening to, realizes they have an audience. Sometimes it just happens to somebody and they go into these litanies of, you know, whatever it is, the script that they have. And sometimes it's like if I find that if I ask a question and draw, act interested, become interested, it changes the whole thing. That's it. Yeah, you connect with them. That's great. That is what you're doing. And breathe and notice my rest, notice that urgency in me that makes me want to get the hell out of there. Then I can stop and I can listen and then I can really hear them. And actually, you know, whatever they have to say has a lot of it. I mean, it is very interesting. And if you really think about it, you can stop and think about what they're saying, what's behind the words. But ultimately, it is very interesting. It's just that, you know, whether or not you're willing to take the time to do that, for me it was. Yes. I struggle with that, especially if I'm in a meeting or in a group where I have no, I can't believe my daughter is there. And I am very fortunate, but now I'm in college and then deal with it in a kind of way because I just grew up or I've waited for a little while and I start really, I, I... I can't believe, like I didn't get very tragic. And I can see for myself, I'm just right. I know there's horrible things, but I never thought I'd think, oh, I've done those. Now that I'm learning all those things, that I've got to find a better kind way to deal with it. And I would like to learn that because it's... I know I have a great idea. What did you... Let me go ahead and take that question. In that kind of situation, I'll be on a train where there is a time limit to it. And during that time, rather than listening to the words that are being said so much, I'll try to listen to the person that is saying the words, listen at a different level. It's interesting to find out what that does sometimes. Again, what seems to be the common thread in people who are doing this skillfully is really connecting with the person regardless of what they're saying. It's really seeing them as another human being that we're with. And, you know, in terms of that very difficult situation that you have, you know, that's really... That's what I would suggest is try really focusing on who the person is, not what they're saying. There's lots of... But mostly it's being with your own feelings, really paying attention to your own feelings. That's how it feels in your body, taking a couple of deep breaths, getting centered. Go ahead. You just answered the question. I have a question. My question would kind of be how do you deal with it and just answer it. My other question is... You may have mentioned that something like this, but it's a restlessness. So I have it because a lot of good ideas for it gets addressed with hearing education or whatever. But what if I feel restless in a social situation? Like say that there's a party, you know, where there are people or whether there's just a family or a dog or some kind of social situation where I can't really go into... Because usually when I'm solo, I try to meditate here more to deal with my restlessness. But if I am in a situation where I can't go into meditating, then... Social meditating. What's your suggestion for me? Well, for me, the quickest thing when I'm in a situation where things are changing faster around me is to just get into my body. I go back to my breath and still totally focus on the breath and the rest of the body. I'll do a global awareness of my body and that's usually what grounds me the quickest. It doesn't require a lot of time. You can just keep kind of shifting back to that. When it becomes the habit, you know, you just habitually... You might get all distracted in the social situation and then, oh, back to the body. Just like you do regular on the cushion, you can just keep doing that with just part of your attention. Can you do this while you are having a conversation with someone or a pre- I've been thinking, and this seems like possibly time to bring it up, but the instruction that's always helpful to me when restlessness is this thing Jack says about the big pasture. Give it more and more space and so try to, instead of focusing on the details inside the body, sometimes that works. Sometimes the opposite works. Just make what your object of meditation, a huge situation like the whole party, you know, like here I am in this room with all this energy going on in me and the energy and the other people. And somehow just make a big, big space for what you consider the field of what it is that you are aware of and then all the stuff that sort of bounds him and the field. You can kind of even not try to tightly focus on one thing. Steve? Or to compliment that, all right, my useful is focusing on the body, but the limits of the body. You find the edge of where, the edge of your awareness, there's peace there. And you see the restlessness in here, but you just say that's the goal. How about when you're in a position of waiting, like sacred lock? So what's the... So you time everywhere you go for the worst kinds of traffic. I find that in situations where it's clear I can't do anything about it, there's a lot of freedom in that. Focus on my breathing if I can do that or I can just meditate a perfect experience. It's actually sort of liberating because I know there's nothing I can do about it. The more difficult situation has been, there's a lot of moving traffic that you have to pay a lot of attention to and everything in the branching text will be more difficult to do. The waiting is okay. I like to try this, but I have a concern on maybe being able to check it up because I want to deal with my concern. I like the idea of doing some own. I'm not going to put my car on my crew, I still see them, there's nothing I can pay for anything. My concern about doing the own is that I'm looking for other drivers. Are they going to think I'm crazy or fighting like that? I'm not going to say anything. I want to explain to you, maybe I'm going to make a mistake of your mother, so that means their own shame. I don't know, maybe they'll leave you alone. As long as you're in Moraine County, it's okay. I'm not, but I'm still in Colorado. I've seen people putting on their makeup, shaving. Changing clothes, I mean, I wouldn't worry about it myself. You might want to pay attention to the part of your mind that's worried about what other people think. How about tech support? I was thinking about when you said when you're stuck in a situation you can't do anything about. I find it really easy to relax into gridlock, it's not a problem. But tech support, somehow you're in a situation you can't do anything about, but there's more of a feeling of helplessness and frustration sometimes that's hard to work with. Because there's an individual to direct your unhappiness to. What if you are tech support? I'm going to go to the next person. I enjoyed your talk and I wish I worked for it Monday because I had the most best host day Tuesday morning in the memory. So thank you for that and use that in the future. But I have a coming in my life and I won't mention any names, but they're the children that are in my own family. And she's got some very strong beliefs and she just goes on and on and on and she just sprayed at me and I feel the tension in my neck and we can't change this subject and we can't change her mind and I can't change my mother. How do you handle that? Because it just gets me, sometimes I just can't hear it and I listen and show them how many people they're talking to. It just has such a negative impact on me and I'm just wondering how do I, what do you recommend for a situation like that? Working with a parent, that's the advanced course. You have to practice the rain formula. If you actually go through it step by step, it's not going to be clear out the first time you do it, but by using it habitually over and over again, you recognize, oh, I have aversion to what she's saying. You recognize that feeling, I'm frustrated. You accept the fact, oh, I'm angry, I'm frustrated by this. And then you start investigating it. What's really going on in me? Pay attention to your body. How does the mind actually feel? Instead of trying to not want to feel it, look at it and explore it. And then realize that everything you experience while you're on the phone with her comes and goes. It's temporary. It's not who you are. And it's really challenging. I mean, I really, I know this from very personal experience. But the more you work that way with all difficulties, it becomes easier and easier to work with. I have a husband who loves to lecture me. And he drives me through absolutely crazy. And he's got a strong, righteous view. And it's not a conversation with a sister-elect, you know what you're like. And what I have found is that if I try to shut the lock, it just gets worse. And so the nice thing about these lectures is that you have like being stuck in traffic. You have lots of time. So what I do is, you know, I know that tension in that. You just, like every fiber, just wants to get up and walk out of the room. You just want to do that. So what I do is I sit there and I just put my hands on the table or whatever. And I just look at them. And I breathe. And I just look at them. And then I will start to encourage myself to be curious. Really curious about where is this coming from. And try and get me to talk about that rather than just trying to shut off. Because that, you know, what I find is that if I can come from a genuine place of curiosity rather than trying to protect myself, then it would work. I don't know how mysterious I am. I just sort of came down to it. Well, you know, it's either, do I want to make this work or not? And, you know, she's your mother. And. It's, you know, it's nine o'clock. So I hate to cut you off. It sounds like I'd love to hear what the rest of you have to say. Time to go home. So thank you all.
