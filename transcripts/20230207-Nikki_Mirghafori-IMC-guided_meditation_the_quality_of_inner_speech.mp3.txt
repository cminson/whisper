 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Greetings, friends. Greetings from Mountain View, California, on Cidadoloni land, to wherever you are in the world, joining each other in this wonderful moment in time, whatever the conditions are. It's wonderful to just be an experience and have agency, whether there are challenges, difficulties, your full catastrophe. It's a privilege to be human with all its ups and downs. So, delighted to be joining you. The theme for this week is, why speech? For the meditation, the invitations are to notice our internal speech, because speech isn't just what we engage in externally, but also how we address ourselves, how we do the narration, all the internal speeches, also speech. So, that's the general invitation. And I'll say more about, yeah, I'll share more in the department. So, let's practice together. Let's begin our meditation. So, arriving, arriving in this body. It feels comfortable to close your eyes, or maybe have the slit open. That's perfectly fine too. That's what's more comfortable. And coming and coming to this body, this human body, this amazing miracle of nature, inclining your awareness, your attention, and the mysterious ways we can do that. So, this awareness, attention, whatever it is, the power of consciousness, directing, inviting it to pay attention, to rest on the body. Sensations of the body. Inviting the body to soften and relax might be helpful to start, say, from the top and go to the bottom of the body. Notice the forehead, it's tight, your cheeks, your jaw. Not forgetting the eyes, let them rest in their socket. Ah, exhaling, relaxing the face, neck and shoulders. The arms, the hands, let them give their weight to the earth. Relaxing, softening the chest. With the next exhale, the abdomen. Let the entire weight of the upper body be released into your sitting bones. Relaxing the legs, upper legs, knees, lower legs, and feet. Let the breath be received, the relaxed body soft, spacious here. The body is tight, the mind gets tight, flutters away here and there. The heart can soften. And this spacious, miraculous moment in time, receiving, receiving the breath, receiving the breath, receiving the breath, receiving the breath, receiving the breath. And as thoughts arise, as they will inevitably do, notice kindly, gently, with metta, notice their quality. Of thoughts of our inner speech, if it's directed to ourselves, or about others, is it even true? Is it even factual? Have a lightness about it. Is it even factual? Kindly, gently, laugh. Is it even true? Is it even factual? Don't have to believe it. It's not even true. It's just an opinion. And then can you release, can it be released with a smile, with friendliness? And giving our hearts to the breath. Presence in this moment, if another thought arises. Again, noticing. Perhaps we can notice if there is greed or wanting in the speech, or ill-will resentment if it's about others. And willingly, after noticing, we let go. After knowing in this way, we let go and we come back to our anchor. And we stay with the anchor, this nourishing, calming, soothing, gathering, collecting, life-giving anchor of the breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If you notice any greed or hatred or confusion in your speech, let there not be aversion. We're adding more hatred on top of it. Let there be kindness. Oh, my inner speech, I just noticed. Aversive. Oh, sweetheart. Oh, sweetheart, it's okay. We let that go. Let there be kindness instead. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As our schan And after you've noticed, let go, let go, just here. Put the breath in the body. And finally, let go. Bring in the sleep, beautiful. Cl resisting your pillowhouse. you you you you you you you you Sitting to a close together. Letting go of any judgment for how it must have been, should have been, wasn't letting go. And appreciating the goodness that we showed up, we did our best. And sharing our inner goodness, the co-created goodness, the metta with metta, with kindness. And sharing this, shining this light of metta, this light of goodness, ourselves and sharing it with all beings everywhere, all beings. And especially right now those who are affected by particularly challenging circumstances. Our siblings on this earth, natural disaster, earthquake, sending them our support in our heart, our compassion. We are not so different. We are all subject to the same causes and conditions, challenges in this world. We are not so different from these siblings throughout the world. Sharing our goodness, our metta, our good will, our humanity. And may all beings everywhere be free from suffering. May all beings everywhere be safe, happy, healthy. May they have ease. May all beings everywhere be free, including ourselves.
