The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So today, the tool of exploring the refrain of the Satipatana,
which in some way is, I don't want to say more important, as important, is very important.
So just to remind us of the refrain, I will put up the diagram from yesterday again.
This is from Bicco Inaleo's book, page 17. The name of the book is Satipatana, the Direct Path to Realization.
And it's also, I put this up on audioderma associated with this week's teachings, actually with yesterday's teaching, so you can look it up.
So the refrain shows up, this refrain, this important refrain shows up after every teaching, after every teaching, shows up 13 times.
And just to say a little more about the significance and then focusing on the internal, external that we've done today is,
so this refrain, as I mentioned yesterday, it both talks, it expands each teaching, it does three things after each teaching,
say after breathing, after postures, after activities, anatomical parts, elements, etc.
It both adds a spatial aspect, which is internal, external, and it also adds a temporal aspect, which we'll discuss tomorrow,
because the refrain talks about arising and passing and arising and passing, so it brings a temporal time aspect to the study of the phenomena.
And also another thing that's significant about this, and I like to point out about the refrain, is that it is worded,
not with respect to the individual content. So after the section about, say, breathing, or actually let me put up this again so you can get a sense of it.
Go, okay, so like, and there are six sections for the body, breathing, postures, activities, etc.
After the teaching, especially on breathing, the refrain goes back to the body, says the body, it talks about the body,
after postures, it doesn't say postures, it's the wording refers to the body.
So as I read, in this way, in regard to the body, one abides contemplating the body, it doesn't say, you know, one abides.
So there's something about, oh, the bigger picture, the bigger picture invites us to contemplate the bigger picture.
So the idea here is, and let me stop the share here, some commentators say that what is significant here about this going back and forth is that in each teaching,
we focus on the content, but coming out, the practitioner is invited to study, to be aware, to be mindful of the general characteristics of the experience.
And when we become aware of the general characteristics, not the detailed, not the thing itself, but the fact that it's internal, external, it's everywhere and it arises and passes.
We shift from a content, studying the content to studying the general process.
And when we study the general process, that's when insights about anicca, dukkha and nannatta, impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and impersonality, not self, pop out.
And that's something I was gently inviting you to explore this morning, if it perhaps maybe for a split second popped out for you.
And if not, no worries, when the mind is ready, the heart is ready, they will be seen, the insight will reveal itself.
So I quote John Engler in this regard who says, his opinion, not mine, but I think it's interesting to see it this way.
The reason, he says, the reason Western meditators tend to progress more slowly than their Eastern counterparts is the tendency to become absorbed in the content of awareness, rather than continuing to attend to its process,
becoming preoccupied with individual thoughts, images, memories, sensations, etc. Rather than keeping their attention focused on the essential characteristics of all psychophysical events, whatever the content,
a tendency to confuse meditation with psychotherapy and to analyze mental content instead of simply observing it.
And you know this, many of you know this already, it's not so much about the content, it's the process, it's the arising and passing, and also this internal, external, which is often not taught, or emphasized.
So I want to focus now after taking more time to set the frame, the importance of the refrain, left over from yesterday what I wanted to say, today I want to now speak more about this first line,
about this practice of internal, external, which again comes in after every teaching in the Satipatana, pretty wild, right?
So the internal, external can be applied to every aspect, and in fact in the commentaries, in the Visuddhimaga, in the path of purification commentary especially,
it is taught the internal, external, for every aspect of the Satipatana.
So it could be applied to the breath, to the postures internally, and just to say internal here of course means our bodies, external in this case means other human beings or other beings, other beings.
So observing our own breath, their breath, our posture, their posture, our bodily activities, their body parts, elements, the cemetery contemplation, internally, externally,
Vedana, mind states, as well as the aggregates. And I'll share with you a personal story here since we're talking about this.
The first time I practiced this internal, external, I didn't even know this was part of the teachings years ago when I practiced with my teacher Pahak Sayada, who teaches very, very detailed Vipassana from the Abhidharma and the Visuddhimaga.
And my instructions for days was to contemplate the 32 body parts internally, first internally, first you do it internally until it becomes really, really, really clear.
And then really clear until actually one feels that, wow, this body is just body parts, it's like sack of grain, it's just sack of grain, rice and this and that, it's just body parts.
And then the instructions were to, okay, now externally, externally, all other beings, not just humans, but where I was practicing their chipmunks and things like that, externally, the instruction was, all beings, internally, externally,
all beings too, body parts just like me, just like me, then start to see all beings walk, actually body parts starting to walk around, which is a very interesting way of seeing the world.
We usually don't see that way, but it is just as valid to see any other way, just as valid to see any other way. There are all these body parts moving around, and then internally, externally, something pops out.
Wow, the impersonality, the impersonality of this body, these body parts.
So when we start Satipatana, as I read, this line starts with contemplating the body internally. So first we do it internally to establish, to really get a sense, to establish also Samadhi concentration, the mind settles, and then it has the ability to go externally
and investigate or see the same phenomena externally.
And it's also said that external also could, for these various aspects, see observing other people's postures, their facial expressions, their tone of voice, when you get to feelings, and state of mind, for example, the next few weeks, you will be studying, say, state of mind,
and the dhammas, the aggregates, internally, externally.
Is a suitable practice for daily life? Is a suitable practice? Because one, perhaps one issue that some people point out, or maybe they feel, when they do a lot of internal practice, is they become too internalized.
Like, oh, just internally, like, don't bother me, I'm just practicing internal. Whereas the instruction is internal, externally, internally, externally, internally, externally.
So, so that we don't risk becoming self-centered, and only aware of our own self, and what's happening internally, but also open, aware of other people's feelings, body, behavior, and how our actions, how our words, actions, our internal state affect other people's
state of, to become more aware of our impact on the world, through this internal, external practice, internal, external. So the external practice is so important.
As here laid out as the second step, first internal, then external, observing the world, others, other beings, their state, their state of mind, their state of breathing, etc.
And then the third step, and this is so important, I want to say it again. The third part, the third phrase, when we're invited to, to the wording is, let me get the exact wording.
One abides contemplating the body, both internally and externally. One abides contemplating the body, both internally and externally.
And some commenters, commentaries say, since we can't do it at the same time, you go back and forth. Okay, that's one way. But another way, what happens, actually, is you notice yourself when you do internal and external, when you try to hold it together and even go back and forth.
Wow, a sense of objectivity arises. It's just a body is just a breath, the sense of objective, the sense of subjective stance drops out.
And an insight towards not self, towards this universality of whatever phenomena we're observing, the universality of the phenomena pops out. So it's not just the thing itself anymore.
It's the universality of it that arises. I cannot emphasize how important these practices are, the refrain, the internal, external. So today, my invitation is as you go through your day, through your life, daily life, practice external mindfulness, practice external awareness.
Both internal, internal, what's happening internally, externally what's happening externally for other beings, internal and external, and see what a different shift in stance that can be.
And tomorrow we continue with the next sentence in the refrain, which has to do with impermanence, with arising and passing away, which is quite profound also.
So thank you all. Thank you for your kind attention, for your dedication, for your practice. May you be well, and may you practice internally and externally.
See you, or feel you tomorrow. Be well.
