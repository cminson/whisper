Good  morning.  Today  I’m going  to give the third 
dharmette  on the wisdom  faculty.  The form of wisdom  
to be discussed  today  is what  I call “decisive  wisdom.” 
This is wisdom  that can make  a decision.  It can clearly  
choose  what  to say, what  to do, and how to be with our 
inner  life.  
 
As we sit, practice,  and become  wise,  one of the first 
things  that really  helps  this process  is to develop  
greater  clarity  in the mind  – the ability  to be mindful  and 
clearly  aware  of what’s going  on. The clearer  we can 
be, the less we’re projecting  our opinions,  fears,  
associations,  and confusion  onto the world.  We see 
more  clearly  what’s happening.  As we see more  clearly,  
we differentiate  the different  details  of what’s happening  2 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg in the moment.  That’s the distinguishing  wisdom  I talked  
about  yesterday.   
 
As we see start making  more  distinctions  and seeing  
differences,  we start seeing  what’s skillful  and not 
skillful  or what’s helpful  and not helpful  in the moment . 
Moreover , we also start seeing  or having  a sense  of the 
consequences  of our actions,  which  we’ve started  
registering.  Because  we’re clear  and are tracking  what’s 
going  on, we notice  that when  we say X, the 
communication  lines with other  people  tend to close  
down , or they become  more  distant  from us. But if we 
say Y, the communication  lines are open,  and people  
can come  forward  to participate  more.   
 
After  a while,  we see the differences  in how we speak.  
Certain  ways  have  one result,  and others  have  different  
results.  Seeing  that clearly  allows  us to then see the 
choice:  “Do I say X next time, or do I say Y?” Decisive  
wisdom  is the wisdom  that knows  what  the wise thing  is 
to do based  on what’s important  to us.  
 
As we settle  and get clearer,  we also become  in touch  
with our values , and our capacity  for freedom  – the 
capacity  to live in an open,  non-contracted,  non-
compulsive  way. We see the consequences  of how we 
speak  – the impact  this has both on others  and on 
ourselves.

  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg It’s the same  thing  with our actions.  We start seeing  the 
consequences  of what  we do in the world.  As those  
consequences  register  in our clarity  and care,  we see 
that there’s a choice.  We can do something  that creates  
health  or ‘dis-ease’ in social  relationships.  We can do 
things  that support  and nouris h our inner  life, or things  
that actually  keep  us more  agitated,  contracted,  and 
caught.   
 
As we see these  things  more,  it isn’t that we’re 
supposed  to just allow  or accept  it. There  is a time and 
place  for the decisive  wisdom  that make s a decision.  
The image  for this in Mahayana  Buddhism  is that of the 
sword  of wisdom.  Sometimes  you want  to use that 
sword.  Sometimes,  one of the ways  to use it is with a 
very clear,  decisive,  “No, not that.” Hopefully , we have  
the wisdom  to know  when  this is actually  supportive,  
useful,  and nourishing.   
 
This is sometimes  clearest  in our meditation  practice.  
That’s why meditation  is such  a great  laboratory  to start 
seeing  and learning  about  all these  forms  of wisdom.  
You’re sitting  in meditation,  and you realize you’ve had 
the same  thought  500 times , and nothing  has really  
changed,  except  that the thought  is rather  mean -spirited  
towards  you. After  a while  you realize,  “Wait a minute.  
This thought  doesn’t have  a good  impact  on me. It’s not 
healthy,  and there’s not much  point  in repeat ing this 4 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg same  thought  501 times.  Nothing  changes . It’s just 
going  around  and around.” 
 
At some  point,  the sword  of wisdom  come s along,  and 
you say very clearly,  “No, enough.” For some  of us, at 
times , it’s like parts  of the thinkin g mind  are like a little 
three -year-old. Sometimes  three -year-olds need  to 
have  a very decisive  ‘No.’ It was hard for me to come  to 
this with my children.  But once  I learned  the right way to 
say, “No, you can’t do that,” they became  happier.  It 
was like they were  pushing  the edges  to find out where  
they were  safe.  When  they heard,  “No more  of that,” 
then they immediately  relaxed  and became  happy.  It 
was quite  impressive.  I think  sometimes  our mind  needs  
to hear that clear,  “No. No more  of that kind of thinking.” 
Probably  it will come  back.  But then we use the sword  
of ‘No’ again.  
 
Wisdom  can be very supportive.  Sometimes  we say a 
definitive , “Yes. This is what  I want  to do. This is what  I 
want  to make  my life about  – these  values,  this 
freedom,  this possibility  of not being  caught  in 
contractions  or compulsion.  This is important. ” 
 
For some  peop le, Dharma  practice  is the most  
important  thing  in their life. They  say, “Yes” to it at the 
cost of everything  else,  because  this is clearly  what’s 
most  important.  It’s like artists  who decide  that art is the 
most  important  thing,  and they’ll be starving  artists.  5 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg There  are Dharma  practitioners  who become , perhaps  
not starving  Dharma  practitioners,  but they really  say, 
‘Yes’ to something.  It’s decisive  wisdom.  
 
There  is decisive  wisdom  in how we speak:  “Yes, I want  
to appreciate  this person.” I want  to say, “Oh boy, 
you’ve worked  hard,  and I really  appreciate  what  you’ve 
done.” There  is a ‘Yes’ to that, as opposed  to perhaps  
not saying  anything.   
 
This idea of decisive  wisdom  comes  clearly  into play 
around  what  in Buddhism  is called  the Four Noble 
Truths.  This is one of the key wisdom  teachings  of 
Buddhism.  It involves  seeing  distinctions :  
• seeing  very clearly  what  in Buddhism  is called  
‘suffering ’  
• seeing  what  causes  and conditions  contribute  to 
suffering  
• sometimes  intuitively  at first, and then more  and 
more  through  experience , that there  is the amazing  
possibility  of having  suffering  end. Sometimes  it’s 
just in small  pieces.  But there  is a sense  of, “Wow,  
I’m not locked  in. It’s not required  to suffer  so much.  
There  is another  way.”  
• clearly  seeing  the practices  that support  the 
possibility  of ending  suffering .  
 6 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg To simplify  these  Four Noble  Truths,  there  is the 
statement , “If there’s craving,  you will suffer.” Craving  
itself is a form of suffering.  The word  ‘craving’ has to do 
with compulsions,  clinging,  and resistance , where  we 
don’t really  have  freedom  anymore  to choose.  There’s 
an impulse  or compulsion  to speak,  to act, or to think  
certain  things.  We feel like we’re being  carried  along.  
We’re contracted  and caught  in a way that caus es a lot 
of suffering.  
 
The suffering  we’re talking  about  here is not all the 
ways  in which  the heart  gets broken , or that we can 
sometimes  feel sorrow,  sadness,  or even  hurt. Here,  
we’re talking  about  the kind of suffering  that arises  
because  of this compulsivity.   
 
As we start seeing  this operating  more,  we see the 
craving,  resistance,  pushing  away,  hostility,  greed,  and 
conceit  that we’re holding  on to. If we’re clinging  to 
anything  at all, it’s going  to hurt us. We’re going  to 
suffer.   
 
Distinguishing  wisdom  sees  all that. Decisive  wisdom  
says,  “No more.  I’m going  to live in a different  way. This 
is not for me. I am going  to disavow  the investment,  
commitment , or authority  I’ve grante d to my craving  and 
clinging.  This is not how I want  to live my life.” It can be 
a very clear  decision.   
 7 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg It doesn’t mean  that we stop by any means.  But it’s a 
world  of difference  to make  that shift.  It’s similar  to the 
shift when  we go for refuge.  “Yes, it’s possible  to live in 
a way that is not caught  in the grip of attachments  and 
fear, where  we’re holding  onto something. ” While  it’s 
not easy  to let go of craving,  as we start seeing  the 
choice  that exists , we can say, “Ah, there  it is. I don’t 
have  to stay with my attachment  to drive  fast and to rev 
the cars waiting  at a red stop sign.” Those  are small  
kinds  of craving.   
 
Learn  to let go. Learn  to let go. Learn  to let go. 
 
Or learn  to recognize  the freedom.  Learn  to recognize  
the peace  that’s available  in a very wise way. We’re 
talking  about  wisdom  here.  Wisdom  is always  healthy.  
That’s the caveat.  Wisdom  is always  nourishing.   
 
Then  we find a way. Decisive  wisdom  says,  ‘No.’ Maybe  
with all the love and care that we’re capable  of, it says,  
“I’m not going  to crave.  I’m not going  to do that. I’m no 
longer  going  to stand  behind  it or feed it.” Or decisive  
wisdom  says,  ‘Yes’ to being  free, and ‘Yes’ to touching  
into the place  inside where  we care and love the world.   
 
So, in decisive  wisdom,  we’re building  on distinguishing  
wisdom.  There  are check s and balance s. We’re using  
mindfulness  to see, experience,  and understand  when  
our decisive  wisdom  is not really  supportive  or when  8 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg ‘No’ is not really  the right way. It may be a little hostile  
perhaps.  Or ‘Yes’ can be too accepting,  complacent , or 
going  along  with the statu s quo in a way that’s not 
healthy.   
 
Hopefully , these  two work  together  – distinguishing  
wisdom  that sees  clearly , and decisive  wisdom  that 
helps  us find our way on the path to freedom.  May 
these  two forms  of wisdom  support  and guide  you.  
 
I look forward  to continuing  this sequence  about  
wisdom  tomorrow.
