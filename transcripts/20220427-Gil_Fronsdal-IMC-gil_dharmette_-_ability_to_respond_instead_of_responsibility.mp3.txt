So nice to see you all.
And, uh...
So, and, um...
I'm sitting here and not so sure what to say.
But I was, uh...
reminded earlier in my mind of the difference between the responsibility
and what happens if you separate out those two words,
their compound word with response and ability.
And what happens if you don't...
we change the English language
and make one word into two words,
and the words become response, ability.
We have the ability to respond.
And at least in my mind, it's a very different connotation
than having it as a single word, responsibility.
When I hear that word, I hear connotations of obligation,
even duty that we have to have.
And, um, but the ability to respond,
that makes me happy.
Oh, I have the ability to respond.
Rather than it being responsibility,
to me it seems a little bit of a burden.
And what qualifies me for saying this is that
responsibility has been my Achilles heel.
And so I feel like I'm responsible for that person's happiness.
I'm responsible for helping someone.
I'm responsible. It's all up to me.
But when I hear that I have the ability to respond,
something in my heart just lights up.
Oh, fantastic. I feel so lucky.
Wow. Rather than being a burden, it's like,
oh, I can look forward to it.
The ability to respond.
And I think the reason for that is that
I've learned that acting,
action, behavior, what we do,
can be done from a wonderful place inside.
It can be kind of an expression of freedom.
It can be an expression of delight.
It can be an expression of love.
It can be an expression of play in this world.
And so response.
It's just to me, I have a very positive connotation to it.
So I feel lucky.
I have the ability to do something here.
And so learning about this ability to respond,
which has a little gap to it,
little pause,
before the automatic sense of burden sets in.
It's like a little bit, I have a choice here.
I have the ability to respond. I don't have to respond.
I have the ability, the choice to do something.
And what's the wise thing to do?
What's the useful thing to do here?
What's useful for me?
What's useful for others?
What's useful for the situation?
What's helpful?
And then part of this delight in the ability to respond,
is also knowing that I have,
and having the confidence that I don't have to respond.
That I don't have to be the one who's responsible.
I can be the one who is ready to support,
or to help, or to be involved.
But I don't have to.
And that's maybe a little bit frightening to hear.
Because, you know, the world will fall apart if I don't.
I have, of course, I have to.
But I wonder how often that's true.
I wonder if there's...
Say there's someone who has...
Let's say that they...
be by MC now, and they discover that,
lo and behold, they have two flat tires in their car.
So you walk by, and you say,
oh, the person I was just meditating with,
they have this challenge.
They have two flat tires.
I mean, this requires a higher level of attention.
And if with one flat tire,
you know I'm a good Buddhist,
so I'm responsible to help here.
You know, I'm supposed to be infinitely compassionate
to help living beings.
So I've got to kind of bear down now,
and buckle up, and I'm going to have to stay here
and help them and do something.
And I really don't want to.
You know, this is like...
I have important things to do,
and this is kind of irritating that they
manage to get two flat tires
when I have other important things to do,
but I know I'm supposed to help.
And I have a responsibility to help.
And you know,
all the other people leaving IMC
they're seeing that,
you know, I'm here,
and I'm obligated to help as a good Buddhist,
and my Buddhist friends are going to think,
battle with me if I don't do it,
then okay, I'm going to help this person.
So you do.
And the person who successfully helped the person,
the person who goes off.
The next day,
maybe the same thing happens here at IMC.
Someone has two flat tires.
Someone leaves IMC
and says, oh,
look at that.
That person has two flat tires,
and
that's a bit challenging to figure out what to do.
And
I do have the ability to respond.
I have some skills
around calling toe chucks,
or calling mechanics,
or changing tires,
and
I have
other things to do today,
but I have this ability to respond here.
It's possible.
Let me check in with myself
and see what do I most want to do.
What would serve me?
What would serve them? What works here?
Oh, you know,
this makes me, it would make me happy
to support this person.
I think I can figure out the other things
and shift things around.
And
this just seems like the nice thing to do.
Maybe I
don't feel like I have to help the person.
It would be nice to
accompany this person and spend time with this person
and help support the person
and do this together.
And we'll probably have a good time figuring it out.
And you're just a success.
That scenario is just as successful
in taking care of the issue
as the day before.
But which of the two
do you think most nourishes
most inspires
the person who is getting the help?
So I tried to make this
as dramatic as I could.
Maybe you can do a better job
to the difference.
But
the how we
engage in the world
puts more than
just the physical things we do
into play.
The attitudes we carry with us
make a huge difference.
And if we do things out of obligation
it has one kind of
result.
If we do it out of delighted generosity
or delighted accompanying someone
or
just out of love or something
you know
even if we have to kind of shift things around
or give something up or sacrifice something
but we're not
burdened by it
it's not a challenge, we're not upset
it's just like lightly given
easily given
then we're bringing
into the world something very different.
And then what I'd like to propose is
what we bring into the world
in terms of our attitudes
makes a huge difference.
Now if you're the kind of person
who thinks that Gil doesn't know
what he's talking about
responsibility is inherent
to this world
of course we're obligated
a little bit like
what I said Sunday morning
if that's the case
then I'd like to suggest you take on
the obligation
to do things with a good attitude
make it your responsibility
to find how to
respond
in a way that
you're doing the same behavior
as helping someone maybe
but you're conveying
an attitude
which is nourishment, which is inspiring
which puts into the world
something very different
than if you do things
out of a sense of
burdensome duty and obligation.
So the same thing
with Buddhist practice
some people feel like
well I have to be a good Buddhist
I'm obligated to do this and that in practice
I don't think
Buddhist practice thrives
under this kind of
responsibility, the weight of it
it thrives
under
picking up, engaging
our ability
to do the practice
we have the ability to practice
not the responsibility
to practice
and so
if we have that ability
how do you want to enact
that ability?
what attitude
do you want that fuels and supports
that ability?
what attitude do you have
that makes that whatever you do
feel wonderful
for you and for other people
and for a practitioner
it's also how does
the attitude in which we do something
how is it freeing?
how does it bring
for the best in our hearts?
how does it help our hearts
sing?
how does it help us see ourselves more deeply?
how does it create the conditions
that practice
the tendency to
the orientation of our being mindful
and compassionate
is something that just seems like
of course
this is a delight to do
rather than
something that is hard work
so
the ability to respond
as opposed to
the responsibility
so I hope that these words have given you
something to think about
a little bit gently
given you a little bit of a challenge
but you have no responsibility
to pick up that challenge
but maybe you'd like to
pick up that ability
respond to the challenge
in a nice way
so
thank you for this
so now
so now I have a...
