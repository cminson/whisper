 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Those of you here in person, welcome. Very happy to see you and be together with others. It's been a shortage of that and for a long time being together. And for those of you watching from home or from wherever you are on YouTube, welcome. Nice to have you here and I think it's very supportive for everyone to have this shared meditation time. One of the interesting approaches to meditation is to consider that it's not only about you yourself, that we don't navigate or engage in meditation. We don't have to engage with it as only as a self-help or as a self-improvement or as something that relates to me and my experience and my way of doing things. The mindfulness meditation, Buddhist meditation, is some of that for sure. But it's also an opportunity to let the usual self-concerns fall away and trust some other process that can happen, some healthy dharmic process, healthy process that can happen when we almost get out of the way for the meditation, get out of the way for the practice to practice us. And the reference point for the practice is not me, myself and mine, but rather the reference point for the practice is there could be a variety of things, but the inner movement towards freedom, the inner movement towards wholeness, or it could be as simple as the discovery of what wants to happen. If we allow ourselves to be present and attentive and clear, what's to happen? What merges out of us when we get out of the way? And to have some deep respect for this process which is maybe not personal or to use a fancy word, maybe transpersonal or something like that. So here we are. So to assume an upright meditation posture and to gently close your eyes. And right from the beginning if you assume that there's something here in your experience that you will allow to be, that's not being measured by me, myself and mine, that's not being fixed or not being assigned or appropriated by me, myself and mine. What's here? What do you experience? What do you feel here in your body in this moment? Maybe with that as a reference point to take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Breathing in, relaxing as you exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And one of the values of relaxing at the beginning of meditation is the support for this getting out of our own way. Chances are a lot of tension in our body is a manifestation of me, myself and mine. Relaxing the muscles of the face, softening the face. Releasing the shoulders. And as you relax your belly to be open to experience what rises. And then within the body as part of your bodily experience, becoming aware of breathing. And to whatever degree is possible, be aware of breathing. And find something that's impersonal, not personal. Getting out of the way, just allowing the body to breathe. With the experience of breathing arising in awareness, one breath at a time. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale.

Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. And as we come to the end of this sitting, when we meditate, there's always people meditating somewhere in the world. There's those of us meditating here in this room, those of us meditating on YouTube. But around the world there are people, thousands, tens of thousands of people who are probably meditating at any given time. And what if flowing from those people is a higher level of respect and care, kindness out into the world? What a great impact I would have if we all share in this wider caring for each other. And may it be that the benefits that we've received from meditation, known and unknown benefits, may it spread from us or be used by us to spread goodness into this world. May we bring friendliness and care, respect, kindness, maybe a kind of gentleness, contributing to the possibility of all people being happy, safe, peaceful, free. May the power of our meditation contribute to the possibility that all beings are happy. All beings are safe. All beings are peaceful. And all beings are free. May the power of our meditation contribute to the possibility of all beings be free.
