 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome. Good to be with you. So let's settle in. So in any given moment, a million things will be right, and a million will be wrong. And we afford ourselves the luxury of not needing to sort all of that out. Being supported by the million things that are right, and being softened by the million things that are wrong. So let's settle in. Although it feels maybe unsafe or irresponsible or something to momentarily put down the world, it's actually important for our heart. Rather than living in the realm of hope and fear, we put all of our hope into this moment and rest. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We don't always associate letting go with joy. Maybe we associate it with renunciation or with how it can feel to unclench the closed fist of clinging, the movement from clenched to unclenched often has a flavor, a flavor of grieving. And that's all real. But there's also this deep link between letting go and being reborn into a world of experience where so much joy is possible. The heart that lets go is carefree and at ease and totally not territorial. The heart that lets go steps out of comparing mind, becomes so porous to the joy of others. We call it mudita, sympathetic joy, joy in the face of the others, happiness, good fortune. And so as we said, we sense in what needs to be put down. What can be surrendered, released let go. Such that I become more porous to the joy of others. The delight of others, it becomes utterly unthreatening. We put down our egoic clinging and our reborn into a world of experience where so much joy is possible. Anything might bring it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So calling to mind someone who's well-being, good fortune, is totally unintimidating for you, something unthreatening. Does not evoke comparison. Just bringing their face to mind. And of course there's dukkha in their life. It's a given. But there's much goodness, happiness, welfare. And so we attune to that. We make our heart porous, and we just receive their joy. Thank you. And we are finally wishing our own mind. May your happiness continue. May it increase. Thank you. And may your faith, your faith in the wake of this joy, happiness, their good fortune, the particularities of their smile. And may it be that you can imagine what their inner life, what their body must feel like amidst their joy, success. May it increase. Thank you. Thank you. And we just abide, suspended in some delight. And there is no self. There's just a world. And the happiness of others is known precisely as our own. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And these last few minutes, the wishes that all the happiness in the world increase. May all beings revel. May happiness increase. And we even might extend it out beyond the beings born now, to the future, maybe even the distant future. May all the potential happiness contained in this moment, may all that goodness, all that richness, may that increase, may it be born and increase. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
