Dharmette : Letting Go of Concepts  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

What’s on my mind to talk about today is high theology. 
For people contending with  theistic religions one of the 
big issues is God. God is in the middle of it all : “Should I 
believe in God? Is there a God , or is there not a God ?” 
But since Buddhism is a nontheistic religion, f or 
Buddhis ts the comparable question that people might 
struggle with is : “Is there  a self , or is there not a self ? 
Should I believe in self? ” So people in Buddhism get 
caught up in this whole ‘self’ thing. In a certain way , God 
in theistic religions and self in Buddhism are both 
touching on very similar territory in the mind and the 
heart.  
 
Of course  I know that, especially in theology , there are 
many ideas of what God is. There are so many that I 
think there’s  free license to define God the way you 
want , or to be creative about it . I’m fond of some of the 
Christian mystics who say that as you get closer to God 
all ideas of what God is disappear . They have to fall 
away  because  any idea you have of what God is gets in 
the way of th e encounter  with God . The point is not 
whether to believe in God or not, but to meet God and 
know God.  The idea that you have to believe in God is rather unfortunate . It makes for spiritually poor people , 
because it’s the knowing that’s important. And how do 
you know? Certain  mystics would say that it’s when all 
ideas  about  what God is fall away. And then  there’s 
what’s left.  
 
In Buddhism there’s all this discussion about self  and 
there’s a  big emphasis on not -self. “So what’s all this 
about not-self? A m I supposed to believe in not-self? 
This not-self doesn’t make any sense . Of course there 
is a self , but they say that there’s  no self. What are we 
supposed to do with this thing? ”  
 
If you really go into the question of self in a deep way 
and look at where the idea and  understanding of self 
arises and h ow it comes into existence for us , then the 
practice goes really deep. It becomes quickly pretty 
clear that any idea of self or not-self needs to fall away. 
Also any  concept of self  or not-self gets in the way of a 
deeper exploration with life, a deeper co ntact with 
ourselves – and freedom . So in Buddhist practice , all 
the ideas  of self and not-self have to completely fall 
away as we go deep into freedom.  
 
So here we have two different traditions. One in a sense 
points to God  – something external at least in many 
people’s minds . Another  tradition points  to something 
internal: s elf or not-self. But in both traditions, the 
concepts and ideas of those  have to f all away. Also in both traditions, there i s a falling away of any sense of 
inner and outer, inside and outside, and external and 
internal  – because these are  just concepts and ideas. 
To bri ng the mind to a state of peace,  freedom,  
luminosity or openness as  fully as possible requires a 
falling away of concepts and ideas.  
 
It’s my assumption that , whether it’s theistic concepts or 
Buddhist concepts , once  these concepts thoroughly fall 
away, what’s left is probably very similar. There is a big 
overlap between  them. I like to consider that what’s left 
is presence or awareness , to use a slightly more precise 
technical word. It’s not anybody’s awareness  or 
presence . It’s not my presenc e or God’s presence. It’s 
just presence . It’s not God’s and my presence , or God 
and self merged. Religious people can get very creative 
and poetic in how they describe these things. “Self and 
objects fall away . Self  and God collapse and become 
one. Everyth ing is God or everything is self. ”  
 
People have words they put on top of it , but it’s not the 
words that are important. It’s the freedom  and peace  
that comes when these concepts fall away  and we 
experience our life  and reality without the overlay or 
filter of all these concepts and ideas. Then  we meet 
something really profound. That meeting is not 
something exactly personal because the i dea of person 
has fallen away , and e ven impersonal has fallen away . 
But it can show or teach us that there is a bigger context that holds our life. There’s a flow and pattern of life that 
is bigger than any concept or idea we have of ‘me.’ So 
many of us get caught up in “I’m responsible and it’s all 
up to me ,” or we identify ourselves  so strongly  with all 
our problems. It helps so much to have a more open , 
spacious understanding of how life unfolds when it  is 
not all knotted up around  “It’s my life, my process , and 
me.”  
 
There ’s an advantage of certain theistic ideas when 
God is represented  as all loving and supportive , 
especially when it’s anthropomorphized . It’s easier for 
people to relate to and feel supported  by, and you can 
just relax into it in a nice way. The disadvantage of God 
is that sometimes people abdicate all responsibility . 
They  don’t do the inner work to understand themselves 
and what’s going on here in some deep  way, and take 
responsibility for what ’s here. Buddhists sometimes take 
too much responsibility for what’s here because of the 
concept of  self and not-self. But is presence and 
awareness personal? Is it mine or someone  else’s?  
 
The Buddha is very caref ul not to add any descriptions 
or concepts on top of the experience of freedom. This is 
not to say that the ex perience of freedom or the 
awareness or presence that’s there or not there makes 
you one with or independent from the universe, merged  
with the God head or with the source of life, or that 
you’ve transcended life. These are all  ideas that people add on top of it. Over and over again you see the 
Buddha seem to say, “Let’s not go there, let’s not add 
anything on top.”  
 
There are mystical traditions in Christian or Western 
religions and in Buddhism  as well. Not that it’s a 
mystery exactly , but it has to  do with this inner 
experience , emptying of the mind of concepts and 
encountering something that is freer and freer of 
concepts and ideas. Buddhism is very good I think at 
really challenging us to be very impeccable and  clear 
about no ticing where we still are applying concepts and 
ideas on top of our experience. So the concepts  – even 
very subtle ones that keep us held in from freedom – 
just fall away. So just let them fall. It’s okay. In that 
freedom, that falling away, t here is something that’s 
profound, beautiful, peaceful and reliable . But as soon 
as you try to explain what that is , then you begin  to lose 
it. 
 
For those of you who are theists I hope I haven’t 
offended you with some of these ideas. But I think t he 
whole concep t of believing in God is irrelevant. It’s much 
more interesting to meet God. And if  you meet God, the 
God and you disappear. Isn’t that good? [ laughter]  
 
For those of you who don’t care for this level of 
discourse at IMC , you can just leave it here.  Thank you.
