It’s my custom to give a little bit of instruction at this 
point in the da y to help you with the practice:  the next 
walk and the next sit. I have something today to say 
that’s going to be very simple – maybe  too simple.  
 
The primary function of mindfulness is to help you 
notice what ’s happening in the present moment. There 
are three general things that might happen in the 
present moment.  Only three things are possible: 
some thing that is pleasant; s omething that ’s unpleasant 
for you ; or something that is neit her pleasant or 
unpleasant. Thes e are the only three options possible , 
so it makes it easy.   
 
The simpl e instruction today is if something happens 
that’s unpleasant, be relaxed about it.  If something 
happens that ’s pleasant, be relaxed about it.  And if 
something happens that ’s neither pleasant or 
unpleasant, be relaxed about it , and keep practicing . 
That’s it. Notice what ’s happening , and be relaxed.  
 
Being relaxed doesn ’t mean continue to indulge or be 
preoccupied or caught up in what ’s happening. Remember the first thing is to notice. And the noticing is 
to notice clearly enough that part of you at least s teps 
away from being entangled with whatever is going on. 
And then when you ’re not entangled, be relaxed with 
how it is.  
 
I hope it ’s a relaxing morning.
