 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Yeah, so the assumptions, the assumptions we make, some of them are obvious, like that our computer is going to behave like we expect it to, or the internet's going to behave, or expect it to. But what other assumptions do we make? Maybe we have assumptions about what we are capable of. Maybe we have assumptions about what brings us happiness. Maybe we have assumptions about what our life can be about. Some of these big questions, and it might be the bravest thing we can do. It might be that what takes the most courage is to question our assumptions about what we are capable of, what brings us happiness. How to live a life suffused with kindness, what our life can be about. It might be that questioning our assumptions about ourselves, about our ideas about life, and loving kindness in general. What does it mean to be kind? What does it mean to be loving? Maybe if we don't even like those words, metta. What does it mean to show up in this world with a warm heart? It's often not until our assumptions don't get met that we discover that we have them, like I did today. I was assuming my computer was going to behave in a particular way. And then I didn't, and then I realized, oh yeah, I was just assuming it was going to. Sometimes it's when we practice with a meditation practice, we allow the mind to settle and some of the busyness, some of the occupations that we have, allow them to be quiet. That we can just have this gentle inquiry. What are our assumptions about what we are capable of? Maybe we can do more. Maybe our hearts, our minds can be more open than we realize. Maybe we can have some more kindness, some more compassion, some more care. Or maybe we have our assumptions about that are accurate. Maybe we have assumptions about what brings us happiness aren't quite right. Certainly we get told in so many different ways, just acquire this. And in some ways I'm peddling that too. Like Sambo, acquire some more loving kindness, cultivate loving kindness and your life will unfold in a different way. But just an invitation to question our assumptions. With the recognition that maybe that's the bravest thing we can do. Maybe that's one of the difficult things to do. These assumptions. About who we are, how we are, and what does it mean to live a life suffused with kindness? To have a life with ease and peace, joy? Sometimes it is in the midst of more practicing meditation and sometimes in the midst of loving kindness which allows not only a selling of the mind but an opening of the heart. And I'm saying the bravest thing we can do, maybe it doesn't require so much bravery if we're steeped in some warm heartedness. If we're steeped in some care for ourselves, if we're steeped in care for others. So with that as an introduction, let's do some loving kindness practice. So taking another upright posture. And just feeling into the body. Is there a way in which the body can be a support? Like feeling embodied, feeling grounded, feeling connected. Feeling the contact of the chair or cushion or couch, bed, floor. Wherever we're practicing, whatever is supporting us. Feeling that support, being connected. Be doing a little bit of a body scan. Tooking in with the face, the eyes and the jaw. Common places where we hold tension. The shoulders, another place where we hold tension. And what about the chest? Is there a way in which it can be just a little bit more open? Maybe the movement is so small that nobody would notice if they were to look at you. Just to have the chest open, heart center. And the belly, can there be some softness in the belly? And the hands. Noticing what the hands are touching, feeling the temperature, cool or warm. Noticing the texture, rough or smooth or maybe somewhere in between. And letting the attention rest on the sensations of breathing. Can we arrive here now? And when the mind wanders, as it swamped to do, with warm heartedness, with kindness, we just begin again. With the sensations of breathing. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Bring to mind a lovable being. Someone for whom it's easy to feel warm hearted, to feel care. Someone you know. Maybe an imaginary person. Maybe somebody who has inspired you but you don't actually know them. You don't have a relationship with them. Connecting with this lovable being. Perhaps bringing them to mind. And to support our cultivating loving kindness. You can repeat these phrases as a way to give the heart and the mind something to do. So that we don't just drift away. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Can we allow ourselves to sink into this warm wishing, well-wishing for the lovable being in an uncomplicated way. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Can we give ourselves over to this well-wishing? Maybe there are different words in the phrases for you. Words that are more resonant or more meaningful. Invitation to keep it simple. And it's perfectly fine if right now you're not quite feeling anything in particular. Perfectly fine. Can we do this practice anyway? Connecting again with the lovable being, allowing ourselves to, in a simple way, have some well-wishes. And then to expand to a good friend. Have well-wishes for a good friend. Or a family member, somebody you do have a relationship with and you care about. Bringing them to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Allowing yourself to connect with this friend or family member that you care about. Sending some well-wishes, some good well, some warmth. Just because. I wish you safety. Happiness. Health. And ease. And then to extend our loving kindness. To include ourselves. It's important, loving kindness for ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. Can we bring this warm-heartedness to ourselves? And from this place of care and warmth, can we question our assumptions? What brings us happiness? And question our assumptions of what we are capable of. I suspect that we are all capable of more than we realize. More than we assume. More than we believe. May we be happy. May I live with ease. May we be happy. And part of being capable of perhaps more than we realize, is that we are all capable of being capable of being capable of being capable of being capable of feeling and experiencing while ovation. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. And then to end this meditation. Feel our feet on the ground and the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. This idea of questioning our assumptions, what we're capable of, what makes us happy, what our life can be about. How does one do this? I think we just sometimes ask ourselves, is this true? Is that true? When we find ourselves having an idea, oh, I can't do that. Oh, this is too hard. Oh, other people can, but I can't. If we ever feel ourselves having this kind of inner dialogue, we can just say, is that true? Otherwise it's hard to know exactly what our assumptions are. So maybe we might catch our assumptions being shown in some unguarded moments when we are, or hear ourselves saying, oh, I can't do that. Other people can. That's too much for me. And to do this with some warmheartedness and some care. So it can be helpful to talk with others about these types of ideas, how to practice with them, what do they mean, how they're relevant for you. So I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms, maybe three or four of you. But sometimes people leave at the last moment, so then there's sometimes two of you in a room. So my intention is for there to be three or four. And you can talk about either how that meditation was or this idea about questioning assumptions. And I was saying it's the bravest thing we can do, perhaps. Maybe why is it brave? Is it the bravest thing? How do we question our assumptions? What does this have to do with love and kindness? So a number of things I'd like to explore in these groups. So it's helpful just to say one thing, not all your ideas about a topic, and then I'll let it go to the next person and they say one thing, and it goes to the next person and they say one thing, and then it goes back around. So that the introverts have a chance to speak and just to make it a little bit easier. So in this way, it's a contrived conversation. It's not the usual way in which we talk, but it's a way that allows us to take care of each other, allowing everybody to have the space to speak. So we'll meet for about 12 minutes. And here we go. So welcome back. Welcome back. Does anybody have a comment or a question or something they'd like to share? Yes, Kathleen. Okay, so as usual, I have an intellectual question. It's just categorically. Does this fit into right mindfulness, right effort, right speech, or all of them? I would say so. And maybe even right intention also. So, yeah, we could go on. Even right meta. Right meta. Nice. Thank you, Kathleen. Thank you. Those of you who don't know, that's part of the Eightfold Path. That's part of the path towards awakening. I'm going to use this word right, but we could also use the word wise. Anybody else have a comment or a question? Yes, I think. Relating to Kathleen's question, I'd say right view because that's what kept coming up for me was about distorted thinking like expecting things to continue that are not going to continue or to be permanent. They're not going to be permanent, but it's really kind of in my face right now that I'm probably going to have to let go of some things that I didn't expect. So it's like you said, when it gets violated, that's when you see, oh, my thinking was all wrong. Thank you, Eileen. You're absolutely right. Right view. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll put that in there. Okay. So here we are at the top of the hour and Trudy, I have a message for you. So maybe if you could just hang back a little bit. But maybe for the rest of us, we can maybe before I say that we're all going to say goodbye. I just want to kind of just for myself to give you all a deep bow, how much I appreciate our practicing together and finding our way and kind of exploring these things together. And when I showed up late because my assumed my computer was working fine and that it doesn't, but you guys just hung out in the waiting room. So thank you. Thank you. So now if we can, if you would like to unmute yourself, we can say goodbye in a kind of unruly way. So bye bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye. All of you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Yeah. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
