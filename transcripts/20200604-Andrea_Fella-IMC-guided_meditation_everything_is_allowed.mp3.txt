However you are, can that be okay? The exploration of opening to with mindfulness, just what's here, is an act that seems like we're not doing much in this, just receiving what's here and allowing it. 
But that takes some commitment and some care, care for ourselves, care for our experience. 
This act, a simple act of allowing what is here is a very kind thing to do for ourselves. 
Allowing ourselves to be just as we are. 
How many of us would like for others to accept us just as we are? And how few of us do it for ourselves? So this act of allowing is an act of love. 
And that act of love has a very powerful capacity because in opening to what is here now it paves the way for transformation. 
So loving, attention, loving awareness can change our relationship to ourselves and to the world. 
So this can be very simple, just relaxing, receiving what's here. 
And that receptivity may be specific to some particular experience such as the breath, receiving the breath, not trying to dive into it or notice a lot about it, but just how does it want to show up? How is it showing up? So it may be that receiving, receiving some area of experience, the breath, body sensations, the experience of healing. 
And perhaps, for some of you, it is simply receiving the next most obvious thing. 
What is obvious in this moment? Just simple recognition. 
This is how I am right now. 
And that's allowed. 
That's okay. 
This is the body sensation that's obvious or this is the sound or the thought or the emotion that is most predominant, most obvious in this experience right now. 
And that's allowed. 
It's okay. 
And remembering this allowing is an expression of love and can be felt that way also. 
It's act of meditation and expression of loving ourselves. 
And through extension also, we can open to love the world. 
Relax, receive whatever is your experience. 
And allow. 
If resistance happens to be what's up, that doesn't have to go away in order for allowing to be there. 
We can allow resistance to be what is here. 
Nothing is outside of what is allowed in our mindfulness practice. 
And we can allow resistance to be what is here. 
And we can allow resistance to be what is here.
