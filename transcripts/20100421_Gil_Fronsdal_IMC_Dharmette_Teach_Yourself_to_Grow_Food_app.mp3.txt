Practice Notes: Teach Yourself to Grow 
Food

There is a say ing, that goes something like, “It’s more 
useful in the long term  to teach someone to grow their 
own food than it is to  feed them. ” If they ’re hungry, of 
course , you should feed them. B ut if you feed them, 
and they don ’t know how to grow their own food, then 
they’re going to be hungry again for the next meal and 
the next meal, and you’re going to have to keep 
feeding them.  But if you teach them a skill , then they 
can take care of themselves.  So this idea can also 
relate to the inner life, Buddhist practice, your 
practice . And  one of the interesting reflections is, how 
to translate that saying to oneself, or to one ’s persona l 
life.  
 
Is it more valuable to finish all the tasks you have to 
do, to get everything done on your to -do list? O r is it 
more valuable to learn how to do one task with some 
sense of ease? Being relaxed, or calm – or to do it 
without a sense of confl ict, without a lot of self -
centeredness, identity, a lot of ‘shoulds. ’ How can you 
do something and  be at ease about the outcome – to 
be at ease with what ’s there, as oppose d to just doing 
a lot of things?   
And, I think, that for the inner life, both for your o wn 
life and for others, learning how to be at ease  with the 
situations of our life, that ’s a skill that is applicable in 
many different situations. Le arning how to accomplish 
a task  may or may not be helpful elsewhere.  So, for 
example, if you have to go ho me and cook dinner, you 
could think that the purpose of cooking dinner is to get 
it cooked as quickly as possible – to have a 
successful dinner so that everyone ’s well fed and 
everyone thinks you ’re a great cook. And while you ’re 
cooking the dinner , you’re also thinking about all the 
other things that have to be done , and you want to get 
the cooking done as quickly as you can  so you can do 
something else. Maybe t hat’s one valuable way of 
living a life;  maybe you ’ll get a lot done. But with that 
kind of agen da, you ’re not learning for yourself, or 
conveying to other people, how to be at ease in this 
world of ours and how to feel some peace about the 
life we have.  
 
Perhaps in the bigger picture of things, it ’s actually 
more important  to learn how to cook that meal  where 
you’re really there just for the meal, and to be able to 
put aside all the long list of all you have to do – not 
doing it to get it over with as quickly as you can , but 
really doing it because that ’s what you ’re doing in the 
moment – to learn how to drop all the desires and 
shoulds and expectations and eg o that might be 
connected to it, and  just do it in a peaceful way. To be 
content, to be at peace , just for that. To learn that skill  with cooking dinner, which might be helpful in other 
situati ons in your life, but to also how to do it 
wholeheartedly , without any tension.  
 
So I think of this  not so much for your sake, but it 
might be really important for others that you learn this. 
For those of you who have children, it ’s possible that 
the most important thing you can do for them, is not to 
get the meal on the table . But in the bigger picture, the 
most important thing you can do for them is, somehow 
through osmosis, convey to them you r sense of being 
at ease  or at peace, while you ’re cooking the meal.  
Because if you ’re doing the meal frantically, 
frustratingly, anxious about the other things that have 
to be done , then there ’s something that gets conveyed 
in your atmosphere. And what you convey is not so 
helpful in the bigger picture. If you could convey to 
children that it ’s okay to be at ease, it ’s possible to be 
at ease with what ’s here, w hat’s needed, what ’s being 
done – it’s like teaching someone to farm rather than 
just feeding them.  
 
And, perhaps, it ’s the simple thing around cooking a 
meal. But what happens when your child breaks a 
bone? How do you take care of that? Is that the time 
to get frantic, anxious, upset, afraid? It ’s a fragile , 
vulnerable time  when a child breaks a bone. What 
gets conveyed in how we respon d to it? If we respond 
as if, “This is terrible; this shouldn ’t have happened; 
this is a disaster; this happened at school. Oh no, 
these people at school are not doing thei r job; they ’re not caring for my kid; I ’m going to call the p rincipal 
and be upset , and poor kid ” – there are all these 
unhealthy things that can be conveyed. But what 
about conveying, “I’m going to try to help you the best 
I can , and I ’m not worried about this. I ’m not anxious. 
I’m not angry. ” Just be at ease with it.  
 
Some of you heard the story of one of the i mportant 
osmotic teachings I received from my father , was 
when I was 14. My friend and I took the keys of his car 
to go for a ride, to drive, and we didn ’t make it very far. 
We only made it like a foot or two [laughs] because 
we didn ’t know what we were do ing. Because right 
next to where the car was there was a parked 
bulldozer . And we managed to get the car going , and 
it jerked and ran right into the bulldozer. The bulldozer 
was okay [laughs]. I felt pretty bad. Here we were 
doing something we weren ’t supp osed to do , and we 
didn’t have a driver ’s license or anything , and didn ’t 
have permission, going for a joy ride in my Dad ’s car , 
and we crash it. So I called him up at work and said, 
“Dad, this is what happened, ” and he said to me in a 
very relaxed way, “Oh, can the car still drive? ” And I 
said, “Oh yeah , the car still driv es but you can ’t open 
the right -hand door any more. ” And he said, “See what 
you can do about it. I ’ll be home this evening. ” And I 
never heard anything more about it, ever. And the fact 
that he held it so – of course it was unfortunate – but 
there was no anger; there was no shame;  he held it 
with this ease , without a sense of conflict. I think he 
could do it because I felt remorse that he could feel in my voice. I ’d confessed. I felt pretty  bad about what 
happened , so he didn ’t need to be angry with me. It 
was an unfortunate thing that happened. Does it help 
to be angry or frustrated or afraid? But rather , he held 
it with ease , and conveyed tak ing care of it the best 
you can – try to  fix it. 
 
So how do we learn how to live a responsible life, to 
meet life as it requires us to take care of it, and to be 
at ease with how things are, not to be anxious about 
it, or not to be in conflict with it? And that skill gets 
even more dramatic  when things do go wrong, when 
we fail. So, “How can we stay relaxed, at ease, when 
we make a mistake, when things go in a way we don ’t 
want them to go? ” Is there a fundamental skill, or 
capacity, that we can learn about – not getting 
activated with anxiety, or anger, or fear – or not getting 
activated by issues of self -identity, self -image? And in 
doing that , can we convey to ourselves, to our own 
heart, and to others perhaps, a way of going through 
our life with greater ease, even when things 
themselves are not easy t o take care of?  
 
I think  this is one of the tasks and challenges of 
Buddhist practice. It ’s not about what you do , but how 
you are as you do it. And if you can learn something 
about how, or you can be at peace with how things 
are, then hopefully  no matter where you go, you can 
carry that with you.  So, I hope that, when you come to 
Buddhist practice, we ’re not feeding you – we’re 
teaching you how to farm.
