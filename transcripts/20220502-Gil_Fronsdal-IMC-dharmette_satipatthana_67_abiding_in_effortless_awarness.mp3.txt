So thank you all for the comments I'm seeing and the ones that are still coming.
I'll read them all at the end when we stop here, so I appreciate looking at them then.
But for now I'd like to say a few words.
So we're coming to the end of this many weeks' teachings on Satipatana, the Satipatana Sutta,
which the title of which I like to translate is, The Ways of Establishing, The Four Ways of Establishing Awareness.
The emphasis of what we're trying to do here is not understand so much these areas of our life that's certainly part of it,
but we're also establishing awareness and then we're abiding in that awareness.
And that awareness involves a clarity, involves being able to remain in the present moment.
That ability to remain centered in the present moment is often associated with concentration, to be concentrated and focused here and now.
But often with concentration, for many people they assume that concentration is kind of a laser focus or a tightening of focus onto something.
And the way that I understand Samadhi here is that it's an undistractedness in the present moment where all our whole being starts getting gathered together
to be aware here and now without the distractions.
To do this well comes at the end of a long period of doing Satipatana practice.
And for some people they might get the hang of it quickly.
Some people it might take years and years.
You'll see in a moment it might take them seven years to develop it to some degree.
But one of the nice qualities that happens is as we get some sense of the naturalness of awareness or the effortless of awareness
or the way that we can practice letting go of the distractions from awareness but then abide in awareness.
Awareness is not something we do, it's something that we allow for, something that we stay in
and avoid. It's like staying in a current in a river and you're floating down the river.
And as I said this earlier, this recording might live differently from what I said.
So floating down the river and you can stay in the current but if it looks like you're going to veer off the current into an eddy or into the side of the river
then you make a small adjustment to come back and then the river carries you.
So the effort at some point becomes not an effort to be aware but the effort to avoid being distracted, being caught in something and then come back, be here, come here.
At some point there starts to be a recognition that in this awareness, this awareness itself, in and of itself there is a kind of freedom.
There is a absence of attachment, of clinging, maybe fear, anger, hostility.
Even desires are absent in this awareness. Even healthy desires, we can still have them.
All these things can still exist but we start taking up residency in the awareness.
We don't have residency in our anger, residency in our fear.
Those things can still exist to some degree but we're not prioritizing them or we're not giving them undue attention and importance.
They can be there and we can take care of them wisely but we realize we're not those, we're not identified with them.
And if we want to identify with anything, we identify with this awareness that we can't do, that just is there.
More importantly though is that we start seeing how this awareness is free of clinging.
And knowing that this exists, that this possibility is there, is a fantastic knowing.
Oh, it is possible to be free of attachment. Amazing.
I get a glimmer of it, I have a hint of it, but wow, it's possible to be free of jealousy, of judgmentalism, of cynicism, of craving, of avariciousness, of all kinds of things that are absent in that place.
And it's possible to live in the world effectively, established and abiding in this place.
To know that is to know something really important.
So now I'd like to read the last part of this text that we've been doing all these weeks and it's kind of the conclusion to it all.
And it says, the Buddha says, practitioners, if anyone should develop these four foundations for awareness in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits results could be expected for that person.
Either final knowledge here and now, or if there's a trace of clinging left, non-return.
So if a person does his practice seven years, they can expect one of two results.
Final knowledge here and now, in this lifetime here, to attain final awakening. Here it's called final knowledge.
And what it's a knowledge of, it's not knowledge about the cosmos and the inner workings of the mind or the details of physics or something.
The final knowledge is a knowledge that the mind is without clinging.
Wow, they really know this. Wow, this mind here has no clinging in it. Amazing.
And what I was trying to point you today is we can get an early hint of that possibility so we know it's possible as we develop awareness, as we find ourselves more and more aware.
And don't confuse it with having clinging. It's a part of you that is free of clinging.
It's a part of you that's free of fear and it's found in the awareness itself.
And then it says either after seven years you'll have full awakening, final knowledge here and now, or if there's a trace of clinging left, non-return.
Non-return means that when you die, you will, in this old idea of rebirth, I mean the common Buddhist idea of rebirth, that you will not return as a human being,
but you'll do the final work, the final liberation, finally letting go in this liminal space somewhere beyond your death.
And it's seven years.
So the usual interpretation of this is that this means seven years, that this is the primary occupation a person is involved in doing this practice.
So classically someone who can do this would be monastic since they really give their life over to it.
That seems pretty phenomenal, but the Buddha goes on and says, let alone seven years, if anyone should develop these four foundations for awareness in such a way for six years,
they'll have one of these two fruits.
Or for five years, or for four years, three years, two years, for one year, one of two fruits should be expected.
Either final knowledge here or now, or if there's a trace of clinging left, non-return.
Let alone one year, if anyone should develop these four foundations for awareness in such a way for seven months, for six months, for five months, for four months,
for three months, for two months, for one month, for half a month, one of two fruits could be expected, either final knowledge here or now,
or if there's a trace of clinging left, non-return.
Let alone half a month, if anyone should develop these four foundations for awareness in such a way for seven days,
one of two fruits can be expected, either final knowledge here or now, or if there's a trace of clinging left, non-return.
So it seems pretty phenomenal to do this inner work in seven days.
There are probably billions of people that exist in the planet.
There are people who probably are prepared and have a certain kind of capacity, potential that maybe they can drop into a deep state and find their way all the way to the end.
For most of us, this is not to maintain final knowledge in this kind of speed, but it's possible to have knowledge of this, recognize that it becomes part of us.
It's not complete.
It's not the final, but we're well on the way.
We've had an experience, we know this possibility of non-clinging, and to have confidence in it, to feel that it's valuable, to know it's valuable.
It's one of the most valuable things a human being can do with this lifetime, is to discover this place within, this place or this possibility or this, I don't know if it's within.
Once you're in awareness, there's no inside and outside.
Where there's a freedom from suffering, then our compassion for the world knows how fully it's possible to help support people to become free of suffering.
To have compassion for people who suffer and provide them with band-aids is great if there's a wound.
I never want to not offer band-aids that are needed, and I celebrate the people who do.
And to really know how thoroughly people can be freed of their suffering is to have this knowledge, experiential knowledge inside of ourselves of this possibility.
Then we can be a beacon, then we can point people, then we can support people to the full potential to become free of suffering, the very goal of compassion.
The text goes on a little bit more, and then we'll stop for today.
So it was with reference to this that it was said, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief,
for the attainment of the way for realization of nibbana, namely the four foundations for awareness.
This is what the Buddha said, the practitioners were satisfied and delighted in the Buddha's words.
So that's the end of the text, and we'll have the next four days of the week to kind of also finish up this whole text and sutra.
So thank you for today, and during this day of your life, maybe you can try to have a heightened attentiveness to when awareness operates without you directing it, you making it happen.
The awareness where your ordinary self is not the agent for the awareness, you're just aware in a natural way.
So thank you, and I'll see you tomorrow.
