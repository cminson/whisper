Good day on this Friday, and delighted to be here with all of you.
One of the themes for this week has been the way that certain states can exist together, sometimes in a spectrum,
where the degree to which one or the other is depends where we are in the spectrum.
And sometimes, maybe we don't necessarily see it as a spectrum, we see it as being quite distinct, but that things can coexist.
And happily, one of the things that can coexist is we can cling, we can be attached, we can be holding on,
we can be heavily resisting something.
And at the same time, be aware of that in a way that is free, that is not clinging.
It's possible to have very clear sense of knowing or of an open kind of awareness within which we know there is clinging.
But the knowing is free.
The knowing feels light.
It has like no weight.
The knowing feels maybe kind of, I don't know if allowing is the right way, or accepting is the right word,
or accepting is the right word, but the knowing is equanimous.
The knowing is not a hostage or not caught in what is known.
And so this ability to do both is actually very significant for doing this practice,
because some of us will have a very strong tendency to identify, to lock into different states,
especially if there's things we're critical about ourselves or strong, very impulses which are of attachment.
We can kind of so get so preoccupied with, so caught in it, that it's almost like we become it,
or it's inconceivable being without it, or it feels like we have to struggle with it, or fight it, or with it.
But when we have a clear sense of this knowing, this awareness, this way of recognizing that is not caught,
is not entangled with it, just simply knows.
The simplicity of it, without identifying with it, without making it a problem, without making the knowing of it a problem.
Maybe some things need to be addressed and there are issues, but the knowing is independent of the problem.
It just knows.
And that's a phenomenally useful reference point for finding our way.
Because then we're not beholden to the attachment to the clinging.
We're not under its influence, which paradoxically we are if we're fighting it, or criticizing it, or upset about it.
And so the fact that we can hold to both, be attached, and know it in a non-attached way.
So that'll be kind of the orientation for this meditation.
And so to assume your meditation posture, and gently close your eyes.
And straight off here, what is the most obvious thing that you're aware of for yourself right now?
And whatever is obvious right now for you, see if you can experiment with recognizing that's how it is in a relaxed recognition.
As if you're sitting back and gazing upon it.
Even if you are upset with it or have reactions to it, perhaps that which knows doesn't have to.
Just know it.
Some people, the idea of gazing upon it can provide a little bit healthy distance where the mind's eye is not caught in it.
It sees what's there.
So then to maybe with a reference point, with a sense of just knowings, unentangled awareness,
become aware of your body and let there be a few long, slow, deep breaths.
If any of you have ever gone scuba diving,
where you're aware of the vastness of the water around you, very attentive to it, and also it's so precious each breath.
And so here, it's so wonderful, the vastness of awareness, of consciousness, of knowing, and within it the preciousness of breathing,
breathing deeply and relaxing.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
And maybe with relaxing on every exhale, see if there can be the breathing, the relaxation.
While at the same time knowing it with ease, knowing it lightly, openly, not needing it to be anything,
not a source of judgment, just knowing.
Thank you.
Breathing simply.
Resting in the knowing that allows things to be as they are.
The knowing that's not confined by what is known.
And to practice that first and foremost with the breathing, staying connected to the breathing with a lightness like a feather touch,
but maintaining that feather touch breath after breath, lightly, staying in the unencumbered knowing.

Remember to come back to knowing, being aware.
As you come back to it, enter into it, appreciate whatever degree of freedom you find in knowing.
Knowing is free from what is known.
No clinging.
And hopefully you feel delightful attraction to this present moment capacity to know without being entangled.
And it's not so important what you know, so let yourself know whatever is happening in the present.
But take refuge in the knowing that's unentangled.

There's a strong tendency to identify with what we cling to, what we're preoccupied with.
And so when we know it, that knowing can be influenced by that clinging.
But to relax and almost maybe know from the back of the skull, to know somewhat removed from where the clinging is.
And to know peacefully, lightly, the clinging itself.

Perhaps you can know with more freedom if you have a small smile on your face.
Just a teeny turning up of the corners of the mouth.
And maybe that brightens the awareness enough for a stronger sense of unconstricted knowing.

And then as we come to the end of the sitting.
To again maybe make a smile on your face.
Because a smile on the face can make it harder to be grim.
To be harder to be attached.
Harder to resist.
And to not resist your capacity to gaze upon the world kindly.
To gaze upon the world in a friendly way.
What would it be like if you were a friend to all that lives?
Maybe even there's hope that with warm and kind enough friendliness
you'll befriend even the enemies, even the people you have animosity towards.
To have a smile on your face to disarm your hostility and animosity.
And to take the risk to gaze upon all that lives in a friendly way.
Breathing deeply.
And may it be that these 360 people now of you all sitting here
may it be that that becomes a force, a force of kindness, of friendliness
that we carry out into the world today.
Whatever benefit and merit we have from this meditation together
spread from each of us in all directions out into the world.
So we contribute to the welfare and happiness of others.
May it be our wish that this meditation is for the happiness, the safety,
the peace and the freedom of those upon whom we gaze upon today.
May we gaze upon them in a friendly way.
