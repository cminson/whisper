 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. Oh, hello and welcome to happy hour. So for today's practice, I think what I like to do is to invite us to start with a settling with a quiet meditation. And the inspiration for today's practice is happiness. It's happiness and the path of practice. The Buddha was known as the happy one, as the happy one. And there is no, no shame, no problem in wishing happiness. In fact, it's part of the Metta wish, wishing for ourselves to be happy, wishing for others to be happy. And offering it so the inspiration today is offering this wish for happiness as a wish, as a blessing, not attached to it. Oh, I'm not happy. I want to be happy. Why I'm not happy in this area. So if you become really contracted around happiness or lack of happiness, that's a sure way to become unhappy. It's the perfect recipe for unhappiness. But if wishes for happiness are shared as an intention, as a blessing, as a goodwill, as a gift without attachment, as a gift without strings attached. You don't give gifts with strings attached. So why would you give yourself gifts with strings attached? I wish myself well. I really do. No, no, no, no. May I be well. May there be happiness. May there be joy. This blessing and seeing the effect of that, playing around with that. So that's the little inspiration for today's practice, and we'll play around with it. So with that, I invite us to settle into our bodies in this moment in time, whatever is arising. And connecting with the body, with the earth, with the contact points, and with the breath in the body. And letting each breath be easeful, calming, soothing, filling the soil, and the breath of my own original soul. That is. Let's explore this happiness first, as much as it's available. And after thoughts, distractions, the happiness of releasing, letting go. Non-judgment. You you you you And as if you were tuning your radio, tuning your radio, your perception, your awareness, to tune into the subtle radio station of quiet contentment, quiet happiness in this moment. It's very subtle, very soft, but it's definitely here for every single one of us. No matter the conditions, the body and the heart and mind, it's very subtle. You can just be perceived perhaps as quiet, settlement, settling ease. It's the moment's respite. It could be a little louder by contentment. It's this simple nourishing happiness. It's here already. It's here already. Ease and quiet. Ease and quiet is already here. We just keep staring it up. And we tune into it with each breath. Consider the breath, your tuning instrument, the breath in the body. Embodied breath is your tuning lever. You you you you you you you I it's It's already here. The moments respite. We can all tune into it and let it reverberate through the body, even if there's pain. For example, in my body, there's a lot of pain right now, and yet there is this nascent happiness, joy, quiet joy I'm tuning into and inviting you to dare to tune in as well. It's possible for all of us. The practice. Practice with it. You As you find your way to tune, turn the dial, the happiness of awareness, this breath, this breath, even if you tune for a moment, you feel it, oh yeah, there is happiness here, there is contentment. I belong with everything else, but this is what I choose to tune into. You can say, if you wish, I am happy. There is contentment, there is joy, or I am joyous, whatever resonates. Or may I tune into joy, into happiness, may I be happy, whatever version that works for you. I am happy. Or may I be, may I tune to it, see what works, play around. Look for it as a wish, as a blessing, as an invocation, aspiration to lift your heart. That's the good. Be very subtle. It's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Or maybe it's just simply I'm okay. Okay. I'm okay. Okay. Okay. And if this practice of tuning into this goodness, the wellness, contentment, happiness is working a subtle way, bringing happiness, joy. It's an act of metta. You can continue. Stay with this. If you like to switch to the more familiar, may I be happy? You can do that as well. As a metta wish for yourself. Either way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you And as we turn to bring this sit to a close Feeling into any nuances of contentment, peace, joy, happiness might have been touched into, tuned into with appreciation. Letting them reverberate through your body one more time. Let there be gratitude, appreciation even for the slightest bit. Which again could be consistent with challenges, pain, difficulty. And yet tuning into what's good, what's here already. And appreciating with wholeheartedness, interesting that we are planting seeds of kindness, goodwill, a metta, wishing ourselves well, seeing ourselves well, tuning into happiness is an act of metta, it's not taking ourselves for granted, but taking care of our heart to tune into contentment, joy, happiness, it's self-care, it's self-love, the way of loving ourselves. Ending to our hearts, a trusting that we're planting seeds of kindness, care, love for ourselves and for others to be more available, more patient with others when we're happy, content and of service. May we be of service. May we wake up. May all beings awaken. May all beings be truly, truly happy. Thanks everyone, thanks for your practice. So what we did tonight, this morning or whatever your time zone might be in this moment in time is an invitation to tune into quiet contentment, quiet contentment, peace, ease, happiness, joy, just a whole range of possibilities. And again, there's so many different channels in the mind and the heart. And as I shared with you, with my body, there's a lot of pain right now and possible to tune into, tune into happiness, tune into, yeah, there is contentment of just being here, being with the breath. There's a goodness, there's a contentment, there's a delight, happiness in that. It's, it's as we blow on it, it grows. So yes, you can be, I can be in pain and I can be happy at the same time. Yes, I am happy, not in pain. Of course, you know, as human beings, we often get so narrow. Our focus gets so narrow, especially when we have difficulty that becomes the only thing that's happening in our field of experience, completely pushing out everything else. But there's so much presence, so many things that we can tune into. So this was a, an invitation to tune into contentment, goodness, peace, happiness right here and now. And listen to it more and more, let it reverberate and see what happens. And as I shared for me, there was a sense of, oh yeah, I am happy as I, as I stayed tuned into this channel, the contentment, the joy, the, the, the gratitude. Yeah, there's so much goodness right now. Yes, yes, happiness is here along with everything else. So that was the invitation. And if it worked for you, this, this way of tuning into metta and self-care, great. If it didn't work, no problem, no worries. There are so many ways, so many doors into the temple. So the invitation now, as we turn to small groups together, is to, to, if you wish, you are welcome to share one, one nugget about how this practice was for you. Oh, this part, oh, there was an aha moment here. Or this was challenging, just one nugget, like your practice, if you wish, or you can also share silence, just kindhearted silence, just being present and you can say pass when your turn comes and next person will share or say pass and next person will share or say pass and your turn comes again. So, so you'll go around and around, hopefully a couple of times, not having a long monologue, but, but, but just brief and also be inspired because as, as you listen to others, you can be inspired by what they found, what, how they practiced, how they turned to this practice. And just sharing from your own experience, not asking questions from others, not directing anyone else's experience, just showing as you are with kindness, with humility and with aspiration to support others and be supported. Offering again as a way of being held witness, not to impress, not to, we're really speaking for our own benefit, not for anybody else's benefit. Be kind, be kind and everything you say here, of course, stays here in small groups. So, and let's go reverse alphabetical order, according to first name, first name, yes, the first character that shows up. I'm going to create the rooms, have fun, take care, take care of yourselves, take care of each other and here we go. Welcome back. So we have a few minutes for reflections, aha moments, challenges, questions. And I'd like to invite you, if you haven't spoken actually in, in the large group to pull forward and if you have spoken, pull back. Really make space for those who perhaps have not shared before or tend to hold back. So I'd like to hear from, from you here. Are willing to share what came up for you. How was it? What happened? She, while waiting for your hands, I'll share one of the reflection that was shared with me in chat privately. That was a beautiful meditation. They have to go back to work now, hopefully now with more contentment. Yay. May you all have more contentment. So any reflections? Don't, I haven't heard from you in a long time. Yeah. I haven't, I haven't lost. I'm just in the wilderness. The, I really, the, we were talking in our group, I think we all really enjoyed the metaphor of tuning in and I, I'm the recent, or actually not recently, but for a long time, this endless thinking. And, and for me, the tuning in, it was really subtle, as you mentioned, and, and for me that it wasn't so much happiness, happiness, but this sort of, every once in a while, it was this quiet and it was sort of for me, it was like this relief of like, Oh God, wow, this is nice. And anyway, thank you so much. Beautiful. Thanks so much for sharing that, Don. I love it. Yes. Yes. It's very subtle. It takes some tuning and there are different nuances that arise, right? Which is this, oh, the sense of relief, just as you, you beautifully shared. Oh, how nice. How nice. It is subtle happiness. So if you have actually time to tune into it more, that, that sense of relief is, is a subtle form of happiness. Yes. Yeah. I see you're nodding. Yeah. Yeah. Sweet. Beautiful. That's exactly it. Love it. Yay. I'm always available to you. Especially when there's thoughts and worries and concerns and past and treatment. Okay. I'm going to tune to something different, which is already here. Trust that it's here for every single one of us. I know that it's here for all of us. I trust it. No one else, please. Maybe you'll take one more reflection. Red. I was saying to my group that sometimes with a meditation like this, with a suggestion involved with a fine tuning, we'll experience something in the midst of it. And then maybe a few hours later, it will come back with a greater force. And I'll feel something that I'll be surprised by. I will associate it with the meditation, but it will seem to have come around a corner. And it's a happy surprise. And one of the people in our group used the Lycan to two ripening, which I thought was a really apt way of putting it, that it needs to sit, it incubates. And it, I don't know why, but it just seems to need a little extra time sometimes. Thank you. Thank you, Fred. Thanks so much for bringing that into the space. How powerful, how important to share that for everyone's benefit. Yes, pay attention. And yes, it does need time to ripen. We are planting seeds. We completely are planting seeds, even if we feel during the meditation, something happened or not much happened, or mine was all distracted. Or later, oh yeah, look at that. And yeah, so powerful. Thanks so much for bringing that in, Fred. Really appreciate it. Yeah, beautiful. Beautiful. So dear ones, as I don't see any other hands and didn't don't see any other reflections in chat, maybe this is a good time on those two beautiful shares to bring our practice to a close. And may we continue to tune in, to tune subtly into this dia, tunar dial, to contentment, peace, release, happiness, and help it grow. Listen to it more and more so that starting from crackly, it becomes loud and clear. May you all be well. May we all be well. May we all be happy and all things everywhere. Thanks for your practice, everyone. Take good care. Be well.
