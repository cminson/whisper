 We spoke yesterday about Samadhi. Samadhi creates room in the mind and heart. Once the hindrances are no longer hindering, there's much more space in our practice. This space is felt as expansive, open, and able to accommodate all kinds of experiences, whether they're strong or very subtle. The instructions this week are oriented around the breath as our home base. It's the place where we connect with mindfulness. And we've brought in other body sensations, emotions, and thoughts. So we're connected now with very much of our inner world. And one more dimension, which doesn't add anything new really, but unifies the practice, is the space in which all of this takes place, in a sense. Sometimes we track along with the objects of mindfulness, being right there with what we're aware of. It's also possible to feel more like our awareness surrounds or encompasses the object, giving it lots of room to arise, change, and pass away. So we know it in a spacious and yet still intimate way. And when the mind is clear and spacious with experience, there can be a deep sense of rest. We rest with experience, letting it be just as it is, seeing it clearly just as it is. The Buddha called such a mind unruffled, and it's associated with a deep sense of well-being. So we'll sit together, turning the attention inward to begin our meditation, taking a moment to find some ease in the posture, ease in the body. You may have a clear sense of that now, but it's always good just to check again, how is it right now, in case there's been some change. So softening parts of the body, the belly, the jaw, inviting some ease and spaciousness in the heart area, letting go of any bracing in the legs or arms, connecting in with the sensations of breathing. Simple, easeful, creating some room around the breath, creating space to let the breath expand and fill the awareness just as it is. And without any change in the mind, just opening to include any bodily sensations that may be present, sensing the space within the body, the space around the body. Perfect. Opening to any emotions that might be present and letting them find their space. Making room for all that is in your heart. Opening also to any thoughts that might be present. Perhaps noticing how having room in the mind de-emphasizes the power or weight of the thoughts. They're actually quite light. Tuning in to this quality of having a lot of room helps the mind to rest with the breath clearly. It's like a background rhythm, a simple repetitive experience. And then the mind can meet any experience with spaciousness, with openness. Resting with the breath and when other experiences come, body, emotions, thoughts, we just let them enter the room freely, give each one space, see it clearly. And when it fades, resting again in the breath. Let anything come and make room for it. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest. And rest.
