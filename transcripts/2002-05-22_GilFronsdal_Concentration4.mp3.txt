 I have to go back and look. I don't... I take it to mean the person is capable. I guess a word that appears twice in this discourse is skillful. Someone who is skillful. But I don't... I don't remember. I don't even know if it's a good translation. I translated it myself, but I don't remember my translation. I translated it twice and memorized it the first time. But then I realized it was a bad translation. And then I redid it. And I memorized my new version. And what I gave you is the version that they use at Abhayagiri. So the translation that you did that you gave at Lhasan a few years back, is that the good one or the bad one? That's the bad one. Yes, Karen. I know this is a lot happening from doing this. I meditated for a long, long time and this has really sort of stated things about Lhasan. And what I notice is a lot of very intense dreams. A lot of negative dreams. And...well, first that, sometimes I'm not sure what it meant. My tendency is to start doing the positive one. And start labeling thinking or the emotion. Is it best to shift to that or just to go back to the concentration and stay with that? So you mean you're having nightmares while you're sitting or at night when you're sleeping? Well, what I just talked about was sleeping. More sleeping. But when I wake up and then sometimes I'm not for a while. And then you sit? Yeah. I can't answer that for you. You're welcome to go back and forth. I mean, you should have a serious session every day of concentration practice. And then at other times, if you're going to practice other times, you can do what you think is most useful. It might be useful just to sustain the concentration. If you are finding it useful, you might want to continue just doing that. There is something to be said about developing a strength of mind that becomes stronger than the pull of difficult mind states or difficult thoughts or something. So you just kind of develop that strength, you can override it. And other times you might want to do the fasten on it. You don't always want to override things. Sometimes you want to look at things carefully. And it's your call, what you think is most interesting and most useful. One more thing I noticed that's happening during the sitting is that I'll have little periods where I lose a bit of orientation. Like up, down, night, day, things like that, time and day. And I find that there is a kind of startle in the way. My mind is saying, it's night time, we haven't had dinner yet. Or it's Thursday, or something like that. And then I'm a little off balance for a minute. And thoughts about that? Well, it's a pretty common phenomena. What happens is the mind gets quieter, gets more concentrated. The normal conceptual mind that we use to always orient ourselves in the world quiets down also. And much of the way we perceive the world is actually through the filter of our concepts and our ideas. And so that activity of the mind, the conceptualizing activity of the mind quiets down. And until you feel comfortable in that state, there's a transition period where some people start having perceptual distortions or perceptual disorientation. And sometimes it's physically, sometimes the body feels really long. The neck suddenly gets really long, you feel a little squat, or you feel really light and floating. Various things might happen. It's like the sensations are still coming in, and the mind is trying to process it, but it's been freed up from the old way of understanding and just puts it together in new configurations. And then also if the conceptual mind has quieted down, then there is no activity of saying, this is Wednesday or this is Thursday, and there could easily be a moment there where a person doesn't even know who they are. Who am I? And since most of us only feel safe in the world, if we orient ourselves in the world by who we are, a very clear concept of what's out there, there can be a fear that can arise. And one of the hindrances, one of the obstacles, one of the kind of bumps in the road in doing any meditation practice, but also concentration, is fear that arises from entering into a way of being in the world with the normal ideas of how things are, have settled away. Especially, you know, with a very little sense or no sense, a very little sense of who I am or that I am even I exist. And so some people will kind of, sometimes they get very calm, very concentrated, and they're kind of taken off guard, and they go into a deeper, deeper state, and suddenly they kind of, they kind of get excited or afraid, they pull themselves out because, you know, oh my God, you know, I don't exist, or who am I? But if I continue along this route, I'm going to die, you know? You know, some things, some strange, some kind of fears arise like that. That's quite involuntary. It's not that it feels like pulling myself out is following the fear, really. It's not that I'm aware anyway. Right, right. But it just, yeah. It's just, it's involuntary, it's subtle. Yeah, yeah. You're entering into a new domain, entering into the unknown there, and it makes sense, and you know, to say it's involuntary maybe means, you know, if the mind was very, very still and really watched the processes of mind going on, you wouldn't say it's involuntary. But most people don't have that level of intimacy with themselves, so it happens just like that. It seems involuntary. But you know, it's pretty normal. It's not a bad thing. It's just, as you continue practicing, you'll get more comfortable in those states, and you'll get comfortable not needing to know, you know, what day it is, or you don't even care anymore. I don't think I care to do that. I don't think I care to do that. Yeah. I've noticed over the last three or four weeks that after, like this morning, I left. And so while I'm in the setting this morning, I'm very concentrated, very calm, and then I leave, and then I just measured how long it took me to be all full of fear and anxiety and everything, all that busy world. And it was before I got home, like 10 minutes. So how can you counteract that when you settle, you get very calm and very concentrated, and then you leave, and then you're really sort of like susceptible, sort of tender. The world comes, all the things that you're exposed to, you know, in your life just come flooding in. Yeah, sometimes the concentration practice or meditation practice can kind of take, again, you can drop your guard, and then you get a greater impact from the world around you, and you can actually get more disturbed than you were before when you had all your defenses up. And also what you're pointing out to is that concentration, there's very little wisdom in concentration practice. And so you need a fair amount of wisdom in order to navigate through our world and do it in a wise way. And if a person constantly relies on concentration for their peace and sense of well-being, relying on something which is not very reliable in the long term. And you might be able to sustain it for more than 10 minutes sometimes, but then you need to go back and get recharged. So you can do one or two, like you can do a number of things. One is you could try to live in such a way that you stay simple kind of doing one thing at a time. So you do the things you do in the spirit of that, you know, being concentrated, being focused on one thing at a time, having your intention and your actions kind of harmonized. And that can be very helpful rather than trying to suddenly get in mind, getting dispersed and doing 10 things at once. The other thing is to do vipassana. Vipassana is where the wisdom comes from. And as you're doing vipassana, you'll learn the skills of how to navigate our reactions, our thoughts, our feelings, and what goes on in the world. And that's really where the wisdom resides is with vipassana. The other thing that you can do is sit back. I don't know if it applies to you, but I think sit back and, you know, go for a walk or something, sit back and kind of look at your life and say, what needs to change here? You know, sometimes we have to change our life and change our behavior if you want to live a life that's somewhat more contemplative or in harmony with that. So those are my thoughts. So, yeah. One thing that I have a similar experience. I usually have a really good meditation in the morning, but then during the day, when I sit in the evening again, I'm pretty scared that it takes me more hour to even get remotely settled. So I banked around the web for a while, was somebody finding information. And there's a really good accounting of, I can't remember the gentleman's name, but he's a monk and he wrote his whole experience from when he entered monastery many years later. And one of the things that he did, having a similar experience, was he just said his meditation worked all day long. I remember when he was in the morning, washing conditions, sweeping the floor. I thought that earlier works for him, but much more subtle than anything. Yeah, so some people will, if breathing is their primary meditation object, they'll stay connected to their breath throughout their day. And it's kind of a dual tracking kind of thing, and it's very helpful to do that. And the meditation words, some people use a mantra and they do that. It's many, many things. Very medisitive. Medisitive. The other thing that relates to all this is that the level of calm and joy and delight that can happen in concentrated states, is if it's really intense, it's unreasonable to expect that you'll sustain that normal life. It'll go away as soon as you leave the meditation state. And so part of working with concentrated states is to learn how to have some equanimity and acceptance around the fact that the benefits that come from it, the states, the good qualities, pass. And having some ability to negotiate that with some equanimity is a very important part of the wisdom of this practice. There it goes. There it goes, bye-bye. As opposed to, oh shoot, you know what would be wrong, I'm such a terrible meditator, it's only ten minutes. Yesterday with eleven, I'm going downhill. So, just accept that it passes. It will pass. Quick question on that. I'm a meditator. What is unburdened with the duties? You don't have a lot of tasks that you're responsible for, and a lot of obligations, not a lot of work to be done. Was that intended for a nasty? Some people find different jobs. You can decide for yourself how you want to interpret that in your life. You have to do what you have to do. But a lot of people take on a lot, some people are neurotic in taking on too many responsibilities. They sign up for every possible class or task or job, you know, everything. Sometimes you want to do less. Sometimes it's un-darmic to do more dharmic activities and take on more. Are the tapes of these classes available? Yeah, Alison has them there. They're also on the web, but on our website. I just was going to make a comment about the meditator. I thought that the first part of it was actually part of the wishing as well. Like you're wishing that people are unburdened, and that they don't have a lot to do and care of. It could be. The way I've understood it is that the meditator describes, again, I think the translation is maybe not as literal as it could be. In my current translation, I actually changed the first phrases a little bit. So it says something like, for those who seek the state of peace, it's a little bit arbitrary, whether it's path or state or dimension of peace. Those who seek or want to attain the state of peace, this is what they should do. They should live this way, these long lists of things you should do. Then you should also, loving kindness should be an infinite part of your disposition towards the world. You should suffuse the world with loving kindness. It's those two things together, which are important. In the end of the sutta, they talk about no longer being reborn in this world. This is the final attainment in Buddhism. So loving kindness by itself is not enough to attain that. But loving kindness is a very important element of the character of a person who is going towards that attainment. Because it says in the end of the sutta that the person no longer has any sense desires, and the person doesn't hold the fixed views, has clarity of vision. So the metta by itself is not sufficient, but it's a very important element in the overall path of practice. Most people read the sutta as being a champion of loving kindness, since the bulk of it is about loving kindness. But I see the sutta as being really about the path towards liberation, with loving kindness being a very important element of it. In any case, your interpretation is beautiful, as long as you remember to include yourself, that you wish that for yourself, that you have all those things. You don't just say, those people can do it, but I'm going to be busy and burdened and conceited and proud. That's the old one. What happened with that was that I found a translation that I really liked, more than any of the many ones I could find. But the problem was that I had no idea, it was the one that Zent sent at the time, just got chanted, but no one could tell me who had translated it. And the publisher wouldn't publish it unless they knew. So I didn't want to go over with any others, and I liked kind of what was in that one, so I redid it. I didn't really translate it the first time. I just redid it in such a way that there wasn't any copyright problems. You know, it kind of had the right, you know. And then, I think it was earlier this year, or last year, I think, I started looking at that and looking at the Pali, and I was, oh, gee, I don't think that's, you know, I don't want to, this is too, you know, it's not literal, I don't know. So then I went back and made a more literal translation. So you're saying that the version that you use in Zent Center, you don't know? No one in Zent Center knows where it's from. It's beautiful. Yeah, I like it a lot. Okay, so let's do a sitting, and who would like to recite the metasuta at the beginning of our sitting today? It would be really nice if someone volunteered because then I wouldn't have to burden someone by calling them out. Who would like to give it a shot? I'll do it. Okay. So next week, everyone's expected to have memorized, and we'll recite it together. So please be sure, over the next week, to have it down. Okay, so everybody make themselves comfortable, and when you feel everyone, and as when you feel everyone's a little bit settled, you can start. This is what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace. Let them be able and upright, straightforward. Straightforward and gentle in speech. Humble and not conceited, contented, and easily satisfied. Unburned with duties and frugal in their ways. Not proud and demanding in nature. Let them not do the slightest thing that the wise would later reprove. Wishing in gladness and in safety. May all beings be at ease. Whatever living beings there may be, whether they're weak or strong, or meeting none, the greater the mighty, medium, short or small, the seen and the unseen, those living near or far away, those born and to be born, may all beings be at ease. Let none deceive another, or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or will wish harm upon another, even as a mother protects with her life or child from the child. So with a bonus heart, she might cherish all living beings. Radiating kindness with the entire world, spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths, upward and unbounded, freed from hatred and a will. Whether standing or walking, seated or lying down, free from drowsiness, one should sustain this recollection. This is said to be the sublime abiding. By not holding to fixed views, the pure hearted one, having clarity of vision, big free or false sense desires, is now born again into this world. So I've talked about concentration involving unification, integration of different factors, harmonizing and working together for the purposes of getting concentrated. We can talk about the mind and the body being together in the same place at the same time. Another important factor that gets unified with those first two is our intention. That our body and mind and intention are harmonized working together. That we intend to hold our awareness here in this present moment in this body. Hold the mind here. In order to do that, it's helpful if you approach the practice of meditation concentration with a respectful attitude, a kind attitude with loving kindness, friendliness towards yourself, with the respect for not only the practice you're doing, but also respect for yourself for doing the practice, with an appreciation of the importance of the practice that you're undertaking. That for this time it's sitting, this is the most important thing that you could be doing, or at least one of the important things you can do, so that you can put your heart into it, a heartfeltness. So then composing yourself, composing your body, your mind, your heart, to predispose it to be interested in becoming concentrated or stilled, to be settled and steady on your breathing, so that you can make a fuller contact with the breathing. It can be helpful to take a few deeper, longer, slower breaths at the beginning. It can be helpful to trust your breathing, the process of meditative breathing. Trust that it'll take care of you, and with its own patient way you'll settle the active mind, settle for now to various feelings and thoughts that pull you away, keep you scattered. Sometimes I think of the breathing as being like an umbrella. It doesn't stop the rain, but the water just washes off the sides. You can stay with your breathing one breath after the other. That staying with the breath doesn't stop your thoughts or your feelings automatically, but they just wash off the side. You don't get involved with them, you don't react to them. They just wash off the side. Bring the awareness to your breathing, and then steady the awareness on the breath. Perhaps there can be a feeling of having the awareness rooted in the breath body, that part of the body that breathes, rooted in your body. And as you relax, as you let your body relax, perhaps your awareness can fill your body with the breathing at the center. It might be helpful if you can, as you exhale, to let the thinking mind become still, let go of your thoughts as you exhale, and let the thinking mind become still like a placid surface of a lake. Let your attention become steady on the breath. Let the awareness attach itself to the breathing. Sometimes it's helpful to appreciate the stillness in the body or the stillness around you, and that's appreciation of stillness. It can sometimes help you stay connected with the breathing, as if the breathing occurs contained within a field of stillness, nurturing stillness. Meanwhile you stay with each in-breath and out-breath. If it's possible, see if you can let the breathing gladden you, bring some joy or some delight, as if you're fanning the flames of a fire with the breathing. See if you can let the mind, the heart, the body become even just lightly, so soft, a little bit delighted or happy. As you exhale, let there be a letting go, a kind of letting go that brings a kind of mild joy or delight. And then while staying connected, staying rooted in your breathing in the body, see if you can notice if there's any feelings or sensations of pleasure, joy, delight within your body. No matter how subtle, look around your body and find that which is pleasant connected to your breathing. And if you find some pleasure or some delight or joy, let the breathing be like wind which is fanning the flames of that joy or the pleasure. To let the pleasure or the delight or the joy spread or diffuse outwards through your body. Or maybe it's a sense of light, white light. Then it becomes stronger and spread out throughout your body as you breathe. Highlight that corner of your experience which has some joy or some pleasure as part of it or some sense of ease. And as you stay with the breathing, see if you can almost let that feeling of ease or pleasure, tappiness, delight spread through your body, your mind, your heart. Remembering to let go of your thoughts every time you breathe out, letting the mind become still. So with a still mind, you can tune into the stillness, the pleasure, the ease that might be found in your body, in your mind. If you feel any delight or ease or pleasure, it might stay very subtle and that's fine or it might get stronger. And there's no need to put any bounds on how intense it gets. Let it get as intense as it wishes. You're allowed to really let the enjoyment fill you. If making a small little half smile helps with that joy or pleasure, you might try that out. If your mind tends to be distracted easily, then stay with your breathing. Take a real interest in your breath. Fall in love with your breathing. Appreciate the beauty of breathing at ease. If it's relatively easy to stay with the breathing, at this point let go of any special attention to the breath. Let go of any attempt to be particularly with the breath. If you stay with the breath, it's fine. Relax that effort of focusing on the breathing intentionally. In favor of immersing yourself more fully in the stillness or the joy or the delight. Kind of like if you immerse yourself in a very comfortable pool of water. You lower yourself into the water. Lower yourself in, submerge yourself in whatever cool, delightful, comfortable feelings there are in your body. Enjoy the happiness. If it helps you, you can, a few times, very quietly, say in your mind, whisper to yourself, joy or delight or happiness. Perhaps to help evoke these states more strongly. You might find that to be thinking about anything at all at this point, normal thinking that you do, talking to yourself. Maybe it feels rather coarse. It feels like it takes a lot of work. If you want to let the mind discover its deep possibility of rest, see if you can put to rest your tendency to think. Letting the mind become like a placid pool, still lake, spacious, cool. If you still feel some delight or pleasure or joy, continue to let it suffuse all the parts of your body. Your torso, head, arms, hands, legs and feet. As if you're sitting in a bubble of stillness or joy or ease. If what you see is white light, yellow light or some colored light, let it envelop you. Now, within your experience, see if you can highlight whatever feelings, however subtle they might be. Whatever some sense or feeling of peace or ease. Be it either mental or physical or heartfelt, even just if it's a hint of it. Highlight the peace or the ease. Let everything else fall away. As if you're enveloping yourself in a soft, clean, cotton blanket. Let the peace and the ease envelop you, making you feel very content, safe, at ease, at home. With the mind becoming very still, content in itself. And then take the last minute or two of the sitting to let go of any holding to anything you have and review what that sitting was like for you. What happened to you as you sat here? What worked, what didn't work for you in terms of getting filled with joy or peace or delight, getting concentrated? Let your mind think about this. The first thing is to realize our potential to not cling, to be in the world without clinging to anything whatsoever. To release the heart, the mind, from all the things that keep it constricted or tight or afraid or angry or bitter or confused. Experience of release, of freedom, of unclinging. Concentration practice in the Buddhist path is not an end in itself. It's a means for helping us do that. It's a means to help us let go of our clinging. So we have to always remember that. We're not doing this for its own sake in order to be filled with joy or light or for its own purposes. But we do these things in order to help us to have the stability of mind and the clarity of mind to really begin addressing the deeper issues of clinging. This is partly review. There are a lot of benefits to concentration practice. One is it stabilizes and clarifies the mind, develops a strength of mind that helps us to be more focused in a normal life, regular life, outside of meditation. It gives us a sense of feeling unified, calm, which is very helpful. It tends to bring a lot of joy, a sense of well-being or a sense of contentment with it. This provides a very important shift in perspective about who we are and who we are in the world and how we feel and what are the values that we want to live our life by. One of the reasons why concentration practice is sometimes taught is that the joy that can come from concentration meditation can give you a very different sense of how to experience joy in your life. I feel like you have to go rushing out and fill it with unwholesome forms of joy or other kinds of things. It helps shift the priorities so that what's called worldly joys, their lure is lessened. They don't seem as interesting anymore because you know this thing which is much more satisfying than any kind of worldly joy or most kinds of worldly joys that you might experience so far. Part of the reason why this is valuable according to the Buddhist path is that it's very hard to free yourselves from our clinging to worldly joys. Rather than just simply telling you, don't cling to those things. In part, you're given this better carrot, this better thing, this better kind of joy, so you kind of loosen the clinging to those lesser happiness. The Buddha said something like, a wise person would give up a lesser happiness in order to attain a greater happiness. This is considered a greater happiness. Not an end in itself, but because it's really helpful then as we continue along the path of letting go and letting go. It also, as we get more concentrated, it's one of the ways that we tend to let go of self-preoccupation. And so again, it gives us a different perspective on who we are. Because if you get more concentrated, it's very hard to continue having those kinds of thoughts, reminations, preoccupations of all me, myself and mine, my problems, my concerns, my desires, my ambitions, who I am. Because all those kinds of concerns are kind of coarse elements of the mind. When the mind is really still, those things aren't operating. And to discover that you can let all those kind of problems of our life or our self fall away and feel a very deep sense of contentment and ease and happiness without having fixed any of those problems. It gives us a very different perspective on those kinds of self-preoccupying concerns we might have. And that can be very helpful to see that. It might give a very different perspective on what we think we need to do in order to feel happy, when we can be happy without fixing ourselves. And then it's also concentration practice is a foundation for the deepest work of insight meditation, of vipassana. And I'm very fond of the fact that in Chinese, when they translated the words for concentration, they used the character for stop. And when they translated the word for mindfulness, they used the character for looking. Stop and look. And the concentration practice helps us to stop so that we can really look carefully at what's happening here and now. So part of samadhi practice, concentration practice, is not only entering into a state of concentration, but almost more important is developing some mastery, some real skill in being able to do this. So it's not just a matter of putting in the time and the effort or wishful thinking or hoping that it happens, or just by luck every once in a while you seem to get concentrated. But beginning to have some sense of you have some ability, some skill at doing what it takes to support the possibility of getting concentrated. Sometimes it feels, and some people will say, that you can't make yourself concentrated. Concentration, something happens, but you can become skilled in creating all the conditions that allows concentration to ripen. Some people feel you can, to help concentration directly. But in either case, you develop a skill, either way, helping you create the conditions for it to happen, or you develop the skills to do it directly. Concentration, for most people, for people who are not trained themselves, is a semi-autonomic or semi-unconscious kind of process. Sometimes we direct our attention to pay attention to various things. If you turn on a television, most of us will direct our attention to the television. We have that ability to change our attention on will, but to really do it to have really power and mastery over that, so that we have the ability to really direct and hold our attention even when things are not interesting or fascinating in and of themselves. We can choose where we keep our mind, develop mastery of that. More importantly, not only mastery of being focused, but mastery of learning how to develop the joy, the light, the peace, and the con that can come from getting concentrated. It's a skill that we develop. In the path of concentration, it's very much part of developing this skill. It may be helpful to think of it as a skill that you're learning. As concentration develops, it brings with it new states of mind and feelings. As meditation deepens, it's an intensification of these feelings, these states. Part of the path of concentration is an intensification of states. It's not just simply more and more peace and calm. It's intensification. Sometimes it gets very intense. The states might arise. There was a time for me where the concentration got very intense, and there was almost nothing left in my experience. Concentration practice is a kind of withdrawal of attention from the sense world, the world around you. You don't hear sounds anymore, and the things outside of you. If you're really intensely absorbed, you don't even experience your body. There was no more experience in my body, and certainly in the world around me. Very little was left of my state, the very states of mind. It was very focused, absorbed state of mind. I got very absorbed in very intense white light. The light got stronger and stronger. At some point, the whole concentrated state began to break apart when I got nauseous because it was so intense. It can be very intense sometimes. You don't hold on to some idea that it's only about becoming calm and peaceful. You get calm and peaceful up to a point in a sense compared to our normal street consciousness and more settled. As you go deeper into it and the concentration develops, there's an intensification of various factors that happens. The path of concentration involves entering into states of concentration, not just simply having the mind concentrated, but entering into the whole state with the whole psychophysical sense of who you are, a sense of being. It shifts from the normal way in which we are. Traditionally, in terrible Angun, there are called entering the Jhanas. In Sanskrit, it's called Dhyana. It's the word for Zen. Dhyana became Chan in China and Zen in Japan. But the city had been concentrated, entering into these Jhanic states. Sometimes it's very difficult to translate this into English. My favorite translation is absorption. Absorption is usually the connotations of being really interested in what's going on. You're absorbed, you're interested. It's often a kind of joy that comes with being interested and being absorbed in what's happening. Sometimes, wrongly, you see in literature it's translated as being in trance. But trance thinks it's a connotation of losing a certain kind of presence of mind. There's a wide range of altered states of consciousness that human beings can experience. What's interesting is that in the traditional maps of states of mind, the Buddha and later Buddhist psychologists didn't enumerate all the different varieties that you can experience. They focused on particular ones that, as far as I can tell, are all characterized by a very strong sense of presence of mind. You're not going unconscious. You're not going to a trance state or shamanic possession where you don't even know that you're talking like a wolf or something. You come out of it and people say, oh, you're channeling this thing. There's not that kind of trance. There's a very clear presence of mind in these states. In Buddhist practice, the idea of being aware has very, very high priorities. Staying aware, staying present for what's happening. Now, these jhanas are absorptions to the point of exclusion or withdrawal from the world around us, from the normal activities of life, but also withdrawal from interest in sight, sounds, creaky floors. You wouldn't even notice those things if you're totally absorbed. Sometimes it's called a seclusion of mind, which I talked about Monday night. The mind is secluded or entered into a kind of solitude in itself. It's withdrawn into itself, the mind, the body, into the inner process. Normal sensations, perceptions, cognitive activity tend to fall away. A lot of it tends to fall away. That's why there's sometimes some disorientation that happens and sometimes fear that arises as part of this, because we're so sometimes to feel insecure if we have our thoughts and our normal feelings. The mind which enters into these absorptions is often described as being a mind which is cleansed. It's without blemish. It's purified. It's very soft, pliable, malleable. Now, so last week I talked about what's called access concentration. Access concentration is a state of mind, state of concentration, where the hindrances, the strong forces of preoccupation, things that tend to preoccupize you very much, are no longer bothering you, no longer have a hold on you. For whatever reason you can get it to no longer have grab you, no longer interested in that, the mind doesn't go there anymore. It's as simply does not interest in sensual pleasure anymore. It doesn't get pulled in that direction, or ill will, or sloth and torpor, or doubt, anxiety. Those things are at bay. So the mind then, because it's at bay, it's not pulled or fragmented into those directions, the mind becomes much more workable, becomes something you can start really using it to stay focused. As a person gets into access concentration, it's kind of like a little brand new toddler, some little babies, just beginning to learn to stand. And it stands, and it can stand for a few seconds, or a minute, or something, and it falls. And then over the days and the weeks, they learn to stand longer and longer until after a while they can stand at will for a long time. So in access concentration it's often kind of unstable, and it's very easy to enter into it a little bit, and then we fall out of it, and the hindrances come back. And then we muster ourselves up, we apply ourselves, we focus ourselves, we let go, we invigorate our inspiration, our faith, whatever it takes to kind of get the hindrances at bay. And then you kind of get into access concentration again. At some point, sometimes there are very classical kind of technical descriptions of what's supposed to happen when. I think sometimes they're a little bit overly done. I think it's kind of a spectrum of things that happen to some degree. But at some point, it's not just simply letting the five hindrances fall away. Also there's the arising of five other factors. So there's five factors which are put to rest, in a sense, get out of the way. And then there's five factors that, in a sense, replace them. And actually sometimes in the texts they talk about how the five hindrances are the five things that arise, the antidote to the five hindrances. These five things that arise are called the five jhanic factors, the five factors of absorption. Now, not every time that you get concentrated very strongly, these five have to arise. But in order to enter into the Buddhist notion of jhanas, these very useful states, these five are what can really start getting highlighted and start becoming predominant in your experience. So there is these five are the initial, what's called the initial application of mind, of attention, the initial application of attention, and then the sustained application of attention, which we talked about before. Then the third one is joy. The Pali word is piti, p-i-t-i. The fourth is happiness, sometimes translated as ease, sometimes bliss. And that's suka, which is the opposite of dukkha. And then the fifth factor is ekagata, which is one-pointedness of mind, the mind to be one-pointed. So these five healthy jhanic factors tend to be the antidote for the hindrances. So I can't remember that well, but let me see. The initial application of mind is an antidote to sloth and torpor, because you're applying energy. The sustained attention is an antidote to... I thought I wrote it down. It said it's an antidote to skeptical doubt, because you get caught up in all the thoughts, and now your whole cognitive world is kind of attentive, staying focused. So there's no space in the mind to start thinking about doubt. And then the joy, the piti, sometimes translated as rapture, is an antidote towards ill will. They say it's very hard to have ill will when you're filled with joy. And then happiness is said to be an antidote to restlessness, because we'll talk about happiness in a while, but you'll see happiness, the deep happiness of this jhanic factor, is a very settled, certainly unrestful state. The mind is very settled and contented in itself. And then ekagata, one point in this, is said to be an antidote for desire. I'm not sure why that can be an antidote to almost any of it. Certainly an antidote to ill will also, but it's said to be an antidote to desire. So it's very neat to have these five kind of matched up like that. In any case, these five hindrances are no longer, nothing really grabs you, nothing really pulls you away. You're really kind of settled and ready to kind of get into the practice, be absorbed, to be intent. You're not interested in other things, you're pulled away by other things. And then these other five factors then begin arising. And they might be very subtle at first. And as you get more concentrated, more absorbed in your subject of meditation, the breath or the metta meditation, whatever it is, these things become stronger. And it's possible also to start recognizing these, having some ability, some skill, at recognizing the arising of joy, of happiness, of one-pointedness, and then fueling it, intensifying it. And part of the art of getting into the jhanas and then developing the art of kind of playing within the jhanas is learning how to intensify, especially the joy and the happiness part of it. When we did a sitting, just now, how many of you were able to highlight some feeling of joy or ease or happiness and then also were able to intensify it to some degree, let it become more pervasive through your kind of psychophysical system? Is that something you had some ability to do? Some people, sometimes it can be evoked, you can actually say joy. Especially people who, if you do a lot of this kind of practice and your mind becomes a habit or a groove of this kind of practice, then a person can, it's a lot easier just to evoke these things. You can just kind of say the word joy. Or sometimes you can just say the name of first jhana or second jhana. And you can sometimes just evoke it. The mind is very powerful, dropping a word. The mind is very powerful, we all know that. And now the power of the mind is being used for very wholesome purposes. It's like, you know, some people have the ability, if you go to sleep at night and you resolve to wake up at five o'clock in the morning or a certain time the next morning, some people can do that. And somehow the power of the mind kind of operates in a kind of subconscious way where you make a resolve, something can be evoked. And the same thing, that's the power of the mind to evoke, to make resolves and to evoke certain things, becomes sometimes very strongly functioning. When a person has done a lot of jhana practice, especially if they're on a retreat, it becomes really close at hand. So I'll go through these, I'll talk about these jhanas. As I do that, the warning is that this is one of the places where more Buddhists probably suffer than almost any other place of meditation. They strive hard to attain these things and they get headaches trying, or they despair at not attaining it, or they get impatient because it takes 20 years, or they're not doing good, things are not happening as fast as they expect to, or it's not happening as fast as their neighbor who's getting into these jhanas right away. And there's at least a lot of suffering is possible here. And so you have to be very careful that you have a lot of wisdom, and a lot of vipassana wisdom to understand how to work with these states, and really good foundation in understanding what the path is and understanding what you are, and understanding your priorities so that you don't suffer because you've heard about these as a possibility. There are some teachers who actually refuse to talk about these things. Ajahn Sumedho, for example, I believe, I believe he never talks about jhanas. He doesn't like to. He has a policy he doesn't want to talk about because he just, he finds that they cause more harm in his circles than they have benefits. And there's a whole range of philosophies and attitudes towards the jhanas in the Buddhist tradition. And some people insist that the only way to get liberated is through the jhanas. Jhanas are not the way to get liberated, but you have to go through them and you have to do them. And some people say you don't have to do them at all, and you just ignore them and you just do the more important work of vipassana. There's all these opinions and they bicker and they argue with each other and say the other person's got it wrong. So these jhanas are Buddhist meditation in general, but jhanas are a source of a lot of difficulty. So you have to have a lot of wisdom when you hear all this. But anyway, I thought it was useful to have you be so familiar with these states. And some of you might already be fairly familiar with them. And some of you might be interested in these and knowing about these might help you as you practice to get more absorbed, more intent, more involved in your meditation. So the first jhana is the first five factors. These five factors are getting intensified. So the mind is absorbed, one pointed on the object of attention. In this case, mostly I'm talking here in this class, the breath. The hindrances are at bay, and there's a strong sense of the presence of applied it, initial application of attention, sustaining of attention, the one-pointedness of that sustained attention, the arising of joy and the arising of happiness. All those things need to be present in the first jhana. And they might be present in different balances and different ways. But if you look around in that first jhana, you're trying to recognize that all those are there. There might be a lot of other things, other factors that might be also present. There might still be some thinking going on, some discursive thought might be going on. The first jhana is said that you can attain without going into meditation. It happens spontaneously in people's lives, that they enter into a very deep sense of joy and absorption, of contentment, of happiness, in the mind very still and very focused. And there might still be some ruminations, some thoughts that are floating, free-floating around. And that's okay in the first jhana. The idea is to be familiar with this. Once a person enters the first jhana, one tradition is that you don't want to be in a hurry to go into the second jhana, the second shift of consciousness, shift of awareness. The Buddha said that if you go quickly, it's like a cow who is in its pasture. Before it really knows its pasture, it's already broken the fence to go into the next pasture. And you want to stay and really explore your pasture first. So the days are really, once you feel this kind of psychic shift, changing of gears in the mind, that where you feel like you're now absorbed and these factors are somewhat present, you want to stay there and become familiar with those. You want to become familiar with the number of things. You want to become familiar with how you got into it. And you want to pay attention to how you emerge from it. And maybe if you have some ability to go back and forth and get some skill there, massage it and work with it, don't be in a hurry to get somewhere else. And then once you're somewhat familiar with it, then you're ready to go into the second jhana. And the second jhana is very interesting because here what's highlighted of these five different factors is the joy. And the first two, the initial and the sustained application of attention, they're dropped. And here in the second jhana, there might be a stray thought here and there. There's not really any discursive thinking going on. The normal way in which we kind of self-talk that goes on in the mind, it's not going to happen much anymore. It might be a stray thought that goes through here and there. But partly it doesn't happen because discursive thinking is a relatively coarse activity of the mind. It's actually tiring for the mind. You feel kind of like you're doing this coarse thing, this agitated thing. And in the second jhana, things are subtle enough now, your psychophysical state, your attention to your mind is subtle enough, that it feels irritating or agitating to be involved in this kind of activity. And you'd rather not. It's obvious you'd rather not. So it's really easy to let go of it because it's just not interesting, it's not nice, not enjoyable. And instead you have this much more enjoyable thing to be doing, which is to continue being absorbed in the actual joy that's in the second jhana. So to move from the first to second, it involves letting go of the initial and the sustained application of mind of attention. And this can be understood in different ways. Sometimes it's felt as if you're no longer making any effort to stay focused on the breath. It just seems to happen very naturally on its own, very easily. You're not applying yourself at all, just happening. You maybe feel pulled towards the breath, or it has you. Another way it happens is that the awareness is no longer focusing at all on the breath, or on metta, or anything. But rather it's letting go of that kind of concentration, but now it's focusing more on the signs, on the symptoms of being absorbed. And there's a number of signs or symptoms of what it feels like to be absorbed, and one of them is joy. Another one might be an experience of light, white light or different kinds of light. Some people have a very strong ability to visualize, and as they enter into these deeper states of concentration, sometimes certain visions appear, like flowers or stars. Some people I've talked to see geometrical shapes, lots of geometrical shapes, and it's a symptom of this being absorbed. And so what you do now, the attention almost naturally, because you let go of the applying yourself, gets absorbed or involved in these symptoms or signs of the meditation. It feels like you're meditating. So you might actually use this, especially the joy here. The joy can get very intense. It can also be very mild, very minor. As a person gets familiar with the second jhana, then the idea is to learn how to intensify the joy. Intensification means suffusing it throughout the body, trying to see if you can spread it. So the whole body feels kind of joy throughout it. This can be experienced, it said, in five different ways. It's wonderful words. There are other categories. There is minor joy, momentary joy, cascading joy, uplifting joy and pervading joy. Minor joy is said to be goosebumps all over the body, here standing up on an end. I never had it exactly that way, but sometimes it said this pity, this kind of joy, has all kinds of actually uncomfortable sensations. Sometimes it can feel like all these insects crawling, like ants are crawling across your skin. I've sat in very deep, very concentrated, and then finally just had to open my eyes. There's no ants there. I could have sworn they were all over me, and there's nothing there. Sometimes the feeling of the skin crawling, the skin is crawling. Sometimes earlier, the mind starts getting really concentrated, but it's before you enter into a jhana getting absorbed. There are other symptoms of joy that might arise in the system like that that might happen. One of them some people have is different muscles can feel or actually can tighten up a little bit. Or there can be very strong buzzing or vibration, sometimes like in the third eye area, or sometimes around the face, the jaw, the mouth. The mouth might feel getting all puckered up or tight or taut. It's a symptom of concentration. Sometimes the eyes even sometimes can feel a little bit taut and tight. If it feels like it's a problem, you can always then bring your attention to those and do vipassana on them. But if it feels like it's very much part of getting concentrated, you might just be patient with it. As you get deeper into concentrated state, those sensations will fall away. The body will relax deeper or something will happen. It's kind of like a stage some people will go through. There can be minor joy. There's momentary joy, which is said to be like flashes of lightning through your body. Suddenly there's this flash of lightning. It can be very strong. It can be very small. Sometimes I had a feeling of these little explosions of light and joy, of energy. I thought maybe there were acupuncture points in my body. It was strange little points. They seem to radiate out in one track, one direction. There must be meridians. They're the following. Who knows? But this is kind of just momentary. Then there's showering joy, which can feel like waves, just waves and waves, just washing through you. Just like you're being showered a wave, kind of pouring through you, one after the other. Sometimes this intense kind of showering joy can remain after a sitting. I remember sometimes on retreats leaving concentrated state and going to lunch. I'm not being able to eat because every time I lift up at my utensil, just the movement of my body somehow, I would just be showered. Just a wave, a cascading wave of joy would just break through me. I couldn't handle it. I would try again. It took me forever to get out of the dining hall. There's showering. There's uplifting joy. The body feels like it's just suddenly very light, like you're floating almost. That can happen. And then there's pervading joy. The joy just kind of pervades, it fuses the whole body. So these are fine things to happen. The classic description in the suttas is of a mountain pond, a lake, that's spring-fed. There's no water coming in from land, no rivers coming in, but there's a cool spring deep inside the base of this lake. Out of that spring, it floats up with sprays or whatever they do in ponds. The spring kind of flows outwards up into the pond, suffusing the pond with cool, refreshing water. This idea of water is very interesting because I don't know if it's Jung, but we think of nowadays, mythically, that water represents the unconscious. A lot of these images have to do with water. The first Jhana is almost nine o'clock. Are you guys still with me? I guess you're used to it now that I go over ten minutes. The first Jhana is described with water also, but here it's like the classic description. Apparently they had bath soap in the ancient world. There was a powder, dry powder. If you take water and sprinkle water onto the dry powder, you can make it into a moist ball that's kind of clay-like, I guess. You can hold it into the ball and you keep kneading it until the whole ball is suffused with the water, with the moist, and pliable and workable. In the first Jhana, the mind is suffused with the jhanic factors, and it's infused with a certain kind of pliability and workability. The mixing of these opposites of water and dry powder, somehow the hindrances in the jhanic factors, the opposites kind of meet and balance each other out. You have this pliable lump of a mind which you can now use. In the second Jhana, you have this lake with this cool spring water that flows up from underneath and suffuses the whole lake. Sometimes the second Jhana is described as a rapture because it can be so intense. There still can be happiness there. There's supposed to be happiness. Happiness, one-pointedness, and joy are supposed to both exist in the third Jhana. Other mental factors can also exist there, but these are the three which are really important and these are which get highlighted. Second, it's mostly the joy. Then, after a person has become adept at the second Jhana, then they're directed to notice that the joy in the rapture is agitating. You can have too much joy. First, you feel really high. It's exciting. After a while, you can give me a break. This actually just tires me out. You can imagine waves of cascading joy going on and on and on. Give me a break. I'm so tired of this. There's a relatively coarse factor. As we move from the higher Jhana to the lower one, we're moving from coarse to more refined states. Rapture and this kind of joy is relatively compared to deeper states, a coarse phenomenon. You're trained to think or to understand that this is actually not a particularly good place to dwell anymore and you want to go into something more refined. You see and recognize that it's still agitating, that it's tiring, it's too exciting. There's something more sublime that's possible. You're directly in mind to let go of the joy in favor of tuning into happiness. The happiness, the sukha, is considered to be much more sublime. It's not agitating. It depends on how you look at it, the perspective. It's much more deep in the psyche, deep in the system, the happiness. It's kind of a contented, happy, quieter. It's a much more quiet, more satisfying feeling than the joy. The person begins to recognize that and highlight that and begin appreciating this happiness, this ease. Sukha is often sometimes translated as ease, but a much more deeply satisfying happiness, contentment or sooth, happy, delightful feeling. This is described as being lotus flowers on the surface of a lake, that same lake. The cool water has not only suffused the whole lake, but now it's suffused and cooled the lotus flowers on top of the lake. I don't quite understand how this image works, actually. I think what it means is now you're beginning to have some sense that you're not so caught up. The joy and the light is suffusing the whole body. Now there's kind of a resting on top of it all, kind of floating on top of it all. You're not kind of immersed or submerged completely in it. Then you realize that the happiness is kind of coarse also. It's a little bit agitating, a little bit unsatisfactory feeling to it. And then you let go of that happiness. In favor, and this is what's interesting now, is that now there's actually a shift in the whole process. You let go of the happiness, and then a new factor arises. This is the jhanic factor of equanimity, usually translated as equanimity. So there's the arising of equanimity, a deep state of peace, where the mind is no longer subject to pleasure and pain or being caught by those, subject to what's hidden in the text, grief and sorrow. The mind is a deep peace with itself, deep equanimity. And this equanimity, this state of peace or equanimity or ease or being somehow separated from pain and suffering, pain and joy, is so much more deeply satisfying for the psyche than the happiness that was there before it. It can sound like equanimity, it might be a feeling of indifference maybe, but it's kind of like an emotion, it's very deeply satisfying. So the second and third jhanas are intensification of some sublime and particular kind of emotional states. Those emotional states are like go of in favor of a much more deeply satisfying emotion or feeling or state or state of mind called equanimity. There can be very little contact now with the external world, even with your body sometimes. It's a very rarefied, very peaceful state of mind. Now why enter these states? Another description of these states is kind of beautiful, I think, and it kind of maybe characterizes a little bit the difference between joy and happiness, the second and third. The second is if you're out in the desert and you've run out of water, you've been out of the desert for days and days and it's really hot and you're parched and desperate for water and you're miserable, and you're really doing the most want in the world is just to have water. And then you see in the distance, you see an oasis. It's a real one, it's not a mirage. You see an oasis and you see nice cool trees around the edge of the lake, the oasis. And you just filled and you know the water is drinkable. It's a big sign, bold and bold, it says, you know, potable water, you know it's safe to drink. And you're just filled with joy and finally relief. You feel a sense of relief and joy and expectation. Yes, you have finally arrived and you can be happy and I'm safe. There's joy and excitement and delight arises. And this contentment to the light, partly of you're freed from the wilderness of the hindrances, you're not freed from the wilderness and the suffering, the burden of all your normal patterns of thinking and obsessions and fears and anxieties and the ways the mind works. And what a great, and you see the possibility of greater peace there, of joy, the joy arises from that. Then imagine that you've actually made it to the lake, to the oasis, you drunk the cool refreshing water, you had your fill and you lay yourself down in the shade by the edge of the lake under the trees. And then you have that feeling of ease and content, then you're really happy. You know how there's excitement and joy, oh yes, oh yes, I got it, you're relaxed, you can let go. You're no longer hoping and happy about what you're going to get. You're satisfied. So this happiness of being satisfied and contented, you're much more settled. So this is a little bit, sometimes describe the difference between second and third, the happiness that comes in. Equanimity is described in the text because it's kind of a shift, it's very different from the others. And there's no longer water analogy that's being used. But rather the analogy here is the images of a person who has surrounded themselves by a cool, comfortable, soft, clean, cotton blanket. And maybe it's that person who's finally made it to the lake, drunk the water, is happy with having drunk, and then they've maybe even taken a dip. And then they kind of had this nice body length, big, white, really soft towel. And you lay yourself in this towel and you're completely enveloped. This very comfortable feeling, maybe like a baby enveloped by its mother or something, just a very comfortable kind of... The equanimity is a very comforting feeling. And the image of kind of enveloped in this blanket is kind of nothing can touch you anymore. You're not bothered by anything anymore. You're so contented and settled in yourself. There's a kind of sense of equanimity, a sense of safety, of ease. Now, for the footnote, it said that the fourth jhana, when the mind is in the state, that's the state because the mind is so much at peace, so still and so concentrated, because one point in this is still there, that the mind is very, very workable. And now some of the more refined capacities of the mind can be developed. Very, very refined things that normally course minds can't be developed at all. And these are sometimes... Some of the things that can be developed are the psychic factors, psychic abilities. I'm agnostic about it. I don't know what these are about. But the Buddhist tradition makes a big deal about them, here and there. And when I was in Thailand, people would say, oh, that person there, he can read your thoughts. He knows what we're going to have for lunch the day before. And the ability to levitate and to fly and to read people's minds and to hear things in the distance. Sometimes people get very concentrated. I've had this experience. I feel like I can hear things that are... I don't think it's a psychic ability. I'm more rational, but I think... It's not like I can hear things outside of the world. But I can hear things much further away than I normally can, because the system is so sensitive. The psychic abilities. Some people feel that the fourth jhana is the best foundation for doing vipassana practice. And other people say, well, you know, other things. And it's the state from which the Buddha died, the fourth jhana, that state of peace, equanimity of that state. So what I'd like you to get from this class today is the idea that as you develop your concentration practice, it can actually be helpful to start tuning in and highlighting some of these factors, especially the symptoms of getting concentrated. Symptoms or signs of getting concentrated, like joy or delight or light, white light that might arise. And then to use those as a way of helping you get more concentrated. And there's two ways of doing that. One is to continue with your breathing and let the breathing be kind of like a wind or bellows that's fanning the flames. And using the joy or the light or the light that arises as a kind of by a feedback chair leader that kind of encourages you to stay focused. Or it's kind of like you're continuing to kind of develop that concentration by kind of massaging the breath, massaging those states with the breath each time, massaging it. That's one way. And the other way is to forget the breath, like go over the breath if you feel like you're really concentrated and stable enough, and then focus on simply on those signs or symptoms of being concentrated. And let them become stronger. You're allowed to intensify and change your experience when you're doing concentration practice. Usually you're not allowed to do that when you do vipassana practice. It's being a bad yogi. But you're supposed to just let things be. But in concentration practice, you don't have to let things be. You can be actually actively involved. You're actually supposed to get actively involved so you can get mastery over these things. It has to develop a skill and the ability to work with these. It has to develop the ability to evoke them or to recognize them, to turn the attention to these factors, to recognize each of those five factors in turn. Some skill in entering into quickly, to attain it quickly. And some people can do that on retreats. In retreats, sometimes I can relatively quickly move into a concentrated state. In daily life practice, I won't say that I'm quick. Then there's this interesting resolving. It's a very fascinating practice with the jhanas. Before you go into it, you resolve how long you're going to stay in it. You can resolve different things to happen when you're in that state. It's a little bit difficult to resolve when you're in this state. But you resolve ahead of time like you do before going to sleep at night, getting up the next morning. That sets an emotion, various things happening. For example, people can resolve, I'm going to stay in this jhana, in the first jhana, the second jhana, or the third jhana, for 20 minutes, for an hour, for certain periods of time. After 20, 30, whatever the resolve has been, you come out of it. Can you imagine? The mind is really an amazing, amazing phenomena. Then a person gets mastery over coming out of it quickly, letting go of it quickly. There's also an important part of it, reviewing the whole phenomena. I keep emphasizing this in this class, before you leave your meditation session, you want to spend some time reviewing how that was like. If you enter into the jhana, you want to spend some time reviewing how you got into it, what happened. You help develop that skill by reviewing and familiarizing yourself with it all. You're allowed to feel joy and you're allowed to intensify it. My doing is next week, experiment with that. You don't have to be in any jhanic state, but see if you can recognize pleasure, physical pleasure, anywhere. For me, that lips touching is a place where I can easily feel pleasure. Sometimes I'll touch my fingertips together, and it feels pleasant to me, and I can focus on that. Sometimes the way the breath feels, some little aspect of the breath feels pleasant or gives pleasure. Or some other part of your body, maybe you feel joy tingling some place in your body, tingling arising some place. Go without tingling, intensify it, let it grow, let it pervade the body. See if you can see the difference between joy and rapture as state of happiness. Explore and have fun with this, play with this, if it's accessible to you. If it's not accessible to you, these kinds of things, please don't be burdened by it. Please don't feel like you're a bad meditator. There's people who have very little ability to get concentrated, who do concentration practice, try to get concentrated, focus on doing the practice, and attain a lot more benefit from the practice than some people I know who had really easy time getting into the jhanas. Some people who have really hard time develop a lot more freedom and a lot more wisdom than the people who have a really easy time. So if it's hard for you this, don't be discouraged. But if any of this helps you, then let it help you, let it support you, let it become more playful and fun. So is that okay? So I'm sorry to talk over. And next week I'll be here again early. I'll be here at 6.30. And if anyone wants to talk, please come and talk about your practice. Do you have any questions about the practice? Please be very personal. Even though other people are listening, this is really a chance to have an interview and really ask your questions about this practice and how it is for you and how to proceed from here if you have questions. So please, if you want, come at 6.30. And then we'll have a class next week at 7.30. Okay? Great. Thank you.
