Practice Note : Selective Nature of 
Attention

One of the interesting issues around attention, 
mindfulness, and what we notice in our lives is 
the selective nature of attention. There are so 
many different things we could pay attention to 
in any given moment , that actually our life would 
probably come to a standstill if we tried to pay 
attention to it all. Or try to figure out what to pay 
attention to. There is a degree of habit or 
learned behavior that helps us  find our way 
efficiently. F or example, most of y ou have by 
now figured out that you are listening to my 
voice and what I am saying. Your considerable 
capacity for attention is directed here. But there 
are a lot of things you are leaving out. Most of 
you at this moment are probably not thinking 
about you r little toe. Probably most of you are 
not thinking about or focusing on th e grayness of 
the chairs  here at IMC. There is a lot you can 
notice if you are interested.  
 One of the things that affects what we listen to, 
what we pay attention to, what we look  at, and 
what we pick out of the environment, has to do 
with what we think is important. It has to do with 
our values , our concerns , and the variety of 
ways that life has conditioned us to focus on 
some things more than others , because they are 
important o r useful. Sometimes we have had 
trouble in our life , and so that conditions what 
we pay attention to  in the future. We may be 
hyper -vigilant around certain areas because of 
past experiences . Some of this is  learned from 
our family , or upbr inging , or culture.   
 
Also, our interests and desires come into play. If 
you come here to IMC and your desire is to have 
a comfortable chair for your home, you might be 
testing the chair to see if this is the right one. But 
if you don’t need a chair in your home,  that is not 
a concern for you. Or , if you are interested in a 
mate, then part of you may be scanning the 
room. Could that person be a good mate? Does 
that pers on have a wedding ring on? Y ou may 
have reach ed a certai n age when  the mating 
instinct is not as  strong , and so rather than 
noticing who might be a good mate, you might 
be noticing some other quality of people. 
Generally, most of the time, our attention is selective.  
 
One of the great pieces of wisdom to carry with 
you is to know that  attentio n is s elective. To 
know that attention is limited by what we think is 
important , or by  our conditioning. And if you 
know that, it gives you the opportunity to do 
something that you likely wouldn’t do if you 
didn’t know that. T hat is to be curious about 
what is o utside of your particular bubble of 
awareness, outside of what you are interes ted 
in, your conditioning. I n being interested and 
curious about that, then maybe you can figure 
out that you can stretch your attention , maybe 
open the attention wider. What am I leaving out? 
What am I missing here that might be useful? I 
don’t think the grayness of these chairs is an 
important thing to pay attention to today. But 
there might be other things to notice while you 
are here.  
 
Some people, fo r example, have a selective 
process that is about me, myself, and mine  – 
what ’s in it for me. Other people’s selective 
attention is one of , “Who are these people  here,  
and how do I harmonize with  them ? How do I 
support these people in what they are doing? ” 
Two different ways of directing one’s attention.  One might be pers onal only;  one might be 
interpersonal only. Or both. Eac h of us has a 
selective process.  Knowing that , we can ask the 
question , “What am I leaving out?  What am I 
leaving out that might be i mportant? By only 
noticing myself, is there some value in opening 
up more widely? If I am only noticing  the people 
around me, would it be useful to become aware 
of myself? ”  
 
If you notice that most of your attention goes into 
your thoughts, then noticing that, say , “What 
about the rest of me? My body, my emotions 
and feelings? What is happening there? ” 
Stretching beyond where your attention usually 
goes is one possibility for this mindfulness 
practice.  
 
One thing  helps in this process is what is called 
the “not -knowing mind.” If you already kno w, 
then you are being selective;  but if you don’t 
know, then you might look around at what is 
going on. Having curiosity and openness helps 
quite a bit.  
 
One interesting aspect  of asking, “W hat am I 
missing here ?” is that it generally helps put you 
in the present moment.  Generally what is outside of your focused attention is what is 
happening now , as opposed to what is 
happening outside of my attention back there in 
Menlo P ark. That is not so interest ing; it’s  just 
more thinking. This question helps you be more 
in the present moment : “What is outside of my 
attention? What am I leaving out in this range 
that I am paying attention to? ”  
 
I believe this works best for mindfulness practice 
if it helps the mind become still , quiet , or calm. A 
way of opening up is not to do it with a lot of 
contemplation , thinking , or analysis. Rather 
open the mind in a way that is kind of quiet and 
still. Diffuse , open awareness . See wh at comes. 
How I experience this is  if I am going to listen to 
a very faint sound, far in the distance, I might 
close my eyes and let my mind become really 
still to see if I can hear the sound. Is there a way 
to be still and quiet , and then take in what else is  
going on here with a full er awareness?  
 
If this  makes sense,  you might experiment this 
morning to see if this approach is useful to  the 
practice. Thank you.
