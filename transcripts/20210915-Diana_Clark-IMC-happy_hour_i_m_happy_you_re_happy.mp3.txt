 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, really warm welcome to everybody. Today I'd like to talk a little bit about something that I haven't spoken about before we turn on the recording. Claire and I were just reflecting, you know, a year and a half. This is a lot of loving kindness that we've been doing. And something that I haven't really talked about that much. I'm not alone in this. Darmuid teachers often don't talk about this. And that is nidita, sometimes translated as sympathetic joy. But sympathetic joy does not sound inspiring. I think Daisy Hernandez, she said, made her think of pastel balloons and teddy bears that are sold in hospital gift stores. I kind of like this idea, right? So what is nidita? Nidita maybe is a nicer way rather than trying to use this word sympathetic joy or appreciative joy. This is feeling happy when other people are happy. Like just being happy that other people have something good happening in their life. Whether they have delight or joy or happiness or whatever it might be. Just this appreciation that they have something good. Sometimes a response might be a little bit of envy. Well, why did they have that? I wish I had something like that too. And this might be born out of maybe we have this belief that's not so uncommon. That kind of we have this. Let's see that word just slipped out of my mind that I was going to use. We have this idea that certain things are commodities. There's a set amount. And you have some or you don't. So maybe we have this thing of other people are happy that somehow that means that there's less happiness for us. But when you hear me say that out loud, you realize, oh, that's ridiculous. Of course, I don't think that. But there might be some little way in which that view is there like, wait, if everybody's happy or if other people have made. What about me? What's happening for me? Might not be enough for me. So we might feel like there's not enough. We might feel a little bit of envy. Or maybe when we see that other people are happy or experiencing some joy or having some good fortune. We might feel like, oh, yeah, I knew I should have done that thing. I should have gone to school longer. I should have done a different profession. I should have married this other person. I should have not eaten so many cookies. I should have all this long list. Like the list is going to be nonstop. And so we might have this inner critic that just really shows up and say, well, they have that because they did X, Y and Z and I didn't do X, Y and Z. And somehow I'm a bad person because of it. So there's all kinds of reasons why maybe this idea of sympathetic joy being happy when other people are happy may not be a such a straightforward capacity to develop. However, this allowing ourselves to feel joy or happy or delight when other people have something is such an important way to move through the world, partly because joy, happiness can be restorative. It can be fueling. It can be nourishing. And so maybe akin to like a good meal is nourishing and necessary, right? That we need to have some lightness as well as maybe as well as seeing clearly how things are. So I'm not saying that we should need to deny all the suffering or the injustice in the world that is still there. And there are people that are having babies. There are new kittens that are being born. There are families that are getting reconciled. There's partners who are having that difficult conversation and finding their way through it. There are all kinds of small little things that sometimes we ignore or dismiss. I go through this. We want to have this loyalty to the suffering, the difficulties in the world. It's important that we not deny that they're there, but so much about Buddhist practice is about seeing clearly. And to see not only the suffering, but to see that there's things other than suffering that are happening also. And it's perfectly natural that we tend to focus on the difficulties, right? We're trying to find solutions, figure them out. And of course, our biology evolved from being sued and get eaten by saber-toothed tigers because they were paying attention to difficulties. So of course we tend to pay there, but so much about the practice is about seeing clearly, including the joy, the happiness. So can we celebrate what's happening in someone else's life? And to do this, we need to look at it like straight on. So not below with envy or not from above with judgment and not with rose colored glasses that assumes that they only have success, you know, after success, after success. Everyone suffers. But can we look straight on and when we see someone is happy, just be happy that they are happy? Because of course, right? Do we really want people to experience more and more suffering? No, of course we don't. What a world that would be. It'd be awful. So, more data. Allowing ourselves to celebrate when others have celebration, feeling joy when other people are joyous, feeling happy when other people are happy. And how many billion people are on this planet? Chances are somebody is having something good happen. So this makes it this practice makes it so it's more likely that joy can arise in our own life, if we see it arising in other people's lives. We don't have to be responsible for all the occasions of joy that arise we can see other people like they're having joy. Okay, I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. So, maybe one last thing that I'll say that moody to practice moody to is love and kindness, this well wishing this warmth this good well that's getting radiated. And then as it radiates out. It meets people who are suffering that living kindness gets turned into compassion. It meets people who have happiness, and the loving kindness gets turned into moody. So it's this warm wishing this goodwill. This care, when it meets other people that are happy, it turns into happiness. Okay. We'll start us off with some loving kindness practice from the prompt so to speak, and then we'll do some detail practice. Before that we'll do just a little bit of mindfulness practice, just to help create the container and sometimes it might be the case that doing loving kindness practice brings you right to your, your difficulties. It's not uncommon. And so I like to introduce mindfulness practice, just so everybody knows if it feels like this practice is not the right practice for you to be doing right now for you to do some mindfulness practice, this as an alternative. If you find yourself in an uncomfortable place it doesn't feel like it's productive and isn't helpful, then to do some mindfulness practice. Okay, so we'll start with a little bit of mindfulness practice, we'll start with bringing our attention. Just in general to the body. Bringing our awareness to the bodily experience. And we'll start to see in general, how we are, maybe globally on the bodies. Taking note of the posture. Is there any feeling of too much energy or not enough energy, or maybe the energies just right. Energy, alertness. And allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing. Just feeling the movements of the body associated with breathing. And the movements, the stretching, contracting. Maybe bringing a little bit of curiosity. What is it like to breathe from a sensation point of view, not so much from thinking, but from feeling. When the mind wanders, as it's apt to do, we just simply begin again. And can we do this beginning again with some warm heartedness. Perhaps setting the intention to be with the entire out breath. How about the entire in breath. Okay. It doesn't matter how many times we begin again. This is what the practice is, just beginning again. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. I like to start where it's easy. So bring into mind that being from it's easy to feel warmth, care, goodwill. This might be someone we know. It might be someone who has touched our life and they might not even know it. It might be a pet, it might be imaginary, kitten, puppies, babies. And then you're going to start bringing this love about being to mind and connecting with them. Letting our heart soften toward them, letting our heart open towards them. May we support the cultivation of loving kindness. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you live with ease. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you live with ease. And to extend our loving kindness to a good friend or family member. Somebody we know, somebody that we have warm feelings, loving feelings toward. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Noticing, again, the body, there's any sense of warmth or openness or spaciousness. And if so, allowing that to be a support. It may be really subtle and maybe just a small portion of your experience. And it may not be there. It's okay too. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Connecting with our good friend. And then bring to mind something that's good that has happened to your friend. Maybe it could be something large, like maybe they got a promotion they wanted. Maybe they got accepted to a program they wanted. Maybe somebody in their family has a good diagnosis. Maybe they do. Or it could be something really simple. Maybe they had a great cup of coffee. Maybe they had a meal that was really satisfying. Maybe they went for a walk that was not too hot, not too cold, not too long, not too short. So maybe you know something that your good friend has experienced or you can imagine these simpler ones. We can say this phrase, these phrases to support the rising of moodita. I'm happy for your happiness. May your happiness grow. I'm happy for your happiness. I'm happy for your happiness. May your happiness grow. Thank you. Thank you. I'm happy for your happiness. May your happiness grow. Thank you. Maybe there's somebody else that you know. Ask good friction. Bring them to mind. I'm happy that you're happy. May your happiness grow. Thank you. Can we allow ourselves to feel pleased, delighted, joyful, happy. Somebody else is having good fortune. We can't delight in that. Appreciate that. Appreciate it in a simple way. Just think how the world would be if more people were happy. I'm happy you're happy. May your happiness grow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can we be happy for them. Happy with them. Thank you. May your happiness grow. Thank you. To end this meditation, feel your feet on the ground, the pressure of the cushion or chair against the body. When you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. I'm happy with other people's happiness. I'm happy to be able to recognize and appreciate other people's happiness. This can be a really transformative practice, allowing us to experience happiness so much more than we would otherwise. I'd like to put you into some breakout groups where you can talk about this idea, Mudita, being happy for other people's happiness. I only let us through just being happy for our friends, people that we know. You can imagine that this practice, just like all the other Brahmapur practices, you can radiate it out so that you're happy for even people you don't know. And of course, even people that you have difficult relationships with. It's always good to start where it's easy. And for some of us, we might stay there for months, years. There's no requirement that we have to go into the most difficult corners of our practice. With unkindness practice, what you'll find is that as you do it, it just naturally progresses to maybe more challenging, quote unquote, individuals. It just has that nature. We don't have to force it. We can. Sometimes it's helpful to do that practice with more difficult individuals, but there's no requirement. OK, so when you're in your small groups, it can be helpful to not say everything you know, but just to say at one point and then to go to the next person. How many times have you heard me say this? Yeah, yeah, Dan. OK, get on. I think it's a good reminder that this is not the usual conversations that we have, just to kind of level the playing field between the introverts and the extroverts and to allow everybody to learn from each other. So just to say one point, let it go to the next person, say one point goes to the next person, then comes back around to the first person. And if it's helpful, you can use the last digit of your phone number as to go in numerical order that way to create the circle. OK, here we go. Welcome back. Welcome back, everybody. Does anybody have a comment or something they'd like to share? Question. I always thought this idea of mudita, sympathetic joy, and happy for other people's happiness. Fred gives a thumbs up and so does Kathleen. Two thumbs up. I think Kim, I saw you give it up to you right here. Hugh has your hand up. Yes, Hugh. Thank you. Well, I was I'm an introvert and I was in a room with two other introverts and we all turned into chatter boxes. Thank you very much. Yes, thank you. Yes, Neil. So one of the things that came up. We were discussing was that out of all the brown of a horse moody just seems like the one that's the least embedded in our American culture. Right. Right. There's like sympathetic joy is the worst of all the translations as far as I'm concerned. You know, it doesn't it doesn't communicate much. I can't come up with a better one. You know, I'm just I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that. I see you nodding a lot. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not 100 percent. Sometimes I would use appreciative joy. This kind of feels uninspiring. I would say these words. So moody. Maybe moody. It's self maybe a little bit better than just sympathetic joy. Or I was trying to emphasize like happy and happiness and other people's happiness. But I agree with you 100 percent. And maybe what one thing that I'll say about that we don't talk about that much or it's not in the American vernacular is I was thinking about this. That somehow we don't we tend to value productivity or something like this. Right. More than joy. So this hasn't really been adopted or and worse or something like this. Yeah. So doesn't mean we can't practice. But thank you, Neil. I agree. I don't have a good translation. I wish there were a good one. John John P. Cox uses the two words gentle joy. Gentle joy. I've heard borrowing joy. Oh yeah yeah borrowing joy. I've heard I've even used like borrowing wisdom. But borrowing joy. Nice. Nice. Thank you. This is southern expression borrowing trouble, which I love. I love this. We don't need to borrow a lot of people do that. But I just wanted to add a little bit real quickly that I hope very much you will continue to teach us some necessary for me. This is very selfish. But I need a lot of help. Yeah, I would like to do more of this. I was thinking this. Yeah, I was thinking this. I'm like, oh, I should do more of this. So I think I will. Great. Great. Okay. It's two minutes after an hour. But thank you all. We can unmute Chen say goodbye. So thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you, everyone. Bye bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. All the best. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Diana. You're welcome. You're welcome.
