So for the topic of this week grief, grief is something that should be
respected and there are many messages that we get from society, sometimes
mothers, that we should get over grief quickly, that we should heal grief, that
we should somehow not have it or be free of it. And I think that doesn't really
respect the grief. Part of respecting grief is to not assume you know what's
supposed to happen with it, to give it its due, to give it its time, to be
present for it. And the greater the grief, the more it speaks to something that's
really central and important in our hearts, in the depths of our being. And
the more important it becomes to respect it. And if your grief is much bigger
than someone else's grief, that's you know, is going through the same thing,
don't then dismiss your own grief. Maybe hold it carefully so that it is, you
know, maybe it doesn't need to be shared with people who are experiencing it
differently. But to respect our own what's happening. And one way to respect
grief is to assume that grief is as much as to do with more things than meets
the eye. That what we are consciously aware of about the loss we've had and
the feelings, the stories, the meaning, the impact that the grief has had, the
loss has had, probably is more as more roots and elements and in our
subconscious and the parts of our minds and hearts we don't see regularly. And
we're caring for the unseen within us as well. The way that grief maybe has
in unknown ways touches ancient griefs we've had, reignites them or
associated with them in some way or other. So when we're dealing with this larger
field, larger ecology of ourselves beyond what we consciously think about to
know, one of the great modes of engaging with it and being with it is to do
rituals. Many religions have rituals. Rituals are, some people don't like
rituals because they seem like it's empty gestures and steps and words that
are just kind of given kind of superficially and not really has any
sincerity to it or authenticity to it. But in fact rituals can be, they're kind
of a language, they're a way of expressing something and speaking
something that expresses in some ways the language of the deep mind, the
language of the deep, the deep heart. And to say something kind of a little bit
more ritualistically sometimes makes a bigger impact. And you know for example
if I meet someone I'm with a friend and they do something nice and wonderful
perhaps and I just kind of like wave my hand and say well that was nice as you
know acknowledging it and kind of moving on and passing it on as if you
know it is not a big thing. But if I make a little ritual if I may you start
language for it and tell my friend wow that was really nice to stop and really
wow that was really good. That was really, I appreciated that and really offer my
presence and my attention to say it rather than kind of as an aside. It
speaks and it has an interesting deeper more fuller than just miss saying
something as an aside. So ritual is a way of saying something more fully,
engaging something more fully, feeling it more fully, participating more fully
and something going on. And rituals the more powerful the ritual has been, the
more powerful the grief is, the more sometimes helpful it is or useful it is
to engage in a ritual. There are many kinds of rituals to be done and some
grief rituals are funerals and memorial services. But to and sometimes the
equivalent of a ritual or some of the steps of a ritual can be done writing.
Some people like to journal and then I'm going to offer you some possible steps
for a ritual, a grief ritual. It could also be possible steps to a journaling
about grief. But in ritual it's often nice to find a space, a place, a time that
is appropriate for you, that's nice for you. If some rituals are done alone and
so you can, it's best than alone and so you want to find a space, create a space,
a time and and if you're grieving something, a loss of something, maybe
bring an object that represents that. If it's a person, maybe a picture, if it's
something else, maybe it could be a stone that represents it or a flower or
something. And then engage sitting with, being with, the object that
represents the grief. And go through maybe different days, these different
steps. One is to write down or speak out loud or reflect on the impact on you
and the loss that you've had. And the impact is different than the story. The
impact is the impact of the event. So you might want to review and talk a
little bit about the event of the loss, not the story of what the loss means in
your life and all the aspects of it. But what's the event and then what
was the impact of that particular event? You'll get a chance in this ritual to
later talk about the impact, the bigger impact that has on you. But when you
first heard about it, the first thing happened, what was that like for you? And
to write about it, to speak out loud about it, to reflect a little bit about
it, think about it. The second thing to do in this ritual, and maybe this if you
have a stone that represents this, maybe you have five stones and one for each
of these five steps. And now sometimes holding a stone and talking to the
stone allows for something deeper to happen. I sometimes will talk out loud
to myself when I have something really difficult I'm trying to process. And I
find that talking out loud touches or evokes something very different for me
than I'm just thinking about it and reviewing it in my mind. So having a
rock, a stone, and talking to the stone might seem like a strange to do,
especially if you're alone or with someone, but it's a means of giving
some focus to what's being done in the ritual. And so the next
thing is to say a little bit about the story. What is the bigger story of the
loss? How does it fit into the story of your life? And what are the
different stories? What is the story? What is the story does it have to do with
different aspects of your life, your relational life, your personal life,
how does it relate to your childhood? How does it relate to your finances? How
does it relate to your sense of meaning and purpose? What's a story about the
loss in relationship to your identity? So to start telling the
stories in different ways and creative ways. And there are two interesting ways
of talking about the story, of the bigger story, of how this fits into your
life, is to talk about what's the gift that you received from the
thing that was lost? What are the positive aspects of it? Reviewing the gifts
like of a person who has died. What are the gifts from that? What are the
wonderful things that you remember? And then also this part of the story is
what's been lost. And there's many things that are lost, not just if a person
died, it's not just losing the person, but losing many of the things to
associate with that person. So the story of the losses, just really kind of
acknowledge it in a fuller, more complete way. The next thing to do is to
maybe for a different stone that represents the feelings, the emotions
connected to the grief, and to begin unpacking all the different collection
of emotions. It's surprising that some with grief, sometimes there are emotions
that come along that others don't accept as appropriate. Sometimes it's the
strong grieving and crying that other people have trouble with. Sometimes
grief comes along with anger, and sometimes that seems inappropriate to
be angry. But anger, all the emotions should be allowed, and that's why a
ritual that's safe and contained and has space for you to bring forth whatever
is happening. So you don't feel held in check by the social messages of how
grief is supposed to be. Sadness, grief, there might be laughter, and joy, and
delight, and gratitude. Many many things that make room for and kind of
assume there are many emotions, many feelings connected to a big loss. And so
having that stone or having a journal you're right in to really try to bring
forth, what else? What else is here? What else is here? Then next step of a ritual
might be to express to a different stone or the same stone gratitude. What's the
gratitude you have for whatever it is you're lost? And what gratitude remains
after the loss? What gratitude would you like there to be? Maybe after the grief
is somewhat faded, or if you ever imagine the grief can ever end, what
would be the gratitude that you want to keep and stay with and remember? And
what aspiration? What is your wish? What's your aspiration of how to live
your life after this grief? The bigger the grief, the more valuable I think is
to consider how will this person's life, this event, this thing that you
had, that's now lost, how will you live differently? How do you want to be changed
in a beneficial way? To be changed beneficially by loss is a way of giving
the loss a different meaning. Sometimes terrible things happen to us. People go
through war, horrible things happen, they lose their home and their country and
all kinds of things. And for that only to be something that is negative, I think
does it disservice to the depth in which the grief is coming from and touching?
And some of the things to do is how do you want to be changed for the better
from this? Don't ask us the first time you do a ritual at the beginning of the
grief. This might be munched down the line, but ask how do you want to be
changed? And then finally, when you're ready, and then maybe this is a different
stone that represents the grief, and that is to liberate the holding, to release
the way that you're holding on to the grief, the person, the event, the thing,
the attachment you have to it. It's not the same thing as giving up or letting
go of the person or the thing, but at some point you want to let go of the
holding you have when you're ready. And so that's where you take a stone
that you've had in the ritual, and you might bury it someplace, or I've
thrown stones that have been part of this kind of ritual into the ocean or
into a lake. And so you're representing, the ritual representing of letting go of
it, being done with it, leaving it behind, or putting it in someplace where, like I
like the idea that the ocean knows how to be with the grief, knows how to be with
the holding. So I'm offering it to something that can hold it
respectfully and be with it. So my suggestion is to engage in a conscious
process of full acknowledgement, full presence, full expression of what the
grief is about and what's going on for you. And it's a ritual sometimes that
can be done very well alone, sometimes with a trusted friend, sometimes with a
spiritual teacher, if you have someone to do it with. And hopefully you'll
experience that this is that deep wave of respecting the value and importance of
grief in our life. So thank you for this. So we have one more day tomorrow, and
we'll see what I talk about tomorrow. It's a huge, huge topic. I
can't cover everything, so I'm kind of a little bit talking about kind of what's
on my heart and what's in my mind, and hopefully that's appropriate for you.
