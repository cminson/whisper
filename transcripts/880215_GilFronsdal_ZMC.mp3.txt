 Perhaps a little bit, I'd like this talk this morning to be a continuation of last week's talk, the last time I talked, in that little bit what I want to do is to express or to share a little bit of passion I have for Buddhism with you all and I have a very deep appreciation and almost a passion for Buddha's way and more than anything else and I think many some of you heard me talk and kind of get all excited about talking about Buddhism witnessed a little bit at times and Sometimes a little bit embarrassing for me, but I tend to get quite impassioned by it Now in the beginning we chanted a very stolting chant and we paid our respects our homage to the Dharma and and Most superficially the Dharma in chant is the teaching talking about the teaching unsurpassed perfect teaching and I think more deeply it isn't a teaching that necessarily the Buddha taught But it's a teaching that we all have already that comes from our own awareness our own kind of dual mirror awareness luminous awareness of how things are each moment and the Dharma reveals itself teaching reveals itself to ourselves as we're aware and So as I practice Buddhism over the years slowly there's kind of little dawning or glimpses of This Dharma and this kind of awareness is possible and I had deep appreciation and love for it and a few years ago I I Started to learn to appreciate the historical Buddha or the Buddha the person who kind of found it or started to these teachings set them in motion and He started something to 2500 years ago, which we're a continuation of right now well the fact that we're together in this room because continuation of his intention and effort and and what he started so many years ago and So as I started getting some glimpses of the Dharma in my practice I also started getting some sense of Some ideas and hint intuition of what a Buddha's mind might be like and it's kind of awesome I just there's one of the awesome things in life tremendously beautiful awesomely beautiful the idea What what what a Buddha mind is like? and all of us have had some kind of glimpse of beauty in our practice in our life and if you imagine that beauty Extended an unlimited way then you kind of have a Buddha's mind So traditionally at the beginning of a talk Buddhists wouldn't pay respect to the Dharma they would pay respect to the Buddha and They have a very ancient language in which they do it with and the oldest living way of paying refuge to the Buddha like a chance for you namu Tasa Bhagavato Rato some more some Buddha saw Paying refuge to the the Arhat the awakened one the perfectly self-enlightened Buddha And One of the things the Buddha talked about a lot He repeated often was a very simple phrase which was on I teach one thing and one thing only suffering and the end of suffering and Then starting from there he talked the middle way the middle path and Until you've heard before you know that people mistake Buddhism as being pessimistic or life-negating emphasizing a lot suffering and To a certain extent that's true. It's very important to come to a very deep Understanding of suffering in our lives and it's very difficult actually to understand suffering It's easy in some ways it's just right in front of us, but the deepest wells of suffering That make up our life in the teaching of the Buddha aren't really understood until the end of the path when you're fully enlightened and But the other hand Buddha also talks a lot about Joy and happiness and the Buddha way practice of Buddhism is packed full of joy and happiness Compassion friendliness love kindness faith buoyancy of the mind clients of the mind likeness and lightening of the mind He talks a lot about all these wonderful Emotions and qualities that get revealed As you start practicing and he said another quote is known for saying is The way to enlightenment is through happiness So he talked the middle way and my understanding of the middle way one of the ways of understanding it is that it's The middle way between wanting and not wanting between holding on and pushing away between desire and hating and What that means is that we're completely open very open heart very spacious mind and There's no choice this kind of choiceless awareness there's no choice about what our experiences and in Buddhism what we're experiencing Doesn't matter at all and People often confused about that they think that is important to have some particular kind of experience when they sit or when they're Or when they're alive and In Buddhism, it's not necessary to have any kind of particular experience. It's unnecessary to have experiences of joy Not necessary to have experiences of suffering or sorrow What's necessary the point of Buddhism is not what you experience, but how you experience it? so the middle way Talking about how to experience what's going on they're talking about experiencing experience it with an open heart and spacious mind So whatever comes up You're allowed to come through you But everything be and the process of doing that Your whole humanity will pass through your eyes pass in front of your eyes and There's a lot of joy a lot of happiness that will come and there's also there's a lot of pain and in some ways The more I practiced the more sensitive I got got me and Stronger my emotional life has become so rather than being having my emotional life becoming smaller as I practice It's actually gotten a lot stronger and I Feel things much more than ever did before And my heart sometimes feels like it's gonna break Very pain sometimes when I see suffering around me and other times I just filled with light and happiness And I think I when I Somehow love this all of it. It's kind of like my relationship to the Buddha's way. It's kind of like a love affair I feel it's a tremendous vitality That comes from this kind of contact this kind of openness It happens with many levels When I was at Tasa Hara before in the early 80s, I remember there was a the Israeli bombing of Beirut and You know, I grown up in the Vietnam War and And you know reading the newspapers and we all know what's in the newspapers But it wasn't until I saw the Newsweek photographs of the bombing of Beirut That I think it really felt for the first time Tremendous pain and suffering of war I think one of the reasons was I was just open being Tasa Hara just because it was so open And also because Beirut was very close. I went to Beirut when I was small so I knew it and also Very European city very Mediterranean. Maybe you saw some photographs here how it looks and It's right on the Mediterranean and I also grew up for many years on the edge of the Mediterranean in Italy So just very close I felt so it's like next door what's happening this bombing wasn't so far away anymore Vietnam is very far away and And in Israel also, I also grew up in Los Angeles and growing up in Los Angeles I often felt that Israel was just a suburb of Los Angeles There were so many I had some in Jewish friends there So I felt some closeness to both places and have both places on killing each other painful And I really wanted to go there. I read those Newsweek magazines this other photographs. I really wanted to go there because I felt that's where my humanity lied I Was kind of I felt I was awakening to my humanity is really vital this pain I felt my heart was so precious and I Want to go very much Just to be there in the middle of it But you know, we don't look so far away to find suffering and I Think all of us here are here at the Sahara because of suffering in our life and Either it's conscious or unconscious that I think all of us know it very well And they're just suffering in small ways Just know is the wantings and not wantings is suffering You Know when we sit here and You know, we don't want the period to end we don't want to have kimmy now We don't have soji that's a form of suffering that That's wanting or we're sitting here and we want the period to end quicker and sooner That's too long that wanting is also kind of suffering There's many many kind of suffering in our lives In the other hand, there's just lots of joy and for me to come to Tassa Hara and see the effort and attention of all these people here And see that there's actually people are opening up to this vast beauty We don't usually use the word Purity or purification of the mind as an Center But to sense this purification process going on and see if another people and see the happiness that seems to bring many of you Of brings me much happiness kind of joyful feeling and Feelings of friendliness that I never had before kind of feeling extending Warms and love that I never had before I started to feel when I started practicing So just vitality which I just I just love if it was vitality that I've gotten from having these this rich somehow emotional life I For me one of the joys of practice has been living in a monastery. I Know it's often isn't easy to live in a monastery like Tassa Hara or other monasteries but The joy for me comes from giving myself completely To the monastery as much as I can And especially Tassa Hara that means giving yourself to a schedule And the schedule is pretty tight There's very little time for personal concerns and So you give yourself as much as you can totally you can and that giving there's just lightness that happens freeing up the mind a lot of the petty concerns or gross concerns we have a self-centered in some way and And the more I did it the more you do it The more this lightness of the mind happens is buoyancy freedom of the mind happens And the more the mind becomes buoyant and free the more openness more open the heart is the more sensitive you get to many things and one of the things you get become sensitive to is Very small sensual pleasures uh Just this morning eating oraoki After my food had been served and all the food was in the bowls It was just exquisitely beautiful. It's kind of silly to talk about how beautiful it is because a little bit irrational, but it's just It's just really it's just like a middle bowl with those bananas coated with yogurt. They were just glistening I didn't even touch it sometimes because it's just You know precious like jewels there Three white bowls three black bowls with white things inside this morning Or sometimes the way the light comes into this endo You know is exquisite. These are all kind these are all kind of sensual pleasures that we can have and enjoy and And monastic life. I think it's full of them because we're open and we're present For we try to be or we tend to be more we give ourselves to the monastery give ourselves to the practice give ourselves to Zazen the more we come open to these little joys little jewels The Buddha he talked about joy which was even greater than this kind of sensual joy sensual joy And another form of giving and then as we talked about generosity He talked a lot a lot and a lot about giving and generosity and It's not something you need to take up as a practice But you can notice the times in your life when you give really something give it give some material thing or Give an act of kindness or give a smile If you pay attention to your mind at that time you'll see that the mind is The moment of giving is very light very free. It's a moment of non greed and non attachment and it's a moment of Non-clinging and You can feel it a very special kind of joy pleasure and happiness With that kind of mind and that kind of pleasure the Buddha said it's far superior to the world essential pleasures So He encouraged people to incline the mind towards these higher levels of happiness climb the mind towards generosity He said that If people knew the fruits of generosity The joys that are possible from the acts of giving You would not if you knew in the way that I know You would not let a single meal go by that offering someone else And then there's another form of giving Which is the giving of non harmless not harming harmless this And This is one of the also one of the very precious things in life. I feel very special things that Didn't just unique to Buddhism, but it's on Buddhism emphasizes it a fair amount other religions emphasize it a lot too, but is Creating an atmosphere and a feeling of trust where people can trust if you're harmless you're not going to harm harm them You can trust you Buddha talked about a lot about that and traditionally British robes were kind of brown Kind of brownish red like maybe like lion's. Okay, so now and It was like supposed to be the kind of the color of the earth and The idea this color was that it was a color which was had a harmless feeling to it The animals that when they walked by a monk We feel not wouldn't feel threatened So this giving of harmless this is really a special thing and and the giving of harmlessness is the foundation or that some ways One of the main motivating factors for following the precepts And and for me I was very little interested in precepts most of my time as incident I didn't see I didn't really have any concern in my life But now in the last couple of years I think I'm going to appreciate the precepts a lot more and beginning to understand them as a guideline or an extension of this feeling of desire to be harmless and The precepts the literal word of the word in the ancient language Poly language for precepts is Selah and Selah literally means foundation so Selah becomes a foundation for our meditation practice and There's a kind of happiness that comes from having Pure conduct pure conduct conduct that Comes out of the precepts or naturally comes out of the precepts comes out of our direct openness to the world and It's going to be called it happiness and non remorse and Think we are we are who we are regardless of who we think we are and Oftentimes we try to run away from ourselves. I think or avoid ourselves or you still know our whole size and One of the things that happens if you do a lot of sitting is that you realize that everything's gonna come back to you that whatever you do Is gonna come back and If you've done something which you're not so happy about it was shameful about in the past You'll find out about it again Sometimes it takes years and years for it to come surface again, but the more you sit the more you get into intensive sitting the Quicker these things will come back. Sometimes they can come with a great surprise and It seems I don't know so much about these things but Impression is that it isn't just one lifetime that will come back. These former lifetimes will come it seems things in the past karma And So if you if you've had a based your life on precepts Then this remorse Won't surface in your sitting And that's kind of nice actually nice feeling. So there's a feeling of non remorse feeling that Your conduct has been good And that's another form of happiness. I think often in the West we don't we have a taboo against appreciating ourselves and It's possible to appreciate ourselves if we think back at our conduct and We say in the full moon ceremony all my ancient twisted karma and the kind of beauty of our conduct I think is that all of us in the in the long distance past or the Short-distance past we've all done everything And All kinds of terrible things and it doesn't really matter It's too much, but what matters is I think the dedication and intention to start living an open pure life open Life based in the precepts right now. If you do that, you don't have to do this, but if you do that then you have Another sound of kind of subtle joy and it's called the joy of non remorse Anyway, so this conduct Life based on precepts as a foundation for our meditation practice And now It's much easier to be To see reality directly If our conduct has been good if If we don't have an agitated mind get it remembers and reflects and feels all kinds of strange things about What we've been doing and You can see that I think all of you have probably seen it just enough small things we do to Sahara Basically, we live a pretty good life here. We don't do too many bad things But Just the way we talk to people and the kind of conversations we have sometimes you know, you feel you go sit down and you feel You've carried with you the feeling or There's a taste of it There's a taste of it So the more you more your your daily life can be in line with Buddha's way the more you can have a direct experience of reality in your city and And as your sitting develops this whole world of joy that open up whole world of suffering And it's very important not to judge your sitting because again experience isn't what isn't experience accounts and if you think you're having joy Don't judge it as being good. You think you're having suffering a lot of pain. Don't judge it as being bad There's just no way of knowing What you can experience and it's out of our control and this has been one of the great joys I know that's the right word now, but one of the great sources of vitality for me in practice is that or in life is that things are so tenuous Everything we know is really tenuous And it's just always slipping away And it comes completely out of our control and the more deeper our inside gets in sitting The more we realize the things are basically out of control our experience these come and go without our wish and Our experience is of our mind experience of our body. We can't really control them How many of you invited your thoughts you had this morning during Zazan? How many of you invite the pains you have they come and go out of our control And um And then there's just another part of the tenuosity of what's known is This tension I feel this great quivering in the heart of facing the unknown There's just so much unknown always in the edge of it And monastic life I think is very much always being on the edge of the unknown The monastic life is very much has very much unknown quality Can't really know what it's about So as we sit Sometimes we get concentrated and uh Some of the some of the greatest uh joys, trills, raptures That are possible for people are possible in states of concentration And I don't say this with the idea that you should all sit down and try to attain these kinds of happiness in some ways there um Uh, slight track but uh some of you experience it sometimes And uh It comes from being one pointed If our concentration is one point in one object, we we develop a happiness of seclusion Of solitary of solitude because we're no longer in touch with All the things that distract our mind all the delusions and heaviness of the mind Distortions of the mind which weigh us down which make us unhappy All those things are kind of put to rest for the time being because we just focused on one point and um And uh most buddhist teachers and a lot of the zen teachers Make a strong emphasis to stay away from one point of concentration Not always but uh There is some value to it And uh the value of one point of concentration Is that from one point of concentration? You can develop what's called the four brahma viharas the four boundless abodes and uh These are just these are some of the most powerful emotions that buddhist can feel And uh, if you feel that think that buddhism is unemotional, just try to develop develop some of these emotions and uh, these four are uh loving kindness and compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity And when you get really strong fixed one point concentration, you can take one of these four emotions And cultivate it and develop it. It becomes the one point you focus on and uh, they become boundless And uh, just if you extend it to all realms of universe these feelings are extended and they're inconceivable and uh You cultivate ability to develop it I think you know, you can imagine feelings at times when you felt a lot of love moment you felt a lot of love Or friendliness to other people you can imagine those moments of having access to them And uh being able to call them up at will just you feel a desire for them. You just call them up in powerful states These are things that are possible from a concentrated mind But then we come to the most wonderful happiness of them all Maybe the most subtle and that's the happiness of zen practice And uh, maybe some of you have been wondering where the happiness is in practices I think that uh Happiness is in practice comes from uh simply being in touch with what's real a rev said in the abdarma class. That's all illusion Anyway in touch with what's real And uh again having this very radical way unconditionally accepting what's happening in present moment And uh again this open open open mind and open heart and um It's a kind of coming home. It's just settling down coming to rest at what's happening each moment Directly in the experience of each moment coming to rest Feeling this is our home It doesn't have anything to do whether it's pleasurable or unpleasurable Uh Some of you maybe have felt Whatever I felt it very strongly during my tungario here Eight years ago That um, I had a lot of pain Just reeking reeking with pain My knees were on fire and um So it was very unpleasant unpleasant But it was very real And I was very happy about this intimacy. I was very very intimate with my life And I was very sad the tungario ended because um I was gonna lose this intimacy Lose this content where I felt was most real monastic life Is a monastery Especially kasahara we give ourselves to the schedule And uh, it doesn't matter if we're tired Or the headache Or we're starting to get sick. Maybe We go anywhere to the zen don't we sit that's our that's our basic dedication basic purpose of being here And uh, it's outside of our judgment our concerns of what is good or bad or good or bad for us or or uh, Whether it's gonna be pleasant or not whether it's gonna be difficult or not We we don't even you fill our minds with those kind of questions even that allow the question to rise up in our mind um Should I shouldn't I go to the zendo? It's a source of suffering It's a suffering mind that has those kind of questions And the joy that comes just going anyway just going doesn't matter if you don't want to go just go And uh, I think it's very important also If we're really going to be confront our lives face to face And see it and have this direct contact with reality that comes from zen practice We have to have some way of stepping outside Of our self-centered ideas of what we want and don't want And uh, so if we have a headache we come to the zendo anyway and uh And you're in touch with what's real and some ways, you know oftentimes I think we trick ourselves and uh Sounds and often is pretty healing And if you have a headache I find it's often just better to come to the zendo. I might not want to come It's just better to come and often I feel better afterwards I often want to start feeling sick Uh mix it, you know, I go to the zendo anyway, sometimes I get sicker but sometimes um It's healing to be here. It's healing to be choiceless The healing power of buddhism comes from being choiceless So as we sit and start confronting what's real One of the first things in practice we confront is all our psychological patterns And it's very important to admit them all and let them all surface let them all come And not to get concerned in the content of them But to be involved in the process of them and see directly for what they are And the more we can have this very kind of deep acceptance and love and forgiveness for ourselves for Our personality and everything of who we are Um the more we can kind of let all that settle down And we start seeing the mental side of our life and the physical side of our life. We start seeing how Um We have expectations and assumptions and projections and and ideas and judgments But what's going on? It's all our mental life And then there's the physical experience of the body which we are so much in touch with when we sit zazen And as we can be involved in the process of seeing these things these things for themselves One of the things we become very quickly aware of is impermanence Is a fleeting changing changing changeableness of what we're experiencing And uh the teaching of the buddha I think As I understand it he was talking about the whole teaching of buddha is based on what we're experiencing And it's point of point of view of what we're experiencing and when he's talking about change in permanence He's talking about the point of view of our direct experience And it's not abstract. It's not conceptual To see impermanence conceptually and abstractly Is uh pretty obvious the buddha didn't have to say that But to see it in a very uh concrete non-conceptual way Is when buddhism really starts opening up for us and dogan said that too dogan said that um The thought of enlightenment bodhicitta Is the mind which sees impermanence directly non-conceptually You don't really in some ways you don't really have the possibility of practicing buddhism in a very strict form away Until you're very very very intimate with impermanence And you see that everything is fleeting And uh At first when the first for many people when they first start seeing impermanence It fills them with rapture because the first thing you start seeing Tend to see is just everything just arising all the time You see it's arising I mean just primarily when when your mind Is very concentrated and very focused and just lighting on the arising phenomena moment after moment The sounds and tastes and sights and smells and touches and thoughts there's one after the other arising Everything seems so perfect. So wonderful. I think just open up. There's no more any concept of inside and outside of body and Environments just all this stuff happening this flow of sensations things just arising and past arising And it can just be so wonderful so perfect And your mind can just be so light to build with rapture Anyway It's a very wonderful time of practice for zinn students The danger is getting stuck in it getting caught in it either Holding on to what's happening or thinking that oh, this is what my practice should be like And then when it's not happening trying to make it happen And that in some sashines i've gotten headaches Holding on to certain states or trying to make them happen Um, but then we keep going and in zazen we have a stubborn steadiness Stubborn steady commitments just staying focused on what's happening moment by moment You're not getting caught by any of what we're getting caught by what we're experiencing experiencing And then impermanence starts revealing its other faces And the other phases of impermanence our next one we might see is the rising and passing away of phenomena And then as our concentration gets stronger, we just see the passing away Just see things passing away very fast Our focus on concentration is so strong That it just I think it's just The moment our concentration falls on what on the object It's already gone And so strong you don't even see things arising anymore just passing away just vanishing so fast and um And then you start feeling you know, we read today in the book on zenghi about a flash of a flintstone spark of a flintstone and talking about the buddhism of flash of lightning and How reality is a mirage or an echo? So I think at this stage when you start feeling this kind of impermanence you really start understanding what they're talking about when they talk about a spark of a flintstone a flash of lightning Things are just so impermanent things are experiencing is just experiencing just fleeting so much And then you start feeling Again, how tenuous things are the mystery and the unknown that's around us and um and uh And you might wonder sometimes we don't wonder what's happened to our practice because We're no longer filled with this happiness anymore that we had earlier. Maybe I remember many sashines I had At the end usually in the evening Like his last night we had this open sitting in the end and I used to have this experience of things just Going away Just flying away. I felt like I couldn't concentrate on anything There was nothing I could concentrate on because everything was just going away It was very strange So I'd usually stop sitting because I thought my I thought I wasn't able to constantly wasn't able to practice anymore Because I couldn't concentrate on anything So it's kind of tricked by this experience And um And uh, it gets pretty far out seeing this kind of passing away phenomena passing away every experience And um It's really far out when uh, you start seeing the mind passing away And you realize the mind isn't there You're just passing away and You know, you might see the body's passing away the sensations are passing away very fast But then the awareness in which sees the sensation passing away then awareness Then awareness Not only is it passing away, but it passes away before you even know quite aware of it kind of very strange kind of paradox Just passing away just And it's very frightening At times a lot of fear can arise in people because our ideas of self ideas of the mind The concepts of who we are no longer hold up There's nowhere we see there's no place we can rest anymore. There's no abiding place We can start seeing that in a diamond sutra they talk about past mind future mind present mind can't be had Can't be experienced and now we really understand that present mind we talk a lot of things about being present here But actually it can't be present When you send it you can't catch up to the present even of our experience It gets in this stage Which You can experience a lot of suffering a lot of pain and I think one is One of the things i've learned about practice It's very very very important. It's not to judge our experience because We go through cycles alternate cycles of pleasure and pain There's no way of knowing what's going to come up next and uh Anyway at this stage of impermanence keep keep penetration and permanence um The suffering can be tremendous And uh Much more than I think most people in their daily lives can imagine And uh at times some people not always but sometimes You think you're going to die and uh I think for zen students if you're really serious about zen practice You have to be willing to die and not just kind of figuratively but um You're actually convinced that you can see you're sitting you're going to die And uh, but you can't stop you just you know, you have to continue, you know, even if you're going to die you have to continue Many times we come to this place If you really completely accept that completely accept this place Then you can settle down you fall down into a place of very pervasive equanimity And this is an equanimity is a jewel Is a jewel somehow of the of the buddhist emotions When you talk about when they talk about the seven factors of enlightenment equanimity is the king And um Then we see things just passing Things arise and they pass away. There's no reaction to them at all anymore. Actually no reaction Don't get the effortless. There's no more feeling of effort in their practice Just things come and they go come and they go Finds very light and very clear and a lot of clarity And from this point this kind of equanimity There's a possibility of getting a glimpse of uh, the unborn the uncreated Of emptiness And I think emptiness the unborn is um Is the greatest happiness it's the most beautiful thing I think it must be that way And so I'd like to end Just with a poem By ryokan My My hut my hut lies in the middle of a dense forest Every year the green ivy grows longer No news of the fears of men only the occasional song of a woodcutter The sun shines and I mend my robe When the moon comes out I read buddhist poems I have nothing to report my friends I wasn't the right poem It was the next one Kind of strange to be up here A cold night sitting alone in my empty room Filled only with incense smoke outside a bamboo grove of a hundred trees On the bed several volumes of poetry The moon shines through the top of the window The entire neighborhood is still except for the cry of insects Looking at this scene limitless emotion, but not one word Limitless emotion, but not one word I Really saw buddhist buddhist away from me. It's just packed full of emotion limitless emotion So Does anybody have any questions any comments These two um, no word heart many people use it Um To me it's sort of a black box. It contains a lot of stuff, but it obscures them So I was wondering what do you uh me? It's like the word god, right right it's our practice of practice Well, I like to use it uh together with the word open And It's an open heart and um It's uh, it's you know, it's it has to do a lot with the feeling Here this area here On my body Uh has tended to vibrate a lot more since I started practicing than ever before and um So there's something here which I feel is very special. So I was like the word heart refers to this vibration and warmth tenderness here but um, I think open heart this is quality of of uh Not reacting to our experience Not pushing anything away not holding on to anything not picking or choosing or choosing And when you have that quality that for me is the definition of an open heart or openness in buddhism Right it seems like uh A big uh paradox And and this is when um, you do uh react to something Well, it's just where you do the emotions or reactions But um Maybe the thing is not to push them away or reaction That instant stay away from a um You stay away from a preconception Absolutely last thing you want to be involved in is instant is preconceptions So I think you're saying is very right And you you you're it's out of our control anyway We don't know what we've been experienced. We don't know if there's going to be equanimity or Reaction or hate or anger And those things just happen and uh, but we just at some point we we don't get involved in the chain I think that's what you're saying There's no chain effect that goes down down the line forever And that's what samsara is this chain effect that goes down forever So, you know at some point or other we just let things be I I do like your emphasis on how we shouldn't uh judge uh, Or or a condemn negative experiences of suffering as uh, as bad And I think of bogey d'arnamous saying that when we experience such a we're really uh, burning up, uh, taking care of that negative karma from the past It's not an occasion To uh, judge it bad Yeah, that's right I hear you speak of this one pointed concentration that you are talking about in the experiences that come from it I experienced the mind saying yes, i'd like to have that i'd like to attain that or Bring that about and what is this? What is it? What is this wanting? It's greed When you put these things up Okay It's not necessarily greed It can be taken up from a place of non-greed Like for example one of the one of the things you develop from One point concentration is possible Is uh, these brahma viharas tremendous feelings of compassion Loving kindness and some people some buddhist will develop Concentration one point concentration in order to try to help other people to be benefits by the people by developing these qualities And uh doesn't necessarily agree. Maybe you're doing it from the great buddhist autotick, but it starts to make mind I don't know but um But for the most part, uh, as I said most students most in teachers, I think most buddhist teachers tend, uh to shy away a little bit from excessive one point concentration because it's um Very little wisdom arises in one point in concentration You're fixated your mind is like a rock you're fixated on one thing Only thing you know is that one thing And it's permanent. You don't see it as changing. You don't see it's impermanence. You're just really hooked on it and uh And what we're interested in more is a fluid mind mind. It's more like water They can see everything as it is as it arises and see its fluidity see its changes See it's its true nature. You can't really see anything's true nature when you're excessively one-pointed So so what I was talking about joys I was talking about from that kind of Comes when when the mind is extremely one-pointed And it happens at times at times to people and it happens. It's nice doesn't it's okay? It even has a feeling for me that uh If one wants to develop Concentrations so that they can develop loving kindness It depends who you're doing it for depends who you're doing it for there's there's there's wholesome wanting and uh, you know, there's a feeling in there's some confusion in buddhism about the word desire and uh, because the problem is that uh, the buddhist word for desire Was translated as as desire And there's other words. It's with desire. It's too big of an umbrella It includes too many things and um When it says, you know the foreignable truths the cause of suffering is desire isn't it like a desire it's a clinging Which is unwholesome. There's also very wholesome wantings desires And uh, like there's dharma chanda The desire or the zeal or desire for Dharma practice Let's consider wholesome then this they're not necessarily coming from a selfish place And now there's a whole range of ways you can be engaged in the world, which is not selfish but still full of desire or intention and um And once you step out of the way and and for me that's you know, I practiced for many years. I think I was telling someone Uh recently yesterday, I think it's a kosher Um when I uh for years at zen center Um I thought it was really insincere to take up any kind of practice, you know except just being present my practice was unconditionally be present unconditionally except the present moment and um To take up any other practice take up even even the attempt to interest you get concentrated or to do the precepts or to Develop the paramitas to me was kind of perversion Because it was adding some into our lives. It came from the kind of desire. All I wanted to do was just Accept what was happening right now and um So for years, you know, I had very poor concentration by sitting because I wasn't interested in concentration And um, probably my practice was much pure back then it is now Because I shouldn't be so concerned about concentration If it's for selfish reasons and um But at some point I realized that um You know the boundaries of self and other start breaking down and you start you see that And you have effect on other people and you want to you want to do something for other people I'm going to help other people support them in their practice or It's like it's like cultivating a garden you want to have a garden so You know weeds are okay to have Some gardeners leave all the weeds there And but also it's okay to pull the weeds And it's also okay to cultivate certain qualities and the desire for that can come from a wholesome place But uh, I think mostly these end teachers will will ask you to avoid Cultivating any particular qualities Especially In the beginning of your practice because It's a little bit of a distraction from the main point which is just to see the reality directly for what it is So it's best just to avoid any kind of desire Even wholesomones and just be committed in this real stubborn steady way To uh direct confrontation direct intimacy with with our reality Right About uh following schedule and being a good monk sort of thing Nothing for me is Loosening up a little bit about uh, for example, um, how Soak through the soak through the soak during the meals and other things I find that I have gotten a bit fixated These kind of observations and uh, sort of I think to go in the after direction sometimes I when I can go to something fixated I look out the look I look out the opening windows instead or I look at the ceiling for I become aware of how the world is much larger than this and I suppose maybe I'll go through a cycle of this sort of fixation and kind of get away from this but you say something about perhaps When it's good to look up the walls to the valley of the skies I think it's great if you're judging too much purpose part of the purpose of these forms the monastic forms is just do them wholeheartedly and I'm going to attempt to do them wholeheartedly lots of mistakes are possible. I mean it mistakes a lot of time you read the wrong poems And uh um Uh But the point of these things is is so we don't judge our life anymore So it's it's one of the one of the greatest Mistakes is to do these forms and then judge ourselves for doing them wrong So if you're judging the forms and getting involved too much in judging them and criticizing people or yourself You know a good antidote would be maybe to do what you're doing look out the window at the ceiling So you kind of come back to more non-judgmental way And uh, that's a good thing and uh Which brings up the point sometimes you see doughnuts Um Doughnuts make a lot of mistakes And I remember at greengolf she's also here doughnuts make mistakes And uh, but sometimes the doughnuts do a terrible thing. It's worse things doughnuts can do and it's kind of uh, their death the death of a dawn And and the death of a dawn is when you hit the wrong bell And you go That's the death of a dawn hitting the wrong bell is fine That can actually that can actually be the moment of birth for the dawn But the moment of going that's the death of a dawn Some of the doughnuts around here have died a few times Yeah, and they get to be born really wonderfully really great group of great group of born again born again So When you were talking about the colors of the roads brought to mind that These react most violently black Do you know where the black came from something in china something happened in china I think Maybe I don't know Oh, I've heard some various things through times, but I don't remember them so well something about you know in japan, I think uh I don't know, you know black is You know, vanya anybody else know you should ask someone who might know I don't really know But put it at orange right kind of orange or brown It's relevant send it on swear roads black roads because they're happy good And I think in japan people get married in black whereas in uh, we get married in white, right so there's a different association with colors Is that right black uh, mr. fusion The idea of confusions was the planet of sort Yeah black absorbs all our emotions what's left is happiness And it's true, you know when everything else drops away You know There was a time in my practice where I tried to prevent joy from arising I thought it was you know kind of silly They get kind of happy and joyful and I was kind of sober. I really wanted to kind of Get going and and it wasn't it's not possible to avoid joy The vine opens up but you have this opening happen You go through a period of joy and it's inevitable and uh, so don't avoid it, but don't get caught in it and uh The ideal thing would be if you could pass through it quickly You know, you know a couple of minutes, you know Ideal thing would just let go and move on unfortunately Uh, we often get stuck Even in good feelings You spoke of reality and How as you practically said Try not to be distracted from reality and uh How is that different from say one planet concentration Well if you're distracted you mind just jumping all over the place usually Okay Oh, there's two kinds of concentrations There's one point of concentration which six takes on one object and the other one is um Called momentary concentration moment moment concentration which rather than selecting and staying over time with one object Uh, you're open to um, whatever is happening moment to moment as it arises If you're open to the changing nature of our experience There's there's constant streams
