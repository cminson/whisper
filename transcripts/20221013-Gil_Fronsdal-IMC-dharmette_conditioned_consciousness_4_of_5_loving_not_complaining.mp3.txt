So this will be the fourth talk on what I've called Conditioned Consciousness. 
With this wonderful phenomenon, a fact that one way or the other, in our waking hours, maybe other times, that we're conscious, we're aware. 
We're conscious beings, aware beings. 
And maybe that's enough to know. 
But we also have some way of constructing a sense, an idea, a feeling of what it is to be conscious, as if there's something called consciousness, something that we can call awareness. 
And the danger of that kind of word is that we make it into a thing, and so then we try to discover what is that thing. 
Whereas maybe it's not a thing, maybe it's more like a hologram, and it is kind of something, a hologram, but is it a thing? And then we get caught up in issues of linguistics and definitions. 
But this Conditioned Consciousness, this Conditioned Sense of what this being conscious is, has a lot to do with states of mind we have, and attitudes we have, and all kinds of things. 
And so today I want to talk about the difference in consciousness and awareness between blaming and loving, complaining and caring. 
So when we spend time blaming, complaining, and caught in the grip of those states, we're caught in the grip. 
There's a tightening, there's a narrowing. 
And often that tightening and narrowing around those feelings, those ideas, are closely connected to the sense of self. 
And it becomes kind of a lumping up, a coagulation, a condensing of a lot of different things, awareness, feelings, sensations in the body, attitudes, energies of the thinking, where everything kind of gets, you can get a strong feeling of me. 
Yes, me, myself, and mine, the self. 
And when blaming is this place of contractions, oftentimes, that's the source of the origin of this strong motivation to be blaming and complaining about things. 
And the paradox is that this tight place of self that can be felt experientially somehow, it's kind of like a solid wall that experiences the world will hit it. 
And it hurts it, or it threatens it, or this wall is fragile. 
Whereas when that self-coagulation, this contraction of self is not there, then the events of the world can still be known very clearly. 
But the knowing has no weight, it has no substance, it has no resistance. 
And what is known just travels right through. 
And we can still be responsible and take care of things, but it doesn't hit anything. 
It doesn't reinforce that coagulated, that contracted sense of self. 
And so the blaming and complaining is kind of this world and universe of self and other, and conflict and tension, in which awareness gets contracted, gets small and tight, gets filled with that. 
As we learn to sit quietly and shed the contractions of the mind, the tightness of the mind, things we're holding on to and clinging to, then the preoccupation with complaining and blaming will quiet down. 
The motivation to be hostile, the sense of hostility within, which is part of the same complex, will settle. 
And then awareness has a chance of not being so congested with a lot of concerns, a lot of feelings, a lot of this self that we can live under, this contracted self, this tight place where we're caught up in ourselves. 
And so the sense of awareness then, our capacity to sense or feel, being aware, becomes more and more empty of all this gunk, all this stuff. 
And this emptiness is a fantastic thing, because we then, to be aware of emptiness, there's awareness of the emptiness. 
But emptiness can grow in a certain way and have no boundaries, can be as big as this room, big as the cathedral, big as the space over the ocean. 
But that which knows it kind of begins to share some of the qualities of that. 
It's kind of like, part of that we construct this idea of what consciousness is from the way that we know, the way that not knowing, sensing, feeling, or wearing kind of is, and if it's more and more empty, it has different characteristics. 
And part of that is that the more empty it is, it allows for something deeper to surface and be present. 
And then I could say to call that something in the family of love. 
And I think we find many spiritual traditions will say something like this. 
In Buddhism sometimes, especially Mahayana Buddhism, they equate deep experience of emptiness with compassion. 
Somehow that emptiness and compassion arise together, or there's compassion in emptiness. 
And this wonderful kind of phenomenon of how some way or other, some sense of emptiness they talk about is coterminous with compassion or impregnated with compassion or something really wonderful. 
And so we have this capacity to nurture others, the parental nurturing of children is a deep instinct we have. 
We have capacity to care for the well for others like a nurse who tends and cares maybe lovingly and warmly for whoever's been wounded or hurt or sick. 
And maybe even someone they don't even know, but there's a care, there's a kindness, there's a warmth that comes and can't come in that kind of caring. 
So there's kind of amazing capacity that as awareness feels more expensive, more peaceful, that it's more empty in a certain kind of way. 
There's a room for something to surface in it that doesn't detract from that emptiness because there's no contractions, no tightening up around it, like there is with blaming and complaining. 
But the mind stays open, the heart stays open. 
And kind of penetrating it all or oozing from it or radiating can be goodwill, kindness, friendliness, care, tenderness, warmth, compassion, sympathy, empathy, and maybe just plain old-fashioned love. 
And this is one of the great things of this kind of deepening of practice is to have that kind of begin to surface. 
And for some people, it's certainly my case that my own capacity for compassion, kindness, loving-kindness, metta, was not something that I cultivated or worked at developing, but it surfaced in my practice as I matured in this Buddhist practice. 
There was room for it and something began to emerge and to grow that changed my life around this family of love kind of experience we have. 
And it felt kind of like this was what was in there, ready to come in the open space of awareness, quiet, settled. 
And so I would like to propose to you that complaining and complaining like blaming, blaming in a complaining way is really a waste of time for you. 
It's really a form of undermining yourself. 
In fact, all hostility is an undermining of yourself. 
Your hostility, if you have it, your hostility keeps you hostage. 
Non-hostility frees you from captivity. 
Hostility makes you a hostage. 
Your own hostility makes you a hostage. 
Non-hostility frees you from captivity. 
It's that dramatic. 
And so check it out. 
If you have a tendency of complaining, especially if you have a tendency, but even if you have an occasion to complain and with that kind of complaining be blaming someone else, you are then giving someone else responsibility for your happiness and your peace. 
Don't be a hostage. 
Don't give away your peace to someone else that way. 
Live in your own peace. 
Take responsibility for it. 
Don't sacrifice it. 
If you need to take care of something, a problem in the world, chances are it's possible to do it, to do it even better if you don't complain and you don't blame. 
Maybe you can do it better when you're kind, loving, caring, compassionate, so much better that sometimes it's better to wait to address a problem until you have some modicum of goodwill, some decrease of the blaming and the hostility. 
So thank you very much. 
May your conditioned consciousness nourish you with love.
