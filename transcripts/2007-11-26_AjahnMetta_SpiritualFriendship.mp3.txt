I'd like to express my appreciation and gratitude to be invited to come here this evening and
to see you all and hopefully share some experiences of myself with you that hopefully makes a
little bit of sense and relates to your own experiences.
We have been arriving a little bit earlier this evening here, like we had tea with some
people who were around here at that time and I was wondering like what I was going to speak
about and something that came actually up during this tea meeting is what I want to
reflect a little bit more around because I think it is probably relevant for each of
us being here.
It was a question around the place of spiritual friendship in our lives.
It came out of a question of like how much to trust somebody teaching and what is the
relationship of a teacher to a disciple to a follower and we have been at that time we
have been looking a little bit into that and sharing our different experiences around that
and I think while I was sitting here in the meditation some of this came back and I'd
like to look a little bit deeper into that question and see also interested to see if
there are any questions afterwards from your side so I want to leave a little bit of space
around that in the end.
I think what is important in regards to spiritual friendship is really to see what place does
it have in our lives and I think all of us practicing whether a monastic or non-monastic
or living in a lay sangha like I assume you all are, I assume you come regularly here
so I assume you are in spiritual relationship.
The Buddha said very clearly to Ananda on his question like what kind of place does
spiritual friendship has in our practice in our spiritual life and he was very clear in
his answer he said well basically it's all it's the most important thing in our lives
in our spiritual practice and he referred in that he referred on one hand to like the
physical spiritual friends like your neighbours, the friends you meet with that you share your
experiences with that you meditate that you practice together with but he also referred
to the benefits that come out of the practice, out of our spiritual engagement and looking
into the physical friendship like our friends right next to us, friends that we spend time
together with whether directly practicing like we did this evening sitting together
here in this hall and meditating or people that we share our lives with which also are
part of our spiritual life of course because you can't really separate that spiritual life
does not only happen when we sit and meditate it's how to say it flows into all aspects
of our lives and what we were looking earlier into is kind of the responsibility that we
all have in regards to our spiritual friends like the responsibility of a teacher to a
disciple and also the responsibility of a disciple towards the teacher but also that
we have in regards to ourselves and I find it quite interesting and quite important to
see that we do like when we say like we trust a teacher or we trust our friends to really
ask ourselves what do I actually mean by that what does that really mean does it does that
show up in whatever this person says or whatever I say to this person like do they need to
fulfill my own expectations does it mean that I need to fill the expectations of my friends
like when they come and talk to me about their problems does it mean does friendship spiritual
friendship means that I whatever they say to me that I say yes yes you are right and
I really do understand you or does it mean does it go further to really pointing out
oh I'm seeing this aspect or I have this perspective onto the point the aspect that you are bringing
up and that might be different than yours and is it important for you to see that and maybe
the perspective that you have on a situation is a different one than I have and can we
open up to that can we in that respect learn from each other and also see that my perspective
onto a situation is not necessarily the right one there might be different ways of looking
at it and for myself a spiritual friend I regard somebody as a spiritual friend if they are
actually showing to me what I might have not seen before an aspect that I haven't whether
I haven't discovered or an aspect that I have just left out of the consideration and I think
each other means that we try to bring more wholeness into our lives bring a wider picture
into a situation bring different aspects into our lives or also in bigger different aspects
of our lives as a teacher you of course have a certain responsibility towards people who
are coming to you and ask for guidance I think it has to be one has to be really careful
with what kind of advice to give to somebody who comes to ask for some support and I think
it is important to consider really when you give advice to somebody else to consider what
is helpful at this time what can the person who comes what can they receive what are they
open for what is really supporting them and I think this you could also say like you don't
need to be necessarily in the position of a teacher when a friend comes to you to ask
for some support or just to listen to them like what kind of response is helpful and
I think that is there is no clear recipe for that you can't just say well I always say
the truth because one point is do we really always know the truth and the other aspect
of that is even if I may know the truth are they really able to receive it or is it not
the right time so what comes into that is is it the right time is it the right place
and what is helpful what is beneficial the other aspect of the Buddha's teaching to
Ananda was the the spiritual friends that arise out of our practice which to most of
you I think is probably quite known like when we do practice what we develop is a higher
degree of awareness of mindfulness of faith and trust in the teaching in the practice
it's a higher level of maybe concentration wisdom all these aspects that flow into our
lives whether we are sitting here together meditating or we are out in our all-day life
situations and my personal experience is that the training the practice that are the developing
of the qualities of same mindfulness trust also like developing the skill to apply the
right energy amount of energy into a situation rather why into the meditation practice or
into an all-day life situation we do develop these qualities why we are practicing why
we are doing the former practice but actually do we also take the time to apply those qualities
into our all-day life or does it end when we leave this room when we leave our meditation
meetings I mean my personal experience is that as longer as I'm practicing as more
those aspects are naturally part of the daily life like when I'm when I'm out say when
I'm doing my work in the monastery and it becomes more and more natural that the mind
is much more focused much more with what I'm doing right now not so much wandering off
into the next step the next thing that needs to be done and I think it is good to also
necessary to remind ourselves like do I really apply the practice when I'm getting out of
the meditation out of the former meditation can I fully be with can I am I attentive to
what is happening right now whether in my work situation or in my way of relating to
others or in ways in like say just when I'm when I'm going for a walk how much awareness
is there to what am I really with what I'm doing right now can I enjoy like say you
go out for a walk in nature can I enjoy the beauty can I take it in or am I already with
what is coming next what is what is probably going to happen tomorrow or is there is the
mind back into what has been what I was doing before or what has happened yesterday how
much am I actually able to to be in the moment to be here with what is happening right now
I mean for me very clearly the fruits of the practice are pointing at that as more awareness
there is as more there is the understanding of what is unfolding right now and am I really
with that do I really want to be with that is another question because sometimes being
with what is happening right now can be quite painful can be painful because aspects of
our personality of our self get touched or are responding that is difficult to be with
like say in an interaction with a friend like an example for what I mentioned just before
like say I'm asking for some advice from a friend and she is responding say in a way
that I maybe did not expect can I still stay with that in the moment with what comes right
now how the way that is effect that that is affecting me can I open up to the unpleasantness
the pain that might come out of that or can I really open up to the support that somebody
else is willing to give can I really receive the gift of friendship or am I afraid that
of the results like does that mean I have to do the same thing again next time am I afraid
of really opening up to what unfolds in this moment because I'm thinking already what might
have or what might have will happen later or what might have happened before so what I'm
pointing at is can we really use the practice that it enriches our lives to come to what
is happening here right now how does it feel sitting here right now in this room with everybody
present can I fully open up to that or are there aspects of this experience that I don't
really want to fully take in and if there are aspects what what are they how do I relate
to that and I think this is something that is helpful to ask ourselves in many different
situations and see what comes up with that the other aspect that came up in our conversation
earlier this evening was the aspect of trust and like when our expectations that we have
are not getting fulfilled and especially like in a relationship that is very meaningful
to us like say in a relationship to a teacher if the advice that the teacher is giving
to us is maybe very difficult to take in and I mean there has been obviously a lot happened
in relationships between teachers and disciples that could be very unskillful or has been
very unskillful and I don't want to go into particular stories about that but I think
the aspect of trust has to be really held with wisdom and discernment do I trust everything
somebody says just because they are seen as like say as a good teacher does it mean I
give up the responsibility that I have for my decisions for my life just because a teacher
says well you have to do this or don't do that does it mean because I think this person
knows better than I do that I with that assumption does it mean I give up responsibility for
the further actions that I am taking out of that and I think that is a question we also
again need to ask ourselves what is actually important here and I mean another example
from the Buddha's life that he came to a place like a village or a town where the people
were very confused because they had many teachers passing through giving them many different
teachings and advice in ways of how to live their spiritual lives and the Buddha was referring
to that he said when somebody gives you advice when somebody is giving you a teaching what
is very important is that you open up to the teaching but you also hold it with discernment
you are asking is this teaching actually in accordance with my own experience with that
how I have been experiencing life so far is that does it make sense to my own experience
to my own practice and the Buddha says very clearly even if the reputation of the person
is very highly if it does not really go in accordance with what your own experience is
regarded carefully just give it more time to find out if that is really something that
you want to follow don't trust just because the Buddha says it don't just take that as
a reason to trust so what he is pointing at is blind trust is not helpful we have to bring
in our own experience our own experience of wisdom of that what we have been learning
in our lives so far does it make sense does it actually bring more wholeness into my life
when I am following this advice and sometimes of course it can sometimes of course there
might be a pointer that we can't fully see like there might be aspects in the teaching
that we can't quite comprehend yet because we are not yet at that point and I think we
have to leave that space open for exploration maybe just to share I am just coming out of
a retreat that I have been teaching together with Atenamaro at the Angola Center and it
was very interesting to see that I mean personally for me because I am just coming over from
Europe and coming to California is a very how do you say very strong experience because
you are you seem to be slightly different like what I found very touching is the openness
of how people share their experiences I feel always very touched when somebody is really
opening up like and in a retreat like that of course as a teacher you see the retreats
they come for interviews they come for meetings and what I felt very touching was to what
degree the people who came who I saw were opening up and were speaking about their lives
and their problems in their lives and I could feel like the effect that it had on me was
very strongly how I really so I want to bring over from this teaching and this is also something
I would like to give over to you all sitting here is that basically all is up to your own
commitment to your practice it is up in the end what how you hold your practice how you
develop your practice this is where the nourishment comes from this is really where the support
comes from and as teachers we can give you guidance we can give you maybe new aspects
new perspectives onto the practice onto your life but basically it's like really look how
you can integrate that what you practice into your all day life like see how much you can
really open your heart to each situation in your life I mean for me that is like what
I what I see is happening is that the resonances become stronger like when I when I meet you
here I mean partly because it's just really quite a large group quite many of you are
here and so sitting here I just feel a very strong resonance but I know also part of that
is the awareness the mindfulness your own practice that you bring into this situation
and really to trust that that is that that is actually the guidance that is what leads
you through all difficulties in life and friends teachers can be helpful and will be probably
helpful but only to a certain degree I mean a common saying and you probably all know
that is like you can lead the horse to the water but it has to drink by itself you can't
make it drinking and I think this is what I would like to see and I like to open the
space for questions I hope they are some questions I think it depends from what point of view
you look into that because I feel our whole practice is based on trust is based on trust
in the Dharma is based on trust on the qualities that we develop the expectations that I see
in myself towards that is that they may grow as fast as possible or as wide as possible
and it is hard to let go of that but I mean I can say for myself I haven't yet let go
of that so there is a certain expectation there and I think it doesn't mean that we
have to let go completely of our expectations but again what comes into that is the awareness
of our expectations like say when I'm coming to you to meet you and I come with a very
particular very defined expectation the possibility of being disappointed is quite high because
my expectation is so defined but if I'm coming here to meet you and say okay I will see what
is going to happen and interesting and maybe I like it maybe I don't then actually the
possibility of something wonderful to happen is there much more than when I'm very fixed
on a certain way of how this situation should evolve do you see the point I'm making it's
like I think it's very hard not to have any expectations I think I mean my understanding
is you probably come there when you are around when you're gone beyond all those boundaries
and limitations but I think it's good to be aware of what kind of expectations do I take
into a situation and am I really fixed on my expectations being fulfilled or can I open
up to what unfolds in this situation and maybe what comes out of this situation is much more.
It isn't often we get to have a certain one nun with us and so I want to ask you something
about yourself could you tell us what made you join the Sangha and also at this point
of your life would you looking back would you have chosen something else or are you
perfectly happy being what you are I think I answer your last question first yes I'm happy
this monastic life is bringing a lot of contentment into my life I wouldn't say a lot of pleasure
because that wouldn't be true but a lot of contentment I feel looking back it has brought
a lot of wholesomeness into my life and it is very kind of almost endearing you know
I do really value and I'm glad I can live the values that are important to me and this
is what coming to your first question this is one of the reasons to join the Sangha
that was one of the reasons to join the Sangha maybe just shortly to share with you I came
across this Tiruvadan way practice and I was in Thailand I was on a longer journey I had
a whole year and I wanted to travel from Thailand to Australia and stopping at different spiritual
centers and I started in Thailand and I ended in Thailand because I met a very amazing teacher
my first place to go to was Wachun Mok some of you might have heard about Achambuddha
Dassa and he was still alive he was still teaching and his teaching just turned my life
upside down inside out and I just knew this is what I have been waiting for all my life
these answers my question coming back to what I said before does it make sense what you
hear does the teachings you hear really apply to your experiences and this is what it was
for me it was like a revelation and shortly after that there was a very strong the inside
and this is the path and this is what I want to go on to walk on I want to dedicate my
life to that and it took about after I came back to Europe after this time in Thailand
it took another year and a half until I went to Amaravati for preparing for the ordination
so it was pretty much like hearing the teaching know it is right and doing it any more.
Hi, we live in Silicon Valley this area and taking bringing spiritual life to high tech
companies it's really difficult sometimes and the confusion really shows up for me personally
to the point that I want to give up that life and then I get pulled again to so it's the
confusion between this just absolute spiritual life and this non-spiritual environment so
what is your input?
My advice to you, I think it is very obvious that not everybody can want to ordain and
live a monastic life so the question is like how can I integrate spiritual values in my
life how can I lift them into my all-day life situations to not just when I go to meet my
lay sangha I think what is very important is that you are for yourself clear what kind
of values are there that you want to integrate deeper into your life like is it truthfulness
is it like mindfulness is it faith and really to see like in what ways can I do that like
I mean I would it's not easy but it's the most obvious aspect of our spiritual practice
mindfulness we can really apply into every situation wherever we are it means to be clearly
aware with where we are right now what is happening internally for us what is happening
around us and how do we relate from what is internally true for us out to where we are
into the situation and I think this is something we can do always wherever we are we don't
need a certain place or certain people around us for that and sometimes that way of relating
mindfully might be not doing anything might be not going into a reaction might be just
stepping a little bit back and look deeper so that can have many different ways many
different forms that can that it can evolve in and I mean faith as I mentioned before
also is something that that can be integrated even if you live in a very difficult say working
situation just really trust your your intentions trust your good intentions towards life towards
others I think that is something that also we do develop during our practice that we
know we can trust our intentions we can trust that we do relate or we do act in a way that
is the best what we can do right now and it might not be perfect it doesn't mean that
we have to be perfect and all the time everybody we are not because we do live in a human realm
and we are imperfect beings and that's alright but what counts is the awareness that we have
about our actions and our intentions this is what makes most of the difference and this
is some something nobody can stop us from doing that whatever situation we are in and
I think that is very important that will bring a different quality different develop different
values in your life wherever you are I hope that answers your question I haven't heard
any question from a man so far do men not have questions fantastic yes I do know that
for my monastic life this kind of follows from the questions that some of the others
have asked but what's more difficult the life of a monastic or the life of a householder
in terms of a spiritual life I think my answer to that is I think the challenges are different
the challenges in monastic life are different than those that you have in lay life I think
in lay life the challenges are coming from the point of destruction towards your values
towards your practice it's like there is so much else that you could do I mean just pointing
at one aspect of that that it is really hard to make your discernment and what is important
now what what do I want to bring into this situation right now and really stay with that
and not getting distracted from it I think that is just one very little aspect of it
I'm sure you can add much more but also because of time I don't want to go too much into
it from the monastic point of view I think the challenges are especially in the first
years of the practice is giving up your independence I mentioned that earlier this afternoon it's
like especially when you come into the monastic life and you have had already really a full
independent life like you've left your parents you live you have had maybe already a career
or you are in the middle of a career you consider to give it up for monastic life you maybe have
done that and then you come into the monastic situation where you are just one of many and
there are certain ways of how we live how we do things how we relate and that can be
very very difficult to give up your ways your own ways of doing things even so you think
well my way is much better than the way they do it here if they only would see that I have
gone through that myself and really to trust again trust comes in by giving it a try what
effect does it have if I really drop it am I willing to give it a try I think that are
the challenges in monastic life and also like what comes in I think like do we really can
and want to give up those very intimate relationships you can have a lay life like partner relationship
or very intimate friendships that also like living the monastic life you are it's almost
like and you might get laugh about this and it's fine for me it feels like you are married
with the whole monastic community instead of just that you are too funny and can really
laugh with it because you know it's just like that it's just like you are in relationship
with many and on many different levels and that is it can be quite challenging because
also like in lay life at least you choose your partner we don't always choose who we
are living with they are there so that are some of the challenges that we face I am aware
about it and I hope you don't mind me I repeat something I have been saying on the retreat
and people really have been laughing about that when I just I came just a short time
like about two and a half weeks ago I came here to California and I stayed with a friend
and she was she was showing me her tea cupboard I don't know if it makes sense what I am saying
and there was such a variety of choices I mean I was just gobsmacked you know just like
just a simple cup of tea and where I am coming from in the monastic life especially I mean
it doesn't mean we don't have different varieties of tea in England that exists but it's just
like the enormousness of that and I can see also like the spiritual marketplace or the
choice in the spiritual marketplace is just tea probably even spiritual tea is enormous
and I think it is important what I would take in regards to that is what is beneficial and
stay with that and from time to time something else appears and comes in look at it does
it can I integrate it in the rest or not if not do I really want it is it really helpful
it's very simple in a way and my recipe and this is something I really learned in monastic
life is more simple is better because it means there is more space to go deeper to look closer
to get more emerged in it and this is what spiritual life for me is about and yeah I
hope that answers your other question you just answered my question
sometimes you need to read about it should we stop here it's shortly past nine so I
really do wish you well I hope your practice continues to work for you and really trust
your own experiences and when you have doubts look into doubt there is nothing wrong in
doubt it's just being aware of doubt good enough okay
