 It's not so easy to do a retreat at home, but it's quite something to know that okay, we're part of this community we're all practicing together. I mean this schedule and listening to talks on occasion. So a really warm welcome. It was nice to meet with, I guess I met with half of you today. Delighted is to connect with some of you. And we will have some sign-up practice discussions tomorrow. I'll be offering a handful of them. If you feel like you need a little extra support or have something that you think it would be helpful to discuss. So those will be made available at the end of this Dharma talk. So they're not available yet. But if you need them and tonight or tomorrow morning if you feel like it would be supportive for you to sign up for a practice discussion you can do that. I'll be offering some today and Brian will be offering some I'm sorry I'll be offering some tomorrow and Brian will be offering some the day following. Okay, so maybe we'll go back and visit our friend Medya. You went to go meditate and had a hard time. And I came back and he told the Buddha told the Buddha and the Buddha said well there are five things that can help the heart's release ripen. And the first was Kalyanamita. Good spiritual friends and it can also be translated as friends of the good or a friend of the beautiful. That Brian spoke about last night or yesterday. So the second thing that Buddha tells Meghia is here's a quote from the Buddha. A monastic is ethical. Restrained in the monastic code. Conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules they've undertaken. When the heart's release is not ripe this is the second thing that can help it ripen. So pointing to ethics. And here Meghia is a monastic. He's the Buddha's attendant. Specifically talking about some of the monastic code, the Patimoka. We're not monastics. But we do have some training rules that can really be a big support for our practice. And I'd like to explore these and pike them a little bit today. But before I do that I want to talk a little bit more about this idea of what would the Buddha be recommending for a churras conduct being ethical to Meghia who's having a hard time meditating. He was assailed, he was beset, he was stopped. He was stopped by these thoughts of sensual desire, ill will and harming. We can imagine there's a number of different reasons why. Maybe one of them is building on what Brian was pointing to yesterday. That is, that's the support for when there's a pleasant or pleasurable this wholesome, pleasurable experience to allow that to be a support for practice. I think we all have this experience when we are in physical pain or in mental anguish. It's difficult to practice in a way that has a lot of openness and spaciousness. It's much easier to do that if we're not in discomfort. So the Buddha perhaps was pointing Meghia towards what we might say, the bliss of blamelessness. I think many of you have heard this expression. That is the power of not having regret, not having remorse. Probably you have the similar experiences I do. Oh my goodness, regret remorse is painful. It's one of those things that just really can haunt us in some kind of way and then show up in so many different ways. So the Buddha is encouraging Meghia to organize his life, to behave in such a way that he might experience this bliss of blamelessness. And this can be a tremendous support for our practice. Of course, not only our meditation practice, but just support for our life. If you want to make a distinction between our life and our meditation practice. So there's this collection and the suttas, and the suttas of these deities, devas, who come to the Buddha and they say a verse that maybe has one or two stanzas. And then the Buddha responds, either correcting the deity or adding something onto it or something like this. And they're kind of delightful. There's like these little conversations that are happening. And here's one that's pointing to this bliss of blamelessness. And this is the name of the person who was saying this is Kama. And it's probably not an accident that this name means safety. So this link between the following the precepts, doing the behaviors that are wholesome and helpful, provide safety. So somebody who's named is safety, the same this. It's not good to do a deed that plagues you later on, for which you weep and wail as its effect stays with you. Right? You cry at remorse. It is good to do a deed that doesn't plague you later on, that comforts and cheers as its effect stays with you. I think we all know this. It's just a reminder that, you know, everything that we do has consequences. Of course it does. And part of meditation is we start to see and experience and feel some of the earlier actions we've done in our life, whether it was before we sat down or as sometimes happens in retreats, something that happened decades ago, all of a sudden shows up. So can we make space for them? Can we honor and respect them? Recognize that these things arise. And then they're the nature also to pass away, if we can have some ease around them, some openness around them. But then Kama continues. And you have rearranged the stanzas just a little bit here, for this purpose here. But Kama says, "'Witless fools behave like their own worst enemies, doing wicked deeds that ripen as bitter fruit.'" So again, this idea of ripening. The Buddha is hoping that Magia can ripen with the heart's release or liberation of the mind, not as bitter fruit. But then getting back to this Kama and the Buddha and these fruits, verses. So the Buddha responds, or is saying, a wise one, but not proceed, thinking like the cart driver. So the Buddha is going to give an analogy, a simile. Sometimes similes can be really helpful, make illustrate in that particular way. So the Buddha continues, "'Suppose a cart driver leads the highway so even and well-compacted, they enter upon a rough road and fret when their axle breaks.' That is, somebody who is on a place, a well-worn path, well-trodden, and yet they want to take a detour, they want to take a shortcut. It'll be easier. That'll be easier. I'm going to go off this highway and enter upon a rough road and then fret when their axle breaks. Recognize, oh, that didn't go so well. Some of you may know that dukkha, one way that we can understand dukkha is the way that a wheel turns when the axle isn't quite right. So suffering happens. Whether it's extreme suffering, maybe it's a little bit of discomfort, we don't know. But I think what's being pointed to here is that the Buddha recognizes that these training rules, ones for the monastics, the ones for lay people, is a way to support us. It may not seem like it's the easiest way, or maybe at the moment it doesn't even seem like it's straightforward, but it is a path for greater and greater ease and freedom. So not only to have the absence of remorse, not only to have the bliss of blamelessness, but also it supports our path to freedom, ripening of the heart. The ripening of liberation of the mind and opening of the heart. More specifically, I'll say that our relationship to ethics matures along the path of practice. For example, early in practice, we may follow the rules, we may follow the precepts, simply because, well, those are the rules and that's our focus for ethics. Well, there's these five precepts, which I'll unpack a little bit in a moment here, but there are these precepts and I'm supposed to follow them, so I guess I'm going to. So there may be a certain sense of being duty bound or obligating. And certainly this was the case for me, but I first, when I learned about these precepts and was really getting involved with practice, I thought, okay, well, I was noticing how I could clean up my speech a little, but there's 10 little white lies here and there. So maybe you've heard me say this, but I was saying things like, oh, sorry, I'm late. The traffic was bad. The traffic wasn't bad. I was just disorganized and didn't know what to do. I was just disorganized and didn't get out the door on time, but I didn't want to take responsibility, right? This isn't a big, huge lie, right? It's just a little white lie. But when I decided to kind of clean up my language, I noticed what a big impact this had on me. Like, oh, I don't want to have to tell this little white lie. I'll be able to make it feel better organized. I need to think about the things I'm going to bring, what I need to do, and when's a good time to leave. And just before we had all Google maps, so to give myself extra time knowing when it was going to be there. And I just started to feel better. So this kind of like, this cascade that happens. So we might begin just with this idea, okay, I should follow these rules, but as we continue with practice, we discover how much our ethical life affects our inner life and our outer life. We notice that we're happier and generally more settled when we are behaving ethically. This way maybe our relationship to ethics might shift less from being duty bound and more to being something like, yeah, it's useful. It's actually useful to be ethical. And then as our practice matures, as we continue practicing, and of course it's not a perfect linear way this goes, but we might discover that we become more sensitive to suffering in ourselves and in others. And some ways we become more aware, we're able to make this distinction between the suffering quote unquote that leads to more suffering than the suffering quote unquote that leads to less suffering. Of course, I'm using this word suffering in such a wide range of meanings, but we can just be that subtle feeling like something's a little bit uncomfortable to just real torment. So we start to become like, oh yeah, maybe it's the pain and the subsequent regret of having behaved poorly, telling a lie that actually turns out to be harmful when somebody else discovers it or for whatever reason. And then we start to notice, yeah, we feel bad as we're contemplating telling this lie or we're practicing with ourselves. Often we have to tell that we have to rehearse it for ourselves super. And while we're doing it, and then after we feel bad, the harm that we've caused others, the suffering that leads to more suffering. We also become aware of the suffering that leads to less suffering. Maybe initially, it feels uncomfortable to rearrange our lives in such a way we don't, we no longer drink alcohol, for example, or intoxicants. Or we don't tell white lies or we don't harm the little ants in our kitchen. But it creates the conditions for a more meaningful experience to arise. And this thought exercise, thought experiment really inspires me. That is, just imagine, just imagine what this world would be like if everyone kept even just one precept. Like if everybody didn't lie. If everybody didn't kill, if everybody didn't take what was not given. Just this would be a completely new world order. So somehow I know this is grandiose and giant, but I find it touches me like, I want to be, I want to live in a world in which something like that is possible. So it's part of my following the precepts. But as our path continues to ripen, as we continue to practice, we may behave ethically just because it's the expression of an inner virtue. It's just the natural expression of this goodness, wholesomeness. This word sounds kind of corny, but it's like that. And then the end of the path, complete awakening. Is the absence of greed, hatred and delusion. And behaving unethically is the expression of greed, hatred and delusion. So there isn't any difference between awakening and behaving ethically. There's no longer greed, hatred and delusion to fuel the unethical behavior. So in this way, maybe the Buddha is talking to Meghia about being ethical, just recognizing that the path of ethical maturation, you might say, is also the path of spiritual maturation. I like this phrase that a girlfriend still uses. He says, sometimes we might think that ethics is kindergarten Buddhism. Oh, yeah. Okay. That's the beginning. I'm not an unethical person. I don't need that. But not really realizing how it's such an integral part of our practice. And that how ethics can be an expression of what's blossoming maybe in our hearts and minds with this practice. So one way that I talked about how kind of an ethical maturation goes with our spiritual maturation. But there's also a way in which we can practice with the precepts that really supports our maturation, our growth, our ripening. Maybe we can use this word. And that is to look at our relationship to the ethic to precepts, like noticing how does it feel? What is happening to us? What's our experience when we are considering maybe bending a precept a little bit or after we have broken one? And the meditation instructions on Monday morning, I talked about how we use the anchor. Sometimes we could put like as a stick in the water to see is this water moving? And then we see the wake and we can see, oh, yeah, the water is moving. And the same way the precepts can be kind of like a stick. And then we can see, oh, yeah, it's my behavior sometimes is wanting to go off of the highway. Getting back to this earlier analogy and want to take a detour. My Buddha is reminding us that the axle can break if we go on a detour. So this using our relationship with the precepts as a way for us to learn about ourselves, to learn about our practice, to learn what's going on with ourselves. But in order to do this, we also need to recognize that it takes time. It takes time between learning something about ourselves and changing our behavior. How many times do we need to do something and see the result before a change happens? It's not one time, usually it's not 10 times 100, 500,000, 5,000, I don't know, right? Different things, but it's a slow process. With this uncovering, this unfolding, this unwinding, dare I say maybe ripening, it's a slow process. So it requires some care. It requires some warmth and some kindness for ourselves. But it starts with this greater understanding. What is underneath our wanting to bend some of the precepts? I'm influenced with this by Joanna Hardy, another Dharma teacher who talked about this and I really appreciated her approach. So the first precept is to not kill, not harm others. But probably I'm guessing most of us are not murderers, of course. But why do people harm or kill others? They have fear, they want power, they want to be in control. Maybe for insects, killing insects, maybe it's just habitual to kill the ants or kill flies. For certain pests it might be to protect our family, to mice, mice, freeze. And sometimes the act of killing might be the wise thing to do. Mountain lion is mauling somebody. It might be the carrying thing to do, not for the mountain lion necessarily, but for the human. So for us to notice, when are we wanting to harm or kill some other beings? And we can also practice with this in our meditation. It's not necessarily about when are we harming other beings, but just noticing when does aversion come up? Maybe this wanting to get rid of something, just like get rid of it. Maybe when there's discomfort in the body, we want to do anything we can to make it go away. Is there a way that we can stay with the discomfort, with wisdom? Not in such a way that we get so tight and tangled up with it, but is there a way in that we can bring a certain more relaxation or ease for this with the experience? And if we do need to shift our posture, just bringing some mindfulness to the shifting of the posture. I'll say one of my stories about this is that, okay, so it was a new thing for me when ants came into the kitchen, like, okay, I guess I'm going to put cinnamon here and I can see where they're coming in through the window. I'm going to put cinnamon there and to block their path and going to brush them onto a little dust pan and take them outside. And at first I felt like I can't believe I'm doing this, but okay, here we go. And then, you know, ants don't go away right away, of course, right? And I started noticing, keeping my kitchen a little bit cleaner, doing the dishes afterwards, not just leaving them, you know, with the secret on the counter or something like this. And then that's kind of a season for ants to enter. My place went away, so I wasn't having ant issues anymore. But then I noticed a big spider in the bathroom. Before this would have been really scary for me, but then just to notice, oh, hello, Mr. Spider. Okay, you stay over there. I'm going to stay over here. I didn't become best friends with spiders. I still am a little bit uncomfortable around spiders, but I don't have this, like, aversion, like I want to harm them, get rid of them, eek scream running out the door kind of thing. So there's a way in which when we practice with these precepts that it helps to cultivate treating beings with kindness. So not harming creates the conditions in which the heart just naturally expresses more kindness care. And it creates this foundation for kindness and care for ourselves. This can grow into a reverence for life and caring for all beings everywhere. So the second precept to not take that which is not freely given, Adina, Donna, and the chanting we're doing in the morning. Why do people take that which is freely offered? Sometimes we might rationalize, oh, they won't notice. They won't mind. But in some ways, we're saying that what we do doesn't matter. Maybe it's true they wouldn't notice. Maybe it's true if we work in an office, they won't notice that we've taken some lots of post-it notes and pens or whatever it might be. But we know that we did that. And is there a way that we maybe we feel entitled or just for us just an exploration around that? Or maybe we have this strong sense of lack, like, I don't have enough. I need more. I don't have enough love. I don't have enough. Maybe we don't even know what it is. We just feel like we need more, more. So maybe we even have an addiction that overshadows any sense of proprietary or what we should do or shouldn't do. We just have to seek this addiction. But can we learn to be with this strong wanting? Can we learn to be with this strong desire? And of course, this shows up in our meditation. We often have this feeling, maybe it shows up in this one, like, well, if only X, if only the dog would stop barking next door, then it would be just right. And then I could meditate. Is there this way that we have this feeling like everything has to be very comfortable and all our desires have to be satisfied before we can settle down and be with our experience? And we can notice how fickle we can be with our desires. Okay, well, the dog is no longer barking. But now, if only the temperature weren't so hot or cold, or maybe I should get up and go get my sweater or take my sweater off or whatever it might be. So honoring this precept, whether it's in our meditation or in our daily life, cultivates this honesty, of course, and this respect for possessions of others. But it also kind of expands, it can grow into cultivating the concern for the environment and this appreciation maybe for this natural healing simplicity, this recognition that more, more, more is not better, better, better. So the third precept for this retreat, we're doing a brahmacarya to be refraining from sexuality, but in our daily lives, when we're not on retreat, why do people, why are they sometimes unwise with their sexuality? And I'm assuming that we're talking about sex between consenting adults. But is there maybe a sense of loneliness that we're trying to fill or trying to connect, but maybe we're not doing it in a way that's satisfying or appropriate that makes us behave inappropriately with our sexual energy. Or maybe we need some reassurance of our attractiveness, thinking that we only have value as long as we're attracted. And many of us want to live a life of love, of love in our life. We can just have this inquiry just the way we use our sexual energy support this. Support and honoring our commitments and our vows and honoring the commitments and vows of others. In terms of meditation, we might find ourselves having sexual fantasies or other pleasurable fantasies. And maybe there's a feeling like, okay, I deserve this. I've been meditating for how many hours today and I deserve to just be lost in this reverie or this fantasy. If you find yourself doing that, maybe you could check in. If there's a sense of that with meditation or can be, I use this expression of weight and neck clean. What I mean by that is holding on really tightly. And then we feel like it's exhausting and now I need to relax and reward myself for all that effort. Is there a way in which your meditation might have a little bit more ease or a little bit more spaciousness? I'll talk a little bit more about this later in the retreat, but just an invitation. One way to look at this is if when the bell rings at the end of a sit, do you find yourself going, oh, like what a relief. And that can be an indicator that there's a little bit extra holding on that isn't needed. And this is a practice. This is part of the art of practice to find out how much effort, but just notice your response when the bell rings. So our cultivating and honoring this third precept of our sexual, the way we use our sexual energy is to cultivate responsibility and cultivate commitment. And our marital relationships or our other interpersonal relationships, maybe allows our most intimate relationships to become real expressions of love and tenderness. The fourth precept is not lying. Morsa vada is the polyword that we're chanting in the mornings. We can expand that a little bit to write speech, which includes not lying, but also includes speech that is kind, timely and beneficial. And we might ask ourselves if we're wanting to tip the truth, stretch the truth a little bit. Is there, what's happening then? Is there a reason? Is it because we perhaps want to be liked? Or we want to increase our status in some way, or maybe we just want to get our way. Or maybe we don't know how to ask, or we feel incapable of asking for something directly. So we have to kind of lie and manipulate others to get what we need. Or maybe to hide something that we're ashamed of. This can be a place where we can learn a lot about ourselves. Speech is such a powerful part of practice and this definitely can be a journey. We might start to see how some of the way that we speak isn't the most direct, the most clean, the most helpful for ourselves or for others. But the invitation here is kind of a way to support our practice. Maybe I'll say that this had a big impact on me. That a friend of mine was cleaning out her closet and she had some clothes and thought, oh, maybe Diana would like these. She didn't want them or need them anymore. So she gave them to me and some of them were lovely and some of them I wasn't so sure about. So another friend of mine happened to be over and second friend, a Buddhist practitioner also and I wanted to ask her opinion. So I put on some of these pants and I said, oh, I'm not sure. What do you think about these? And my friend said, it's a lovely top you're wearing. I said, no, no, not the top, the pants. What do you think of these pants? My friend responded, you know, the color of your top is really a nice color for you. Like, oh, I get it. I get it. This is my friend. She knew, she didn't know exactly in the moment what to say. Actually Diana, those pants. And I have to say, I felt so much love for my friend. Like, she's trying to take care of me in such a nice way and she's trying to take care of her speech and I don't know, I just felt this such an intimacy with her. I felt like, oh, what a beautiful thing. I don't know, just even now thinking about it, I thought, what a caring, loving thing that she was doing for me. So is there a way that we can have our speech, you know, just we have this emphasis on not lying, but of course we don't want to be sane to everybody. Well, actually, it was awful. Don't ever leave the house wearing those. If I don't, I'm not even sure if we should wear them. We shouldn't, is there a way in which our speech can be helpful for others? And of course, in meditation, to look at the speech that we have for ourselves. To say the tone of voice, the words we use, and to, here's another opportunity for a lot of kindness. This is what, chances are it's been a lifetime of speaking to ourselves in one way. Maybe some ways it's really supportive and other ways it isn't. And can we bring some kindness to this when we notice, oh yeah, I have this habit of this inner critic getting really loud. And just to, it's best we can to notice, sometimes the voice that's inside can sound so authoritative. It feels like, well, this is the truth. And so it might not be until some, lots of meditation experience and having the mind quiet down, that we start to realize, oh no, there's another way we don't, that the inner voice can be. But this, cultivating this commitment to truth and kindness in our speech, cultivates just a commitment to truth and dealing with others, standing by the truth and in the bigger picture, it always ends up being like something that we can really stand behind. This will be a tremendous boon for our lives to know, like, okay, I don't, I don't have any lies, I don't have any secrets. This also, this commitment to the truth can help deepens our voice so that we can speak for compassion, so that we can speak for understanding and that we can speak for justice. The world needs this. So is there a way that we can have this commitment to speech that is supportive? It's true, but also kind and beneficial and timely. And then the fifth precept about not using intoxicants, you might ask, well, why do people use intoxicants? Obvious ones are like alcohol or drugs. But there are lots of other ones that we use to check out, to numb out, to push aside. We might use food, shopping, surfing the internet, watching YouTube videos, working, some of these things that we might do to like disconnect from ourselves or disconnect from our experience. We don't want to be mindful anymore. There's nothing inherently bad or harmful about these things. And to be sure, sometimes watching a movie is like a great way that can help the nervous system to reset and calm down or have to bring in some ease or might be some way that's the wise thing to do. But there might also be a way in which we're using them to disconnect from our life, from our experience. Is there something we're trying to avoid? Are we procrastinating? Are we trying to avoid responsibility? So we can notice if we feel like there's some ways we want to check out just some gentle inquiry into this. Again with kindness, warmth and care. And then in meditation, we might explore how this shows up this way, which we check out fantasies I mentioned earlier, but maybe it's the planning, planning, planning or complaining. Or maybe we feel bored because things have quieted down a little bit and we just want to be entertained, stimulated in some ways. But our commitment to the fifth precept, this helps us to cultivate this heatfulness, this way in which that we have this maybe a sobriety, both literally and figuratively and that we can develop this intention to live in the most awake and conscious manner and in all circumstances cultivate our intention to be present for our lives. So the second thing that the Buddha tells Meghia that can bring us support can help ripen the arts release or the liberation of the mind is being ethical. Buddhism in the monastic is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. In danger in this light is fault, they keep the rules they've undertaken. When the heart's release is not right, this is the second thing that can help it ripen. So thank you. Thank you for your practice. Thank you for your attention.
