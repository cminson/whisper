 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So today I continue the discussion about the Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness. And there are five different areas to attend to in this foundation. Yesterday I talked about the hindrances, the five hindrances. Today will be what's called the five aggregates. Tomorrow the six sense doors, then the seven factors of awakening, and then the four noble truths. So all these wonderful lists. And there's a progression through them. And the progression from yesterday is that the hindrances are, you think of them as kind of the, what keeps us distracted in the world of desires and aversions, in our relationship to pleasure and pain and things of the world. The alternative word for essential pleasure, the first one, that Pears Nisutta, is another same list, but with the word instead of essential pleasures is avariciousness. So wanting to acquire, especially things of other people, or acquire things. So it has a lot to do with our relationship to things and desires and pleasures. And kind of you think of it a little bit, that, you know, kind of what the self can get, what the self cannot get, what the self wants and doesn't want. When that kind of desire settles down and quiets, then we're more present for ourselves. We then at some point encounter the next layer of attachment, this layer of preoccupation that interferes with the deeper settling into peace. And that has to do around me, myself and mine, self concern, identification. Where we take different parts of our psychophysical being and we hold on to that, or we assume or conceive of that as being, this is mine, this is me, and this is my true self. And so something as simple as seemingly innocent as saying, you know, this is my hand. Now I've appropriated it as being mine, and in some sense it is, but when I say my, my hand, then it's associated with me. And maybe I think my hand is the best hand in the world, or the worst kind of hand in the world. And so here I am holding it up in front of all of you, and if I'm attached to this as my hand, then I could be either completely proud of showing it off or completely miserable that you're seeing this thing that's of mine. And so the idea of my hand can be innocent, but it can come along with a lot of baggage. That baggage is called selfing. Or it could be that rather than, it's me, the hand is me. And so if someone brushes against it in a hard way, they're kind of offending me, because the hand is me. And so we're taking what's innocent enough and assuming that this represents me as a person. Or I take my hand as being my true self. That's the essence of who I am, handness. And I'm ready to argue with anyone, or I'm ready to insist that this is my handness, and I'll protect my hand at all costs. I don't want it to die or get old, because that's essentially who I am. So maybe that's a silly example, but I'm hoping that you can apply this to yourself. There's this action of selfing, in extreme forms it takes the word, the form of conceit, very strong attachment to self, it has a lot to do with identification, not identifying who we are, if we're some simple way, a man, a woman, neither man or woman, trans, gender non-conforming, all kinds of other options. But if there's a way of kind of leaning into it too much, holding onto it, and clinging and holding tight, in such a way that as the vagers of life encounter us, that it either challenges that heap attachment or reinforces it, and so there's selfing going on. So in the Buddha's teaching, the idea is to be sensitive to the contraction or the stickiness, or the resistance or the pushingness, the neediness that seems to be related to this idea of self. And it can be experienced very simply as sometimes as a kind of contraction, tightness, inner pressure, it can be experienced as a wanting, as a not wanting, it can be experienced as ideas that we swirl around in. And a lot of these selfing does in fact have to do with ideas and concepts we live in, sometimes so deep that we don't even see we're doing them. For example, if you come to a place where there's chairs, and there's lots of chairs to sit in, and lots of empty chairs, and maybe you're waiting at the doctor's office or something, and then you have to go to the bathroom. So you've been sitting in one chair for a long wait to see the doctor, and then you have to go to the bathroom, and you go to the bathroom, you come back, and lo and behold, someone's sitting in the same chair that you were sitting in. And the initial reaction is, how could he be sitting in my chair? And there's identification with the chair and me that might arouse anger that the person's sitting in it while there's lots of other chairs around. And so this can happen in all kinds of small ways throughout the day. And so to begin being sensitive to this movement of selfing, that's possible where we're no longer caught up in the more coarser surface desires of wanting and not wanting, and the confusion that comes from that, the hindrances. And the very interesting, what the Buddha wants us to do is to recognize in our simplest forms of experience the five different ways, five different kind of foundations for what he thinks is constructing a self. Sometimes it's the body, the form. Sometimes it's based on our feelings. Sometimes it's based on our ideas of things, our concepts. It's called Perceptions in English, the third aggregate. And sometimes that's to do with the stories we make up, the impulses, the intentions, the motivations, the opinions we have, the fourth aggregate. And the fifth one is consciousness, the idea that we can be aware, that we can know. Some people very strongly associate that with a feeling almost of em-ness, I am. And of course that's who I am. So these are different areas that people sometimes focus on in the construction of identity, in the construction of self, in the preoccupation of self. And you might spend, do it as an exercise, maybe today, maybe a period of time on each one, each of these five aggregates, and see how much self-concern is there around your body, what you look like, bodily pleasure and displeasure. How much preoccupation and selfing is connected to how you feel, your feelings. And you're feeling happy or sad, all kinds of ways. And how much of preoccupation and selfing, self-concern about my opinions, my history, my story, my biography, my plans, my desires. And it's a whole kind of inner world of the world that we construct with our mind. And then consciousness. These are the five aggregates. So this is where the Buddha wants us to look. But he wants us to look and see this for a particular reason. Not to negotiate, not to abandon it, not to let go of it even, not to make a problem out of it, but to see it clearly. And to see it this way. To be quiet enough to see that each of these five areas, when we don't cling to them too much or don't overlay our ideas on it too much or our preoccupation, can be experienced as something which is flowing, something that's arising and passing, something that appears and disappears, something that's very inconstant, changing, fluxing, moving. And it's kind of like a river of our life, our being is a river of changing sensations, experiences, thoughts, emotions. And the idea is to relax into that river and float or be massaged by it or settled in. And attachment to self and selfing is like taking a bucket of that water out and sometimes freezing it and saving it for the future. But it's no longer the river. And so the idea is not so much to attack or feel upset about the selfing that goes on, but rather to look more deeply and see that underneath these self-concerns, can we notice how it takes us out of the flow of life, the movement of the present moment. If the present moment is a river, notice how it takes us out through retrospective thinking, through fantasy, through being caught up in conversations in our head and such things. So the five areas is the body, feelings, the basic simple concepts, ideas that we live by. The fourth one is the stories we live by, the more complicated constructions, mental constructions about our lives and motivations. And the fifth is consciousness. And you don't necessarily have to remember them all, but you might become sensitive to how much selfing goes on. I think for many people, a primary subject of main character, much of their thinking, and what fuels their thinking is the self, is me, myself and mine. We're kind of either center stage or somehow important in the thoughts, the concerns we have. And just watching the thought stream and recognizing how much self is in there and selfing and ideas of self is a fascinating study. But to do this as this mindfulness exercise is to try to see it as selfing, but see it as a reification, a solidification of the ongoing river of life that we live in. And in doing so, start experiencing some freedom, some independence from those attachment to self. So thank you. And I realize this week is a bit of a whirlwind tour of these five different areas for the fourth foundation. But maybe at all plates it's useful to have a general sense, those of you who don't know, of this very important part of mindfulness practice. And maybe some other time we can go in some more depth with each of them. So thank you all very much.
