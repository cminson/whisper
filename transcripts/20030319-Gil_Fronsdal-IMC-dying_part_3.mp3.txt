 The first chant is the homage to the Buddha and the refuges and the precepts, going for refuge and taking the precepts. And aside for their appropriateness around the time of death, these refuges and the precepts are done at any point where a Buddhist might feel a need to recommit or be reminded or plunge into the deepest orientation, the deepest understanding, the deepest protection that they know. So sometimes in times of crisis and difficulty, when people come to a Buddhist temple, one of the first things they do is chant these. So for now just listen as I do it. Namo Tasa Bhagavatu Arattu Samma Sambuddhasa Pudam Saranam Gacchami Dhamma Sarnam Gacchami Sangham Sarnam Gacchami Dhamma Sarnam Gacchami Dhamma Sarnam Gacchami Dhamma Sarnam Gacchami Dhamma Sarnam Gacchami Dhamma Sarnam Gacchami Dhamma Sarnam Gacchami Parnati Pada Veda Mani Sika Padaam Samadhiyami Arinada Nava Veda Mani Sika Padaam Samadhiyami Musa Vada Veda Mani Sika Padaam Samadhiyami Kame Su Mi Chachara Veda Mani Sika Padaam Samadhiyami Sura Miryam Maja Pama Datta Nava Veda Mani Sika Padaam Samadhiyami I undertake the training of not killing. I undertake the training of not taking what is not given. I undertake the training of not lying. I undertake the training of not misusing sexuality. I undertake the training to abstain from using mind altering substances or activities. This is what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace. Let them be able and upright, straightforward and gentle in speech, humble and not conceited, contented and easily satisfied, unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways, peaceful and calm and wise and skillful, not proud and demanding in nature. Let them not do the slightest thing that the wise would later reprove, wishing in gladness and in safety. May all beings be at ease. With ever living beings there may be, whether they are weak or strong, omitting none, the great or the mighty, medium, short or small, the seen and the unseen, those living near and far away, those born and to be born. May all beings be at ease. Let none deceive another or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life, her child, her only child, so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings, radiating kindness over the entire world, spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths, outwards and unbounded, freed from hate and ill will, whether standing or walking, seated or lying down, free from drowsiness, one should sustain this recollection. This is said to be the sublime abiding by not holding to fixed use. The pure hearted one, having clarity of vision, being freed from all sense desires, is not born again into this world. The next one is adopted from the Tibetan book of the dead. It was adopted by the Pasna teachers in the 1980s, 1980s, to be used to help people in their dying, to be read while they're dying. Remember the clear light, the pure, clear white light from which everything in the universe comes, to which everything in the universe returns, the original nature of your own mind, the natural state of the universe unmanifest. Let go into the clear light, trust it, merge with it, it is your own nature, it is home. The visions you experience exist within your consciousness. The forms they take are determined by your past attachments, your past desires, your past fears, your past karma. These visions and thoughts have no reality outside your consciousness. No matter how frightening some of them may seem, they cannot hurt you. Just watch them pass through your consciousness. They will all pass in time. No need to become involved with them, no need to become attracted to the beautiful visions, no need to be repulsed by the frightening ones, no need to be seduced or excited by the sexual ones, no need to be attached to them at all. Just let them pass. If you become involved with these visions, you may have to wonder for a long time confused. Just let them pass through your consciousness like the clouds passing through an empty sky. Fundamentally, they have no more reality than this. Remember these teachings. Remember the clear light, the pure bright shining white light of your own nature. It is deathless. If you can look into the visions, you can experience and recognize that they are composed of the same pure clear white light as everything else in the universe. No matter where or how far you wander, the light is only a split second, a half breath away. It is never too late to recognize the clear light. In another passage that's sometimes read, it comes from the Zen tradition. The way is perfect like vast space where there's no lack and no access. Awakening is to go beyond both emptiness as well as form. All changes in this empty world seem real because of ignorance. The great way is without limit beyond the easy and the hard. Just let go now of the clinging mind and all things are just as they are. In essence, nothing goes or stays. To seek great mind with a thinking mind is certainly a grave mistake. If mind does not discriminate, all things are as they are as one. When all is seen with a mind of equality, we return to our most intimate nature. When the mind is fully with the way, all ego-centered striving sees. Doubts and confusion disappear and so true faith pervades our life. There's no thing that clings to us, nothing that is left behind. In this true world of emptiness, both self and other are no more. The way is beyond all space, all time. One instant in 10,000 years, one instant is 10,000 years. Not only here, not only elsewhere. Truth is right before your very eyes. One thing is all, all things are one. Know this and all is whole and complete. When faith and the mind are not separate, this very reality is beyond all words, all thought. For here there's no yesterday, no tomorrow and no today. The final one I'll read is a kind of a dedication of merit, a sharing of blessings, it's sometimes called. A very important part of Buddhist practice is sharing one's blessings, one benefits, one's merit. This is often done for a person as they're dying to thrive in their mind, to make them rejoice and be happy in their blessings. It's also done after a person has died, both for the person who's died, for their benefit if they can hear it, but also for the benefit of those people, anybody who hears it, to the memorial service or a funeral. Through the goodness that arises from my practice, may my spiritual teachers and guides of great virtue, my mother, my father, and my relatives, the sun and the moon and all virtuous leaders of the world, may the highest gods and evil forces, celestial beings, guardian spirits of the earth and the lord of death, may those who are friendly, indifferent, or hostile, may all beings receive the blessings of my life. May they soon attain the threefold bliss and realize the deathless. Through the goodness that arises from my practice and through this act of sharing, may all desires and attachments quickly cease and all harmful states of mind until I realize nirvana. In every kind of birth may I have an upright mind with mindfulness and wisdom, austerity and vigor. May the forces of delusion not take hold nor weaken my resolve. The Buddha is my excellent refuge. Unsurpassed is the protection of the Dhamma. The solitary Buddha is my noble lord, the Sangha, my supreme support. Through the supreme power of all these, may darkness and delusion be dispelled. And then finally, a very short chant which is sometimes called the Theravada funeral chant because it's very intimately connected to funerals, memorial services, but it's actually chanted in many different occasions, great happy occasions, all occasions. It's a very, very central and important chant. All conditioned things are impermanent. They have the nature of arising and passing away. Those who see deeply, those who realize deeply, the calming, the peace of these formations, these conditioned phenomena, who find happiness. So those are resources that are available for people as they're dying and after they're they're dead. Things that I use when I go visit people who are dying are people who are dead. And there are also resources that can be used, things that are chanted and said also in times like tonight. And I don't know if all of you had your radio on when you were coming over here today, but I didn't know this until I turned my radio on. It's quarter after seven to come down here in my car. And I heard President Bush basically announced that the war had started. So it just that's, you know, we find ourselves. And it seems a little bit odd to be talking about anything else relating to anything else given what's happened. We will have the gathering tomorrow evening at seven in order to somehow hold the war and the beginning of the war as a community. And Monday night we talked about this and very clearly we said we should continue with the class. Some people said we should continue the class if war was declared because the class seems important. The person who was most local about the importance of continuing the class is not here tonight. And so who knows what that is about. And so what do you all feel? Like doing you want to just continue venture forth and finish the class or would you like to do something different since venture forth. And somehow it does seem appropriate enough talking about death. I always respond to death. How are we with death? So as we did last week, if you don't mind, I'd very much appreciate it if you'd all especially the chairs most all of you for a little bit. You come closer. So for my sake I feel more connected to you all. Also the center here will be open all day tomorrow starting at seven a.m. and just be here open. Someone will always be here during the day. It'll be open if you just want to come and sit. A lot of centers of faith centers churches and synagogues and mosques and stuff there open their doors now with the fact that the war has started to mark the beginning to bring people together. And so that's something you'd like to do tomorrow. You know that the place is open and come and sit and meditate. In the evening we'll have our gathering as a community, bigger gathering. Now in terms of the class, one thing that building on what we talked about a little bit last week and the week before, into the preparing for one's death, maybe perhaps well before you're here, you know, death seems to be in sight. There are all kinds of resources, a lot of resources out there, a lot of books on the whole topic of death and dying and a lot of places you can get support. And it's very easy to find now these kinds of things much more than it was 25 years ago. But there's this book called the beneficiary, beneficiary book, which is a was put together as a way of helping people prepare for all the kind of legal, financial, medical things you want to have well thought out ahead of time. And the book's very interesting because it's mostly, as you might understand from the description, it's a whole bunch of questions that you want to answer. So rather than telling you and giving you what's what, just ask all these questions. You have to kind of, I guess, find out for yourself. And some of them I imagine are pretty practical and straightforward, you know, with your bank account number. And others are probably much more you know, soul searching, you know, deep questions about what would you like at that point, that, you know, as you're dying or after you're after you're dead. So there's this order form for here. And so if you want to look at this at least or order it, it should be very interesting, I think, to do that. So last week, we came up to the point of someone dying. And then the question is, what do you do after that? So if you're someone who's around to take care of someone who's died, what do you do in a Buddhist tradition for someone who's died? And if you ask what is the Buddhist thing to do, there are so many different Buddhists that there's so many different possibilities of what you can do. And then even within Theravada Buddhism itself, there's various things that people do with the body afterwards. Sometimes the body is whisked off very quickly. And as quickly as they can, they bury the body or cremate the body. And sometimes the body is left in state for a long time. You leave it alone for a long time. And if it's some very important person in Thailand, they might leave the body in state for as much as a year. There's all kinds of reasons why they might leave the body kind of someplace without doing anything, without burying, without doing any final thing with the body. There's all kinds of things to do. And the Buddha didn't actually give any instructions for how to take care of. He gave instructions for how to take care of his dead body. But he very clearly used the model of a great emperor, treat his body like a great emperor. At least that's what the records say. And so most of us are not great emperors. So it's not really appropriate, that kind of burial. So besides that, there's no instructions. And what's happened historically, and apologies if I said this last time, is that as Buddhism has gone through the different cultures of Asia, Buddhism has assimilated or adopted many of the local customs around death and dying, as it seemed appropriate, as it seemed helpful. And did I say this last time? Did I explain this? Do you remember? I think that's right. I said this. Okay. Sometimes I talk so much, it's hard to know what I said, where, when and how. I apologize. And so, you know, adopted different practices that are useful from different cultures in different cultures. So different cultures have different worldviews, different understandings of what a self is, and different understandings of what it means to be in relationship to other people. And so they have different rituals and practices because of who they are. And that means that for us also, we're unique, Western psyche is its own kind of psyche, or there's many psyches, depending on the background we have, families, ethnic, religious, whatever. And so different things, different rituals, different ways of doing it. If you're Irish, you know, it might be the best thing you could do is you get a massage table and put the body out there on the sidewalk and bring out the bear and have a party, which is what they do sometimes. I've been told, I haven't seen that in Ireland myself, but I've been told that it's quite interesting. You know, very, and, you know, if you're other traditions, it's very sober and somber, many different ways of doing it. And did I tell a story here last Friday, last Wednesday about the Amazon rivers where I went? I mean, I consider it on Fridays, right? On Friday. So people are Friday. You didn't hear last Wednesday. So it's an example of some of the customs, how different they can be. It's not a Buddhist one, but many years ago, I had the opportunity to go sailing up one of the tributaries or not tributary, I guess, but one of the side rivers, side shoots of the Amazon in French Guiana and the kind of away from the Atlantic, the French Guiana is quite protected. The Native Americans, the Indians who live there and the cultures are quite undisturbed for the most part. And we went to a place with mostly so-called, you know, certainly people from America, so-called civilized people don't usually go. And there we found people called the Boney and they're actually Africans who are enslaved and brought to South America, I think to Suriname by the Dutch. And then they escaped in the first generation. So the people who had been captured in Africa, they escaped from slavery. And so all their culture was intact in their heads. And they went into the jungles and stayed there for two, three hundred years. And in some ways, they're more African than some of the people nowadays in Africa because they were so isolated like an island. And we came into this little village where this woman had died maybe that day. And we came just when they were building her coffin and we could watch the big coffin being built around her body. And we explained that that evening, it was going to be festivities, funeral festivities. So we stayed around. And when nightfall came, they were going to carry the coffin with this woman into this ceremonial hall or I don't know, ceremonial dance hall, this hall, kind of center of the village that had no walls, just had thatched roof and posts holding it up. But there was an entryway and there were six men carrying the coffin. And then they came to the entryway to this hall. There was a man blocking the way. And when they tried to enter with a coffin, he started pushing the coffin away and beating on it and yelling at it. As far as like the way the sound of the language was, he was cursing at this coffin, banging at and pushing it away, refusing and letting it in. This went on for a while. And then suddenly he stopped. And then he took the place of one of the other coffin bearers. And the other coffin bearer came and took his place and did the same thing, prevented the coffin from entering a ceremonial place. And so finally, and finally, there was enough of that and they let the coffin in. And then they had this party, music and dancing all through the night. And the coffin was just right there as part of it. And I asked, you know, what was that about? And the explanation was that the men carrying a coffin, some of the older men in the village, they'd known this woman all her life. She was an old woman when she died. And they had a score to settle with her. They had things to say, you know, and before that she could be laid to rest, before they can kind of celebrate and have the festivities, you know, around her death, their life. They had to, you know, they had to get it off their chest and tell her, you know, what that be said. So, you know, all these different customs and different cultures have different things which are useful. The Buddhist contribution to this is pointing to what is spiritually most helpful. And what's most helpful is that which helps people become released from any kind of holding in their hearts and their minds, their clinging. So what is it that's most helpful for that process is the Buddhist question. And in different cultures, there'll be different answers for that. So there shouldn't be under the assumption that the proper right Buddhist way to do it. There are very straight, you know, in true Buddhist things that you can do, and which is beautiful to do. And some of you might want to do it that way, but you don't have to feel like this is the way it has to be. You're actually quite welcome to design your own. To design your own funeral if you want. And then it's easier for the people who survive to know what to do. Or if one of your loved ones has died, you know, you don't have to, you can kind of, you know, find out, kind of figure out what's best for you. Sometimes it's very hard to figure out on your own, especially if you don't have any background in this kind of event. And then, you know, you can come to me or some other teacher or some other person who knows about these things and can help with the design or can decide themselves what's most useful. So after a person has died, and after you feel, you know, the person has died, as I said last week, there's some ambiguity in Buddhism or ambiguity in life and when death actually occurs. And so the idea that it actually occurs with the final breath, maybe it's not so. And maybe a person continues for a while and some, you know, there are meditative states where a person stops breathing. And so, you know, it's just end of breath, sign that consciousness is left or we don't know. So it's best to kind of sense or feel your way into this, the presence of the person in case, you know, you have sensed the person still there beyond the final breath. You want to stay peaceful and calm in the room the best you can. If there's a lot of, if you feel like you won't have to cry or grieve a lot, it's the suggestion in Buddhism is you actually quietly leave the room so you can keep the room peaceful and calm for they have to help that person who's dying or in the process of dying or die dead. And at some point you might feel, you know, the presence, the consciousness, the life force or something is gone. At that point, there are various views about, you know, it is a little bit hard for me to talk about because, you know, do I represent just myself or do I here to represent the Buddhist tradition? And if I represent the Buddhist tradition, then how do I hold the different views? You know, and I know so much. One of the problems with people who study a lot is it's hard to, you know, know what's true. You know, if what you're learning is just from texts and teachers and stuff, because, you know, there's different teachers say different things and different texts say different things. And so if you want to be a fundamentalist, you don't want to go shopping around. You know, stay with one thing. So it's a little bit hard, you know, so I thought a little bit hard for you to know how to talk about all this. Now, one of the interesting aspects of that Buddhist theory of rebirth is that there's that you can look at it from at least three different perspectives that all amount to probably doing basically the same thing to the practices, how you actually the practices and the ways you'd relate to death and someone is dying would be the same regardless in which way you hold Buddhist teaching of rebirth. So the first way is that it's literally true. And a lot of most Buddhists believe that. It's very clear. The second is that it's really a metaphoric way of talking about life and death that happens moment by moment. Which I talked about, I think, the first night. And the third way, which I didn't talk about, is that the whole idea, whole description of rebirth in Buddhism is mythological language. It's a psychomythic language, meaning that it speaks to some deep aspects of our psyche that responds to ritual and to myths and to those kinds of stories. And it sometimes gets underneath the radar of our conscious rational mind. And this, you know, something as profound as death, you know, affects the mind in deep, deep subconscious ways in our relationship to it. And occasionally, maybe not occasionally, many times, the rational approach is not going to get into what's really going on in the psyche. And sometimes the mythic descriptions, the mythic rituals, they might not be literally true, but they address that part of the mind which responds to myths, informs it and changes it and heals it and things like that. So how do you treat someone after they've died? There's one belief that as long as the body is still around, the being who has departed in some form or other is still around you in the mystery in the vicinity, somehow present somehow is able to tune in. The person might not choose to tune in, but that capacity to tune in is still there, in which case you would speak to it still and relate to it. And as if, you know, they can hear you and say things that are helpful. Another view is that in Theravada Buddhism is that once a death has finally occurred, the final moment of death, that then that life force or the consciousness or whatever it is departs immediately and instantly is reborn someplace else. And so that body then, you know, it just, it's a body. It just, you know, it's an adamant object at this point. And you want to treat it respectfully in memory of the person. But there's no need to be particularly concerned about how you handle the body vis-a-vis what it's going to do for the person who's passed away and died. So there's these two different views. And what are you going to do about those two views? If you share any of those views, I think it's a really intuitive, a very personal thing. And so, but in both cases, whether you want to, it comes from almost the same, what you would do. So one of the first things that happens is that you would, in a Buddhist tradition, you would do, again, some of these readings. You would probably, minimum would be, you take refuge, go for refuge with the idea you're doing it for the person, the idea the person can hear it and then be inspired and helped. And you would do the precepts, which are so centrally important to healthy karma. And maybe you'd read some of the other things. And if it's not helpful for the person's departed because they can't tune in, then it certainly is going to be helpful for those people who are left here, who are present. So it's a useful thing to do. Having a ritual, having some chanting to do helps stabilize everybody in the room, helps create a sense of calm or concentration or presence or stability in the room. And it's very helpful, the Buddhist view is it's very helpful to maintain that peaceful calm stability in the room after someone has died. And so chanting is one of those ways, reading is some of those ways to do that. So, so, so we can't always be sure where, who's getting the benefit, but it's a very beneficial thing to do. A very particular Buddhist thing that's done at various points, it can be done right after the body, the person has died, and it can be done later also as we go along, is the ritual washing of the body. Now, practically, it's often very useful to wash the body. And sometimes hospice workers will do it for you, a person or nurses will do it for you, because sometimes there's all kinds of body fluids that get released with the death. And it's nice to clean it up so that it doesn't smell too badly. But some people find it very helpful to do the washing of the body as kind of a ritual. It can be a very loving thing to do. You know, you students, the last time you're going to be with someone, you're going to massage them, wash them, maybe you wash them with usually with yogi tea, some kind of scented tea or something. Sometimes people put something in it. A little bit, I don't know what it is. I don't remember right now what they put in it. Maybe some of you know something that helps close the pores. And so that helps slow down the decay process or the smelling process that might happen. But you wash the body. And there's various other things you might do practically like putting cotton in some of the orifices so it doesn't, things don't continue coming out. And in some traditions, it's the women who do the washing. And nowadays, making those kinds of distinctions with men's work and women's work is sometimes not appreciated. But sometimes it might still be appropriate. And I'm not one to judge if someone wants to say it's appropriate for the women to do it, not the men. In that circumstance, you know, I'm not going to you know, go for it. Or the ritual washing of the body and perhaps doing it with candles, flowers, sometimes it's very nice after a person has died to virtually place flowers around the person, maybe on the chest, the flower in the chest, there's some flowers around the head, has some flowers lit and to create kind of a sacred environment for everyone who's going to be there. And people will come. And it's another time to say goodbye to a person. When you're washing the body or after the person's died, say another kind of farewell. Hopefully you've had a chance to do that before the person's died kind of farewell. That's often very nice to do it afterwards. It can also be very nice to do that as part of the memorial service. And address the actual person, have a photograph of the person, have the ashes there if you have ashes, or have the body there if you have, and then it's more of a funeral, I guess, but actually address the person. Say goodbye or say what needs to be said. So it can be actual washing or it can be a ritual washing. And the ritual washing in Theravada Buddhism entails pouring water over the person's hand. So you'd have a bowl perhaps under the hand. You hold the hand over the side of the bed and you pour water over it. And part of what the tradition is, is as you're washing the hand, you're also asking the person for forgiveness. So part of the saying goodbye is asking the person for forgiveness for any ways that you might have harmed them. And I suppose then also offering forgiveness for any ways they might have harmed you. There is a tradition of sitting and meditating with a body. And I've done that with bodies. At the Zen Center, they usually would keep bodies for three days. In Theravada Buddhism, there is no particular idea of how long to keep the body. And it'd be nice, it'd be very nice to get the really straight answer for me. This is the way you do it. This is the truth. This is the, you know, but I'm not capable of doing that because I don't know some of these answers, you know, in terms of this is the way it is. But there's a custom and I find that very, for some people, it's very beneficial. It's very profound. And it feels very helpful for all concerned to sit and just meditate with the body, have the body there. And sometimes people have, will take turns, take shifts so that someone's always there sitting with the body. And some people don't care for that so much. It's just enough and they leave the body there and maybe they'll go to sleep and leave the body alone at night. And then the next morning they'd be with the body a little bit. Some people like to sit near the body and just quietly reminisce about the person who's passed away. And I've seen that be quite nice thing for people to do. But the particular Buddhist things is these very simple rituals, the washing of the hand, the chanting, the reading, and the meditating with the body. And sometimes the meditation is done. There's all kinds of meditations you can do, but I find it's very helpful when I'm around a dead body. One thing I would tend to do is two meditations. I do loving kindness meditation and I do choiceless awareness meditation. And choiceless awareness is the meditations. It's kind of like, choiceless awareness is the awareness where you're not choosing any particular place to concentrate your mind, but you're open freely to be attentive to whatever comes, whatever comes to your door, your sense door, any sense doors. And to me it seems very appropriate to do that after a person's passed away because I'm kind of like making myself an open receptacle to receive whatever might be there still, the presence of the person, the communication, the sense, the intuitive sense of what's happening in the room, the sense of what's happening with the people who are still there. It seems appropriate to have this choiceless awareness of just tuning in. And sometimes I'll do this meditation without closing my eyes because it seems very part of it then is keeping the eyes open because sometimes I'll just kind of be there and kind of just do this meditation where part of it is just looking around the room, kind of taking it in because I'm going to have some feeling of just taking what's there, all my senses and trying to tune in the best I can. And from my own sense, with the idea that the more that I can be in a state of non-clinging and at the same time as choiceless awareness is tuning in to what's there, that that is helpful for the overall environment. That's helpful for, hopefully also for the person who's passed away, to somehow that there's a resonance that might be there. So if I get invited to someone's home, to one of your homes because one of your people has died and it seems like this is what's appropriate to do, that's one of the things you can expect me to do is I'll probably sit there for a while very quietly and just be with what's there. Can I ask a question? Yes, please. Can you say if you read a loving kindness meditation? Yeah. So can we kind of give other people a favor of what phrase you would use towards the department person? Always. How do you use it towards the people who are left behind or both? Usually it's mostly to the person who's departed at that point. And what kind of phrases would you use? Usually the normal phrases. Sometimes, you know, may you be happy, may you be safe, may you be healthy. The person's, you know, somewhere, you know, in wherever you are. May you be at ease. And sometimes I might use kind of just spontaneous things that might arise. So then the question is, so then there's various things that are done with the body. You know, I'm keeping it for a while. Some people don't want that. Don't feel comfortable with it. Feel comfortable with it. And it's fine to get the more cherry service to come and get the body right away than that case or other services. I have a kind of a, I suppose it's a bias, to be honest, but a bias that, I have a bias that the Buddhist way is that all the stuff should happen as simply as possible. So that if, so not elaborate funerals, not elaborate memorial services, not elaborate caskets, not elaborate, you know, that it should be simple, kind of straightforward and kind of like, you know, Quaker style, maybe I imagine Quakers are simple and down to earth. And that's my bias. And there's no particular reason for that. And, you know, beyond my own view of the spiritual life. And certainly lots of Buddhists will have quite elaborate funerals. But I think they are doing simply. And so learning a little bit how to do that, you know, learning, you don't have to use a mortuary service at all, for example, and learning how you don't have to, you know, you can really get the cheapest possible casket. You can actually get a coffin, you can get the cardboard. That's legal. They have cardboard coffins that are the cheapest things you can get. There's a general assumption, a view that the Buddhist way of handling the body is to cremate it. And I think that's because it's very common in some Buddhist cultures to cremate a body. But there's no particular Buddhist way to do, thing to do at this point. There are plenty of ways to do that. There are plenty of Buddhists around the world who bury their dead. There's plenty of Buddhists who probably the majority burn, I suppose. But there's also what's called sky burials, where you, I guess even Tibet, I haven't heard of anywhere else, but they leave the body up on the clifftops to be eaten by the vultures. And the water burials, where you throw the body into the water, and which I guess there's no water bodies here, you can do that in, but in the Ganges, you can do that. And when you go out in Varanasi in a boat, you have these bodies that float by. And so it's really up to you. If the person said their wishes before they die, then honor those wishes. If they haven't said what their wishes are, then you have to kind of guess what their wishes are, guess what seems appropriate for you and your family or whatever. But generally, Buddhists tend to think of cremation. It tends to be cheaper overall, and it tends to be simpler, and it tends to, for the most part, be more ecological than the kind of funeral home, cemetery kind of approach, where they have lawns. Yes? I was dealing with a summer guy, and she had contracted with a mortuary service. And what I learned from that is that the law was that they have to, if the body isn't, I forget when they preserve it, you know, if that isn't done, the body has to be cremated within 24 hours or something like that. There were some laws that they started, you know, reading to us, and it just seemed so inappropriate. Yeah. Some of the things that were required by state laws, and I wondered what you knew about that. And the reason I'm asking is because you're saying, you know, the different types around the world, the different types of ways of dealing with the body, and I'm wondering within the different types what is allowed in our... Legally. Yeah. It depends on the state, as far as I understand. Different states, only different counties have different regulations around this. But in San Mateo County, there doesn't seem to be any limit, as far as I could tell, in talking to the people involved, how long you keep the body at home, short of, you know, becoming a health hazard. And sometimes I've been told that some of the neighbors sometimes will put pressure, because the neighbors get nervous about having their dead body more than a couple of days or a day or something. But, you know, I think there's a lot of leeway. Funeral homes and mortuary services are notorious for saying the things that would help business, you know, putting spin on things. And there are non-profit mortuary memorial associations that will help people know what their rights are, what's possible, and how they get the best deal and things like that. But it's very hard when an urbanist is kind of grieving, so, you know, they have you kind of in a vulnerable time. But just be very careful when you talk to these mortuary services that you're really getting a straight story. And the only reason... You're only legally required to bomb a body if it's going to cross state lines. In terms of leaving, it's for, you know, I never heard that 24-hour rule anywhere. Also, oh yes, you know, maybe. Sorry. There is no... there is no system that has a 24-hour rule in central. Yeah. Yes, I never... If you go to Neptune, and you have the dye on Thursday or Friday, they don't ship out to the... to where they're going to do their permissions until Tuesday or Wednesday. So they have to keep... So you either keep the body at home or you have to send it to a mortuary service for a while. So you either keep the body at home or you have to send it to a funeral home to hold it or the morgue or something. Again, those that go to Neptune, the pickup is usually from a home to Neptune directly, and very rarely is there a showing or candy, but that's up to the individual. Right. And then they may have a service or may not have a service after the fact in terms of having the ashes given back to them. Okay. There's a number of options there. And so... Very low time ones. Right, that's my understanding. And the... so, you know, what this happens, the place to call... Semiteo County, the people to call, is the office or department of vital statistics. And they're the ones who know all the regulations and what you can do. And they're the ones who can issue permits for the various things that you can get permission to do. In order to transport a body, you need to get a permit. But you can get a body and just, you know, put it in your back seat and front seat, I guess. You know... You know... Yeah, carpooling. As long as you have a... as long as you have a permit. Just... Yeah, please, please. ...and that is if you can't drive in the diamond line. You cannot. Because it's not a person anymore. And who's ruled that? Who's ruled that? Has it been ruled that way or is it... Not because of the cat. So... Yes. Okay. I have a question. You could back up a little bit. I know we touched briefly on the question of... Yes. Yes. And I'm fine with... I don't have any experience with that. So I don't know what to say about that. There are some Asian Buddhists who have strong feelings about not having the body cut up or not having certain ideas about how... Like Tibetan Buddhists who say you shouldn't have organs taken out prior to doing a certain transfer of consciousness ceremony. They do. After that, you can do whatever you want because consciousness has been transferred. There are different views about it. The view that... That particular Theravada view, that's pretty instantaneous and then it's off to the next life. You can just do it right... For the body, for the person's sake, you can then do the organ donation right away. My own understanding or view about this, my own logic of how this works, is that if there is this process of death and rebirth and the transfer of intermediate time of consciousness before the rebirth happens, the person might be aware of the fact that their body is being disturbed and cut up. But that it's such a wonderful thing. It's such a phenomenally beautiful wholesome thing to do to donate one's organs. It's so helpful. That that's what the person's wishes are. The benefits that come to oneself through the merit are greater than the disadvantages of being disturbed. And so if that's what a person's wishes are, go ahead and do that. Go ahead and do it. And then probably you need to follow the doctor's orders the best you can. And then tell the doctors that you would have a great value in trying to make a peaceful environment quiet as you can. And what are the parameters that you're allowed to do? And I really don't know much about this. I never had an experience with it. So you have to kind of feel your way. Yes. Because I've never broken this culture at all. I've never had experience of anybody dying here. I don't know if this is true, but I'd be very good. If anybody knows any information on, so if you are doing organ donation, where would your body go? And do you have a choice of a particular location it can go? Secondly, some of the places you mentioned which will give you kind of a nonprofit, you know, otherwise on quick cremations or any institution that you say you will have talked to people concerned. If you can mention some of the resources, it will be really useful. What I'll do, what I'm putting together a manual. Therefore, a lot of this information. And then in that manual will be all kinds of, you know, references to things. So you have to be a little bit patient. Hold off with you dying until you get the manual. Yeah, I've missed the last one. Yeah. You may have. No, no. No, no. And the... My mind's kind of blank. What was the first half of your question? The first thing you asked? Like an organ donation. Yeah. Oh, where did it go? So again, I don't know so much about this. It's a little bit hard to actually have the organ donation happen because you have to be in good condition. So, you know, if, you know, it's usually, I think it's kind of usually if you're brain dead or, you know, you really don't have much chance to living, but you're at the hospital. That works best. If you die at home, it's probably, you know, they're not going to get you to the hospital quickly enough. Unless what you do, there's other donate things, other ways of donating your body besides organ donations. There's also donating your body for medical purposes or scientific purposes. And then you might end up, you know, in the anatomy lab, you know, or for studies, by students, so the medical students can really learn and be trained. And that's quite a useful thing to do too. And then probably it's a whole different, that's probably a whole different scenario than how that's done. And I don't know if this is true, but I was told when I was growing up that a friend of the families had a tattoo on the sole of her foot that said property of UCLA. Because she was, you know, so that's sounds really bizarre to me, but maybe that, you know, my son believes that I grew up in the old days. So, you know, back in the old days, things were different. Yeah. You know, Bruce's mom gave her body to be studied at Stanford. And all it was, you know, you had to get a form for that ahead of time that she had to sign. And then they just, you know, they just called them. Yes. So certainly the people who are going to survive you, it's really good if they know, if they don't know, then it's hard to, you know, to have your wishes fulfilled. So, okay, that's my, that's my take on this. Is that satisfying enough, my answer to you about? That's a very half-passable thing. The state of California a couple of years ago, the law in which they gave everybody a form on the back of their driver's license. But that is a humorous thing. It depends on where you are and what you've got your driver's license with you or that. And whether anybody bothers to, to your driver's license. Right. And, and the whole Oregon transplant donor thing is actually quite a bit considerably more disorganized than anybody believes. It's actually a matter of serious luck. Anybody gets it all over again. It has been for a very long time because I used to have a friend who worked at the Northern California Transparent Bank and his take on it then, which was 15, 20 years ago, it was the same then as it is now. My sister got her kidney last spring and it came from Boston. That's where they found a good match. She waited, she was a kidney transplant list for, I think, four years. And she'd been told she'd be on it for two to three years, in the four years. And now I think it's probably five or six years of waiting lists and there's a great need for it. And it's a whole issue of the Oregon transplant, transplant's a big really important one. Bruce, your hands? Oh, I was just going to say the anatomy instructor or whatever he was, he called, I got to talk to him to find out what they were going to do. And he said they were going to do a new heart procedure, to study new heart procedures. Right. They also wanted to know what the condition of the body was. They wanted to know if a person died of infectious disease, if that sort of thing. So they might be, I assume they might be picky. Yeah, I can imagine. Oh, his mother, who was donated to Stanford, he asked what they were going to use it for. And he was told to do a trial kind of heart procedure, kind of learn how to do it, new procedure. But they're kind of picky about the bodies they will take because they're worried about infectious diseases and other things. So they'll ask you kinds of questions. So it's kind of hit or miss whether they'll take you, even if you've offered. Yes. On that same note, I don't know too much about or who has a question. But I've heard this that many people question, you know, is the person really dead because they have to take the point, for some of the organs, the point at which they have to take the organ. It's so close to the time, and that's always concerned me. So and I know you mentioned before, saying, well, what is the question is, what is the point of death? I guess that's a point. I'm not sure where the question is in that, except to say that, you know, that concerns me. Sure. Again, again, this is what I said earlier. My view on this, you know, there's no authority that ultimately can answer this, I think. But my view is that if it's the person's wish to have their organs donated, and it's such a powerfully beneficial thing to do, such a wholesome thing to do, that even if the person is still somewhat alive, to have the organs, what a great way to go. You know, it's such a wonderful thing to do. Hopefully, it makes the person really happy to know, yes, I'm going now, but this is my last thing I'm going to do while I'm still alive, donating my organs. Yeah, so my sense is not, you know, if that's the person's wishes, just go for it. And don't worry about this thing. Well, the person's not really quite dead yet, or the Buddhists say, you know, it's not really dead for, you know, three days. I don't know, you know, just if the person's still alive, then they get more benefit from it. They get to maybe be aware of it, what great thing they've done. And maybe they can, the important thing in Buddhism is try to die with as good a state of mind as possible. And my hope is that if the person's heartfelt wish is to donate the organs, that is going to make their mind really good state. Wow, yes, I'm happy. What a great thing to have done. Whereas if you don't do it, and that's the person's wish, and they're going to go out, those people, they might have a little bit of regret. So I think you just go for it, and don't worry about these kinds of details. That's my take. So a couple of things, brief things about funerals and memorial services. Kind of repeating myself is, you know, you're on design in such a way that's helpful for everyone. But one of the customs that I know of in Buddhism is, even as, even if the memorial services a week later or whatever, is it's very helpful to speak to the person. Not everyone has to, maybe just the officiant, maybe one or two family members. But it's really, it's very powerful, whether they actually communicate to the person or whether it's just for one's own psyche. It's very powerful to actually speak to the person and say what needs to be said. Even if it's not necessarily nice things, because you're angry, let me just, let me tell you about this. I miss you, I'm sorry, I love you, but I got to tell you, when you did that to me, you know, I never told you how much it really hurt or whatever. And so speaking to a person is very powerful to do that. I think it's very helpful. And then to do some of these things, you know, to refuge, to precepts. If the whole audience, however there, is kind of in the kind of Buddhist world enough, everyone can chant the precepts and refugees together and do so many chants together. If most of the people there are not in that flow, in that tradition, then, you know, if I'm invited in, then I can do it. I'll just do it for the person. And dedication of merit. And there's various things that can happen in funerals. Sometimes there's a little Dharma talk that's given. Of course, there's kind of usual things, kind of like eulogy. I tend to, I'm fond of having people, kind of Quaker style, people in the audience freely be able to stand and speak whatever they want to say, rather than have it all organized ahead of time where, you know, people who's going to speak and it's all, but have some spontaneity to it and see who, you know, who wants to speak, what needs to be said. And let it kind of have a life of its own part of it. There's also some ritual things that are running out of time now, but a few ritual things that are done with the thread and again with water and candles. And so you just know that there are all kinds of ritual things that can be done and have symbolic value for a funeral memorial service. I wanted to, one of the things I wanted to talk about today, and we're running out of time now, is some of the ethical issues. For example, mostly euthanasia, but also suicide. Because this is a question that comes up around when someone's terminally ill and suffering a lot. What does Buddhist feel about the person who's committing suicide? Or euthanasia, will you somehow help the person? Euthanasia literally means good death. So help the person have a good death. Through passively kind of letting them, just not feeding them or not pulling them off life support or more actively killing them. Mercy killing, it's called. It's a difficult topic to talk about again because it reflects people's deepest understandings and views about what it means to be a human being and what happens after a person dies. And so for someone to come and impose even Buddhist ideas on that can be tricky. Because it's a very deep kind of area in persons and people's lives. However, probably the key Buddhist teaching that relates to all this question has to do with, is the basic Buddhist teaching having to do with the intentions that are the impulse, the cause or the condition for which we do things. What's the quality of our intentions when we do something? If the intention is motivated by greed, hate or delusion, then it's very clear in Theravada Buddhism, then it becomes an inappropriate action that should not be done. If it's motivated by the opposite, love, wisdom, generosity, then it's considered to be ethically beneficial because the measurement is based on people's intentions. The problem with that is that are there circumstances where you might judge the greater good is going to come by following through on my unwholesome intention. So for example, if you hate, the classic example is if you hate some great king who's going around murdering everybody, or your king is murdering everybody in their kingdom and you have the chance to kill that king. And it's understood you can't kill someone like that unless there is some aversion in your heart. An aversion, if you kill someone you create tremendously bad karma for yourself. It's morally unwholesome. But someone might evaluate and say, I'm willing to take on the bad that comes to me, the bad karma, the bad intention and all that, that comes from that because it's so much greater good that comes from saving all these people's lives. So there's those kinds of equations that go on. But those kinds of logic is for the most part absent in Theravada Buddhism, for better or for worse. Mahayana Buddhism tends to have more of a gray area where you're getting a sense of what's the greatest good here. Whereas Theravada Buddhism tends to be much more black and white, it's very clear that if you have an intention of great hate and delusion in your heart, then that's a morally unacceptable action to do. And the Theravada view is that in order to commit euthanasia, in order to actually do an act that causes a person to die, as opposed to passive approaches, letting the person, you know, nature take its course, that that act, the claim is that in Theravada Buddhism is that there has to be some aversion present for a person to push the button. Even though 99% of the motivation is out of compassion, when you really come down there, the argument is it's the some aversion there, and therefore it's unacceptable. It's not an appropriate thing to do. Also, there's a tremendous amount of sanctity in life in Buddhism. And life is considered very precious, and the karmic unfolding and the spiritual process of any living being is considered very, very special, very precious, very sacred, and that to interrupt it by killing it, or killing yourself, is said to cause great harm and is morally inappropriate for Buddhists to do. So any kind of helping someone commit suicide is actually considered inappropriate also. Anything that helps someone else to die, anything that encourages someone else to die, because it's a really good idea if you die now, is inappropriate. Any kind of bringing it up, say, oh, by the way, have you thought about, you know, just, you know, not eating now and dying? Any kind of encouragement like that is considered unethical in the Theravada Buddhism. Right. Yeah, so, so yeah. And then the question is, what do you do if the person's wishes are, if they're unbraindead, I'd like to be, you know, all life support be taken away. If that's their wishes, then how do you negotiate between those two? The wishes and what your tradition says is ethical or unethical. Now, suicide in Buddhism is considered, for the most part, to be unethical, because killing oneself is the same as killing someone else, because self and other are not so different. It's like you're killing a human being. But also the logic that is probably behind most suicides is that things will get better, or maybe not better, at least my suffering is going to stop. Because this is intolerable, the suffering I have now, it'll end when I commit suicide, this puts an end to it. And with the view, Buddhist view of rebirth, there's no guarantee that's the case. And in fact, you're setting up the conditions for things to get worse, because such an unethical thing to such bad karma to kill yourself, the chances are that you're making things a lot worse for yourself than it is now. So it's not an equation doesn't work in your favor, even though you might, you know, on the surface, it might seem that way. If you don't believe in rebirth, then there's two other arguments against it along these kinds of lines. One is that the process of what happens in the last moments of death, you know, people sometimes recollect their whole lives in just like an instant, when they're about to have a car accident or something. A whole lifetime can kind of be lived in a few moments of consciousness. And who knows what the karmic pain that you're going to have to go through, if you commit suicide, because the karma of that in those last few moments, and you might think, well, two moments, you know, that's like nothing, I can live with that. But you know, it's all this becomes quite relative, in those last moments when time seems a whole different dimension to it. So you don't know what you're doing in suicide. And then the other and also very important argument against it is what it does to the people who are left behind. And, and it causes tremendous distress and suffering for people left behind. And indirectly, their suffering is going to come back and haunt you, either in future lifetimes, or in those closing moments, my belief, which I don't have any real basis to prove this, but my belief is that some of these things, that the dying process involves really a dramatic facing of your karma. And so rather than thinking you're becoming free of these things, again, the distress that you causing other people will dawn on you at that moment, or somehow, and it could be quite difficult. So it's kind of, you know, bad news for those people who are thinking about suicide. But it's good news in some ways, because it encourages people to find other ways to do it. Part of the argument in Buddhism is that as long as there's life, there's always the opportunity for spiritual purification and transformation. And that suffering is one of the vehicles for that to happen. And so we don't have to be so afraid of your suffering, or try to avoid it at all costs. Yeah. So there's the line between not intervening, someone's dying, and they could be kept alive on life support. And by taking no action, how much action is that choosing to let somebody? Yeah, good question. So I mean, so there are a couple of circumstances where suicide is considered, ethically okay, or neutral or something. One is a very strange provision that says that if you're engaged in your meditation, and you're really engaged, and you're going for some deep realization, experiencing meditation, and you decide to forgo eating, because you're so engaged, and then you die because you forgot to eat, you didn't eat, then it's okay. It's kind of like suicide, because you're just going for it, you're just going for enlightenment. And then if you die because you need, then it's okay. Another is that if you have a terminal illness, and you're going to die, you're about to die anyway, you're going to die soon enough anyway, and out of compassion for the people who are taking care of you, for the amount of difficulty and problems you're causing for them, it can be okay then to, not to kill yourself, but to stop eating and let nature take its course. That's an argument that's made. And the last one is that if you have a terminal illness, and you're going to die anyway, and you've already been enlightened, then it's okay just to stop, because you're doing more work to be done then, right? So in terms of, you know, needing to hang in there as long as you can to do whatever processing can be done, you don't need to anymore. So you just kind of let yourself go. So what about caring for someone else? And what about decisions around helping them die? My sense is that you never, a Buddhist never wants to encourage it, never wants to be the first one to bring it up. But what if they bring it up? What do you do then? I think this is a very deep thing that we, each person is not going to kind of figure out for themselves in the context of each situation. But in my understanding of what I read, what I understand from teachers and stuff in the Theravadan tradition, doing anything that kills a person is ethically unacceptable. Doing something that where the person simply allows a person to pass it to nature, take its course. So removing the person's life, the person's life, the person's life, the person's life, takes its course. So removing life support, for example, if life is support, moving life is support, let's nature takes its course, is acceptable if the intention is one of compassion. If it's simply like this is, you know, I've been dealing with this person now for seven years and you know, just I can't take it anymore. And let's just, you know, pull the plug. That is not acceptable. So you have to also have a sense that this is the wishes of the person, they have to convey it in some way. And it's very difficult to use, you have to be very careful in using the justification of compassion as a reason why you're going to help someone to die peacefully, so-called peacefully. And that is that the three sources of bad karma are greed, hate and delusion. And there can be delusion infused with compassion. So you have to be very careful that there's no delusion, delusion going on at this time also. So the tendency in Theravada Buddhism is to be very careful about the moral quality, the ethical quality of these kinds of acts. And to be very, very careful not to create this very atrociously bad karma of somehow being responsible for someone else's death. Yeah. One of the things that is not unusual for hospice workers to suggest, at least they did in my friend's dying, is they asked us to encourage our friend to let go and give him permission. Oh yeah, that's beautiful because that's what they have to do. That's what's happening anyway. And so that's part of, if I go to sit with someone who's dying, at some point I'll be doing letting go of meditations with them, encouraging them. And also this thing of giving permission to go. But that's not wishing them to die, just like there's this process going on and you can feel them holding on and they're suffering because they're holding on. And so you're not really encouraging them to maybe die, you're encouraging them to not suffer and to let this process happen. Smita. I can imagine at the time of a loved one is on my support system, would be very hard. I mean, I'm just thinking of myself, it would be a very hard time for me to sit and come to understanding what my real intentions are. And if the distribution is hard enough sitting on this chair right now, I mean what my intentions are, but at that time would be very hard. If the person has given permission within my household, many of us have about not continuing on my support system, then even then should I, do I still have to go over that step of seeing what my intentions are? Or if that person has given permission and has driven very specifically, then as the nearest one, so for the hospital's concern, am I allowed to give permission without really coming to terms with that? You have to be always careful with your intention. And sometimes intentions are mixed and sometimes they're kind of vague what our intentions are, but you're going to be very careful as you can. And then kind of find your way. So your intention is not mixed with greed, hate and delusion. So never mind what the person said, I still... Well, if you're responsible, if you're going to be responsible, that person dying. Yeah, the person said very clearly, oh, do not continue your life support. Do I still give them permission to pull the plug, even though part of me is more fine and convenient and part of me is going to be sad. I'm sure there's nobody in my life that I for whom I would have that very long be sad. What do we do when our intentions are mixed, which sometimes they can be? 90% one way and 90% pure and 10% impure. What do we do then? These are very difficult questions. I'm very uncomfortable saying anything almost about these things. And even in saying, when I say things like the traditional Buddhist view is this, I'm being very careful to say that I'm not trying to say this is what the truth is, because I don't really know some of these things, but they're very difficult issues. But the main thing we're trying to look at, Buddhism is suggesting, is look at the quality of the intention and look at the sacredness of life. Buddhism teaches that people have their own karma to work through and you don't want to interrupt that karma. And also they have their own spiritual process that they're going through. And as long as the person is a human being, and some kind of consciousness is still going on, there's a possibility that they can work through. And there are lots of experiences of people in comas who seemingly are unconscious, but you come up next to them and you speak to them and they seem to hear and register at some level. So some processing going on there. And who are you to know? Who are you to know what is really going on for that person? So the tendency in Buddhism is to be very respectful of that person's own karma and abilities. It's considered extremely rare to be a human being. And the opportunity in here, in human form, is so great that you don't want to interrupt that and just kind of preserve it as much as you can. But then the question is, what about when it's a person suffering a lot? Sometimes medical interventions means a person will suffer more. One of the interesting questions is, Buddhism puts a tremendous value in having a positive wholesome state of mind as you're dying. So is it better to die in a wholesome state of mind earlier or to die with a morphine-induced stupor or nausea? Lots of medical interventions will keep you going, but the quality of your life is going to deteriorate. And is it even better just to not have the medical interventions and just let yourself die when your mind is still clear and kind of be present for it in a way? So a lot of it depends on the kind of medicine, medication, what the effect it's going to have on you and the balance of how much suffering things are going to cause or not cause. I find these questions very hard. And maybe if I had a lot more experience with my heart, I had very, very, very, almost no experience with these kinds of directly. So I don't really have the experience to give, to talk as if someone has actually grappled with these things myself. I'm aware of these things, I've talked to people about it indirectly and I've read about them and things like that, but I find it very difficult. And I wish I could be more cogent about it. And I was just thinking about this week, talking about this, I was very acutely aware of how this really, the delicacy of talking about this, because it really points to really core views that people have about what it is to be a human being, what religious life is all about, what life and death is all about. And this very deep, deep area that people's lives. And then how do we talk about that with authority? I look concentrated on all the people dying, but at work, one of my coworkers just had her baby die after three days. After three days? In the area. Yeah, in the local paper, I just looked at the police blotter last week and it said that the fire department or something came to some house someplace because there was a report that six-year-old baby stopped breathing. And so there's various things. There's a Buddhist idea, which some Buddhists find a lot of solace in, it's the working of karma. And so the karma is the fact that someone dies after a few days as a child, that's the karma of that person to have that kind of life. But that's a little bit simplistic because the Buddha himself said that the karma is not the only reason why someone might die. There are non-karmic causes to people dying. Illness, for example, it doesn't seem to have a karmic source. I don't know what to say. You said the Buddha said illness doesn't have a karmic source? It doesn't have to. There are non-karmic sources of illness and death. Is there a way to determine? Well, you know, I left that manual at home. I have to mention that karma is very confusing. I mean, if you're a doctor, are you supposed to help and heal people or let them live and die through their karma? I mean, it's confusing. Well, it's their karma to get more in a circumstance where they have access to doctors. So, you know, doctors do what they can. I think that healing is never, as far as I know, I've never seen anybody suggest that the doctrine of karma implies you should not help someone heal. And with all kinds of acts of helping. Normally, one would think that it is good to help to the extent you can. But then should you stay away from helping somebody because you're interfering with their karma and they will be reborn and have to live through the whole experience? The thing about interfering with someone's karma, I know about it, is this thing about death. To help someone die prematurely is to interrupt the working of their karma in this lifetime. That's the Pacific teaching on that. There are circumstances when we're supposed to be as helpful as we can to each other. I'll stay and answer a few more questions. People are beginning to go. It's late. I want to end with this point. This topic of death and dying has a lot to do with, you know, for a lot of people with notions of karma or what happens after we die and all this. My personal view is that I don't know what's the truth about some of these things, but what I do have a tremendous amount of confidence in so much so I feel like it's enough. You don't need to know anything else. And that is the tremendous power of being fully present for what's happening right now. And that fully present means present in such a way that you're finding your way or you work your way, you practice your way to being fully present without any greed, hate and delusion. So the practice of presence is what is significant, is phenomenally significant in all these circumstances. To bring our presence to someone who's dying, to bring presence to our death, to bring a sense of presence to what's happened, you know, the period after someone is dying. These kinds of questions that what happens after death and a lot of these questions are secondary to the importance of really bringing presence to what's happening there. I know that doesn't answer some of the questions around euthanasia and I think that euthanasia is such a difficult one that each person's going to really have to search their own hearts to find out what seems most appropriate. And each situation is probably different from every other one, so it's also situational. But I hope that your Dharma practice, your mindfulness practice, is teaching you the skills and the value, the faith in the importance of being present. Being present now, being present now, and then doing again for the next now, and then for the next now. And someday the next now will be your last breath. It's just another now. And then what happens after that? It's just another now. So cultivate your presence and share your presence with the people that you love. So those are my thoughts and I'll stay if you have more questions. And I hope this three-day class has been useful and it's certainly stimulated me a lot in terms of thinking about a lot of these things, about how it would be useful for our Sangha. And I have a lot more to pass on and I think that it'll have to take the form in this manual that I'm putting together. And someday, I'll let you know, if you don't come to our Sangha on any kind of regular basis or at all, except for this, if you want to know about this manual, you can contact us in six months or so and see if it's been done by then. Okay, thank you.
