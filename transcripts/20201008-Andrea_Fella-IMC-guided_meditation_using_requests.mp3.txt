For just a little bit of the guided meditation, I thought I would offer something that I have found useful, just a little piece that I found useful in my own practice. 
And it's the use of what we could call requests to help orient the mind in a particular direction. 
This use of requests, or sometimes they're called resolves. 
In my own experience, I found that there's a lot of instruction in use of resolves in terms of developing concentration practice. 
As you get closer to having a really settled mind, the mind becomes very amenable to being shaped by intention or shaped by requests. 
But I found in my own experience that if I'm very intuitive or if I'm kind of aware of what the level of subtleness is in the mind, then there are certain kinds of requests that can help shape what we could call the container of the meditation. 
So I found this out on one, no, it was at the forced refuge, actually. 
It was at the forced refuge. 
I discovered that when I sat down to meditate, I was having a lot of trouble doing anything. 
Like the mind was very resistant to any kind of, okay, do this now. 
But I did discover that I could sit down and say to myself, may the body relax? And then I wouldn't try to do it, but I would just sit with that request and then see what the result of that request was. 
And I've discovered since that retreat that often, if I do a little bit of settling at the beginning of a meditation, just even the barest bit of settling at the beginning of a meditation, then the mind can be amenable to certain simple requests that can help to settle the mind. 
I've talked about this before, so it's not new to some of you, but that's the shape of the guided meditation that I'll offer. 
So we'll just begin with, you know, just landing here in your body, just being as aware as you can, and allowing as much relaxation as is available or as possible for you in this moment. 
We'll be consciously relaxing areas of the body where there might be tension. 
Maybe seeing if there's a way that the inside of the body might relax, you know, maybe the throat can relax. 
Maybe the heart can relax. 
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. 
And then exploring this possibility that kind of a request or intention might support relaxation of the body. 
Seeing what happens if you just drop in the request, may the body relax, and then not try to do anything with that. 
Let's just see what the results of dropping that into your body and mind are. 
Sometimes, not always when I do this, so if you don't notice anything happening, that is fine. 
But sometimes I see when I drop that and may the body relax and just sit there kind of attentive and attuned to how the body and mind are. 
Sometimes when I drop that request in, I feel some shift, a little bit of relaxing in some part of the body that I didn't even know was tense, didn't even know that it was possible to relax. 
Sometimes I found it helpful to try a couple of times, just see what happened if I made that request every few minutes for a little while, maybe every 30, 40 seconds. 
May the body relax. 
May the body relax. 
Giving yourself plenty of time to just be with yourself after making a request like that. 
It's not so much about looking for anything either, just being available, being with yourself. 
May the body relax. 
May the mind relax. 
May the mind relax. 
May the mind relax. 
May the body relax. 
With some measure of relaxation of body and mind, you could play with a couple of different approaches with these requests. 
You could explore. 
May the body and mind receive what is already happening with ease. 
Or if you're more inclined to attune to one particular area of experience such as the breath, you could explore. 
May the attention rest with the breathing. 
And again, not try to do it, do it, but just see how the mind and body respond. 
May the attention rest with the breathing. 
May the mind receive the experience with ease. 
Letting go of any expectations that this will happen, just seeing there might be some openness to that possibility. 
And if you find this useful or supportive, you're welcome to continue playing with these simple requests, see what happens. 
Again, I'd suggest not very frequently, maybe once or twice a minute, not that often. 
Give yourself plenty of time to just see what happens with each request. 
Or if you find this not landing or resonating, just let it go and explore the practices that feel most congenial for your mind in this moment. 
Thank you.
