 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Greetings, everyone. Greetings, friends. Thank you for your practice. And just as we ended our sit, I asked if you wanted to put some words, so I'll bring those into the space. Just a few of them. There are so many beautiful ones. Alive, rested, calm and peaceful, healing, comfortable, accept. Sleepy all of a sudden. Yes, when the body gets really comfortable, we can get sleepy. Especially if you're sleep deprived, they can be each other's neighbors. Serenity, metta, invigoration, container calm, softening. Yeah, not mindful. Yeah. Energy of life, precious body. Mmm. Connected head to the body. Simply here. Grounded self-compassion. Thank you all for bringing, or for voicing what's in the space, and so many other things. In addition to distraction and sleepiness, it's all okay. It's whatever is here. It's perfectly fine. It's whatever is arising in this moment. So, as I mentioned at the beginning of our practice today, the meditation today, that the theme that we're continuing to explore with the theme of Dharma of life, a Dharma of improv, improv of in Dharma, is groundedness, is embodiment. As you might have heard before, Gail speaking, other teachers, myself speaking about embodiment, feeling the body, the mindfulness of the body, the first satipatthana, really, the first establishment of mindfulness is about the body, about the body. Most practitioners, when they start practice, they want to go to the mind, the third satipatthana, mindfulness of mind. No, no, no, no, no. The Buddha taught about mindfulness of the body, being mindful and resting in the body first. We're really important. It's a fun, it's foundational practice. Only later, after feeling tone, we get to mindfulness of mind. So, in order to awaken, we really do need to explore and really make friends understand how important embodiment is for our practice, for our daily life. And for me, it took some time when I was a beginner practitioner. It took me some time to really understand, to really grow rock how important mindfulness of the body was. And then it just opened up my practice deep and then opened up more. It was quite profound, actually, when that unlocked. So, since then, mindfulness of the body teachings have been so important, both to me and also in my teachings with others. They seem so basic. Oh, yeah, embodiment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The mind is where it's at. No, no, no. Believe me, it's the body where it's all at, to be grounded, to sense the body and also to allow the... I would also say the wisdom of the body, the wisdom of the body to lead, instead of being in our heads and trying to think and figure it all out, but let the wisdom of the body lead. Similarly, in the Dharma of improv, it is important, it's a primary rule, teaching of improv, that you need to be embodied, not in your head, not disconnected thinking about what you're going to say in a scene, what you're going to do, especially as you're interacting with others in this relational field, in this relational field. In fact, the basic rule, the basic teaching is be embodied and let your body lead. Let your body lead your choice, your thoughts, your actions, your interactions. Really use the tuning fork of the body when you're embodied. Use the tuning fork of the body. Let the body lead. Let the body lead, the sensing, the emotions, the all the thoughts in the body. Again, not the control tower of the head, but in the body. In improv, the scenes where people are really embodied, and actually as a player, improv player, when you're playing relationally, and you are in your body, you let your body lead, it's so satisfying. It's such a satisfying co-creation that when you realize, actually in that scene I was really in my head, I was trying to like fear what to say or what to do, and so I'm like, ah, it was hard, it was tight. Whereas the body, there is both the ease of resting in the body, stable, grounded, yes. And the body leads, really leads and gives you the cue as to what is needed. There's so much more wisdom to the body than just our head thinking. In fact, I'm going to be silly for a moment, what we ascribe in the West to be our mind is this much. Whereas there's so much wisdom to the rest of us. And in fact, our mind, there's a seminal book years ago in psychology called The Embodied Mind, which is really an amazing Dharma book by Francisco Varela, the famous neuroscientist, a Dharma, a Darmic neuroscientist, and Eleanor Raj, and Evan Thompson. Amazing book for those who are inclined that way. But really the wisdom, the wisdom of the body, embodied mind, the entire mind is really in our bodies, not just in our heads, and so much research and actually philosophy to support that. So the invitation as we practice both on the cushion and as we improvise our lives, we're all improvising our lives, is to be in our bodies, not in our heads, to be in our bodies, to keep coming back to the body, to keep coming back to the body. And I'll give you an example. And for example, when I teach mindful leadership and one of the things that I teach leaders in that is that when you are, for example, sitting at your desk, when you are sitting, you're about to send an email, you're about to do something. Check back with the body. Before you're about to send an email, check back with the body. Ideally, you'll be embodied the whole time, but you know, we know us, right? We get distracted. Check back with the body. How is it feeling? What's happening? Check back in with the body. Feel grounded. Feel your feet on the earth. Feel your hands on the keyboard. Feel yourself present. Really step back into the body, PM body. Take a breath. Embodiment is really the key to awareness, is the key to awareness of what is arising, what the appropriate response is at this point. Is it really wise, is it kind to send this email you're about to send? The body will tell you. And if the body is so agitated that it can't get up, go for a walk, become embodied, really sense and land in the body. So embodiment is so helpful, both on the cushion as we're practicing. And you might have noticed, and again, I noticed this in my own practice, that when I am embodied, it seems like there's this big, large, if there's a balloons of thoughts, then they're swinging in the wind, this way and that way. Oh, the same way that with helium balloons, we attach a weight to them so they don't go off everywhere. Body is that weight, is that lovely light, not heavy and grim duty, but this, this, this, ah, the sense of coming into our own, in our practice, unmoved, unwavering, not being pushed over by this thought, that thought, that emotion, but actually having the resilience, having the stability to be with everything that arises, with the sense of integrity of the body. I love the statues of Buddha, all these different postures, but mostly we see the seated posture and there's just such a sense of integrity. You know, his legs, again, you can be sitting on a chair or, or, or on a cushion, it doesn't matter. And yet this, as we look at, at his statue, there's a sense of stability, the sense of stability of, of the body grounded, stable, upright, the sense of dignity, integrity of the body. So, so important in our practice on the cushion, as you're sitting actually, as you're listening to me in the, in the relational practice of, of relating to others, mindful listening and mindful speaking, the primary trick or the primary way of, of deep listening is to be embodied, to really be in your body and listen to others. So as I'm listening to you, in fact, you can be practicing embodiment. You can be feeling your feet on the earth, your, your, your legs, your sit bones on the cushion, your breath, is it tight? Is it loose? Ah, so much wisdom in the body. And of course, relationally in improv, you need to be in your body to, to be actually light and responsive. Be in your body, not in your head to be responsive. And improv can be pretty fast. If you, if you watched, um, if you, if you've done improv yourself, or if you've watched it, you know, whose line is it anyway, for example, there's just, it can be quite fast. And sometimes people are intimidated. Well, how are they thinking about all this? It's actually, it's really a lot about embodiment. It's, it's, that's the trick. It's like the wizard of Oz. I've pulled back the curtain. It's about embodiment. It's really, there's so much Dharma in improv. It's about embodiment, meeting the moment, meeting the moment, not from the cleverness of your head, but, but bringing, bringing your whole self, your body, um, letting the body lead. So, so thank you. Thank you friends. May you be embodied today as you're moving, um, cooking or eating or walking, going to the bathroom. Oh, it was sitting at your desk, typing emails, and body come back to the body, listening, especially interacting with others, relational field. Um, and again, it's not that you just check out and you're in your body, but you let the body lead. It's both the stability and also the tuning for the body tells you whatever is needed. If there's upset anger, if there's anything that's, well, that's not quite right before it develops to full blown, say anger is like, oh yeah, something isn't quite right here. Let me check in anyway. So much to the mindfulness of the body, so much to embodiment, um, both relationally and on practice and on the cushion. Thank you all. Thank you so much for, for your cultivation or your wholehearted, whole body dedication. Take good care. Be well, be embodied today, observe plant seeds and looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
