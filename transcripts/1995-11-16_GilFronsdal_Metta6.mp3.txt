 So this is our last class in this go-around for loving kindness. And so before I start or we start, it would be nice to hear from you. How's it been going? What have been your reflections or discoveries or questions about loving kindness over the last week? How often should you, I mean, how does this fit in? Do you do it every time you do a meditation? I mean I don't do all that much meditation. It's no more than 20 to 30 minutes a day. So is it generally speaking one or the other? I mean I'm forgetting about mindfulness meditation now. Because you're doing this instead? Yes. I was just wondering about a ratio. Is there a ideal optimum ratio? There's no rules for such these things. It's more of a pragmatic sense of what seems to be best for you, what seems right for you. And some people, that's all they do for long periods of time is loving kindness meditation. And some people will do sometimes the first five or ten minutes of their sitting with loving kindness and they switch to mindfulness. Some people will start with mindfulness and end with loving kindness. Some people alternate days. It kind of depends on what you feel works best. But I kind of think that whatever you choose, it's good to have some regular consistency. Because with doing the same thing each day on a regular basis, you build a little bit of momentum or some sense of familiarity with that world from having done it routinely. And so it builds from day to day. If you sit every day, then the next day you sit, there's somehow a history of how it was the last few days. And that somehow helps build perhaps the way you engage yourself in the new day. Not to stress yourself, but you can just add a little bit of spice, something like that. I know when I meditate, I don't really do loving kindness meditation, but I find that having feelings of loving kindness during my day to day life, which seems to increase, but I don't feel better. I like the other kind of meditation better. I don't like the formulaic approach so much to that. In fact, sometimes I have difficulty remembering the words, but the feeling that those words are supposed to engender seems to come quite easily. That's a great way of doing it. There's just different ways. The formulaic way doesn't work for you. There's other creative ways of doing it as a meditation itself. Sometimes creatively you can use visualizations. So you just visualize or just imagine or just don't use formulae phrases, but just kind of talk yourself into it. Just use the saying whatever seems suited for you, whatever words or phrases. In a way, it's more meaningful for me to feel loving kindness to people I'm actually with or looking at or meeting in some way than to do it more abstractly in meditation. That's how I like to do it the most. That's what I do actually do the most in my daily life. I don't do it that often in sitting practice myself, like my daily sittings, but I do it a lot kind of just going about. If I'm driving along the road or in the traffic or waiting for a stop sign or something or in the store, it's just a nice thing to do. I just kind of send loving kindness in all directions. I've been sort of tacking it on to the end of my meditation for five minutes or so, not for very long. I don't get as far as sending that much loving kindness to the whole world. Basically, I've been using it for myself and for my family, for my kids. I don't know if it's a coincidence, but it seems to have helped. I don't know, it's me. I'm less angry with them. All of a sudden my relationship with my daughter has improved. I don't know if that's why, but it's helped. Maybe. Great. That's nice to hear. I was thinking today about how the relationship between loving kindness and patience and giving yourself time, half a chance, that if I'm rushing around, trying to rush to get somewhere or busy, that there's very hard for me to have space for any kind of feelings of loving kindness. But if I slow down and just kind of follow a nice pace and plan ahead and get to my car early enough so there's plenty of time to get to where I'm going, then it's a lot easier to drive or be with myself in places of loving kindness. But it goes the other way also, that if you cultivate a little bit of loving kindness, that that also creates a more spacious and more open-ended time feeling. And as soon as you're more patient and more open-ended, it allows for all kinds of other things to happen in a relationship. How many of you have felt that maybe it's improved your relationships since you've been doing loving kindness? Yeah? In what way? I like people more. I assume you're on better with people. And the teamwork that occurs in the course of the day when you make more progress, I'm a lot more talented somehow. Patience develops. And what's been the key for you in order to be able to cultivate loving kindness towards your fellow? Well, it's part of what you mentioned, giving yourself a little space. Somehow the process results in a deeper examination of what's going on inside of you. And as a consequence, you do create more space than that space. There's more tolerance than that space. That's what comes into it. Out of it is a warmer feeling towards people which are just very flak-packed heels. It's the body opening also that's extremely interesting, shall we say, and new in this process. In the doing loving kindness? Yes. And you feel the body? Well, it starts out as loving kindness. Pretty soon, all kinds of things are opening up. Forget about it. Go and look at these openings that are happening. Great. Great. I've decided in intimate relationships that I think I'm ready to attract someone in my life that exhibits those qualities. I'm probably doing the exercises here as facilitated that. I just started to see. But I noticed that as I was breathing in the quiet that my ribcage opened up. I thought about, I could first fit me into there, but then within a few minutes it seemed like I could fit more people into this sort of love cave. And then by the end of when I was sitting, it just felt like more and more people were able to fit into this space that my breath was opening up. Nice. I think the most important thing for me was the very beginning, was the loving kindness for yourself. And that when I stopped, when I started thinking that I was worth more love, that I stopped being so defensive. And that was what facilitated getting along with people better, was that I wasn't always protecting my territory as much as I had been before, because I didn't have to. Fantastic. It's like lightening up. Yeah. Yeah. And I've heard that said so many times. I mean, I've known it's true for the last 40 years that you have to love yourself first before you can really give love to other people. But I never understood it. So part of loving yourself is also, we did this I think earlier, was you can love particular parts of yourself which are difficult. So if you have a lot of fear, or have a lot of self-criticism, or hate, or whatever, rather than thinking you have to get rid of those things, you send your loving kindness to those things. And then often people then protest, you know, I mean, I'm supposed to love my fear? Yes, you are. And, or have compassion for it. Or have compassion. That's also possible. And a lot of things dissolve in the light of a little bit of loving kindness. Someone told me recently, or read, or someone's policy about how long to sit every day. And this person's policy was, she sits half an hour a day unless she's really, really busy. And then she sits for an hour. And then she sits for an hour. So what else? Before we start? We have started. I had an opportunity, I really used the practice a couple days ago, I did a car accident. I sat that morning, I got there. It was one of those things where the long after I hit this woman's car, I just went into this place of just being calm and being aware of everything that's going on. And I could see her fear and her anger and her sense of having been really violated. And you're not supposed to say I would fault. So I didn't come right out and say that. But I became as close as I could to saying that I really could regret it that it had happened. I haven't been able to stay in that place since then. I got pretty judgmental and actually felt angry about some things that had happened. But at least at that moment, for those brief 10 minutes that I was with her and you were reacting to the practice, which really helped me. You think it made it easier for her too? I don't know. I stayed calm and I think maybe that helped her. Maybe in some way actually helped calm me out a little bit. I don't. One of the things I wanted to mention several weeks ago, this little thing that maybe many of you have read or heard, is that the Dalai Lama has been quoted as saying, My religion is kindness. And it's a beautiful sentiment. My religion is kindness. So kindness probably says a way of saying loving kindness. I don't know what the difference is between kindness and loving kindness. So should we sit? Yes. So close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. And as you breathe out silently to yourself, maybe almost as an imagination, kind of sigh letting the day slide off you. And then you can be relaxed or soften. Relax or soften your stomach muscles. Muscles around your waist and the lower part of your back. Feeling how your weight sits on your waist, on your hips. See if you're balanced and composed along the center of gravity. And take a few moments to slowly go up the spine from your lower back up to your neck. Feeling how you're aligned there. Feeling if you can ever so subtly become more balanced, upright, balanced so that your weight doesn't hang forward or hang backwards. And then around the core of the spine or the core of the muscles that hold you upright, allow the rest of the muscles, those purpluous muscles to ring. Relax to soften. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the arms. Relaxing the shoulders. And then gently feel your breathing going in and out through the center of your chest, the area of your heart. As if the breath was a gentle wind caressing the breath, the heart. And sometimes it's suggested that in doing loving kindness meditation that you can create a small half smile with the lips. Turning up the corners of your lips is a little bit your smile. And in the space and the time we have here, the quiet, can you allow yourself to be happy? Or can you open up to feel a little bit of happiness? Or if there's something that is keeping you from being happy or keeping you from feeling that you're okay just being here, can you look below that? Can you sense deeper than that? And perhaps sense the deep pulse of life? The deep current of being alive. And continuing to breathe in and out through the chest. You can perhaps imagine you're standing under a great blue sky on a warm day. Perhaps in a great green, meadow grassland. And perhaps with a kind of sense of boundless sense of self that comes from being under the great blue sky. Open up to loving kindness towards yourself. Connecting to whatever wishes, wishing you have for yourself to be happy. Connecting to whatever desire you have, inspiration you have, to be kind to yourself, to be loving. May I be happy. May my body be filled with joy and delight. May I be free from restlessness and anxiety. May my body be filled with loving kindness. May I be patient and forgiving with myself. May I live at ease. May I be at peace. And then with whatever desire or wish you have for yourself to be happy, think of someone, a friend or an acquaintance, who would you like to extend that wish to, that person also? Think of someone who you'd like to include in your desire for loving kindness. Who would feel safe and comfortable and warm to hold within the embrace of loving kindness, perhaps sharing the space under the great blue warm sun, the blue sky. And then breathing in and out. Extend your loving kindness to your friend, to this person. May you be happy. May you be blessed with loving kindness. May you be free from harm. May you be free from anxiety and hurry. May your heart be filled with joy. May your face be radiant with delight. May we meet each other in the warmth of loving kindness. And then bring to mind someone who's sitting here in this room. Someone who you happened to notice when you came in, or it could be anybody at all. And with whatever memory or image or visualization you can have of that person, open your heart, open your sensitivity to extend your loving kindness to that person also. May you be happy. May you be free from harm. May you be at ease in body and mind. May you experience the delight of loving kindness. May you feel content. May you be at ease. May you be at ease. And then open yourself up to the sense of the whole group sitting here. The circle of people sitting here quietly in the silence of the room. Many of whom you've shared these weeks of loving kindness class. May all of you be happy. May all of you be free from anxiety and worry. May all of you be filled with joy. May all of you sit at ease in your body, in your mind. May all of you together be touched by each other's loving kindness, by each other's kindness. May all of you be at peace. And then expand your loving kindness now to bring to mind all the people who live in Palo Alto between Highway 101 and El Camino. See if you can let your heart open boundlessly in all directions to include a wider group of people, unknown people, great variety of people, young people, old people, all the people in this area of Palo Alto around us. May all these people in Palo Alto live together in friendship. May all these people in Palo Alto live together happily. May all these people be filled with joy. And you can imagine yourself maybe driving or walking around Palo Alto. How would your body be open? How would your heart be open? If it was sensitive to feel kindness to the various strangers you might come across? May all these people be free from harm. May all these people go about their days at ease. May all these people be filled with joy. May all these people be at peace. And then perhaps if loving kindness was a great wave that radiated outwards, expand the loving kindness to include the whole peninsula, San Francisco Peninsula. From San Jose all the way up to the Golden Gate Bridge, hundreds of thousands of people. As you expand your loving kindness, your sense of care and kindness to more and more people, there's an increasing softening of the heart, expansion of the heart. Breathing in and out through the heart center, let your loving kindness softly radiate out. And radiating out further to all the people in California, north and south, east and west. As if your loving kindness was a great soft radiating field of warmth that somehow blanketed the whole state of California. And then not just the people of California, but all the birds and the animals and the fish. So that all beings that share this wonderful state, may all of them be happy. May all of them live together at ease. May they all relate to each other through kindness. May they all relate to each other through kindness. And now in the last minutes of the sitting. Quietly do loving kindness in a little different way. As you breathe in, breathe in loving kindness, kindness to yourself. And then as you breathe out, silently to yourself, state the name of a person who you'd like to send some loving kindness to. And each time you breathe out, choose a different person. Going through anybody that occurs to you. So in the in breath you're breathing in loving kindness to yourself. And in the out breath you state the name, sending out, breathing out loving kindness. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. And in the out breath you say, I'm going to be your friend. Finishing and loving kindness to oneself. And breathing in loving kindness to oneself. Breathing out sharing it with some other person. Quietly saying their name. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. We're going to go to the next station. Allowing whatever names come to mind to be expressed in loving kindness. . . Letting go of all names. Letting go of any expression of loving kindness. Simply sit quietly now in the silence of the room with whatever feelings, sensations, thoughts that might be here. Resisting nothing. . . The traditional sequence of loving kindness actually covers six different steps. It was kind of nice. We had six weeks in the end. The first is loving kindness towards oneself. Then to a friend and benefactor. Then to a neutral person. Then to a difficult person. Then the fifth is called breaking down the barriers. You express loving kindness equally to all four categories of those first people. You express it equally. You can have this equal feeling of kindness towards yourself, a friend, a neutral person, and a difficult person. Once you've done that, you go to the sixth category, which is beginning to expand loving kindness out to wider and wider circles. Either wider and wider circles of beings. Everyone in your family, everyone in your block, everyone in your city, everyone in your county, everyone in your state, everyone in the country, everyone in the world. Just expand it out and out and out. Or you can do it to specific categories of beings. One traditional thing is you do it to all women. Or you do it to all men. You do it to all children, all republicans, all democrats. You start choosing different categories of beings that you want to kind of include. And just go around doing that. And then you can do all beings in the western direction, all beings in the eastern directions, in all possible directions. And as you do that, you get a hang of it. And if you have the feeling of the intention of the kindness gets strong, if you have a sense of it becoming more and more boundless, it kind of radiates out and out. And it doesn't seem to have any boundaries anymore. And at some point it just feels like it fills your whole experiential universe. The whole universe. And just sitting there in this whole bath of loving kindness. The universe, rather than being made up of atoms, it's made up of waves of loving kindness. So that's when it becomes boundless. Now it's not easy to do this. This is a concentration practice of loving kindnesses. There's two different ways of doing loving kindness. One is just simply to soften. This is the way most of us do it in the west. We just do it as a practice to soften the heart and cultivate some loving and some kindness. And some patience and tolerance of others, some love for others. And to work with that more kind of at the heart level. That's one whole way to work with loving kindness. Another way of working on it is that it's a concentration practice. And you're focusing on this particular sentiment of loving kindness and allowing that to be the primary focus of the mind. And allowing the mind to become more and more concentrated on that, more radiant with that, until that becomes more and more boundless. And the more boundless, the more expansive it is, the more concentrated it will become. And you can enter into very deep states of expansive states of concentration. Doing loving kindness practice. And so in Southeast Asia, it's done for both reasons. As a concentration practice, it is a practice of the heart. And in the west, it's mostly a practice of the heart. In the concentration part, we don't focus on very much. Though it can be useful if you find yourself very agitated when you go to sit. Sometimes doing some loving kindness practice can just help quiet you down enough to be able to do mindfulness practice. So how was that, to do that sitting? Were you able to follow along to Palo Alto and the state and outwards? Yes? I found that it was a conceptual problem. And then when you said, I couldn't see how I could come to all of these people. And I just was busy. And then you said, away, up to San Francisco. And I felt I was in the way and everything was connected. And then I wasn't quite able to take away all of California's. It's a big state. It gets more abstract. It gets more difficult when it's abstract. It's a lot easier when you have concrete people. You kind of visualize them and imagine them much better. When you get these larger categories, it's much harder. It's a lot easier if you've done the preliminary work of doing it to yourself and to others. And you've cultivated a strong sense of that. And then you're working with it that is expanding that sense. And then it can be a lot easier in the abstract in a sense. I didn't get much sleep last night, so I slept for the rest of the middle hour. While I'm not completely sleeping. I'm not fully there. But I'm kind of towards the end when you start that, I think you said just before the end, you're breathing. You kind of miss yourself out with the name. Yeah, for some... Somehow I woke up and found that very interesting. It was going so fast with each breath that it had to be different person. What was especially interesting was that there were these names that people coming up that I didn't know. It didn't even happen, but I just kind of let all of that just be there. I didn't sort of force myself to be there. It also happened very quickly. But it was interesting to have that happen and then let some, well, okay, that came up anyway. And if you don't want it to, then let that all be there. And just sort of keep building the feelings of how the kinds of people. Very surprising people, you know, that I haven't thought about for many years. Yeah. I'm sorry. How many of you were surprised by the names that came up? Some people were so far in my past, I mean, remember the childhood, just the generation. Just a sense of them or face on. It's odd the way it worked that way sometimes. It's people from the far past. You haven't thought about them for 10 years or something and suddenly, somehow they're the people that come out to this little simple exercise. Why is that? I don't know. They found a place in our heart sometimes or in our psyche. Sometimes when you, you know, it's just a thought, but you touch on some aspect of broken kindness to yourself. You know, that's the beginning part of it and maybe it sort of reaches in somehow, just like that, into some place that you don't normally contact, that might be related to being very young. It might have felt for yourself in the long term, going on for some time. It's absolutely embarrassing for some people. The associations and things. Apparently when people die, as they're dying, sometimes they'll remember things in their life they haven't remembered for 20, 30, 40, 60 years. It's just interesting, you know, at certain, what becomes significant when a person's on their deathbed? What becomes significant when you're deep in a meditative state? What are the acts, what are the activities, what are the relationships that have really made an impact on us? And sometimes they're not necessarily what you thought they were. Sometimes they're just really small acts. And Jack Cornfield likes to point this out. He has an exercise where he has people think about a good deed they've done. And some people have a hard time thinking of one. And sometimes they remember it's really insignificant. You know, they're doctors and they're saving lives left and right or whatever, you know, what they're doing, you know, it's a major thing. And they don't think about that. They remembered, you know, that maybe 10 years ago or something they helped someone who was sick when they hadn't bought their groceries and they brought their groceries home. And that's what they thought about. That's what came to mind. And if that's what came to mind, where is that equation of significance residing in the heart or in the mind and their memory? And I wonder, you know, the whole notion of Buddhist karma and how there are consequences to acts in part that consequence resides in our heart or in our mind, the substratum there. And what activities, what actions, what intentions carry the most weight in that whatever that substratum where karma resides? And sometimes it's really, you know, really insignificant things seemingly have the biggest impact. Maybe it helps your neighbor when she was sick, you know, buy groceries. There was much more of an openness of the heart there, much more willingness and really desire to help someone. There was much purer than, you know, many things we do much more intentionally later in our life that seemed much more consequential. So that's kind of what, that's what the memory, the karmic memory, that's what stayed maybe or that's what comes up again. So I don't know, I mean, I don't know how all this, you know, how it really works, all this stuff, but it's nice to point it out because it's for me, it's a reminder to honor much more, respect much more the little details in life, the little connections and how I connect with someone, you know, just even casually. That it might be more important that I, who knows, it might be more important that I stopped and let a pedestrian walk in front of me who had a lot of heavy bags or something than it was for me to kind of, I don't know, make a donation to the Nature Conservancy or whatever, you know, I don't know. So in terms of karma, in a way, karma works, who knows how it works. So I pay much more attention to details than I used to, to small things, small acts. Now the surprise too was that you were seeing every breath, you know, somebody knew, or I mean, I was really racing down the roster, all the people, and it was something that was very, I mean, not automatic, but it was spontaneously arising and I couldn't, I couldn't do my standard on selected screening because every breath, somebody knew, had a couple of people. Yeah, so it's less inhibited maybe. And so were you surprised? You were surprised maybe the names that came up. Were you surprised also perhaps that you could have some modicum of loving kindness towards those names? I was surprised that I should have a share number. Share number. I was surprised that I was. Sorry? I was surprised in that way. I was surprised I couldn't remember names. I just got the feeling of mercy. Just how? Yeah. When Sylvia Borstein does her Wednesday morning class at Spirit Rock, I guess they sit together for 45 minutes before the beginning. And at the end of the class, they switch to new loving kindness practice. And then at the end of the loving kindness period, the five or ten minutes they have, they'll, at some point, everyone will start saying out loud, quietly, but out loud. Names of people they want to send loving kindness to. And I've only been to it once. Probably the effect would wear off if I kept going for me. But just sitting there in the middle of this room and hearing all these names, all these, you know, there were like 30 people in the room, maybe more, maybe, all these names, you know. And I was really moved to almost here. All these feelings of loving kindness. And most of all, I thought I could hear someone's name that I knew. So anything else before we end? So this is the last class. And, you know, I've mentioned this many times now, it's my desire to be able to have a loving kindness class every Thursday at 5.30, 6.30. It just seems like a great thing to offer the community. And as we kind of go through it, we'll make up new ways. And you have to be creative, I guess, if we keep doing it for a long time. But I don't think, you know, I can't do it from now on through December. And I thought maybe near the end of January we could start again. And then I might be able to do it for quite some time, you know, just four weeks or six weeks, just, and then it becomes a different event then. We'll see what that's like just to do it as an ongoing event. But when I started up again in maybe near the end of January, I was thinking the easiest way of doing it is just to start over again. Go through the whole series. It doesn't seem like that ever gets old. Does that seem okay with you? Any of you might be interested? Or should we just kind of go on to advance loving kindness? Directly. Sure. He hasn't been so expert yet. Me neither. I love doing this class. It's not only that it's nice doing it, but it's nice just to know that I'm going to be doing it. And have it in my mind, loving kindness. It's kind of a reminder during the week. What do you do with advanced loving kindness? Well, that's when you do it to yourself. It's the beginning and the end. I don't know what advanced loving kindness is. We'll have to discover it together. So, then I thought it was a way of ending then. Because I think we started that way, maybe the first days. Everybody can go around and say their name so we can all hear it again. Jennifer. Anne. Stacy. Kristina. Marjorie. Yvonne. Rita. Gus. John.
