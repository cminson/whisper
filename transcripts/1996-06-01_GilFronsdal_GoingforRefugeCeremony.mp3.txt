 So I'll read now from the Parinibhanasutta. And the Buddha says, You should live as islands unto yourselves, Being your own refuge, With no one else as your refuge, With a Dhamma as an island, With a Dhamma as your refuge, With no other refuge. And how does a person live as an island unto himself, With no other refuge? Here a person abides, Contemplating the body as body, Earnestly, clearly aware, mindful, And having put away all hankering And fretting for the world. And likewise, With regard to feelings, mind and mind objects. That is how a person lives, As an island unto oneself, As one's own refuge, Taking the Dhamma as a refuge, With no other refuge but the Dhamma. And having talked and discussed a little bit the refuge, It's quite a strong statement right near the end of the Buddha's life, Where he says, Take no other refuge but yourself, Take no other refuge but the Dhamma. And since those statements, you know, Would have to logically be the same, Otherwise they contradict each other, There's some way of understanding the Dhamma and Dhamma And oneself as being the same. And this, When you come forward up in the front, Pasha, You can hear. And we can be more intimate. There's some way of understanding the word Dhamma, Dhamma in Pali, And oneself, true self, Real self as being perhaps the same. So the Buddha says, Take oneself as one's own refuge, Take the Dhamma as a refuge. And then he explains how to do that actually. And what's very interesting for us, Since we practice Four Foundations of Mindfulness, He then goes on to say, You practice the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness is the way That you take refuge in the self, The way you take refuge in the Dhamma. And so, you know, we talked in the class about how each of us Would have their own understanding of what it means to take refuge In Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha. And this ceremony we'll do tonight is really a place Where each of us can hopefully feel really acknowledged In what's already true for each of you. That there's some commitment, some intent, That brings you to practice, it brings you to the Sangha, That is quite strong. And so you're inspired to come to a ceremony like this, Most of you came to the classes. So this is already a chance to acknowledge what's already here. And to think what it's a means to take refuge in Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. And this ceremony normally in Southeast Asia Would happen on either the full moon or the new moon. Probably on the full moon, like we have here. Those two, the full moon, the new moon, And often the quarter moons in between, Are the holy days in Theravada Buddhism. And that's a day that the lay people would most frequently come to a temple To make offerings, to meditate, to practice, And to take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha, And to receive the precepts from the monks And then try to live by those precepts during those days. So here we are, it's a full moon. And the last full moon that we had a celebration Was the Buddha's birthday enlightenment And his passing away day, a month ago. So this is kind of like, we've been studying the precepts a little bit And the refuges in between. And the moon, as I think many of you know, Is symbolic in Buddhism for enlightenment Or for the fullness, for the wholeness of life That can be experienced through one's own realization. The luminous quality of the moon is sometimes likened To the luminous quality of the mind that is free and pure. And I was thinking about this, the full moon Which maybe we'll see tonight, depending. I see it. We'll see. You wait, you'll wait. Just wait a few more minutes. Perfect. So the moon is full. And then sometimes we say the moon is new. Or we say the moon is quarter full, or whatever we say. And the whole idea of the moon is new or old Or full or empty or whatever, all these words. The moon couldn't care less. The identity that we attribute to the moon Has nothing to do with what the moon actually is. But rather, as a particular vantage point, perspective we have on the moon In relation to the sun and all That we see the moon in a certain way And then we say, well that moon is full, that moon is empty Or that moon is new, or that moon is full But actually, it has nothing to do with the nature of the moon The moon couldn't care less what the people down here on the earth Are saying about it And it's particularly not anxious That we think that it's one way or the other And I think to take refuge in the self, take refuge in the dharma Is to perhaps take refuge in some aspect of ourselves Which is like that aspect of the moon Which is unfazed by the normal kind of identities That many people get caught up in And we try to defend, we try to assert on the world We try to... That gets demolished, gets criticized You know, all these terrible things that happen around this notion of self And is there some aspect of self Which is unfazed by the names that we call it By the identities we assume on it Is there some aspect of dharma, of reality as it is Which has nothing to do with sufficiency or insufficiency or adequacy or inadequacy Or with the kind of normal polarities That many of our lives swing back and forth between So I believe to take refuge in dharma Take refuge in what can be called maybe the true self I think we have to say the true self Where the Buddha says take refuge in the self He doesn't mean the small sense of self The egotistical sense of self That is many of the places where a lot of suffering arises But rather he's talking about taking refuge in some sense of self Some true sense of self, some profounder sense And there is this expression of forgetting the self Forgetting oneself And Mazzen Master Dogen has that famous quote Which I like so much To study Buddhism is to study the self To study the self is to forget the self And to forget the self is to be awakened by all things But we have this expression in English to forget oneself But I think to forget oneself happens a lot in our life Where we simply forget that we're operating on some egotistical sense of self And we're just going along full speed ahead With our pride or insecurity or whatever And we've forgotten ourselves in the midst of being insecure or being full of pride And I don't think that's what's being talked about Rather it's the disappearance of self Disappearance of that small self Which is a possibility When we're engaged fully with our life When we sit quietly and let our mind be uncombered By the normal proliferation of concepts and ideas about who we are As opposed to actually letting who we are express itself and come bubble up through us Rather than overlaying some ideas of who we are But allow to bubble up through us is often a frightening thing Because it represents the unknown It has to represent the unknown To really allow yourself to be yourself Is to enter into an unknown territory Because who knows? If you're not having concepts or ideas to hold things in neat categories And you're allowing a deeper sense of self to arise with the self forgotten The surface self forgotten One has to be quite willing In a sense kind of courageous To let go of control, to let go of defense, to let go of fixed ideas And allow the inner expression to come out It's very easy to set up the idea of the disappearance of self To being a passive state where the mind is kind of empty of concepts and ideas And I think that's often a place where we first get a sense of what Of a new possibility of existing in world Is from the sense of meditation Of letting a normal kind of neurotic sense of self settle down and disappear And feel a sense of well-being that isn't part of the normal polarities That so much confuse us in our lives But if it's only passive, it's only meditation, it's only half the work And the other half I think of practice Is to allow that deeper sense of self to express itself in our life and the life around us And not to allow the moon to be something off in the distant But allow the moon to exist in our very activities themselves So to take refuge in all this To take refuge in what I hope is this deep interconnectedness To something that's much more enduring than any of the changing ideas of who we might be They talk a lot in Buddhism about the deathless The deathless is the only thing which is maybe reliable enough for any kind of security To take refuge in Buddha Dharma and the Sangha I think many of us know that the normal refuges that people in our culture take as supports To rely on are notoriously unreliable A lot of people put their refuge in their bank account Or in their jobs or in their relationships Or in their health or in whatever Things that are very changeable And the great, there were some of us, I don't know if anybody here, but there was a Yaka Valley retreat A 20 day retreat down in the desert some years ago And people were sitting very quietly meditating for all these days And I think it was during the Dharma talk, there was this massive earthquake And people came back and reported that what they usually took quite for granted Something was quite reliable, the solidity of the earth Simply was unreliable during that earthquake Or my experience in Burma, of finding I kind of think that money is pretty reliable stuff I grew up thinking that the green dollar bill was like, you can always depend on it It's value might decrease a little bit over the years, but basically it was reliable stuff So when I went to Burma, I kind of think it was the same thing, that the money was reliable It was pretty much given And so there I converted a lot of my American dollars into Burmese money And then retreated to the monastery to meditate And in the middle of my retreat there, after about four months The government decided that all the money that I had Was from one day to the next, was worthless It wasn't worth anything So I was rather surprised I thought money kind of was money And how could I wake up one morning and find out that this was just Now it's worth as much as toilet paper It was rather of a shock to me So where do we usually put our trust? What do we really rely on? And what can we rely on? And one of the things that I've learned that we can rely on That we really take refuge in, is in practice itself That the mindfulness practice, that is one of the more enduring refuges we can take And because the mindfulness practice teaches us that the way in which we respond Or react to the world, fits into our choice The world of our choice Isn't that obvious always when we first start practicing that we're acting out of choice But our response to the conditions around us Has to do with our choice Whether we hate something or whether we desire something Belongs to the world of choice and intention And as we begin seeing this and as the normal holds of the mind begin soften a little bit And you see an alternative way of being What practice teaches us is that at least we can rely on practice That our response to a situation will not get us into deeper trouble That our response to a situation will not be a tightening up of the mind or the heart Or that creates increasing suffering Even though what happens around us might be very difficult and painful And who knows what happens around us Who knows if they, you know, wake up tomorrow and all your dollar bills disappear Or the banks burn down or an earthquake or you get sick I mean who knows all these things might change But if you bring your practice to all those changing things Then you bring the possibility of at least you and your response to that situation Can remain balanced and open You can still remain open regardless of what happens to you And that's the offering of what practice offers And that's a kind of a refuge to know that at least you don't have to add to the situation By the way in which you react and respond So for me, I take refuge in that and that's a very important source of refuge for me And when I take refuge in Buddha Dharma and Asanga In part, I'm taking refuge in my ability to practice and my trust in the practice There are many situations I find myself in Where I simply don't know what the right answer is, how to respond But But I feel like I can always trust The practice The process of mindfulness, of noticing my reactions and responses And learning somehow to maintain some freedom and perspective In the midst of all the difficulties regardless of what's happening So there are three different areas of taking refuge Which I talked about the first class And one of them is there's the intentional aspect That this is a choice that we make That we want to intend our life, incline our life in a certain direction We want to orient our life in a certain direction And this is it, you know, so you come here tonight with an intention You've hopefully reflect a little bit of what it means for you to take refuge And it's something you'd like to do And it represents some intention to practice Some intention of involvement with For whatever Buddha Dharma Sangha means for you There's an intention The second understanding of refuge is it has to do with an understanding A knowledge And sometimes that's clear than At sometimes clearer than other times An understanding of maybe what the potential is Of freedom The potential of an awakened mind, of an open mind And some of you have touched that And some of you have smelled it And some of you have seen shadows of it But we all know it in some way And the third is there's an emotional or devotional aspect of taking refuge And that'll vary among different people The strength of the emotional aspect But there can well up within us a tremendous amount of faith and reverence Gratitude and love For the Buddha Dharma and the Sangha For the practice For our own hearts as they open up For our own minds as they become more open and free And for the Sangha and the community people That we share this wonderful practice with We share this freedom And movement towards freedom Towards kindness Towards compassion I can't see the candles over there Are they okay? And the last thing I want to say about refuge Is that normally we say we take refuge Or we go for refuge It's something intentional when we do But I believe that there's no reason to do that And that's why I'm not going to do that I'm going to do that And I'm going to do that And I'm going to do that And I'm going to do that And I'm going to do that But I believe that there's no going for refuge Taking refuge without simultaneously offering refuge to others That the two go hand in hand And that as we take refuge in Buddha Dharma and the Sangha I hope that what we have in mind also Is that we then become a field and offering We also become an intention to also help support other people In their own negotiation Their own way of finding Their own deep sense of self Their own deep expressivity Their own deep freedom and potential of what's within them And it doesn't mean making anybody a Buddhist It means helping people find out who they really are In the context of who they are Rather than making them look like they're Buddhist But to offer refuge To offer a place where people feel safe to be themselves Is I think one of the things it means to also to take refuge So I hope that you consider that also as you As you embark and engage on this ceremony I think the three treasures or the three jewels Which is what we take refuge in Is also a cave or a room or a cavern That we enter into to explore And to discover what actually are these things And I think it becomes a lifelong exploration Within this great cavern, this great container of practice And I like somewhat that I don't know where I got this idea But that the idea of being open To be open-hearted, open-minded, to be free Is very closely related in my mind to the notion of being interested To be open-minded also means thanks to me to be interested in what's going on And questioning, interested in questioning what's happening And I think that as we go into the refuge As we go into a life of practice That we take, that is a life of interest in the world around us in ourselves And a life of questioning, of deep questioning That not taking things for granted Not taking Buddhism for granted Not taking any religious discipline for granted Not taking any teacher for granted But rather it's a life where we go in and question deeply What is being said? What is the situation here? And who am I in this context? What do I bring to it? It's a life of questioning Of a life of perhaps of seeking in a sense Questioning, questioning interest, seeking interest With the understanding that in what's said in many different traditions Is that often what we are seeking in a deep spiritual life is that which seeks That the impetus to seek to be interested The impetus to question the desire to be open To be compassionate, to seek for some truth That desire is the very thing that we're seeking It's really a beautiful thing within us That desire is part of this deep expressitivity Of the Dharma that moves through us Of the deep self That that which seeks itself That which searches That which inspired or has the intention to practice So as we take refuge in Bhura Dharma Sangha I hope that some of you think of it as also taking refuge And that movement to practice The inspiration and intention to practice That you find some protection and refuge in it So what I have here for you all is a little statement or document that I've written For each of you to receive And part of it is a kind of you'll see when you look at it But it's kind of a it's it looks like a leaf The drawing but it's actually kind of like a mandala And it's to recognize that each of us exists in a mandala Of interconnected practitioners That each of us is not alone in practicing But rather our ability to practice Our inspiration to practice Our coming to practice And even though the possibility to practice The support we have to continue our practice Exists because we are we live within an excess within a mandala Of interconnected relationships of other practitioners And so taking refuge tonight I think I want you to think of this also as being Acknowledgement of this interconnected mandala of support That we receive and then we offer to others around us And it's a mandala of support and interconnectedness That goes back 2500 years to the time of the Buddha Where where numerous uncountable people have practiced before us And only because of their practice And we've been able to come here and gather tonight To celebrate in a sense the each of our own engagement with the world of practice And it was brought up last Wednesday that The idea that some of the lineages that go back historically to the Buddha Are predominantly male lineages But as I read the history of Buddhism and kind of dig a little bit deeper Beyond kind of the surface textbook introduction to Buddhism You find that many examples of quite inspiring women Who were essential for this continuation of the practice And that it I don't think of this as being a male dominated tradition Though it often looks like that And we have up here you know on the altar we have the Buddha as an example Of someone who has attained enlightenment and freedom And entered the world with great compassion But the model that the Buddha gives of his life Is a model which many of us in the west question you know how good of a model is that for us A man who whose wife had just given birth to his only son And seeing the situation and feeling somehow feeling there was a hindrance His married life his family life he saw it as such a hindrance in the name that he gave to his son Ruhula means in Sanskrit obstacle So and then he renounced he left his family And went off then and won to run India for you know six seven years before he came back To offer anything in return And there's a lot to be said about that and I'm not going to be critical of it But there are people who wonder well that's not a particularly good model for me Here I am a lay person in the west practicing And here's this person who renounced the lay life and the family and And maybe this is not a particularly good model for me. I don't want to go off and be an ascetic for six years But another figure in the tradition That is as important I feel as the Buddha Is the figure of the Buddha's foster mother Mahaprajapati Whereas the Buddha was the founder of the monk's order Mahaprajapati was a founder of the nun's order And you look at her life of practice and you find a very different role model for That in some ways is maybe more suitable for those of us practicing the west as lay people Mahaprajapati didn't renounce her family But rather she raised the Buddha It was a foster mother of the Buddha the Buddha's mother died when he was seven days old And Mahaprajapati was his aunt And she raised him and she raised two other children of her own And she was the wife of the of the king and so she you know took care of the family And then when the Buddha left She continued to take care of her family responsibilities her responsibilities that she had as the queen of this tribal republic in the Himalayas And she was known as a very wise woman And many people would come to her and many of the women would come to her for advice maybe because she'd gone through a very rich full household life Where a lot of I think wisdom had had she learned a lot of wisdom just from the fact of living in the world itself When her husband had died Which in india was a very difficult time because when a woman was mostly Someone in indian society by being connected to a man and if a husband dies It's very difficult for an indian woman to kind of feel a connection anymore When her husband died Then she went to the buddha And asked if she could also undertake the religious life And here she was already quite aged fairly advanced in age And the buddha in reply didn't say no, I won't ordain you which is sometimes what people think What the buddha said was a little bit different. He said That's enough. Please don't ask that question He didn't say no, he said please don't ask that question and she asked three times and three times he said, please don't ask that question And what could be said about why maybe the buddhas was reluctant to take on that question to respond to that question And then the buddha left Where he was staying and he wandered from two three hundred miles away At which point mahapajapadi Because she was a wise woman not Was known for her wisdom She gathered around her many other women Who had lost their husbands or their family and I don't know why they gathered around her many other women gathered gathered around her And they marched those two three hundred miles to where the buddha was With tremendous determination and seriousness great intent. They weren't going to mess around And showed up and asked again Could they please or be ordained to enter the religious life the monastic life? At which point anandah who is buddha's attendant Intervened and carried the message of this request to the buddha directly and Discussed this matter with the buddha and asked Isn't it true that women can also have the possibility of becoming free and enlightened? And he said of course and then said well, why don't you give them a chance to practice the religious life to become monastic? And he said okay So he agreed But what I think for me the role model of mahapajapadi Of this person who goes through a whole life as a lay person engaged in the world Raising a family becoming wise in that context and from perhaps that wisdom Then entering into a religious life In my mind at least is a much more inspiring Role model for us who are trying to be lay people in the west than the model of the buddha who Attain the same enlightenment But through a very different path So i'm saying all this because the rich mandala the rich Pattern of interconnectedness that supports us here today in our practice today Is made up of many different models of people's practice many different people who practice in many different ways And we have the monastic model strong monastic model of the buddha and we have in a sense the lay model of mahapajapati And down through the ages it goes and uh, I feel very fortunate that in my own In a time that I practice buddhism in the both in the west and the east Was a time when a lot of women were already beginning becoming teachers So So I feel very fortunate at the time that I began practicing buddhism There were in the buddha scenes both here in the west and nolce in asia many, uh women not simply practitioners that I Co-practice with but actually women teachers women who were my teachers that I got to practice under in a sense or study with And uh starting right here at the san francisco zent center. There were already women who had been practicing there for Many many years, uh who then I studied with and I went and discussed my practice with and explored When I went to japan one of the first most First and one of the more impressive teachers that I had a chance to meet there and spend a little time with was a uh Was a was a japanese woman zen teacher And then there was an american, uh zen teacher in japan who was just bubbling heart of compassion And I felt very fortunate to have been able to study in the same monastery with her In um when I went to asia there were I didn't study directly under so many women, but I had the wonderful opportunity to encounter a number of women uh I encountered deepama in kolkata as i've told you a little bit about this wonderful old uh indian woman who poor indian woman who lived in Tenements in the poorer areas of kolkata on the third floor of this tenement building in a small little Apartment with big family and She's considered to be one of the people most realized people most enlightened people to come out of the tradition of meditation that that uh us uh ims the spirit rock teachers teach Very hardly attained and it was wonderful to meet her and uh You know, she gave me her blessing in a sense I felt very lucky to have known her And then when I was in thailand also I met a number of women teachers I didn't really practice under them But I had a chance to talk with them about practice and learn from their experience of their life of practice So I say this to emphasize for all of us how rich it is the the interconnected mandala that we're all part of that It not only includes westerners it includes asians includes europeans includes people in all parts of the world Who are engaged in the practice of truth of waking up? And the mandala interconnecting mandala in a buddhist ceremony. It's mostly we we recognize the buddhist friends that we have but if um You know the dharma people who really find the dharma take refuge in themselves and in deep self sense of self They are found in all religious traditions. That's not something unique to buddhism And so as we practice and we take refuge in buddhist dharma in the sangha and take refuge in ourselves in a deep sense of self the true sense of self I believe that we also become sensitive to recognize the truth That's found in other people also And our own sense of practice and resonates with the practice and awakening of these other people Even though the vocabulary can be quite different So take refuge in the buddhist dharma sangha for me is not simply take refuge in buddhist and buddhist terminology Buddhist ideas and whatever but really take refuge in whatever it is whoever it is that seems to resonate with what's true with awakening with freedom and and to find inspiration from that meeting of uh other free people one of the Freeest people I thought I ever met in my life Outside of the world of buddhism for me was a sufi teacher. I met in turkey a few years ago And it was I felt so at home being with him In a sense, I feel like I could take refuge in in the dharma the buddhist dharma in that teacher also So i'm speaking for myself now So, I don't know what it is. You know, we have I haven't heard from each of you what it really means for each of you But i'm very happy uh to be here this evening with all of you and to know that all of you come here with um intention with some sense of connectedness to The buddhist dharma and the sangha And then we share This in this wonderful mandala that we've created here tonight Um supportive mandala of fellow practitioners And for those of you who are from palau Alto, you know, I think it's quite phenomenal What has happened here in over the last years? In developing this interconnected supportive group of friends Who practice together and support each other and inspire each other And I hope that each of you inspires All the rest of us and i'm inspired by all of the people who come to our sangha in palau Alto And i'm very grateful extremely grateful for the inspiration and the support that I feel I get from all of you From all of you So it's gotten dark I was hoping uh part of this I was hoping actually In the back of this there's the metasuta And I suspect some of you can't read it. Is that right? Because it's too dark It's too dark, okay. Well just no It's especially in the japanese zen tradition Um There's a way in which um, if you can't do something just read define you kind of redefine it Um Anyway, maybe i'll just read it What I wanted us for all of us to read together as a chant Maybe we'll do some monday night Maybe we can do that as a monday night to make up for the part of the ceremony we're missing tonight Or perhaps it was intended I told you the story of practicing in japan at the zen monastery It was you know, very intense rinzai monastery and rinzai Monisters are known for being kind of anti-study Anyway, these kind of just special transmission outside of words. You just have to be careful Practice and realize for yourself if we get the words forget the teachings burn the books burn the buddhas burn your teachers Which is you have to do what you have to do at some point at least metaphorically But so in this very intensive zen monastery they had Suddenly they had this hour for study And they rang the bell and we had to get ourselves in a meditation posture on our meditation meditation platforms And we had our books our sutras and these wonderful kind of sutra covers cloths And you have to be a choreographed way in which you open this cloth and you open your book and it stands open And you chant for a while you chant these sutras you have these chants for you know studying So you go through all this and as we're doing all this preparation It's it's dusk and it's getting darker and darker And then it gets darker and darker and then it's finally a time to read And They don't turn lights on So we had this hour period of study with our books open in the dark And I don't think it was unintentional They had done their required hour of study But they had managed to continue with their meditation practice understood by such complicated words So think of this as think as I read this think of this as something we're chanting altogether This is the work of those who are skilled and peaceful who seek the good May they be able and upright straightforward Of gentle speech and not proud May they be content and easily supported Unburdened with their senses calmed May they be wise not arrogant without desire for the possessions of others May they do nothing mean or that the wise would reprove May all beings be happy May they live in safety and joy All living beings whether weak or strong tall stout medium or short seen on scene Near or distant born or to be born May they all be happy Let no one deceive another or despise any being in any state Let none by anger or hatred wish harm to another As a mother watches over her child willing to risk her own life to protect her only child So with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings suffusing the whole world with unobstructed loving kindness Standing or walking sitting or lying down During all one's waking hours May one remain mindful of this heart and this way of living that is the best in the world unattached to speculations views and sense desires With clear vision such a person will never be reborn in the cycles of suffering So now we'll Do the chanting that we do we're taking refuge So you can take your um Strings You're pretty called protection cord and um And one of the meanings of a refuge is it's a protection And you can figure out for yourself what is a protection from And what we'll do is um as we Will chant the refuges in Pali taking refuge in buddhadharma sangha And then we finish the refuges chanting it all then you can tie a single knot in this cord And that knot will represent your intention of taking refuge And then we'll take the precepts and i'll chant them in Pali best I can And then i'll recite them in English and then you can repeat them in English after I've said them And then when we finish the five precepts, then you can tie another knot in the cord as a way of symbolizing that intention So i'll start with a namo tasa chant and And I will chant the full chant the full line And then you can repeat And i'm sorry that uh If you don't know it that the lights are dim that's ok Baga Vortex Bada Namo dasa, Bhagavato, Arahdo, Samma, Sambuddha, Namo dasa, Bhagavato, Arahdo, Samma, Sambuddha, Namo dasa, Bhagavato, Arahdo, Samma, Sambuddha, Sam. Now recite the refuge and after I recite it then you can repeat.

And when you're finished you can bow to each other.
