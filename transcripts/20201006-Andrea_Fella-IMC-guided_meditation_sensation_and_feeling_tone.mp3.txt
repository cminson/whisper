This meditation will be in two parts. 
We'll just settle at the beginning and then right at the end I'll come in with a little bit of a, um, some suggestions for attending to particular aspect of experience, the feeling tone, which is the topic for the, for the talk today. 
But we'll just start with the kind of settling as usual. 
Start, it can be helpful to start by just acknowledging where and how you are just here, in this place and time, in this body. 
I'm just taking in how you are right now and no judgment, but just kind of like taking inventory. 
Is the body tense or relaxed? Is the mind agitated or at ease? And just, just acknowledge that and see if there can just be a, okay, that's how it is right now. 
Just kind of starting there with awareness of how you are. 
Then a condition that supports our capacity to be present, our capacity to be aware, is relaxation of body and mind. 
And having checked in, you may notice, you may know or recognize that their particular aspects or areas of tension. 
And if you have noticed that, you might just explore the possibility of relaxing the body. 
Maybe even a possibility of relaxing inside the body. 
Sometimes that's a place where there's physical tension that's held. 
And if we attune to that area, sometimes it can soften. 
If we attune to it with the intention of relaxing, so maybe the inside of the throat can relax. 
Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can relax. 
Maybe the stomach and intestines can relax. 
Maybe too the mind can relax, letting go perhaps of worries, concerns about the past or the future, setting them aside for now. 
Maybe too as an analogy for relaxing the mind. 
Sometimes it can be helpful, as Gil suggests, maybe the brain can relax. 
This relaxation connecting to the conditions that support the meditation and clining towards relaxation. 
You could say as kind of a setting up a container for the meditation. 
With that relaxation, perhaps you can recognize that you're aware. 
First, aware of whatever is obvious. 
Maybe aware of how relaxed or tense the body is. 
Just aware of what's here in this moment. 
Often body sensation is obvious. 
In the past weeks, we've been exploring awareness of body. 
So maybe there's awareness of sensations in the body. 
Often a very obvious aspect of experience. 
Maybe the pressure, the hips are contacting, the chair, cushion, bench. 
Maybe sensations of feet or hands. 
Maybe they're contacting. 
Maybe a broader sense of the body. 
Maybe the breath. 
What is the actual experience that's happening in the physical experience? In talking about what I've just said, the contact points, the contact, the place where the hands and feet touch, the breath. 
All of that is known through actual sensations. 
Maybe you can touch into the sensation level of experience. 
The pressure, wherever it's obvious, whatever experience in the physical realm is obvious. 
Maybe you're noticing pressure of hardness or softness. 
Maybe you're tingling or vibration, pulsing. 
Maybe movement if you're attending to the breath, expansion, contraction. 
Maybe temperature. 
Maybe moisture or dryness. 
What is the actual experience happening in the present moment? In this way, touching into essentially how our physical body communicates. 
It doesn't communicate the physical body. 
It doesn't communicate through concepts of hand or foot or even breathing. 
It communicates through sensation. 
Can you know the sensations that are happening right now? You're welcome to just be attending to whatever is obvious for you in the physical body right now. 
With a breath, if that's more comfortable. 
You don't have to go digging for knowing what the sensations are. 
Just whatever kind of is most clear what's coming to you. 
Going to relaxation and a receiving of these sensations. 
Letting them come to you. 
Of course, the mind will wander or get lost in thought. 
At some point, equally, naturally, the mindfulness will return and you'll become aware again. 
In that moment, when we become aware again, often we become aware that we've been lost in thought. 
We become aware of that because we're aware of something here now. 
So can that be the curiosity? What's here now? Sometimes after the mind wandering in thought, there is sometimes a tension that creeps back in. 
If that has happened, it can be really helpful to not try to jump back to where you were when the mind wandered, whatever you were paying attention to before the mind wandered. 
It's allowing a relaxation of body and mind, taking a few moments to allow that relaxation again. 
With that relaxation, the mind relaxes again, it supports awareness. 
What are you aware of? I'm going to see actual experience that you're aware of. 
We'll sit together in silence for some time and I'll come back in towards the end. 
Thank you.

Thank you. 
In the last few minutes, I'd like to explore a little bit around the feeling tone of experience in your practice. 
So just allowing your attention to connect with whatever is the most obvious physical sensation in your experience. 
Maybe new attending to the quality of that experience as we were doing before, the hardness, the pressure, vibration or tingling, heat or coolness, whatever that is for just a moment, letting yourself take that in. 
And then what is the flavor of the experience in terms of pleasant, unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant, neutral quality? Maybe obvious or not so obvious, just seeing if you can recognize whether that experience is pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. 
And as you know that aspect of pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, does it get stronger or weaker or stay the same? And you may notice perhaps along with the quality of pleasant or unpleasant, sometimes with neutral also, that there's a response to that. 
And as pleasant, we often like it. 
And as unpleasant, we often don't like it. 
That's happening, just acknowledging that, okay, it's unpleasant and not liking is happening. 
It's pleasant and liking, appreciating, delighting in is happening. 
There's a difference between the pleasant, unpleasant, neutral quality and the response to it, just seeing if that can be recognized. 
Relax as you explore this, again, it's what can be received rather than trying to dig. 
Letting go of that for now, for the last minute or so of the sitting, just letting the attention kind of float freely to whatever it's drawn to in the physical experience. 
And see if you can be curious about whether what it's drawn to has a pleasant quality, an unpleasant quality, or a neutral quality. 
Thank you. 
And then for the last little bit of the sitting, just the last few seconds, I'd like to invite you to allow the corners of your mouth to turn up in a half smile and see what happens to the feeling tone of your experience as you do that. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
