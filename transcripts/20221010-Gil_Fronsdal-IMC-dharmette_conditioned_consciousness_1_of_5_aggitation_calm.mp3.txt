So this will be the first talk in a series following last week's On Consciousness, where I'll attempt to talk about how different factors of the mind, mind activities, can affect the quality or the characteristics of consciousness, how we are aware of being conscious. 
Overall, if that purpose of these talks don't quite work for you, don't worry too much about it. 
I think what I'll be teaching about will have other value in addition. 
So what I'd like to do is to set up the idea of contrasts, that different contrasts of different mind states will have different effects on how we feel aware, how we have a sense of what being conscious is, and to the degree to which we have a sense of being of consciousness, that that sense of consciousness can be affected by these different contrasting mind states. 
And so for today, the talk is about agitation and calm. 
Agitation can be coarse, and many people associate meditation with becoming calm. 
But one that is not known and recognized is that as we become calmer in meditation, we start uncovering deeper and deeper layers of agitation, maybe quieter, more subtle layers of it that are invisible to us in the ordinary states of mind, that as we go, and in fact some of the places that we feel as we recognize the deeper, very subtle agitation, is in contrast to ordinary states of mind when we're agitated, it might seem like a calm state. 
But when we're deeply calm, we still see there's a little bit of agitation, tension, pressure. 
So learning to recognize the contrast between calm and agitation, learning to be accepting of agitation so that we can be aware of it carefully and fully, is an important part of this path to freedom. 
And to emphasize this, part of the classic teachings of Buddhism is that agitation sometimes is explicitly that word, sometimes restlessness, it's that word that's used, are the last attachment, the last hindrance, last piece of dukkha, ouch, suffering that remains before a person becomes fully liberated. 
In fact, you have to be fully liberated to let go of the last vestiges of restlessness and agitation. 
And so if you have some agitation in your meditation, then it certainly means you're not fully awakened, but it also means that you're human, and this is part of the parcel of being human that we're working with and becoming wise about how to be with agitation. 
And calm can set in all kinds of different stages of meditation or all kinds of qualities of it. 
There can be the first really palpable and impactful experience of calm that I experienced, at least in my spiritual life, especially before I was interested in spirituality, was when I was 18 and I went into a little Catholic chapel in France, and immediately this calm descended in the cool ancient chapel with stone walls. 
And there was something about the cool, clear, crisp air, the history of the chapel, maybe, the atmosphere there or the associations I had with it, who knows. 
But I felt this calm settle into my body that I just found so stunning, and I kind of stayed lingering with it for a long time. 
And then I found myself being agitated in rush hour traffic here in the Bay Area freeways, and then decided, well, I'm here for a while, and I have better things to do than be agitated, and then finding some simple modicum of calm to settle into and just settle in the chair, in the seat in the car and be still and look around at the other drivers, wish them well. 
And nothing that dramatic, nothing that I would want to linger in or feel that was something spiritual, but it was available and content with that. 
Part of the advantage of calm in the path of liberation is that as we become calmer, we're able to see more clearly. 
As we become calmer, we have access to more wisdom and skillfulness and understanding of where to go from here, including how to not feed the agitation, how not to get agitated because we're agitated, but rather to support and nourish the calm, to feed the calm is the language of the Buddha. 
And he says that nourishment for calm is calm. 
So if you don't have any calm, you can't nourish yourself with it, but if you recognize some degree of calm within, even a small degree, then that calm can as the food for becoming more calm, in the same way agitation is the food for more agitation. 
So to be able to see the contrast between calm and agitation gives us the wisdom to know which one to attend to the most, not to ignore the agitation, but to learn to tend to the calm enough that we can be calmly aware of the agitation. 
And that way we're not feeding the agitation. 
And each of these calm and agitation has a different effect on how we experience consciousness, how we experience being aware. 
That agitation can make the awareness agitated. 
Agitation is a kind of a movement that feels uncomfortable and so it's localized. 
You can feel it's a certain place and it tends to ground or settle or gather or kind of tie consciousness to a bounded, smaller, tighter place within. 
And sometimes it's so agitated that it's really hard to even know we're aware or to be, you know, to tune into what consciousness is like when we're agitated. 
It's impossible. 
It's almost like it's absent. 
But as we become calm, calm can have a location in the body, but it tends to have soft boundaries. 
It tends to be not moving and jumping around so much. 
And it tends to kind of have a smooth or relaxed or porous boundaries that spreads out through the body. 
And sometimes calm, especially mental calm, can feel the same way that it just has no boundaries so much so that the calm can feel like it's in the room. 
Even though the room conventionally is agitated because our calm is so strong, it kind of spills over into our sense or feeling of the room, at least how we're aware of the room, the awareness that is there. 
And so one of the most precious resources we have is our capacity for attention, for awareness of being conscious. 
And this amazingly precious resource, amazingly precious kind of treasure that we have, its characteristics and its availability and its way in which supports us can vary a lot depending on how agitated we are or how calm we are. 
And one of the things that you might consider doing today, in the next 24 hours, is two things. 
One is just become attuned to the presence of agitation and calm. 
And just that attunement, that recognition of them, it might be enough, you don't have to fix anything, but just what happens when you see it clearly? You might find yourself shifting even unintentionally in a positive direction by that clear awareness of it. 
And then if you can be calmly aware of your agitation, what happens then? What shifts then? And I'm not going to suggest that you become aware of the calm in an agitated way, but that if you did that, that would have a different kind of effect. 
But then also, the second thing to do is to be aware of, kind of see if you can notice, what is your sense of being conscious like, being aware like, at times you're more agitated and at times you're more calm. 
Does your sense of what awareness is, or its location, or its qualities, or its characteristics, shift and change depending on where you are on the agitation, calm spectrum? And so finally I'll say that the deeper we go in this exploration of calm and agitation, one of the things we can discover is a lot of the agitation that we can experience is connected to our idea of self, our idea of me, myself, and mine. 
And that's one of the ways to get a handle on or to put a big question mark next to our agitation, not to make it as such a reified thing, but to realize that what's agitated is our sense idea of self. 
And that as we get calmer, our idea of self shifts and changes as well. 
And the relationship between consciousness and self is one of these fascinating things to discover. 
And so one saying, we could say, to assert the self is to be agitated. 
To forget the self is to be calm and wise. 
To assert the self is to be agitated and foolish. 
To forget the self is to be calm and wise. 
So thank you very much and I hope your exploration of calm and agitation makes you wiser.
