These four areas for developing awareness can work together cooperatively and support each other. 
They bring a very interesting and useful perspective to our lives. 
 Often when we pay attention and perceive the world around us or inside of us, it is all too easy to do so with preconceived ideas and agendas oriented to certain areas that we think are important. 
These Four Foundations or four areas are useful perspectives to keep in mind when looking at our life. 
For example, some people might be oriented towards: “What’s in it for me? What am I going to get out of this experience?” With the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, we would ask instead: “What is the physical experience here? What is the feeling tone here? What mind state is present?” Then, “What are the dhammas? What processes of being caught or free are playing out as I practice?” Sometimes when we look at the world, we look through what we do not like, what frightens us, or what is unpleasant for us, and we react to it from that point of view. 
But instead, we can ask: “How is it physically? How is the feeling tone? How is the mind state? How are the dhammas?”  There could be a lot of self-orientation going on. 
Instead of self-orientation, we practice the Four Foundations. 
Practicing these is like going through the scales. 
We can tell ourselves, “Given what is happening now, let’s look at them from these vantage points.” They are the four vantage points that the Buddha offers for the path to awakening, freedom, and everything that is wholesome and skillful – a heap of wholesomeness. 
For the Buddha, it is phenomenally healthy and beneficial to cultivate this kind of awareness. 
Of course, it is about you in a certain way. 
But the self is not the orientation with which we are looking, analyzing, and understanding the situation. 
To cultivate open awareness that is liberating, freeing, and healthy, the Buddha is saying to notice instead how it is in your body. 
Notice the feeling tones – how an experience is taken in and registered as pleasant, unpleasant, or neither. 
Notice the qualities of the mind – the state of the mind. 
Is it contracted? Is it expansive? Is it filled with intense desire or intense aversion? Or is it not? Does the mind feel caught? Does the mind feel free? These categories have no self in them. 
These questions are not the same as asking, “Am I caught? Am I filled with greed? Am I aversive? Am I contracted?” None of the instructions in the satipaṭṭhāna involve the perspective of me, myself, and I. 
This can be such a relief. 
It can also be a challenge because of how common it is to have that perspective. 
But we can put that aside and evoke a different perspective. 
The advantage of doing so is that the perspective of looking at things from the point of view of me, myself, and mine (What’s in it for me? How am I being seen? What is good for me, and how I am) is a magnet for all kinds of unskillful, unhealthy attitudes and states of mind. 
It tends to reduce our open-handedness, our open-heartedness, our open-mindedness. 
Instead of taking the direction of what’s happening to me? How am I doing? How are people treating me? What is going on here for me? Am I improving? I am getting better; I am getting worse; I am a meditation failure – see if you can put all these things with the word “I “ or “ me” aside, and bring into play a different perspective: the Four Foundations. 
 Use what you have learned about mindfulness of the body. 
Go back and read some of the exercises or listen to some of the talks about mindfulness of the body. 
Cultivate a greater connection to the body. 
It is you, but you do not have to think about it as being you. 
Of course, this is who you are paying attention to. 
If you are paying attention to your body, you are paying attention to yourself. 
But to operate, analyze, and react to the situation by adding the idea of me, myself, and mine is extra, especially when we are meditating. 
Instead, stay with the simplicity of the body, the feeling tones, the mind states, and the dhammas. 
 Another orientation in the sutta is not to try to get anything out of the practice or understand or analyze the situation. 
The river of life goes through us, and things are always changing, always moving. 
We tune in from the perspective of the Four Foundations. 
 So there is another perspective: the perspective of change, of things coming and going, and seeing this in an open-hearted, open-minded way. 
To rest or float and keep opening to the flow of change – the flow of experience – is a very helpful way to loosen the grip of attachments. 
This flow is only available or best available when we are centered in awareness: in the direct experience of body, feelings, mind states, and the dhammas. 
Let it all flow. 
This teaches us how not to cling and grasp. 
 The Five Hindrances are forms of grasping or clinging that diminish our freedom. 
They diminish the clarity with which we can see things. 
For the Buddha, they diminish our wisdom. 
When you are caught in the Five Hindrances, bring forth the Four Foundations. 
When you are caught in a hindrance, how is that in the body? What is its feeling tone? What mind states are there? Then, just be really present for each hindrance, in and of itself, as it comes and goes, letting go of it. 
 Referencing the Four Foundations applies also to the way in which we practice – the way that we meditate. 
When we sit down to meditate, at different times we might choose one of the foundations over another because it seems to be the salient one – it seems like a good one for developing awareness. 
I find it is really useful to come back to breathing over and over again – the very first exercise. 
I find it very useful to stay in the body. 
I use the other ones as needed when they are helpful. 
Sometimes I go through all four: “Okay, how is this area; how is it here?” in relation to whatever is happening in the moment. 
 This is a way of bringing the four foundations together and coordinating them. 
We see that they are mutually supportive of each other and that the satipaṭṭhāna works as a unified whole. 
There is a unified way of bringing together all these practices for the purpose of open awareness: open-hearted, open-minded, open-handed attention to ourselves and the world.
