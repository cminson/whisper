There. So, hello, hello and welcome, formerly.
To happy hour. Makes me happy to be with you, to see you all.
This evening, afternoon, whatever your time zone might be.
Coming together and practicing so.
So for today's practice.
I wanted to invite us to engage.
In the practice of.
Of compassion and care.
To explore that as, and as you know, as, as you might have been.
For those who've been coming or listening to, to happy hour. There's so many different aspects of these practices, they're just not one way.
To explore these practices, there's so many angles, so many dimensions, so many ways our hearts can open.
To these practices. So.
So for tonight, I'd like to invite us to explore a particular aspect.
A way of exploring.
Karuna, compassion, the practice of compassion, which is where care, which is where love.
Warmth meets or holds suffering.
Either for ourselves or for others.
And then there is the practice of uncompah uncompah.
This other beautiful word in Pali, uncompah.
Often translated as care, this basic care, basic care.
Which we can think of as pervasive, just the sense of caring.
And both of these practices are beautiful. So tonight I wanted to invite us practically to explore them in our hearts.
In our minds, in our mind hearts.
Again, in the Pali word is Chitta, C-I-T-T-A, Chitta.
Often translated just as mind, but actually it's mind heart.
It's the more appropriate translation. So in our mind heart, exploring care, uncompah, and exploring compassion, Karuna.
And see how much more do I want to say to frame the topic versus just inviting us to practice together and explore and see what arises.
The first personal laboratory, which is, which is our unique and amazing human mind and heart.
So, yeah, let's just dig in. Maybe I'll reserve some time at the end to say more.
Let's just explore together fellow travelers. Shall we? Ready? Yes. Yes, let's. Okay.
All right. So I like to invite you to get into your meditation posture, whatever is comfortable for you.
You may be sitting or standing or lying down, as long as you don't fall asleep, not a problem.
And if you are sitting, allow there to be a sense of integrity to your body.
Letting your base, your sit bones to release to land into the chair, the cushion, in lieu of the earth.
Ah, your base, your base, well rooted, well connected, your legs, your feet.
Well rooted to the earth that can offer their weight, offer their weight to the earth.
Ah, releasing, releasing, releasing some more.
And from this stable, heavy, connected, well rooted base as a fury tree, connected to the earth.
Ah, let your body rise up as if a tall branch of a tree rising upon its own, a sense of integrity, not needed to be pushed up.
But rise up, rise up to the heavens with your goodness, with your aspiration.
Ah, well rooted to the earth and well supported.
And feeling expansive, expansive in this body, taking your rightful place on this earth, taking your rightful seat.
As the Buddha touched the earth, the night of his enlightenment, as earth be my witness, I am here, I belong here.
As earth be my witness, we touch the earth with our bodies, we are here, here.
I let the breath, let this life giving breath, move through your body, let it be received, received in the abdomen on its own.
Notice, I don't invite you to breathe because the body knows how to breathe.
We don't want to make it into a project.
Simply knowing that light touch, that breathing is happening. Here it is.
Being breathed in, being breathed out.
Resting, resting.
Receiving this gift, this gift of the breath.
This life giving and liveening breath. This friend, this friend.
Not to be taken for granted.
Enjoying the breath, appreciating the breath.
Imagine you had jumped in the lake.
In the cool lake in the summer day, and you jumped a little too deeply, it took a while to come back up to the surface.
When you come back up, the surface of the water, this breath, I've been waiting for you, delicious.
Ah, let it be enjoyed. Natural breath.
Ah, let it be enjoyed.
And if thoughts arise, not a problem at all. Thoughts will arise, sounds will arise. It's okay. It's all okay.
Arising and passing. Greeting the thought with a smile.
Maybe for the benefit of this practice period, gentlemen.
Telling the thought, thank you, and not now. Please come back another time. I'll be waiting for you.
But now I'm giving my heart to this practice, to this cultivation.
Turning, turning. The awareness.
More internal.
Calming soothing.
In the body received, just tilling the soil.
Another few minutes just to settle before we turn to explore care and compassion.
But here, this breath.
Receive.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Releasing pension, releasing thoughts, releasing and re-releasing.
Intending, being with, causally, lovingly, with this body.
Knowing, feeling that the breath as it's received.
It's like stroking, petting a cat.
Our hearts and minds can start to purr with ease and delight, just with this simplicity.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'd like to invite you as we continue to stay embodied, feeling the body and the earth touching the earth.
Receiving the breath.
Releasing, tightness holding.
Continuing to feel the body.
And invite, if you would, this image into your heart for reflection.
And the image to invite is an image of care we've often seen, interspecies caring for each other.
Perhaps you might have seen videos on the internet.
If you've seen one you can bring, pull one up, or I'll describe one.
A dog caring for, playing with little chicks, young chicks.
Playfully caringly.
A dog mothering chicks.
Or whatever image arises for you.
Often observing another being caring, caring so much, caring, protecting, keeping safe.
Another being.
It kindles, it rekindles the sense of care and softness as we recognize the sense of care.
Or maybe an image, a sense of a hand loving, protecting its own chicks.
Or a duck.
Its ducklings.
Sweet little furry animals.
Young ones being cared for, protected in safety by others.
Witnessing care in your mind's eye.
Let yourself rest in this and see what arises in you, in your heart.
Witnessing care.
Witnessing care.
Witnessing care.
And feeling into the sense of care, witnessing another, being scared.
Maybe kindles reminds you of a being, maybe a pet, maybe a child, or maybe an older parent that you have cared for.
Or maybe a friend, someone you have cared for, deeply cared for.
Or maybe perhaps a type low, an image of a moment when you cared.
Maybe fed them, kept them safe, cleaned them, took them to the doctor.
Deep care.
And let yourself appreciate, let yourself recognize your own care, your own capacity to have cared.
This is not a time to remind yourself of all the ways you have been cared or you fell short.
This is not the time.
Letting go of any self-judgment that may arise and just feel into the care.
Let your heart appreciate, feel into its own care, expression of its love for another being.
Let the sense of care brighten your heart, brighten, bright light shining, gladdening.
And maybe there is a being in your life right now that you care for, you care about.
Feeling into the sense of care, not clingy care, not with attachment to outcome, but an easy, just a sense of care.
This being, person, cause is important to you. You care.
Letting the care be felt, let it be bright.
Let it be nourishing to you. Care is nourishing.
And can we turn this care, the eyes with which we gaze through, gaze with care, turn around and gaze at ourselves with care.
Care for this being who is me, myself, along with others, not separate, not separate.
This being who is me, just as worthy, just as worthy.
A protection, happiness, health, well-being and care to take care.
As if you were both the chick and the hen, the den mother.
This being who is me, myself, along with others, not separate.
This being who is me, myself, along with others, not separate.
This being who is me, myself, along with others, not separate.
This being who is me, myself, along with others, not separate.
Now transitioning or bringing in the practice of Karuna compassion to bring up perhaps some mild challenge you've been having recently.
Let the sense of care hold this challenge.
Not self-playing or you should have done this, it's your fault, no, not that, or sweetheart, this is hard.
This is hard, anyone going through this would be having a hard time.
This is hard, dear, it's okay.
Now holding yourself with care, tenderness, compassion, meeting, meeting the hurt, with love, with care.
Perhaps extending the metaphor.
If you see yourself as one of the chicks, maybe you're having a bit of a challenge.
Maybe you're the one that's running behind, doesn't get enough food, is the smaller one, so the mother hen cares more.
Oh, sweetie, sweetie, let me care for you.
Opens the heart more, even more to care for this precious, precious being that is you, your own care for yourself.
Now, now, it's alright, dear.
It's okay, sweetie.
I care for you, I'm here for you.
And I acknowledge this is challenging, this is hard.
Thank you.
And extending, extending our care, our compassion to others, perhaps to the being from earlier, that in our mind's eye, we're feeling our care for.
Imagining if they had a challenge, our heart would be moved to a tenderness of compassion, meeting the hurt, meeting the challenge, with even more love.
And care.
And for the last minutes of this practice period, extending our care, and our compassion, our everyday care to all beings everywhere,
and all beings who have challenges, difficulties, suffering, which is all of us, no one is immune.
Extending our compassion, may all beings everywhere have ease, may all of us beings everywhere have grace in the midst of our pain or sorrow or suffering.
May we have ease, may all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be free.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
So, care and compassion.
So, in this practice, we engaged, we felt into a sense of care, what I call at the end, everyday care, just caring, caring, and then that care can be expressed as compassion, where it meets suffering.
And there's a different qualities, different nuances to these flavors.
They're both beautiful, they're both lovely.
And also what I was inviting you to feel into at the beginning is sometimes when we feel the care of another being, for another being, oh, that brings up the sense of care in our heart, in life and for us.
So, there's a lot of invitations in this practice.
I'm curious. I'd love to invite you, if you wish, to share reflections, questions, comments, and for the benefit, and this is for the benefit of both yourself to be held witness, if you like.
And also for the benefit of the community, all questions are important, valuable, and aha moments, whatever you like to share. You can type them in chat also, or you can raise your zoom hand.
If it's your physical hand, I may not see you. So, friend, please.
Thank you. Today, I received a copy of a letter that I wrote 60 years ago to one of my cousins when I was 10, and I could picture myself at 10 writing that.
And this is to a cousin who's since been estranged from the family and who I haven't seen in many years. But it helped me see myself in the part of the meditation tonight where we were extending this care to ourselves, which I always find difficulty doing.
But being able to see myself as that 10 year old and seeing the actual handwriting on that letter and actually recalling the moment 60 years ago when when I did that made that much more palpable and accessible to me and very sweet.
So, thank you. Thank you for it. So sweet. Thank you for sharing this precious to be able to have access again to this letter and for it to serve as a way to access the feeling of turning the sense of care to yourself.
Wonderful. Thank you for sharing this and really bringing the how palpable this is, I could feel it in your words. So, so I wonder if you have considered, as you practice Metta care, compassion, all the Brahma Viharas for yourself, whether remembering this letter
or putting it somewhere where you can look at it frequently, the 10 year old's handwriting would be a way in, would be a way in.
It's, it's, you know, it's as Leonard Cohen says, crack is where the light gets in. And this is such a beautiful precious letter for the light to continue to pour in.
That's a great thought. Yeah, and you're welcome to unmute or not.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
I'll do that.
Sweet. Thank you so much. My heart is so glad and hearing hearing the story system. Thank you. Thank you.
Any other reflections you can raise your zoom hand you can type in chat if you type to everyone, I will read your name if you just type it to me alone, I won't read your name, but just your reflection or the question that you sent.
Anything else that came up for you. Appreciation coming from YouTube, you're welcome. Thank you for practicing along our YouTube community Susan, please.
During the meditation I thought of an example of compassion that really touched me then and it did now and I thought of it and it was watching a video about President Carter and Habitat for Humanity visiting they were building all these houses for Hurricane Katrina victims.
And I remember it just worn my heart and I felt so good watching that just that them doing this action and then the reactions of the recipients getting housing again and they were so blown away by the kindness of these strangers.
Yeah, isn't that interesting Susan yeah someone else's kindness generosity there, their care, it just makes us happy right it lights us up it just your face was lit up as you were talking about the President Carter and Habitat for Humanity and I've heard about this I haven't seen the clip but I've heard that even as he's been very
physically aged and, you know, not as young as he was but he's still continuing to do this continuing to care and serve in this way. That's very sweet. Thanks for bringing that in.
And then we'll have to go we'll go into groups so we'll make this brief. Yeah, just for that moment. I could let go of that moment now that I didn't have anything else in that moment.
That moment and then it wasn't there. And then it was there. And then it wasn't. And it's my breath and my desire to be now in the now.
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And Jen on YouTube says just hearing the words Habitat for Humanity and Carter lifted my heart.
Yeah. Yeah. And here's a reflection coming in. Today I chose not to drink like I have been doing so habitually. The pain I have been trying to keep at bay is hard to sit with.
But you helped me sit gently with it today. Thank you for this. Thank you for bringing yourself for coming to this container and practicing supporting yourself with this practice, the person who sent me this reflection privately.
And thank you for being here and supporting others with your with your practice. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for being here. Yeah. And sitting and sitting with what is hard. It's not easy.
And yet and yet the way the way towards awakening to freedom is through the pain is sitting with the pain with kindness and compassion, not around it, not it's not going to go away.
We all know this. Yeah.
Thank you for that. So, dear ones, the time has come for us to turn to each other and support each other ourselves where the rubber meets the road and in practicing in small groups.
So I'll make the small groups in a moment and the invitation is, as always, to speak from your own experience, not managing other people's experience, the group, etc.
But just sharing if you like a couple of words from few words from your own experience. And if, if when your turn comes, you want to pass and just hold silent space.
Great. You can say pass and hold compassionate caring, caring space for others. What a gift your presence as a gift, your presence as a gift to others.
And let's go with reverse alphabetical order, just for the fun of it. And each person will say maybe a word or two and nugget and then the other person will say nugget and then the third person and then you'll go around and around maybe a few times.
And just sharing as little or as much as you wish about what this was like for you being held witness by others and caring caring for yourself.
Not not getting in your head like what am I going to say to be impressive. Just it's okay. Say little and caring for others. So about to open the rooms with care and kindness. Here we go.
Especially if you're new.
Not to put anyone on the spot. You can type in chat raise your hand.
Any insights.
I just wondered if you survived the interview with Sam Harris.
If I survived it.
Yes.
It was intense.
I loved it.
It wasn't clear. I had a great time. We had a great time.
Good. Good. I'm glad to hear it.
It's sweet. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Rich.
I was recently interviewed by Sam Harris for his app Waking Up. And yeah, it's
Sam deeply cares. Speaking of care, which is the topic for tonight.
Sam deeply deeply cares deeply cares.
Both not just for himself and family, but for others for their waking up for humanity for the world. He deeply cares and, and I really, really appreciate that about him.
So thank you all. Thank you all for your practice for your care for being here for supporting each other.
Supporting yourself. May all beings be happy.
May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thanks everyone.
Now.
