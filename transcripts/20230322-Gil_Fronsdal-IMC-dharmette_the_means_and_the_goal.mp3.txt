 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, if someone comes to the Dharma, to Buddhism, without knowing anything, and they come and hear a talk, and the only thing they learn from the talk is the famous little saying from the Buddha, Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. That's all they hear. That's all they remember. Nothing to cling to. And, oh, I think this sounds okay. I should try. Yeah, it's true. I really cling to my cookies. And I see that's a problem sometimes. Like, I run out of cookies at midnight, and I have to go find a store that's open, and it's a real headache. So, I think I'll let go of that clinging. So, that's how they start the Dharma. And right away, they have some, see the benefit of non-clinging. And, oh, yeah, that's a little easier. I just go to bed at night rather than go looking for a store that's open. And then, they start their meditation, they start their practice, and they start their meditation. But, they say, the non-clinging is always there. So, they're like, Oh, I cannot cling here. Look, that's what I cling. I cannot cling here. And slowly, their non-clinging is expanding and growing and developing. And they hear lots of brilliant Dharma talks, but the only thing they remember is that, Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. And so, it keeps expanding and expanding. And then, they hear a Dharma talk that says, The goal of practice is to end all clinging. And they say, Oh, I don't know about a goal, but this is what I've been doing all along. So, this is good. Maybe I'm on the right track. So, the person keeps practicing non-clinging, and it grows, and over the years and decades, it becomes a bigger and bigger and bigger part of their life, until there's nothing more to let go of. And they're happy, peaceful. And then, they hear a Dharma talk that says, Strive for enlightenment. Oh, I didn't hear that before. I guess, well, I guess I didn't do it right. I was supposed to be enlightened. I guess, complete non-clinging is not good enough. So, I think that person's quite lucky to have heard that, because what they heard was a little, really good advice for how to follow along in your Buddhist practice. Don't cling. But it's also a definition, in our tradition, of the goal of practice, to a radical non-clinging. So, what's possible, then, is to have that the goal is found in the means. In the practice you're doing, you can find the goal in little steps along the way. So, it isn't so much that the goal is way up in the future that someday I'll get enlightened, but rather, not someday I'll let go of clinging, but there's all this little letting go of clingings along the way. And it's a taste of awakening, of freedom. It's a taste of liberation. And it's being expanded. It's growing. It's becoming fuller and fuller, as opposed to thinking you have to wait until there's some big experience. So, I've always found it very meaningful, this idea to have the goal reflected in the practice. And today I'm referring to the goal as non-clinging, which is fairly classic in our tradition. Another goal, another way I was talking about is to end suffering, to no longer suffer. And is it possible to reach the complete ending of suffering and no suffering? Is that possible? What is that? And it's a complicated answer, what is it? Because it depends a lot on how you define the word suffering. But it is the goal. And so if the goal is to be reflected in the means, can we practice in a way, certainly practice in a way, that the practice doesn't cause us to suffer more? And plenty of Buddhists suffer more because of Buddhism. Unfortunately, it's kind of like, wait, the whole thing is about the end of suffering, not make more for yourself. But one of the ways that Buddhists make more is they strive, they measure themselves against all kinds of Buddhist ideals, like I'm not up there, I'm not good enough, I'm not a card-carrying Buddhist yet, I'm an embarrassment to Buddhism because I'm attached to cookies. Whatever it might be, I have anger. And so then we use Buddhism as kind of a reason to suffer more. But it's kind of ridiculous. The whole purpose is not to suffer. So hold the Buddhism lightly. Don't take it too seriously so that you don't suffer more because of it. But then the goal reflected in the means means that, okay, so I'm suffering here. Oh, this is the suffering. Let me look at this. Let me work with this. Let me let go of this. Let me find the cause of this. Let me massage it. Let me relax it. Let me find a way with it. And then slowly we find areas where we elect suffering ends, suffering ends, suffering ends. Someone carries resentment with them for decades. And at some point, that suffering, at some point the resentment dissolves. Oh, this is good. There's freedom, freedom from suffering. This is the goal in a small taste of the goal. This is the goal too. And then there might be fear that people struggle with, anxiety. And so they practice with that. And they're doing their practice and they see the anxiety evaporates. Wow, I had no idea. I remember many years ago, the surprise I had when this woman came to me and she said, when I was in retreat a year ago with you, I let go of my cynicism and it hasn't returned in the last year. And I said, wow, that was pretty cool. And so this end of suffering, and this is just like the end of clinging, it's the kind of thing that grows and matures and develops. Sometimes it goes in leaps, quantum little leaps, but just, you know, and then sometimes it just gradually matures and matures and matures. So to have this idea that the goal is reflected in the means, it's a very important idea. Because you're all involved with the means if you came here today. You're practicing meditation. That's the means. How can you look upon your meditation that the way that you practice contains part of the goal? Can you practice in such a way that the practice, you're not clinging to something as your practice? Can you practice meditation in a way that doesn't give you cause to suffer more because of it? It's not so easy to do this because some of us have very strong dispositions or habits of judging and wanting and criticizing and doubting and being afraid that we bring into whatever we're doing. So of course it'll come into meditation as well. So, you know, but how do you then, given that, given that you're doing it, how do you hold that lightly? How do you hold that spaciously? How do you not suffer more because of that? So if you're suffering anyway, how do you not put more suffering on top of it? That's where you're finding the goal in the means. You can't necessarily stop your suffering, but can you stop adding more? You can see the more coming. Judging yourself, I shouldn't be this way. I've been practicing meditation now for three days and I should have, you know, I should have been floating on a cloud by now. And then what's wrong with me? So that's the added layer. So to have this as a reference point for your practice, where's the goal in the means? How does the means contain part of the goal? And use that as a protection, use that as a support, as an inspiration, use that as a guide for finding your way. And then practice can be much more fun, much more nice, much more satisfying. And because you're seeing results, you're seeing the evidence that this works in a lot of small steps, rather than waiting for evidence that it works until, you know, some, I don't know, some idea of what's supposed to happen. So I hope that that gives you enough to contemplate, think about, and practice with, that idea of finding the goal in the means, letting the means, let the practice, embody some of the elements, some of the aspects of the goal. And there are many definitions or descriptions of what the goal might be. And so, you know, maybe some of those will speak to you and you can find it in the means, how you practice. So thank you.
