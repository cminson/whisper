 So I was a little bit unsure about whether to give a talk today or whether since I'm gonna be gone for a while it's often nice to take the time for questions and answers, but I decided I would give a talk unless a strong upwelling of desire for Q&A period just to flesh out hear about the different issues that the community community has and what you'd like to talk about what I'd like to talk about is ethics and and the little bit there's been has been in particular about conflict conflict resolution and And I had various ideas went through my mind about how to make this talk how to present it I decided some of them were too artificial and too contrived But maybe I'll tell you about them and you know, I won't tell you I won't do it But I'll tell you about the contrived nature of some of my ideas so that the wise part of it you can kind of just imagine and take it in and if there is any I Was gonna first I was gonna tell you a story about that. I've told many times a little story a little saying about Zen Saying is that Zen is two things It's a Zen which means in meditation in sweeping the temple courtyard And or the monastic courtyard and The understanding of that is that the monastic courtyard Doesn't end at The boundaries of the courtyard or boundaries of the temple the monastery. It's saying there's two aspects to Zen practice There's sitting in meditation either literally or symbolically and then there's engaging in the world Taking care of what needs to be taken care of when the pathways in the monastery are dirty you sweep them When there is conflict in the world you deal with a conflict So you respond to the world you take care of the world and the both those things are important and so And those things that go hand in hand they go together you want to do you want to be able to do both Both of them support each other and make each other healthy and both of them Test each other your Zazan in sense your meditation is Tested by your engagement in the world and you find out that is it really real you have you ever really changed in a healthy Way if you really understood something deeply here and then you bring it into the world and see what how world responds how you respond what happens and if you just stayed in your own meditation the whole time stayed in your monastery and never were tested never put yourself in situation where You really see what's happened for you then? You won't know for sure and who you are you'll kind of live in kind of a idealistic utopia And then also there's an opportunity to learn From what we see then so you go into the world and you find out oh, I'm much more attached than I realized Around this particular thing or that particular thing or everything And and so then oh, I'm so this is where one of the places we need to continue practicing and Also, it kind of then helps with the certain kind of healthy humility that It's very good to have I think in practice and conversely the Engage our engagement in the world is often is tested in a sense by going On retreat by sitting in meditation That many of us because often possible to be fooled in daily life to think that you're much more Free than you actually think you are and only by going sitting in meditation only by going on retreat Is the mind does the mind quiet down enough that you can really see what's going on in the mind? Oh, I didn't know that was so preoccupied about that. I'm so obsessing about that I'm I'm actually you know so you can start seeing kind of what's underneath the surface chatter of the mind and you start seeing oh and I've had the experience and I know other people had the experience of feeling everything just fine in a sense some kind of level and And then going on retreat or sitting in meditation say oh So the two go to hand in hand so And and part of what meditation is is Coming to some place of clarity of calm some modicum of it at least of stability of being centered and then engagement in the world is to take that calm or that centered and bring it into the world and And you don't have to go back and forth literally, you know run to your cushion every time you lose your calm but But that movement Can continue in daily life the movement of engaging and then Finding where our center is finding where the calm is And it while while we're engaged So that what the artificial part of this talk which I'm not going to do then it was I was going to give a talk about conflict resolution and Then tell you that part of conflict resolution is also learning how to work with your breath Coming back to your breath learning how to have a fluid breath using your breath as a cue as an aid as a help to understand how you're caught and how you get tight and tense and and then learning how to have a lubricated breath learning how to breathe a relaxed way as You're involved in the conflict. So don't get so caught up in the conflict In whatever way we're caught up in it that you lose touch with your breath Don't get too lost in your breath that you lose touch with a conflict But use your breath as a tool in the middle of it as a place to be in the middle of it it's kind of like Sometimes in some yoga teachers will emphasize the breath a lot and they'll talk about you know again get into a yoga posture and stay there and find your find an easy breath in it and Hang in there in that posture until you can find an easy breath Natural breath within it relax breath within that posture and probably some of you have done yoga kind of know you know you think You get into this kind of from toward a position and you could you know barely hold it and your breath is all tight and Yoga teacher says you remember to breathe and you are breathing of course But but what they mean is remember to kind of you know, breathe in a relaxed way in a full way Don't hold your breath don't be so tense So you go part of the part of the great thing about yoga some people is is being in these kind of difficult positions That sometimes can be awkward, but then working with that position to find how to have a natural breath an easy breath So the same thing with conflict resolution Coming back to the breathing. Can you in the midst of the conflict where conflict have that easy breath come back to your breath? So I still haven't told you the artificial part of the talk that I'm not going to do But that was as I as I gave the talk was to have you every five minutes every three minutes Have you all go back to your breathing and talk about the breath kind of to have a two talks? You know We've we've weave into each other conflict resolution in the breath and back and forth like two parallel talks You know and so how are your how's your breath? But I won't do that It's a great idea and someone who was really skilled at this could probably do it in the way and we'd all be enlightened at the end But but I didn't feel like I had that skill and probably you know, I was concerned you would all be irritated with me by the end If the way I did it so It wasn't such an important part Maybe was the most important part, but who knows excuse me Conflict resolution it's come up a little bit for me because I'm on this Spirit Rock ethics council. It's called the air council at air council is an acronym for ethics and reconciliation Council Ear and that was chosen Intentionally because one of the primary functions of the ethics council the air council Is to be near is to listen to people is to listen and to be a place for confidential Listening to people's concerns around ethics and conflict the San Francisco Zen Center also has an air council and and So it's kind of nice that these two Buddhist traditions that come from very different places in Asia Japanese and Southeast Asian Theravada Buddhism both have a air council. Isn't that amazing? It's not so amazing because I wrote a document for both of them So and my hope is that the idea will spread and there's come up a little bit the idea that we should have such a a council here at our center and and I'm starting to talk preliminary preliminary talks with people about the us starting one here as far as I know There's no reason in terms of having conflict that I know a particular that but no one's come up but but that I know but but it's always good to have these things in place and And They started off You know in the 1980s there were a lot of conflict with teachers in American Buddhist communities And a lot of people felt betrayed by the Buddhist teachers and they Buddhist teachers did various unethical things and so by the early 90s some of the Buddhist centers some of the Buddhist teachers and the members of the communities started feeling the need for teacher codes of ethics And I believe Jack cornfield was probably the first to do this produced a repost in the teachers codes of ethics and Then had a very started a kind of an ethics council for spirit rock and Then a little bit later the abbot's at San Francisco Zen Center Suggested this at San Francisco Zen Center have something similar and that then they had They start having meetings to try to have a subcommittee to try to come up with some documents and some procedures for that I think that was 1992 that the abbots started that yeah, they started that in that in Zen Center and So as a response to teachers ethics and in both communities the desire that what arose out of consideration for this was to not limited to issues around the teachers when there's you know teachers have done some transgression, but rather to To be a place for deal with tension and conflicts within the community themselves and the community and might not have to do with community members or in San Francisco or spirit rock between practitioners and administrators or people employees, you know for everybody concerned some place to go and deal with conflict Jack cornfield once told me gave a little kind of history of how Conflict teacher conflict transgressions had been dealt with in the Vipassana community in the now it's been probably 30 years that he's been part of it in America and Overall the Vipassana community has not had the kind of level of Scandal as far as I know there hasn't been any scandals in the Vipassana community There certainly have been things which had been someone maybe they have been scandals and ethical things, but I shouldn't even say this but anyway So the so he went through of history and he said for the first approach was when there wasn't a teacher actually American teacher who was I Think maybe as early as late 1960s who was teaching here early 70s teaching here in America and there was something Inappreciated something inappropriate and His elders in Burma basically excommunicated him just you're out of here That was the approach number one Approach number two was there was a Asian teacher who came to America who was supposed to live a life of celibacy and Kind of broke that And when that became known the first approach the community was denial and avoidance of the issue And So that was approach number two and the third approach is that approach of going and talking to people and Having a process in place to try to work things out understand all the elements of it. What's really went on Understand what goes on and people's psyche when when they did what they did and and to look for Healing look for reconciliation look for atonement look for processes that includes people in the you know Within the community keeps them in or has a way of bringing them back in so it's not you know either way It's not not you know reject people or denied something's happened, but have a healthy process in place and In the monastic rules there are lots of processes like that that helps to reinstitute people in good standing in the community after they've done some kind of transgression and one of our Very revered American Dharma teachers who was a monk in Southeast Asia talks about Breaking one of the very important rules that you're not supposed to break Having to do a celibacy He masturbated and so he had to go and confess to his teacher Mmm, yeah Okay, so there's a process then in place what to deal with it so he can come back into community good standing I think he had to stand at the temple gate for some days or a week and every month they came in he had To explain why he was standing there And after that week that he was came he was invited back and good standing and So you know you know hopefully we won't have exactly that kind of process here But but to have some kind of healthy process in in place Why why have a healthy process I like to think of it because it's an extension Extension its expression of the basic Buddhist practice itself that basic Buddhist practice is involves never turning away from suffering Never turning away from conflict unless it's healthy to do that sometimes It's maybe healthy to do that for all kinds of reasons But there's a lot mostly unhealthy reasons to turn away. We never turn away from suffering and conflict Because that is that's one of the that's where the path is found That's where the the Buddhist path is found is by going into the places where attachment conflict reside breathing Finding where to be relaxed finding how to be free in the midst of it finding how to work with it so in both the so both Zen Center and Spirit rock have these documents and Talking about their irrespective air councils. I'd like to read a little bit from both of them at Zen Center it says We wish our life within the Zen Center Sangha to express our Zen practice and bodhisattva Intention the bodhisattva intention is that intention? To be helpful to all beings to help liberate all beings So that is it it's it comes out of compassionate concern for the well-being of everyone As the bodhisattva path is our heartfelt response to suffering Turning away or skimming over suffering through silence rationalization assigning blame minimizing feeling Self-deprecating guilt or not listening deeply to its causes and conditions are full are all steps directed away from the bodhisattva path itself So turning away or skimming over Suffering and the hill goes through a list of all the ways that some of the ways people can do that Are all steps directed away from the bodhisattva path itself? furthermore Avoidance avoidance is a condition for additional suffering Thus when a conflict grievance dissonance or violation of the precepts arises in our interpersonal relationships It is essential to attend to it fully Personally this involves waking up to our own contribution to the suffering in these situations through understanding our reactions emotions and attachments Interpersonally this involves taking the time to discuss the conflict with the other parties involved in an attempt to clarify the actual causes Conditions feelings and responses that come together in the situation What follows our guidelines and procedures for resolving conflicts and transgressions within the Zen Center Sangha It is our hope that such resolutions take the form of reconciliation with oneself and with others So here is two parts is a personal part and interpersonal part and both are important Sometimes people forget one or the other part what I found Very often at Zen Center When I was there was that people there were tend to take things very personally in the sense of if there's conflict I must be the cause of it and So people didn't sometimes enter into the conflict into discussion about it because though it's all to me I have to deal with it myself my own attachments and things and it might be that really the other person needs to attend to something But still they took it on themselves and I told this story before but it was It this document for Zen Center was late If it was in Zen Center You know it needed it earlier because of the issues they had to develop and one of the reasons documenting it since I need this document Earlier was to deal with the level of conflict and hostility that arose in the community and trying to write this document And it blew me away it was amazing Partly Zen has an antinomian streak in it. No rules. It was just be free and and Especially among younger members that was kind of idealistic kind of approach and Also, they so the first committee to try to make this for Zen Center Looked around to see what they could borrow from and they borrowed from the Jungian Institution Institute in San Francisco their guidelines which is very different language than the Buddhist language and they came and And without due process in the community and presented these new guidelines for ethics and the community went ballistic the amount of hostility that I saw I sat behind one of the members in a meeting once and the level of hostility directed to just amazing and and because of all the hostility the the The the board basically was ready to give up. They didn't know what to do anymore. They didn't know how to proceed with because he's kind of stalemate and That's where in my kind of way naive way. I just jumped in and I started I took the precepts It's end precepts of 16 precepts and use that language and just kind of type something up kind of redid it in that kind of language And everybody said oh, that's great. There's something's the way forward here you be on the committee and so I was involved in the second committee then to rework this and Once we were kind of we went back and forth We were basically very good friends in the committee But you know it was kind of a little bit testy at times because you know where the comma went was really important And we were very you know commas were important to you We went to every single you know word was kind of like analyzed as we went through this And I remember once leaving a meeting feeling somewhat peeved at this other guy and you know we were kind of like you know tents between us and I thought about it for the week and I realized you know where I'd been attached and And I was going to go to the next meeting and first thing I was going to do is apologize to him I Got to the meeting and before I had a chance the first thing he did was he apologized to me for his responsibility How he was attached? Isn't that beautiful if both people come like that? But sometimes that approach we just kind of look at ourselves sometimes can leave out the part Oh, I have to kind of talk to someone to work it out interpersonally And some people want to talk work things out into personally you're to blame you better, you know and don't want to look at themselves at all So that's the introduction to the San Francisco Zen Center's Doc document the Spirit Rock document Simpler document for various reasons and but it starts off this way Conflicts will inevitably arise within the Spirit Rock community the health of our community is not measured by the presence or absence of conflict as much as by our willingness to find effective responsible and compassionate means of resolving interpersonal tensions as they arise The health of our community is not measured by the presence or absence of conflict as Much as by our willingness to find effective responsible and compassion means of resolving interpersonal tensions as they arise So the dedication a healthy community one is dedicated to process Not to mean not measured by the purity but dedicated to the commitment to process So we never turn away from suffering It doesn't mean that anyone my hope my heartfelt hope for our community here If any Sangha is again not that Sangha has is free of conflict, but no one's rejected. No one feels uncomfortable No one's pushed away. No one's runs away because there's conflict a Sangha is a place where we're willing to hang in there To talk about what needs to be talked about It doesn't mean we have to all be friends But we're never going to close our hearts to each other We're going to hang in there at least to find how to keep the heart open and feel the connection there And that process I think it's one of the primary things of what a Sangha is and one of the things that makes a Sangha a safe place We're all going to make mistakes and become with all kinds of cultural conditioning all kinds of things, but We listen to each other if we need to we stop The intention to attend to and learn from conflict The intention to attend to and learn from conflict is a clear application of Buddhist practice into our daily lives without this intention Practice can too easily be a comfort Rather than a deep transformative vehicle for our lives We want practice just to be a comfort security blanket Or we want to use it, you know to change us to try to try to radical transformation to be liberated One of the words for liberation is release And too many people sometimes look for relief Rather than release So if you were looking for release you have to stay there and really work with what's actually happening Buddhist conflict resolution is not based on good or bad blame or guilt winning or losing offenders or victims What do you think of that? What's left? in conflict resolution No good or bad. No blame or guilt. No winning or losing no offenders or victims What do you think of that? No offenders and victims You like that? You take care of offenders And victims he works in juvenile Juvenile Juvenile psych ward and most of the people there are either victims or offenders or both But no dangerous but no Victims or offenders and you like that both thumbs went up for that What do you think of that huh? so Rather it is based on fully addressing the suffering of all concerned That's the alternative To all those labels and all those judgments Attending to the suffering of all of all concerned Hurt fear and anger are taken seriously through forums in which everyone may speak honestly safely and completely about their own direct experiences and feelings in looking for resolution buddhist practice values dialogue over silence reconciliation over estrangement forgiveness over resentment confession over accusation and atonement over punishment Because the process of reaching such resolution is often very difficult spirit rocks ethics and reconciliation council offers support So Then Um In both communities part of the function of the air council is try to facilitate informal means of conflict resolution of reconciliation formal means grievance procedures that you know can be instituted are generally we consider not a very useful way of Reaching reconciliation if someone has a grievance and they want to Usually so rather than but that's necessary to have sometimes But the air council is there partly to see before doing a formal grievance procedure Can we have some can we explore can we develop can we advise people on healthy ways that lead to reconciliation? Which is a higher standard than just simply settling a grievance um And so the idea was what are the informal ways that uh need People need to do in order to deal with conflict and result and disagreements So in san francisco's end center they have basic guidelines for um doing this Although no fixed procedures for informal conflict resolution exist The suggestions and procedures that follow are intended to give all persons involved in a dispute A chance to be fully heard in an environment of respect and kindness That flows from knowing that there's no fundamental differences between us One Stating the actual A crucial aspect of conflict resolution just as in buddhist practice itself Is discriminating between our interpretations and opinions of an event and how the event was or is personally experienced In part this means not making general statements But rather sticking to the particulars of actual situations and the emotions experienced It is extremely difficult to have mutual understanding when discussion remains at the level of interpretation and generalization Two so this is part where I was going to go I thought of going through this and then at the end of each paragraph telling you all to breathe, but you know, I would do that Being heard It is important that everyone be given an opportunity to be fully heard And um, I don't exactly remember why It's worded that way. I don't remember what happened those all those years or 10 years ago. We wrote this but um being heard usually people say Listening is really important for conflict resolution And I think what we had in mind was that being heard is a higher standard than listening Being heard is kind of like you know that someone who's listening The other person has to listen carefully and has to listen so carefully that you know, you're being heard So being heard is really important It is important that everyone be given an opportunity to be fully heard This means that everyone be given a chance to recount how they remember the history of a conflict To state their feelings regarding the conflict and to explain the goals they have for its resolution Such statements should be neither defensive nor critical since both approaches tend to preclude deeper mutual understanding Much conflict arises and is perpetuated through a lack of mutual understanding Taking calm deliberate and adequate time to listen to each other is often all that is needed for reconciliation to begin So i've been on the ethics committee involved in ethics conflicts now for some various conflicts that have risen for some time and i've watched how I've watched ways in which they've been resolved or tried to be resolved in unhealthy ways and one of the ways i've seen is when someone has an opinion about What the solution is or how In terms of impose that on someone else And and or if it has some judgment about the other part of one party Oh that party, you know, it's not really a real grievance that person has or that person It's a grievance. All right, but that person is like really stuck in being the victim mode or something and And you know, this is never going to end if we keep catering to this person and so, you know this is a difficult person and so let's just kind of like do something here and send a letter and Kind of close it close the door And it's not really listening. It's not really letting someone being heard and what i've seen when that kind of approach is taken Um a few times i've seen it. It just it becomes it just aggravates the wound And and what i've seen often if we stop And listen to people really carefully And give it time and listen that that's really what people sometimes most want They want to know that they're someone really heard them understood where they're at and i've seen how sometimes the conflict dissolves When people feel like they're adequately fully heard and listened to And I think that some people are afraid of listening deeply deeply because they think that there are further consequences That oh then I don't know that it'll never end that that's way But i've seen over and over again now a number of times that just giving people a chance to be heard really well Is is you know I don't know how much you know, it's a majority what needs to happen It's like in therapy, right? Your therapist doesn't even say much to you But you know a lot of it is just the fact that you have a chance to talk And and in your talking there's a process Restating what has three restating what was heard To ensure that everyone understands one another it is useful for each party to briefly restate what the other has said highlighting the main points The other party then says whether the restatement is complete or accurate And accurate and they and if necessary makes corrections Next one is interesting because these these three are basically you'll find in a lot of different manuals and conflict resolution These kinds of ideas stated maybe different words making i statements and restating and listening But the next one is doesn't you don't find them in kind of I don't think you find them in a lot of the kind of the conflict manuals that You can read about The next one is called confession Resolution and reconciliation is greatly facilitated if everyone involved reflects on how they may have contributed to a conflict and then explains it to the other party Even when one person is primarily responsible self-reflection confession and apology on everyone's part Can provide a safer more trusting understanding environment for everyone to be truthful So they have confession the day of volunteering voluntarily saying oh, this is my part. This is what I contributed You know bringing it out and saying it And um And you know the word confession, you know, I don't know I Think it's a very powerful word. It's a very powerful act to confess And I don't know, you know in catholicism they have this, you know, they don't call it confession anymore Someone told me I don't know if it's everywhere in catholicism, but they have a new word now for going to the booth I'm setting at the booth and You know and they now it's called something like the word reconciliation is in the word. What is it? That's all it's called. Isn't that great? What was that? So in catholicism used to be called confession When you go to the booth and you know whisper and they say you do nine hail marries or whatever And now it's called reconciliation. It's not called confession I love it But I also wonder Isn't something lost? Because I think the act of confession is actually a very powerful act. It's a very cleansing to actually state to someone else This is you know, someone is confident confidential Advisor someone this is what I did Just that just that is very powerful and that is part of the process of reconciliation And and perhaps by renaming and reconciliation something is lost and something's gained It's like in catholicism. They dropped latin, right? Something was lost and something was gained And then And the rest are the pro has to do with In Bringing in witnesses mediators facilitate having people help facilitate from outside in the conflict Um So in the midst of all that breathing midst of all that looking for that relaxed breath What does it take for you to come back to a relaxed breathing? In the midst of tension. Do you want to is it valuable? Can you find it if we're looking for reconciliation? Then the end result should be a state where we have a relaxed breath to relax breathing again Can we do that? Step by step as we go along can we can we take one step forward into the conflict? And not kind of rush ahead into it But maybe take then half a step back and go back into our breath And find that breath again Breathe find it find a relaxed breath and then take the next step And maybe half a step back breathe be with the breath and take all the steps that it takes to be in the conflict Stay in it but not to be conflicted But to look at a process to heal the conflict too And one of the ways simply to say I think we're in conflict now. I think there's something or one of the one of the The first spiritual community I lived in That kind of opened the door of spirituality for me was a the farm in tennessee it was a kind of a you know, kind of a hippie commune it came out of haytashbury kind of and And s and lsd and all that lsd was kind of one of the gurus of the community and And they had found that and at some point they stopped taking acid because they moved to tennessee and it was not you know It wasn't legal and And but they found that honesty being honest with each other Was of equal value to lsd If you're honest enough you didn't need to take the acid Isn't that saying a lot? And um, and so one of the things that was really was remarkable for me with this community Was if they became very sensitive to interpersonal conflict dissonance Things that most people in most communities I think you just overlook because you know It's no big thing And they would stop middle of work and middle all kinds of things and they'd stop and they'd work it out And sometimes it's what they would work it out for hours But one of the things I noticed there in the time I was lived there Is that um, maybe the first time you had to work it out it took hours The second time it took half an hour The third time it took five minutes because the ground has been set and the fourth time All someone had to do was raise their eyebrows And then oh, yeah, okay, this is what's happening, okay, drop it or whatever Um, so that points to the idea that um familiarity with working with conflict Um, you know initially it can be quite difficult and easy but hanging in there working with it that it gets easier and easier over time And eventually hopefully it becomes something that You know, it's very easy To resolve when things arise Um So the last thing i'll say is um In the early indian buddhist tradition in the monastic tradition There are all these procedures for how to deal with conflict. Some of them are similar to this And um, there's one one one step which is not in here We didn't do here and that is uh, sometimes called, um, putting straw over the mud and that is um the um, sometimes, um Actually ignoring the conflict ignoring what's going on And in the favor of harmony And what you find in asian cultures in indian and buddhist cultures that the group harmony is very very highly valued phenomena So much though, it's sometimes the expectation is that you're supposed to kind of Put aside your conflict for the sake of the harmony of the group And I say this because um, I think there are different cultural ways of dealing with conflict And the way that I described here Uh, uh my emphasis, you know kind of my interpretation of you know, you really hang in there you stay in the conflict You find the practice within the conflict Working with the conflict I think is partly represented represents, uh partly a western or you know or a Americanized perhaps or western kind of view of interpretation of how Conflict resolution happens in buddhist circles Uh, so to emphasize again what I just said you find in in the monastic early indian tradition Both processes both kind of this meeting it and listening and working things out But what you also find is sometimes for the sake of harmony for sake of whatever not not Bringing it up or you're not kind of putting mud over putting straw over the mud So that's a whole topic in itself and I just wanted to lay kind of Kind of stir things up a little bit after giving one particular approach and how it's done, you know my take Um apologize if that confuses everything Um So those are my thoughts for today and um, it would have been great if I had discussion um, and um I do hope that we uh create our own document like this for our own community and especially now that we have a center and we're growing and And perhaps by having a document like this and having this available and with with uh, stressing the importance of listening and working things out Um We'll never need the committee So, uh, thank you very much
