 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Again, a warm welcome to Happy Hour. So I've been thinking about how kindness manifests internally and externally. And those of you who have been around the Buddhist scene for a while know that internally and externally is something that the Buddha talks about, especially in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, about observing things internally and externally. And I was thinking today how kindness can be observed internally and externally. As we cultivate kindness within us, also we can cultivate more kindness for those outside of us. And as we learn to offer metta, benevolence, kindness around us, we can also start to cultivate more of it within us. And as we receive kindness from others, either notice their acts externally, what they're doing, or noticing the impact on us, the softness, the warmth, internally. That has an effect too, and we can learn to offer more of it to ourselves and to others and to everyone as to ourselves from this kind of process of observing, taking it in, drinking it in, the kindness. This comes from Ajahn Suchito, a wonderful teacher and monk in the Thai forest tradition. It's from his book, Harami. He writes, true love for another means that you don't appropriate someone or project your unfulfilled wishes or needs onto them. Instead, it means recognizing otherness and feeling that it's okay. And again, I'll add true love for ourselves. He then goes on and says, we don't have to feel compelled to prove ourselves. From time to time, pretty much everyone has made a mess of things. We have responsibility, of course, for our mind's state at that point, for what we allowed in in terms of influences or what happened. But our current responsibility is one of cultivating virtue, discernment, and kindness, not of sustaining a burden of guilt and denial. And one of the major healing tools, development tools for this is the process of cultivating metta. So, I'll just invite you to sort of drink that in, that recognizing with kindness all of your mind, all of my mind, all of our minds, are conditioned and formed by life experiences, often circumstances about which we have very little control. So, just like me, just like you, everyone is in this situation, being informed and formed by all these different causes and conditions. So, to give ourselves a little graciousness and maybe find ways to offer others a little bit of kindness as well. Recognizing that our impact, our control, is in how we choose to cultivate our hearts, our minds. So, with that, let's start to cultivate our hearts and minds, making a comfortable posture, and inviting you to turn off or silence anything that might distract you on the outside, slack notifications, devices, etc. And tune into your body. Just checking in with how it is in this moment, exactly as it is. And setting a determination and resolve an intention. To meet whatever arises in your experience for the next half an hour, with as much kindness and graciousness as is available. No need to force anything, but to prove which kindness, allowing the attention to rest in this body. Noticing the weight of your body and the cushion or chair or floor. Noticing, too, the support beneath you, the steadiness, holding, holding your weight. It can be helpful to start a period of meditation like this, with one or two intentional breaths, perhaps a little longer or slower than you might normally have. And then releasing the breath. Noticing any tension, excess tension that wants to leave a bit, allowing the breathing to return to normal. And inviting, inviting progressive relaxation through your body, the scalp and the forehead, the eyes and the area behind the eyes, the jaw, maybe opening the jaw and allowing your lips to float back together, teeth not quite meeting. Allowing the tongue to rest in the mouth, perhaps naturally the tip of the tongue at the top of the palate behind the teeth. Breathing. Noticing the air moving through your windpipe, back of the throat, and allowing that to invite the neck to soften. The shoulders to relax, the chest and ribs and torso to soften. Allowing the spine and the back to be aligned and relaxed. Balancing the weight on the bones and allowing the muscles to be soft and plant. Inviting the buttocks and hips to soften. The upper legs, lower legs, ankles and feet to soften. And tuning into a sense of the whole body, the integrity of your skin around this body. Areas of warmth and cool, softness, roughness, whatever's there. And then settling whatever object of attention feels most friendly, easy in this moment. My instruction will be based on the breath, but it's okay to be creative, not a fire. Tuning into the aliveness, particularly the aliveness of the felt sensations of this body breathing. Appreciating your life's breath. Perhaps at the belly or abdomen. Or noticing the movements of the chest and rib cage. Or the nose and throat. You can also notice the body, the whole body of the breath. From beginning to end. The very beginning of the inhale to the top fullness of the inhale. Back to the last gentle moment of release, the exhale. Noticing any differences in sensation. And if there's any soothing quality. Perhaps a moment of relaxation in the exhale. Or a moment of pleasure, happiness or appreciation on the inhale. And now tuning into any feelings of or intentions of kindness, benevolence, appreciation. And with each out breath, radiating those intentions through this whole body. Through the face and head, throat, chest and heart. Through all the organs and bones and viscera of the torso. Through the arms and legs and hands and feet. As if kindness is a part, a very part of the biological process of breathing itself. All of the cells transpiring, oxygen, carbon dioxide, exchanging nutrients and also exchanging metta. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Just imagining this energy kindness metta, like a soft mist, or soft light. Radiating throughout the body and the breath. And whatever is happening in the heart and mind, allowing this mist, this soft light, to fuse and fill all of it. The open space in, the hidden corners, every little look and cranny, nothing left out. Breathing. And the healing touch of metta to permeate your skin. Warmth. I created warmth from the body, even just a little ways out, a quarter inch, centimeter, and arms like, for whatever feels right. Allowing that mist, that soft light, warmth of metta to spread out just a little ways beyond the boundaries of the body. And now inviting someone dear, someone you're fond of in a simple way. Or being you respect deeply, as if they're sitting beside you to also be suffused, permeated, filled by this metta, this radiance or envelope of metta extending beyond this body. Two of you together in a field of kindness. It's helpful to use words to focus these intentions of kindness. And please use your own in your own language, or perhaps form a rhythm out of them. I'll offer a few as possibilities. Be safe, happy, healthy, be peaceful, be useful, and free. Repeating those words or any others that are helpful. Or maintaining silence, that's most helpful. Allowing a rhythm of metta to build a heart and mind, including this other one and yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Noticing the quality of the heart and mind. And rededicating yourself. This moment to the cultivation of this beautiful intention of kindness, good wishes, friendliness. If it feels right, perhaps keeping this dear one, this respected one nearby, expanding, this effusion of metta further out, perhaps with their help, their presence, it is even amplified. Further out towards other beings that come to mind during your life. Beings who might be more on the periphery. Not so well known to you. It's also okay to add other dear ones. Each cell, breathing metta, each breath, further amplifying these good intentions. Safe, happy, healthy. Be peaceful, peaceful, free. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now the invitation is to expand the circle. Still further. Out to any beings you sense or know might could use some kindness. Known or unknown. Radiating good wishes. Good energy on the breath. Good will. Be safe, happy, healthy. Be peaceful, peaceful, and free. Thank you. Now leaving go of any restrictions or specific kind of people or being. Allowing these intentions to radiate through every part of this body, heart, and mind. Spreading out words as far or as close as they want to go. All corners of the mind, all quarters of the world. As feels. Outwards and unbounded. Free. Healthy. Healthy. Peaceful. Peaceful. Free. Free. Free. Free. Free. So before we leave meditative contemplative space. My invitation is as the custom has become when I'm here these nights. To take a moment to wish all of the other members of the happy hour Sangha a moment or two of kindness, of metta, friendliness. Especially including the other folks in this Zoom room. Also perhaps keeping in mind people who've listened in the past with you. Practiced here. People might be listening in the future. Sending that to especially to each of the Zoom tiles. To all the people who are in Zoom, both seen and unseen. Thank you so much for this evening. Sending those wishes and knowing that each of you are receiving them too. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. Time now. For those who want to offer any brief comments or reflections, moments of ahas or struggles. The floor is open for a few minutes. I'm sure you're also fine if you are shy to speak. This is more of a request than a comment. I was interested in the reading you gave tonight. This is the book. It is available in PDF form on the internet. These are Dhamma Dhamna books. You can order them. I'll be in the chat in a while. The meditation tonight was a little bit inspired by a form of meditation. It is a little bit fun. You are very good at that. You are muted. Am I unmuted? Yes. Is he able to demonstrate this practice of radiating that he teaches and talks about? It is more like a radiation of energy of cheese. It is not visible. I think it does. Sometimes it is visible. I have seen a lot of people who seem to glow. I may have been hallucinating when I was looking at them. Martin Luther King seemed to glow for a minute. He was captivated by this glowing quality. I think it is a very important thing to do. There is a chi that if you can master, there is a flow of energy that can become relaxed enough. There is a totally relaxed body. There are different things. There is a glowing outpouring of energy that can be seen and felt. Different people perceive these things in different ways. Some people do not perceive them at all. Some people do not perceive them at all. Some people think that we talk about people, the figure of speech in English, they are glowing with joy. Who knows how? If we are in a state of clarity or natta, we are in an aversive state. Thank you. I will ask questions about the practice and the teachings. I am going to invite those who wish to to stay for breakout rooms, for small group conversations. If you want to stay and do not want to be in a room, simply decline the invitation and stay in the main room quietly and meditate. I will talk about how this practice tonight went for you or you can talk about how this notion of internal and external mindfulness might impact your practice. Or something else in this vein. We will be in breakout rooms for about 6 minutes or 1 minute at the end. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. Welcome back, everybody. Anyone who wants to share any insights that came up for them about necessarily naming other people's names, anything that emerged from you about your practice or about the experience of talking together. Just a few minutes. Yes, cool. Our group seem to be one in which we shared how much we had a hard time sharing. So I just wanted to share that. Okay. But you shared you had a hard time sharing meaning in the group. Yes. The group. But had a good feeling to it. Nice. So a sense of connection around the having a hard time sharing emerged. Exactly. Thank you for sharing that very much. Anybody else. Yes, Diana. Well I didn't make it into a group because I was too late and responding. And so I looked at I was in my own world. But that was fine. I don't thank you for this practice because I started out I was kind of in a lesson wonderful mood and not liking people in the world and so forth. By the end, I was just with someone I cared about and going way beyond my skin and, and, and really feeling very nice about all of it, and especially like getting down to just the single words that helps me a lot, but the whole progression. This particular reading practice has been very helpful to me. So thank you. I'll be faster next time. Thank you so much for the comments. I'm really glad that practice is helpful for you. It's kind of our own rhythm with our own flavor of it right and then it kind of somehow the words with the breathing and something it's just, it's really quite nice. Very welcome and just a technical note anybody, including you of course Diana. I can always move you into a zoom room if you miss your prompt so just private chat me I'm usually at the computer most if not all of the break meditating but I have my eyes kind of open to monitors so. But it sounded like you had a nice meditation on your own anyway. For one more quick word if anyone wants to squeeze in a notion or anything else. Maybe I'll just end the way started the reflection, which is this idea of kindness, internally and externally. As we cultivate within. So, then we can cultivate more kindness, outside of. And as we learn to offer kindness around us, or some of us that comes first. So to we can learn to cultivate more kindness within as we receive kindness from others. So we can learn to offer it to ourselves and to others. And to all as to ourselves. Again, thank you so much for your sincerity in this beautiful practice. Good night everyone take good care. Thank you for your good wishes for your good hearts. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Bye everybody. All right. Thank you.
