The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening. And of course I have to say good
morning or good afternoon, whatever time it might be where you are.
And a really warm welcome. A really warm welcome.
Just this opportunity to practice together and share the Dharma.
Feels like a precious gift for me. Hope it does for you too.
So we'll begin with a guided meditation.
Then we can begin by taking some long, slow, deep breaths.
Not necessary to breathe loudly or to push a lot of air,
but just allowing the breath to come in long and slow.
And to go out long and slow.
Without becoming uncomfortable, so still in a comfortable way.
And just noticing that with the exhale there's a certain amount of relaxation or letting go.
Kind of tuning into, but letting go.
Turning into any sense of ease or comfort or relaxation.
And see if you can notice what is the most comfortable way to breathe right now.
Maybe it's a little bit deep and slow, maybe a little bit more shallow, a bit faster.
Maybe the breath is a little bit rough or smooth. That's okay.
For this moment we're noticing, paying attention to the ease, the comfort and the well-being that can be associated with breathing.
This usually means the breath isn't contrived or forced.
Maybe it's not the most ordinary way of breathing, but the most enjoyable way for you right now at this moment.
The most comfortable for the body, just allowing the body to breathe that way.
The most comfortable for the body, just allowing the body to breathe.
If there is some feeling of comfort or enjoyment with the breath, including that in the breath,
we can practice that feeling, even if it's just a small amount or slight or subtle,
but including that feeling of comfort or enjoyment in the practice.
This too we can notice.
We don't have to do anything with it, we're just noticing.
If the breath feels uncomfortable, can we be okay with not making it be a problem?
It's just how it is right now, and see if you can relax around the discomfort in any way that makes sense for you.
Not making the discomfort go away, not insisting that it be different, and relaxing around it.
It's just how it is right now.
And when the mind wanders, as it will, just noticing that.
No need for judgment, no need to analyze where the mind went and why.
Just very simply, gently, begin again with having a comfortable breath.
Just very simply, begin again with having a comfortable breath.
Just very simply.

Just very simply.
Checking in again and seeing if there's a way in which breathing can be uncomfortable, enjoyable, supportive.
And not worrying how many times the mind has wandered.
It doesn't matter.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
Just beginning again.
And allowing the comfort, the ease that can be available with simply breathing.
Allowing that to be a support in our meditation practice, in our daily life, all the time.
And may this support help us to support others, this simple, ordinary, everyday thing of breathing.
Allowing it to be a source of goodness in the world.
Through the experiences that we have and through our direct contact or indirect contact with others.
That this goodness may spread.
That this goodness may spread.
