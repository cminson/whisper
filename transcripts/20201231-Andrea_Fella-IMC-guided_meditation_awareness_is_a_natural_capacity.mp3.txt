Going to how you are in this moment, this beginning with taking in your human experience as it is right here, right now. 
And from the beginning exploring this possibility of having an attitude of allowing, receiving, allowing your experience to be as it is. 
Whether you are, whether there's agitation or calm or infusion or delight, uncertainty, boredom, just kind of taking stock. 
This is how it is in this moment. 
And if there can be that sense of allowing, just that recognition, oh, this is how it is. 
It's a pointer to what wise mindfulness is. 
And we know that allowing a relaxation of body and mind can support this capacity to be present for what's here. 
If I haven't taken stock of how you are, perhaps there can also be some relaxation. 
As we can scan through our body and let go of tension, just noticing where there might be a holding and allowing a relax or release of tension. 
Sometimes I find dropping in a request. 
May the body relax, not trying to do the relaxation so much, but just seeing how the body and mind respond to that gentle request, may the body relax. 
I often find when I do that, there are releases in places that I didn't know or tense. 
And so dropping it in, maybe again, may the body relax and being available to see how the body responds to that. 
May the body relax. 
Maybe to the mind can relax. 
For this period of time setting aside, seeing if there can be a letting go of thoughts, worries, concerns about the past or the future, and instead opening to, again, how is it in this moment when the mind relaxes it very naturally opens to this present moment experience. 
And from this exploration of relaxation, which has been a mindful exploration of the body and mind, allowing the attention to let go of that particular exploration again in favor of just, and how are you now? How is the mind and body now? It's possible there will have been a shift from earlier. 
So just taking that in. 
And allowing it to be however it is, receiving whatever is obvious in your physical experience and your mental experience, settling back, letting experience come to you. 
This is one way to explore mindfulness, not choosing where to aim the attention, but stepping back like you're taking yourself out of the driver's seat of a car and you become the passenger just available to see the landscape that goes by. 
If this form of mindfulness practice feels useful, you're welcome to continue this. 
And some of you may find it more useful to choose some particular experience like the breath and let the attention rest with that, narrowing the field of what we're paying attention to, but still seeing if there can be a receiving of that. 
How is this breath being received? Experience and receive experience, whether the broader experience or particular experience. 
You don't need to look for anything in particular, just how is the experience showing up? This is actually a very natural part of our human experience, this capacity to know what's happening. 
You don't need to be in charge of it, so can you settle back and relax and allow that natural capacity of being aware, being awake.
