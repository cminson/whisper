 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Um... Yeah, it's good to be with you. Um... Yeah, let's go right into the silence. Um... Yeah, let's go. Um... Yeah, let's go. Um... Yeah, let's go. Um... Um... So maybe... You begin by relaxing, or maybe you begin by becoming sensitive, more sensitive to goodness. Um... To the goodness of your intention, the goodness of the Sangha. What is good in each of us? Part of practice is becoming, uh... Moved by goodness, and so maybe that's a good way to begin. Help us inhabit this moment more fully. Just settle in, in whatever way you settle in these first few minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Um... Yesterday I was meditating outside, and in the distance someone was practicing bagpipes. And when you're meditating, bagpipes are very, very funny. And you may now have the benefit of bagpipes in your sound space. But there's something to hear, so maybe we'll explore outer sound and then inner sound. So first just anchoring attention to the soundscape, the ambient noises of your space. Thank you. Because we tend to subtly image the objects from which sound emerges. And we image those in a kind of location in the theater of our own mind, the sense of spaciousness. The openness of our mind. Just listening for sounds, we'll tend to focus on near sounds, the beginning of sounds, loud sounds. But here we honor sounds from the distance, sounds that are faint sounds when they end, in addition to when they begin. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's as if we allow the sounds to run through us, like a gust of wind that is not trapped inside of us. It just blows through our hope and our fear, trap phenomena. Or grasping in a version what we like, dislike about the sound, or that traps the phenomena in the headquarters of self, we chew on it. But instead, in our practice, we practice letting sound run right through. In this awareness of the soundscape, we can also include our own verbal thinking. Usually we just call it thinking, and usually we don't hear it in the sense of knowing thinking as thinking, we don't hear the phenomena of verbal thought. We are just identified with it and obey. So now the awareness feels almost as if it's poised, perched, listening for the arising of auditory thinking. And it's generally true that the awareness will disrupt auditory thinking. The presence of awareness means that we can't be fully identified with the content of our thought. But we listen as we can for the words and senses, for the chatter, for the embryonic auditory thoughts, the thoughts that seem to beg us to think them. And so now we're letting the attuning to the soundscape as it runs right through our own heads. So In a way, we practice not treating thoughts as some special species of sound, but in the same category as the birds, the garbage truck, and the neighbors. So
