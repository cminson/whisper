The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Afterless.
Things are spontaneously arising like the breath movements or sensations, sounds.
Primarily aware of this beingness
that is now it's empty of any identities.
It's so fruitless and futile to create or cling to any identities here.
This being so completely utterly relaxed in this open, unhindered, unfettered,
allowing the ceaseless arising of perceptions, even thoughts, but we don't pursue or try to resolve any of the thoughts just letting them be.
Who are you?
Maybe this feels a little like freedom.
Maybe this is satisfying.
Just being.
Letting thoughts be.
Letting them dissolve on their own.
You don't have to do anything to get rid of them, no conflicts, or promote them, resolve them.
To get more in touch with this sense of being.
Try saying these two words.
I am.
And with nothing else.
Just, I am.
And let it be.
No concepts.
You are.
Essentially alive.
If life said to you, to your life, who are you?
You might say, I'm like you on life.
This life, this being, has no shape.
Who we are, our essential being, is formless.
It has no beginning.
It's just here, no middle, no end.
Just so completely here.
No boundaries in space.
It was never born.
It doesn't suffer.
It does have consciousness.
Maybe it is consciousness.
This relaxed, effortless, natural being.
Like space, infinitely, wide, expansive, empty.
Of identity.
This is where our compassion leaves us.
This is an enlightened, compassionate intention to be free.
Love.
Maybe you can feel your compassionate intention
to be free, to be liberated from the painful illusions
that we mistake for what is me.
The painful strivings, entanglements with these dreams of the mind
are we long to be free, long to be peaceful, long to be happy.
Love.
Goodness. Wisdom.
It's who we are, essentially, when we just relax and allow ourselves to come home,
to simply be ourselves.
Okay, thank you.
So welcome.
Wonderful to see all of you.
All of you wonderful people who want to be free.
Just like me.
All of you.
Want to be happy.
Maybe take a minute and look at each other and realize that she's just like me.
She has her own voices and images, but essentially she has this enlightened intention.
She has compassion.
She has love.
She has wisdom.
She wants to be peaceful.
We're all the same in that.
Sangha, supporting each other in that intention.
Maybe look at yourself for a moment.
See that in yourself, that you yourself have this compassion for yourself.
For your loved ones, you want your loved ones to be happy and free, right?
Your friends, maybe even passers-by.
A repairman, people you meet at the grocery store.
We have this natural kindness.
This natural warmth.
People smile at us.
We kind of melt.
So sweet.
We're all so sweet.
Like Sharon Salzberg said,
when someone is kind to us, we blossom like a flower.
When we see the goodness of others, we allow them to flower within.
When we see the goodness in ourselves, we allow ourselves to flower.
Mingyur Rinpoche, maybe the leading Tibetan Rinpoche of our time,
says how essential it is to recognize this in ourselves.
This is the heart of meditation, is to recognize the inherent goodness in oneself and all beings.
This is the quintessential practice.
And the Dalai Lama says, my religion is kindness.
There he is, the king of Buddhism.
Certainly the king of Tibetan Buddhism.
But everybody, presidents, world leaders, respect the Dalai Lama.
Doesn't say my religion is Buddhism.
He says my religion is simply kindness.
And what do you think about this radical statement by Shantideva, a 7th century,
kind of a celestial being of Buddhism?
All the joy the world contains comes through wishing happiness for others.
And I think in a way we can include ourselves in the others, just this wishing happiness.
All the misery in the world comes through wanting pleasure for oneself.
So I had a couple of discussion suggestions for our next small group.
Maybe beginning with, and this, you know, we're also shy.
It's not fair.
It's so easy to see the goodness in others.
The question was, what goodness do you see in this person or that person?
Easy.
But when we say what is your own goodness, what is your own,
what do you see about your own goodness?
We're a little shy.
But don't be shy.
It's good for you.
Maybe Rinpoche says it's quintessential.
Quintessential.
It's really important.
And you might spend your entire time on that.
That's okay.
But then there are a couple of other, if you exhaust that.
Well, I think it's kind of interesting that maybe you've had this experience.
I think you have.
After social experiences, we often come out of that and we have self-doubts or
recriminations.
I should have said this.
I didn't do that.
They said this about me.
And I suggested for the next few days when you're with others,
be aware of your own kindness to them, your own goodness to them.
Be.
And then see how that affects the resonance afterwards.
I don't know if you did that.
If you didn't do that, you can probably imagine.
I'm going to a St. Patrick's Day party tonight in our neighborhood.
They always have it.
And if I go with the intention to get people to like me,
and then I, so I go in that room, a lot of people, you know,
and, and, oh, this is the most important, important person to like me.
So I go to that person first.
And I am talking to somebody who's not that important to like me.
So I looking around while I'm talking with them.
That's one experience of the party.
And then I come home and I, you can imagine how you feel it.
Well, did the person like me or did I, you know, all kinds of reprimanations.
But what I'm going to personally, I'm going to go to that party with the
intention of just being kind.
And I don't care who I talk to.
Or if I sit by myself, probably long because they're very social,
but it doesn't matter.
Just be kind.
And I, that's, that's going to be my intention.
And then how will that affect me afterwards?
Come home feeling much cleaner, I think.
So yeah, that was something to, that's something that you could perhaps
think about and discuss.
Kind intention.
The Eightfold Path.
The Buddha talks all about suffering on the first step.
Second step is the intention of kindness.
Of, of letting go of self concerns and just being kind.
Renunciation of self concerns to enter the path.
Okay.
So that's enough for me.
So please enjoy your discussions, you know, watch the time so that it's,
you know, equal and we'll come back in about 20 minutes.
I said, welcome back.
And I hope you had a great discussion.
Good to see you all again.
I wanted to make an announcement.
We are having a half day in person for the senior sangha on April 14th.
So if you'd like to sign up for that, it's on the calendar.
So maybe if there are one or two people that would just like to comment on your
discussion, what, what came up, it would be just good to get a couple of voices
into the large group here.
Go ahead.
And Gail too.
I see.
Oh, Gail and I are good opponents.
In my group, Gail wasn't there, but in my group, we were talking about a comment
you made, David, about, um, we go in with good intentions, but we come out with
recriminations about our behavior.
And so we got into how do we deal with this?
What can we do?
And, um, he came up with some lovely ideas, but mainly was, uh, if we were taking
care of ourselves first, before making a visit to a friend who might be very
elderly and repetitive and telling old stories to us that we, you know, don't
have the time for really or seem not to have the time for, um, if we can somehow
prepare for that in ourselves, um, that that would be very, very helpful.
And there might be less recriminations coming out of that meeting.
And it was lovely.
Thank you.
Yeah. Be prepared before you go in.
Where are you going?
Yeah.
Like I'm doing for this party.
I'm going to tonight.
I'm prepared.
Gail.
So please.
Thank you.
It's good to not depend on how and whether I'm feeling love and kindness.
At the moment.
Um,
Maybe I'm not, and I could get worried about it. I could think, oh, I'm not.
Not really kind.
Um, and loving.
Because I don't feel it, but.
And it just needs to be accepted and seeing.
That's part of the whole.
And, and, uh,
The intention.
To, um,
But it will one person with using the image of peeling back the onion.
The intention to feel back layers and reach the heart.
It is just so good and lovable.
Um,
And if we can.
Just have faith in that.
Um,
If the intention is, is there.
Yeah.
That's, um,
That's,
That's one of the thoughts that it gives me a sort of faith and.
In goodness and kindness.
Right.
Sweet. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you all. I hope you had good discussions. Those were great.
Comments.
And, um,
Now we're very fortunate to, uh,
Hear from my dear friend and.
Wonderful teacher Robert Cusick, Robert, please.
Hmm.
Thank you. Thank you, David. And, um,
I'm happy to be here with all of you today. Uh, I had to come in late. I.
I'm still working and was engaged in a series of meetings this morning.
So, um,
I missed, uh, what David did, but I,
I think that I'm not going to go too far off the rails.
Here, um,
With what I want to talk about, uh,
With you all for the next few minutes or so.
And then, uh, I'll also have you go into a breakout room to,
To just sort of explore together.
Um, a prompt that I, that I want to offer you.
So I, I want to talk to you this morning about the quality of.
Inherent goodness or our, uh, basic essential goodness.
And I, as I reflected on this, I was noticing that, you know,
As people age, as we age, we naturally,
We begin to experience really a dizzying array of physical and mental changes
And transitions that totally run the gamut from everything from loss,
Heartbreak, grief, sadness, or disappointment,
Disappointment in others, disappointment in ourselves,
Sometimes disappointment in life itself.
To what could be characterized and what I would characterize as a,
As a sort of the full arc.
And on the other end is the direct knowing of a kind of indescribable happiness
Or a profound sense of peace and contentment that feels steady
And that feels reassuring and safe.
It's a refuge from the distractions and challenges
And all the ups and downs of our daily life experience.
And this arc is completely natural in part of what it means for us to be human.
So in the ebb and flow of our lives, it's important,
At least I think it's important that we learn how to keep returning to
And staying anchored in our hearts, deeper core values and intentions.
Just to stay connected with our heart at this level that goes deeper
Than what we think about and what we ruminate about.
So our lives are so full of experiences that trigger and challenge us
And throw us off balance.
I think this is true for everyone.
Even a profoundly beautiful experience like compassion
Puts us in direct face-to-face contact with the reality of suffering
In ourselves as well as in others.
Compassion is a response to suffering.
So even in the realm of compassion,
It's important that we learn how to return to and stay anchored in the heart
And in the greater purpose that calls us all to this community
That we've created here with all of you, this senior sangha
Or whatever community we're a part of
To stay connected to this place that stirs in us to trust and take refuge
In the Triple Gem, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha
And I would add to what I think David was pointing to you too earlier
It's for us to stay anchored in our own essential goodness
And our ability to meet ourselves and others with kindness and care
Recognizing our shared human desire
That all of us want to be happy
None of us wants to suffer
We all want to be happy and we all want to be free from suffering
So this inherent goodness is like an anchor for us
It's like a North Star if we see it this way
And this anchor can stabilize us, it can guide us, it can sustain us
And it is what fortifies us through the vicissitudes of our own aging process
Especially when we bump into the edges and all the things that we protest about
And resist in the flow of our day-to-day lives
So trusting in our own essential goodness is something that can help us stay on track
And feel balanced
It helps us to maintain a quality of stability that feels safe
That feels like we're connected to ourselves in a way that is very organic and natural
And it really feels safe
And this can be an intentional and a deliberate practice for any of us
It can be a way for us to see and acknowledge the other half of life
So what do I mean by this? What do I mean by this other half of life?
Well, we know that suffering is part of life
This is, after all, what the Buddha taught
It's undeniable and no one of us could claim that our life has been free of suffering
But to embody our full humanity, it's equally important for us to see the goodness, the kindness, and the compassion
That's also present in us and around us
And it's important for us to embody and experience that directly
It's one thing to think about it, it's one thing to talk about it, it's another thing to read about it
But to embody and experience that quality of kindness, the quality of compassion
To recognize the essential goodness that tilts you and inclines you in this direction
Is quite remarkable, it's quite beautiful, and it's accessible to any and all of us
So there's a psychologist, a professor of ethical leadership at New York University, NYU
And this guy's name is Jonathan Haight
And his research suggests that when people deliberately pay attention to qualities like kindness, like compassion and goodness in others
This is interesting, when we simply start to pay attention and notice these qualities in others
It promotes the awakening of those same qualities in ourselves
So he's a researcher and I'm a Buddhist practitioner and I might say when we cultivate those qualities in ourselves
Others can begin to recognize that and cultivate those qualities in themselves
In other words, we've modeled for one another
So his research shows, or showed I should say
That when we deliberately pay attention or recognize positive traits in others
It literally breaks down barriers between us and leads to more acts of kindness and compassion
And all of this ripples out into the world
So as practitioners, as we train our minds, we literally change our brains
The way that our brains function and work
And the term that Jonathan Haight uses for this is he calls it moral elevation
Because when we recognize these wholesome qualities in others
It figuratively elevates us and creates the causes and the conditions for us to live and act from the best version of ourselves
So you might ask why is this important for us?
That's a reasonable question
And as I mentioned earlier, this is the other half of the human experience
Yes, there is suffering
But at the same time, kindness and care and joy and goodness coexist as part of how we experience our full humanity
And unfortunately, the goodness part, the goodness piece doesn't get broadcast to us nearly as much as the bad news
Researchers have coined the phrase negativity bias which some of you may know of the work of Rick Hansen
He's a neuroscientist or a neuropsychologist and he aptly describes this as
Our brains are like Teflon for positive thoughts but like Velcro for negative thoughts
And I don't know if that rings true for you but it most certainly does in my experience
I gloss over that which is easy and positive and I get hooked on the things that I think are difficult and challenging
And that have tripped me up or triggered me
And this is just part of being human
And this is partly why we're having you engage in very deliberate breakout sessions together
So you can consciously give attention to the qualities of joy and goodness and care and kindness and compassion
And in this talk that I'm giving here, I'm using the term fundamental goodness to sum up the very best parts of our humanity
You can use whatever word or term works for you to describe these traits, the traits of kindness and care and goodness and compassion
And to be clear, it's a practice to consciously look for these traits, to look for goodness, to recognize it
Both in ourselves, sometimes it's the hardest place to see it as well as to look for it in others
And this intentional practice actually helps us maintain balance and clarity and inspire us as we do the hard sometimes difficult work of meeting and addressing
All this stresses and suffering which are also part of our everyday lived experience
So before I send you into a breakout room to process with each other
I'm going to invite you now to just take a moment, just a moment or two to think about and reflect on this notion of basic essential goodness
And if or how it does or doesn't show up in your own life
How do you recognize this quality of your basic essential goodness?
This quality that wants to be happy and doesn't want to suffer
How does this show up in your life?
See you in 10 minutes folks, have fun, swim in your essential goodness
Okay, so we're going to go on a break in a few minutes for about 5 minutes or so, a quick bio break
But before we go, we maybe have room for a comment or two, if you want to share what that was like for you and in your group
Elaine has her hand up, thank you Elaine
Come off of mute
Good idea, thanks
So we were saying that I like the format of going back and being able to go much deeper with the people that I had earlier spent time with
So thank you for that
Okay, wonderful, good
Don't be shy folks
Rada also has her hand up I think, do you, Rada?
Yes, I do, I do, can you hear me?
Perfectly
I totally agree with Elaine, thank you for saying that Elaine
We also enjoyed and got to know each other even better by repeating in the same session, our meeting
Lovely, lovely
That was by the way, that was Joe's idea, so thank you Joe
Thank you Joe, I got a third waltin for the sink
Right, and I don't know what the prompts were for the first group, so I'm glad it was a good prompt that allowed you to take it even deeper
So
I actually appreciated that too
Okay, great, I appreciated that, and we talked about authenticity in our session, which can be a fearful thing
Because other people are going to judge you maybe, and you're not going to like you, and maybe you're going to offend somebody and whatever
But it seems to me that that's important to me
When I'm most authentic, I feel I'm at my best
You are
I agree, we're all at our best when we're most authentic
Yeah, lovely
But it's, you can question yourself and go back and forth about are you being authentic or are you being a charlatan
Yeah
It gets a little complicated sometimes
So maybe we can talk about that in a future senior saga, because that's a whole topic of itself
And Randy, you're going to get the last word before we do this short break
I think my group mates would agree that we found that coming together of the four of us to talk about our inherent goodness was a moment of feeling inherent goodness
Beautiful, beautiful
Yeah, inherent goodness recognized in other people awakens that in us, it breaks down the barriers, just like Jonathan Haight said in his study
Well, I'm glad that you all had an opportunity to share a second time, and let's take about a five minute bio break and then Fiona will start promptly at 25 to the hour
So
I was a lot of the practice for me recently has more into the form of gratitude practice
So insight, meditation, you know, really seeing, really feeling what's going on
has changed for me, there's a sense of amazement and gratitude
Just what's arising is rather remarkable
And then I listened to a talk by a local Zen teacher
And I loved the title of his pep talk for aging, he said, instead of aging gracefully, perhaps to age gratefully, and I loved that
Just to really appreciate what's still here
Robert was referring to the diminishments in our aging, things that are lost, the losses, the challenges, the changes that are unbidden, but here they come
The speaker that I'd listened to, his name is Norman Fisher, and he was talking about, you know, I'm amazed, you know, I'm still
My eyesight isn't as good, but I can still see
There's so much I can still do, and to really appreciate what is here, especially this miracle of perception
I can perceive what's going on, I can see, I can notice, I can be present for
What is arising, and this is a miracle
Even my breath meditation, which I've done, I was sharing this with David the other day
For so long it was, oh, this amazing sense of the body sensations in and out of the breath
Of late, it's felt more like this amazement about breathing, it's happening, this amazing process of life
Being in the garden, just amazed, the trees, the plants are respiring in their way
And giving the oxygen in this reciprocal miracle
I've come across practices, oh, gratefulness practices, and it seems somewhat, oh, just one more self-help process
But what I find is actually in acknowledging a sense of gratefulness opens my heart
It relaxes the body, it relaxes the mind, like, wow, look at this
Many years ago in our area we had El Nino, too much water, too much rain
And our neighborhood flooded, our house flooded, water in the house, I mean, everything was ruined
And my husband and I spent every day ripping up floors and everything was filthy
And we were doing it, we were being taken care of
But I remember driving away from the house, it was still raining one day
And there in the street planting in this great February day, daffodils were blooming
And I was so shocked that I could see and be so appreciative of this beauty in the middle of all this challenge
There was this beauty
I want to share something that just came to me this morning, it was not what I intended to talk about
It came from another teacher at IMC in her weekly letters to her yoga community
It's a poem by a poet I'm just learning about, Rosemary Watola Trome
This was in response to the fact that coming up in a few days is the international day of happiness
And in a time when we're reading the news and we're seeing things, how to cultivate, acknowledge, nurture happiness, kindness
So here's the poem
Dear Finn, this was a letter to her son
Full of seed, the bird feeder hangs from the cottonwood tree we planted years ago
Even without the birds it's beautiful, dangling mid-air with its copper perches and glass column
This morning in the news we're going to war with each other, either with words or with missiles
It seems clear that we are our own problem
No wonder we try to bring beauty in close, the garden with its open-faced pansies, the hummingbird feeder with its hold of sugar
The battles are not what will save us, it's beauty, not just outside us but in us
All day let us look for ways to be like this brown bird at the feeder, see how it gathers light in its open wings
The battles are not what will save us, it's beauty, not just outside us but in us
All day let us look for ways to be like this brown bird at the feeder, see how it gathers light in its open wings
I think we were talking earlier, this inner goodness, this light inside which has maybe been covered or unacknowledged, shy, hidden, what's there?
It seems to emerge when I can relax, open, mind, the heart, just arises this beauty
Look at this, just incredible gratitude, we're here
This gift of the Dharma, this gift of life, we're still here
How can we enter this day with an open heart and see what arises?
How can we meet this life with a soft, more open-heart mind?
Let's just be quiet now and listen, just to the breath, just to this body, sensations of aliveness and share the space together, just for a few months
Just for a few months
Just for a few months
Just for a few months
I love these words, what will save us as beauty, the beautiful heart, cultivating kindness, openness
May we cherish this time together and this time of our life, what an opportunity we're still here
What an opportunity to really nurture this beautiful heart inside and share it
With the world, share it with each person we meet
What will save us is beauty, not just outside us but in us
As we gather here now, on this day, coming up to the spring at Quinox
As Ali mentioned earlier, to many people this is the coming of the new year, not in January but in this change of season, into the spring
And the world news is distressing and how to bring what beauty and kindness into the life we have here that we're living, wherever we are
But I did want to mention, if people were so inspired, Gil through Insight Meditation Center has offered that any Donna given to IMC in this week ending tomorrow
will be channeled to save the children and their project in working in Ukraine right now
That all the Donna received will be going to that project, there's a link on the IMC website under what's new if people are inspired to do that, somehow share our good fortune, our generosity, our care for those who are truly suffering right now
Anyway, I want to thank you for your presence and giving me the time to share with you
And I'll hand back to David and Robert and thank you so much for your kind attention
Thank you Fiona. And I'll just add my thanks to everyone who's here today and to this community that's been going for several years now, it's really nice
Many of you who are old timers to the group and some of you who may be new, so whether you're a newcomer or an old timer, you have a home here and you're always welcome and it is a delight to be part of this program with all of you
So be well, be happy and think peaceful thoughts and send them out to the world. The world needs all the compassion it can get
And our hearts open to the Ukrainians and also to the Russians who are being, a war being waged in their name and they have nothing to do with it and the soldiers who are conscripted and maybe really don't want to be there and don't know what else to do
It is a tragedy of epic proportions, so let there be kindness and compassion in our thoughts and not confusion and anger and the kinds of things that separate people and disconnect us
Let us see the humanity in everyone. So have a wonderful month. Thank you for joining us today. David, did you want to say anything?
Just dedicate the merit, whatever merit we have accumulated here today, whatever goodness, whatever insights into the beauty of our lives, the ethics of our lives, the goodness of each other, the goodness of ourselves.
May we dedicate the merit of our insight to the well-being of all beings everywhere. May the merit of our good hearts open and the wisdom of our insight open proliferate throughout this world
To help with all the suffering in the world, to help calm all the suffering in the world, to help the, as Robert said, to all the suffering in Ukraine, to help all the problems of horrible racial discrimination, all of the suffering that's caused
To really penetrate the universal problem of this insane monkey mind that grasps and causes so much suffering.
Now, let's just end with this poem that I've read before. May we and may all beings rest in natural great peace, this exhausted mind beaten helplessly by karma and neurotic thoughts like the restless fury of pounding waves.
In the infinite ocean of samsara, may we rest in natural great peace. Rest in your true being. It's always here.
Good and many blessings.
