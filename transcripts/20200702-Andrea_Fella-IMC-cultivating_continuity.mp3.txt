Sometimes paradoxically when we're trying to track things and trying to maintain a continuity, so your question more about just generally maintaining continuity, sometimes if we're using kind of like a trying to stay with the experience, as opposed to letting the experience come to us, sometimes paradoxically it makes it a little harder in a way. 
You know it's like it wears the mind out a little bit. 
So that's you know that's why I was suggesting the notion of the receiving, it doesn't have to be pure open awareness. 
In the guided meditation I was saying you know if you if you're at with the breath it could be that you kind of narrow it down so that there's a little more sense that okay I know I'm present here, I know I'm with the breath, but then rather than trying to be right on top of every little moment, letting the breath come to you. 
And so that's it creates more of a relaxation in a way. 
It creates more of a relaxation of receiving the experience. 
In receiving the experience it creates a little bit more of a relaxation, and sometimes that can support the continuity. 
But I'm going to say a few more things about continuity because you know continuity is really where power of the mindfulness comes from. 
As the mindfulness gets more continuous that's when the mind can really start to see into what's going on in our experience. 
You know it starts to be able to see the conditioned to nature of our experience. 
It can see things happening very quickly even at times. 
But initially that in the receptive practice the it can feel a little bit like where's the detail? You know it wears the detail. 
How do I know that I'm really seeing one thing after another? And it's more in the in the receptive awareness it's more of a kind of a trust that the momentum builds very naturally through just receiving the experience as we can. 
And you know the mind does wander. 
It absolutely does wander. 
But in the receptive awareness as we just receive the experience moment after moment it's like the continuity begins then to reveal more depth of the experience. 
And so with the with the receptive awareness it's kind of more of a patience with the continuity developing more gradually or more naturally in a way. 
So you know with the sometimes with the with certain tool with certain techniques like the Mahasi technique which uses a noting you know you're really actively aiming the mind every moment you know lifting moving placing you know picking up you know raising it putting a fork in the mouth you know you're noting every single thing and it's very active in the mind and that can it can it can like make it can take the mind into continuity in a way to do that. 
So that is one tool that can support continuity is to use a kind of a noting practice. 
In my own experience I've found you know that can be that can be useful at times but at I've also seen people get a little vigorous with that and kind of it gets hooked into our striving habit you know our sense of I'm doing the meditation you know I'm going to figure this out I'm going to make this happen and so I think that the the noting practice can can hook into that and create a little bit more of a striving kind of practice and so there is a way to do the noting practice and receive the experience. 
It's like it's more like you're noting what's being received rather than aiming your mind and then noting it aiming it and noting it so so there's I think that the the what I've seen at least is really cultivating the the receptive side can help with many many forms of meditation practice and can support the continuity. 
One of the things with the receptive practice and continuity is that it's a little it's it's like we need to start recognizing what it feels like to be mindful and that's where you know that's where the the kind of confusion that happens around not being sure about whether you're mindful or not in the open awareness practice that's partly because we're not so attuned to what it means to be aware what what the experience of being aware is and so that that's that's actually when I when I started kind of just being curious about what is it like to be aware so and a great time to notice that is you know your mind has wandered mindfulness returns in that moment there's a kind of that's a great moment to begin to get really familiar with that experience what is it like to be aware in this moment it's like awareness has arisen with some experience maybe it's with the thinking or maybe it's with the sound that's kind of brought us back or a body sensation we don't have to immediately jump back to whatever we were paying attention to before if we were directing the attention at the breath for instance we don't have to immediately jump back to that but take a moment to really take in this is what it's like to be aware again that that will really begin to support the mind to understand what it feels like to be aware and then so I mean often what happens especially at the beginning of meditation you know we're aware for a little while and then we're gone and then we're back and we don't really know where the mind left I'll ask you that question in a moment but you know so so often especially early on it's like we're either we're either present or we're not and then or we're coming back you know so it's it's there's not a sense of what it feels like for the mindfulness to weaken or for the for the the mind to start getting losing touch with awareness that's that's another experience that begins as we begin to get familiar with what it feels like to be aware so aware of some experience aware experience we as we begin to get familiar with that experience we we then can kind of start to get a sense of what it feels like for there to be a weakening of that you know for there to be a sense of the awareness kind of moving off or shifting to something else and that when we start to get familiar with that experience of maybe the awareness weakening a little bit or shifting a little bit then we can we can we can do one of two things at that moment if we have a sense of oh mindfulness is kind of losing touch with the experience we can bring it back to the experience which is you know one way if we're doing directed experience directed attention that might be what we're doing so at one point I was doing this with practicing with the breath I was noticing that that I could feel the attention to the breath start weakening so I was I was attuned to what it's what it was like for myself to be really clearly mindful of the breath and I could feel there be just this little like you know the mind start like it's kind of with the breath it's kind of sort of with the breath but it's kind of also like starting to shift into spacing out or thinking about something or going to another experience so I could feel this like weakening of the attention there and initially I just just like oh okay well I feel that let me just reconnect with the breath so that was that was what I did for a little while with that and then at some point I got interested in oh I'm aware that the attention is leaving the breath why do I have to stay with the breath why don't I just see where the awareness is going and that actually it's kind of it was almost like the the awareness was shifting to some completely new experience that kind of shifted into a very open vast kind of space it was a completely new meditation experience that I had not experienced before and it almost startled me it was kind of like it took me out of the experience but he's like what was that but that was you know so that's another way that I learned that I could explore when I am aware of what it feels like to be mindful and aware of what it's like to kind of lose touch with an object then I could either come back to the object which would cultivate the continuity with that object or I could cultivate the continuity by kind of being curious about not you know knowing what the attention what the awareness is is moving towards but just kind of being curious where is it going what is it what is it doing so those are I'm not sure that's that's quite answering in a sense and it's like how do we how do we improve continuity by continuing to try you know it's it's it really is just the the the continual practice and you know exploring some different things because different minds have different proclivities I'd say some minds really are very more comfortable hanging out with one experience it's kind of like to go oh yeah thank goodness I don't have to know everything other minds like feel like they're in this tight box in being with one experience like being just with the breath would feel like so constricting that the open awareness feels much more easeful and it's it's kind of more easy to kind of cultivate the continuity some minds are kind of more in the middle you know it's like a little of the directed and a little of the receptive maybe that exploration of aiming at the at the breath but then trying to receive might be interesting to explore or you could also try using some of the tools of of noting like if you're staying with the breath you know with with the breath you receive an in-breath just after you're receiving it or as you're receiving it just say in as as the breath goes out and you're receiving it you can say out because that sometimes a mind needs a little a little just a little kind of extra help there so those are a few thoughts I'm gonna stop the recording for a second one other piece that I just occurred to me is there's another piece that can be really useful for supporting continuity and that is getting familiar with the shift of attention so you know when we're sitting in meditation so that's kind of like the attention kind of losing touch but there's also sometimes it happens quickly so you know we're we're sitting in meditation and we're paying attention to the breath and then the attention you know there's the dog starts barking and and our attention is with the hearing sometimes we have this idea oh I'm paying attention to the breath and we we kind of sort of know that we're caught or thinking about the dog but we're kind of thinking we're trying to stay with the breath so if you can be kind of curious about when the attention shifts to something else and not have a preference for staying with whatever it was before but kind of curious oh the attention shifted can I be with that can I can I know you know the attention shifted to the dog barking so can I know hearing or the attention shifted to a thought can I know that thinking is happening or the attention shifted to a body sensation or an emotion so there's a kind of a feeling of the attention shifting that's also really useful and there's a fun way to play with this to get start to get familiar with it and that that in in doing walking meditation so if you're out doing walking meditation you know I'd encourage at times to let yourself take in the field of seeing there's a one tool or one teaching or one practice that I often suggest for walking meditation is that you do kind of more an open awareness with the with the walking but then you you do a particular kind of exploration and that is let yourself take in seeing because seeing is happening a lot in walking meditation so let yourself know that you're seeing and then be curious about while seeing is happening noticing sometimes there's a sense of seeing and noticing the difference between seeing and looking at something so you know you're you're in this walking and just taking in like maybe it just feels like you're just kind of knowing the general sense of the the field of seeing and then there's movement and suddenly you are looking at that bird that's flying across your path it's very natural it's it's like it's just the nature of the mind to to shift from seeing to looking when there's movement or when there's color or perhaps you hear a sound and you orient and look there so kind of curiosity about that process you can you can explore that with seeing you can explore with hearing to kind of you may be like taking in the ambient sound and then a crow's calls and you're listening to that so noticing the difference between hearing just taking in the ambient sound and when your mind orients to a particular thing in the field of hearing so both of those are looking at that factor of attention and the shift of attention so in the seeing you know you're just kind of walking and then suddenly there's the shift of attention so that's kind of getting familiar with that experience of the attention shifting in the hearing also and you might notice that you hear something and then the mind orients to seeing so the field of seeing and hearing is really especially when you're walking is a really great place to play with getting familiar with the shift of attention and then you can start to be curious about that experience in the sitting meditation as well because I would say that probably the number one cause of the mind losing awareness is that the attention shifted to something and we didn't notice that it shifted you know it shifted the attention shifted and then we started thinking about it but we never noticed that the attention had shifted so if we can be aware of that that quality of oh the mind is shifting and it's it's like that you know we're attending to some experience and we kind of feel the attention you know leave this experience and go to another it's it's similar to that but you can you can you know kind of also notice that it's kind of jumping from object to object it's it's you know and it can sometimes have a jumpy quality or a smooth flowing quality of the shift of attention so a kind of a curiosity about that can be really helpful to support continuity yeah so the question of is it doesn't make sense to start with focusing on the breath before moving to open awareness and and whether or not it makes sense to to do one thing to to stay with the breath for sitting or or let it go as it does back and forth this I think this is really person-specific there's no one right way I think a lot of it depends on the mind somebody's you know what the what what what what supports you in this moment to be aware and be present what supports you and so if it supports you to be stabilizing the mindfulness to stay with the breath that's fine there is one thing that I will say though and and it's also fine actually it is fine to to stay with the breath for a little while and then and then you might notice that the attention gets drawn somewhere you notice the shift of attention and then you're with that thing for a little while and then you might notice the shifted attention to something else so it can be that that the attention kind of naturally shifts into open awareness for a little while and then after a little while of that it decides or kind of naturally shifts back to a more focused attention I see that happens a lot for me when I do open awareness there's times that the attention just kind of finds its way to the breath and and it's like I didn't decide that it's just that's what's happening so the receptive awareness or the open awareness doesn't necessarily mean you're always wide open what it means is that you're kind of honoring where the attention wants to gravitate to and sometimes that me may be very focused and sometimes it may be more open now there's another piece of the of the question that I wanted to point to oh I remember you said that you know it feels like your mind is just kind of busy doing this thing and then jumping to there and doing this and that and that it feels a little bit chaotic potentially in the open awareness you know sometimes that's just a transitional kind of experience and that it feels like because we're familiar with the experience of a kind of a stability of object with the attending to one experience it's kind of like that the concentration there has a particular quality it feels a particular way to be with the breath and stay with it and and it's like we get familiar with that and then when we're in an open awareness and the objects are changing it feels very different and so it's hard to have the sense of the stability there the stability of the awareness there can be a stability of the awareness there even as the objects are changing and so there's there's a learning process about what that experience is like you know and then this is where attending to or attuning to there's mindfulness here there is awareness here that we begin to get a sense of that stability of the awareness even as the objects are changing so it's a different quality or different kind of experience it's not better and it's not worse it's just different and yet it's really valuable to learn how to do both because sometimes our minds are doing one and sometimes they're doing the other so that it's if we can't be aware when the mind is doing a lot of different things we're never going to be able to be aware in our daily lives because our daily lives our minds are doing a lot of things so the the it's a skill to develop and it does feel a little bit strange and so sometimes with the open awareness you have to let it feel odd for a little while let it feel a little uncomfortable for a little while so that you can learn what the stability of the awareness is.
