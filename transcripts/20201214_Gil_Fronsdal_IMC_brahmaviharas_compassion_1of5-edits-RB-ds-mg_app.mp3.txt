With this talk, I begin a five -part series on the 
brahmavihāra  of compassion. It's hard to imagine 
Buddhism without compassion. It's one of the primary 
forces that has brought Buddhism to us down through 
the ages – one of the primary movements that, with 
awakening, are awakened within us. The more awake 
we become, the more compassion, care, love, and 
goodwill there is.  
 
I'd like to think that awakening – this famous English 
word for liberation or enlightenment – includes the 
awakening of compassion. And ce rtainly, for me, one of 
the big surprises and treasures of Buddhist practice 
was the slow and gradual awakening of compassion. It 
was so gradual and slow that I didn't really recognize audiodharma.org  
 that it was happening. Even though I was changing, I 
wasn't oriented to  notice it.  
 
Looking back, after a few years of practice, I see that 
maybe I didn't get enlightened, but I certainly became 
'compassioned.’ I discovered this wonderful quality in 
myself. And to my surprise, it was a quality that was 
very satisfying to feel. It had a fe eling of sweetness, 
settledness, and rightness.  
 
In and of itself, compassion is not troubled by anything. 
To come to this untroubled compassion is one of the 
great tasks of a lifetime. It's certainly easy to experience 
one’s own suffering and the sufferi ng of others. It’s easy 
to have alarm, upset and distress around it. It's also 
possible to have qualities of compassion, together  with 
distress. But one of the great gifts we can give the 
world, a gift that comes from Buddhist practice, is to be 
able to ha ve compassion without any distress.  
 
What is compassion? I almost don't want to define it too 
much. Sometimes, I like to think that I don't really know 
exactly what compassion is, even though it's been one 
of the central organizing principles for much of m y adult 
life. I can think of very few things that are more audiodharma.org  
 important to me than the compassion that’s been 
awakened in me. It’s important for how I live, for what 
motivates me, and for how I orient myself in the world.  
 
It's clearly very important for me.  So, it may be a bit odd 
for me to say that I can't define it exactly. And, perhaps, 
it's because, over the years of my practice, what I’ve 
called compassion has changed. It may be that as I've 
developed, or as circumstances have changed, the 
quality, the characteristics of compassion, have not 
stayed the same. In fact, maybe there are different 
forms of compassion. In the course of time, we can tap 
into these different forms, shapes, and characteristics of 
compassion. We don't want to narrow it down to jus t 
one thing: "This is what it is."  
 
Although I'm a bit reluctant to give a definition of 
compassion, it can be helpful to understand some of its 
classic definitions. The classic Buddhist definition – the 
one in our Theravāda  tradition – probably doesn't c ome 
from the Buddha. Actually, he never defined karuṇā. It’s 
a bit a guessing game to understand what he meant by 
the word karuṇā, the Buddhist word for compassion.  
 audiodharma.org  
 Buddhaghosa, a teacher who lived about a thousand 
years after the Buddha, provides a wond erful 
description of karuṇā. He begins his definition with 
something he loves to do – something that many 
Buddhist teachers in Asia love to do – namely, he 
connects the meaning of a word with words that sound 
similar. It’s not quite a game of etymology, bu t a game 
involving the correspondence of similar sounding 
words. Karuṇā starts with the letters ’k’ and ‘a.’ So, as 
part of his definition, Buddhaghosa offers many Pali 
words that also start with the letters 'k' or 'k -a-r.' He 
sees these words as providing  a resonance with 
karuṇā, the Pali word for compassion, as well as a 
reason for it.    
 
So, for the word compassion, I will suggest some 
English words that start with 'c', 'c -a', or 'c -o' in order to 
go along with the 'c -o' sound at the beginning of the 
word. This is the closest in meaning to what the Pali 
words are.  
 
It’s compassion  because it causes  the hearts of good 
people to be moved by the suffering of others. What 
does it mean to be a good person? To be a good 
person might mean to be an ethical perso n, someone audiodharma.org  
 who tries their best to not live from hatred, greed, and 
lust. But rather from qualities of friendliness, goodwill, 
kindness, and wisdom.  
 
People who have discovered why meditation is so 
helpful, I think, is because meditation helps us to 
becom e good people. It helps free us from the forces of 
hostility, ill will, and from things that we do that can hurt 
other people. It helps us to be strongly motivated not to 
hurt. And, if we're a person who's able to be in the 
present moment –  this is such an  important place to be 
as a reference point, as a discovery of this life. Then, 
something inside of us moves, to be in the presence of 
other people's suffering and to know about it. Some 
people translate karunā  as to tremble or shake. We're 
moved by the su ffering of others. And the question is, 
“How are we moved?” How are we moved so there's no 
distress?  
 
Then, the definition goes further and says, it’s 
compassion, because it combats , strikes, and destroys 
the suffering of others. It's a bit paradoxical or  ironic to 
use such violent terms in relation to compassion, but it 
does speak to a strong motivation to really make a 
difference, to really try to overcome suffering in this audiodharma.org  
 world. It speaks to the idea of not simply accepting 
suffering, but instead to ha ve a goal, an idea, that 
suffering can be ended in one way or another.  
 
And, it’s compassion because it covers  or moves to 
cover those who suffer. Compassion can also mean in 
Pali, 
 to move or to affect other people who suffer. So, 
compassion touches other people. It moves, covering 
those who suffer. Actually, here’s a different translation: 
"reaching out to pervade those who suffer." It’s 
compassion, because it covers those who suff er. It 
moves us. We reach out from the heart with the idea of 
suffusing or spreading compassion.  
 
Is it fanciful to think that compassion can spread out 
from us into the world? Is there a force like electricity – 
like wavelengths of vibration – that sprea ds out? What 
is it? I don't know. And I'm disinclined to call it anything 
specific.  
 
But we do affect each other. We do pick up the cues, 
the tone of voice, the mannerisms of others. We can 
feel, sometimes, the intentions of others. And we know 
that this spreads out. We know that, somehow, people audiodharma.org  
 are touched by it. It resonates with people. And we 
open our hearts and spread loving -kindness and 
compassion to the world as if we're suffusing, as  if we're 
touching other people who suffer.  
 
There's a little bi t more I want to say about this ancient 
definition: "Compassion is characterized as supporting 
what reduces suffering." I like this definition, because 
it's not necessarily saying that we work directly to end 
suffering, but that we can help reduce the supp ort for 
suffering, the underlying causes for suffering. And those 
causes can be many things. Sometimes it's things in the 
external world. Sometimes it's things within us. But 
whatever it is that conditions people to suffer, these 
things are addressed by pe ople who have compassion.  
 
The idea expressed in the next quote is very important: 
"Compassion functions to not carry  the suffering of 
others." Compassion has this quality. When we have 
this karuṇā kind of compassion, we’re not burdened or 
distressed by th e suffering of others. That’s one of the 
key qualities of compassion – to not be distressed by or 
burdened by suffering, and to be interested in 
alleviating suffering elsewhere. "It manifests as the audiodharma.org  
 absence of cruelty. Its proximate cause is to see the 
helplessness of those overwhelmed by suffering."  
 
That can touch the heart in a deep way. People suffer. 
But there are some people who have no ability to help 
themselves because of their circumstances, or because 
of what's happening in the world. And that really tugs at 
the heart. If they can't help thems elves, who's going to 
help them?  
 
"Let me help them." People live in war zones. People 
experience tremendous oppression, and there's no way 
out of the terrible state they're in. The idea that 
sometimes people are helpless in their suffering tugs at 
the he art and awakens this kind of karuṇā – 
compassion.  
 
"Compassion succeeds when it makes cruelty  subside, 
and fails when it produces sorrow." So, when cruelty 
subsides, hostility subsides. It doesn't elicit sorrow or 
distress in us. Our hearts are moved in s uch a way that 
we're not burdened or distressed. There's an absence 
of hostility and anger. There’s a strong motivation to 
help and support people to suffer less.  
 audiodharma.org  
 Those are the general parameters of what compassion 
is. I think that, many times, this qual ity doesn't involve 
being burdened. There's no distress or sorrow involved 
in compassion. That is the art of compassion. That is 
the magic or the specialness of it.  
 
Some people can’t believe or justify that. They feel as 
though there has to be sorrow and  distress. They feel 
that there has to be a sense of the weight of the world 
being on their shoulders.  
 
But to have this compassion is sweet. Compassion is 
one of the great sources of being happy in the world:  
If you want to be happy, live compassionatel y.  
 
The compassion of karuṇā, this particular kind of 
compassion that both the Buddha and Buddhaghosa 
emphasize, is a very special thing.  
 
I hope that these few words about compassion will 
awaken a curiosity in you, and an interest in the 
question: "What  is compassion for you?" What does 
your compassion feel like? What reference do you have 
for compassion that is sweet? Or, what reference do 
you have for compassion as a source of well -being – audiodharma.org  
 compassion that is deeply moved by the suffering of the 
world, but is not burdened by it or distressed by it? 
What is that?  
 
Do you have a reference point for it? If not, maybe you 
can reflect on these questions. Think about them. And, 
over the next day, talk to people about your relationship 
to compassion and how you understand it.  
 
Thank you very much.
