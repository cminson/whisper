The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Kind of internal, looking at ourselves, looking at how we are, observing our
experience. This is a big part of our practice for sure. And yet the Buddhist
teachings include the relational, also, how we are in community, how we are with
each other. And he had a lot to say about cultivating skillful relationships.
A big chunk of the Eightfold Path is about skillful relationships. Why is
action? Why speech? Nice livelihood. And the key or the piece in terms of the
cultivation of skillful relationships is can we or how do we engage in a way that
cultivates non-harming, that cultivates harmony, we could say. Cultivates
harmonious relationships. The emphasis on this really in my
understanding is that the Buddhist path, the Eightfold Path, is really pointing
towards how do we free ourselves from suffering, stress, how do we let go of
suffering, abandoned suffering. How do we do that? And the Buddhist
says or points to, I think, the harmonizing in relationships, if we
want to be free of suffering ourselves, then we should engage in our
relationships in a way that would not add harm into the world, or it would
create harmony in the world instead of stress in the world. So this is not an
easy task. It's not an easy ask. Last week we talked some about the why speech
aspect of the Eightfold Path, a little bit of the teachings on why speech, and
partly I was thinking about it in terms of its, for many of us, it's kind of the
holiday time, the end of year, holiday time, and seeing families or in situations
with, in relationship a lot, perhaps, and things come up often, especially in
families, you know, that stress can often arise in families, and how can we have
our practice contribute to harmony in our interactions, especially through
speech. And so last time I spoke about that, and I would like to continue a
little bit with that tonight. At the end, we didn't have time for questions
yesterday, and last time we didn't have time for questions, and I thought it
would be nice to have space for questions on speech today, but I thought
I'd recap just a little bit to just set the stage a little bit. So we talked
last time about four kinds of speech to avoid. The classic teaching on why
speech is to avoid or refrain from false speech, harsh speech, divisive speech, and
idle chatter. And the the instructions connected with these point us to
avoiding speech that is intending to deceive, avoiding speech, false speech,
is speech that's intending to deceive, avoiding speech that is intending to
create pain in the listener, harsh speech, whether through the words or through
the tone of voice, avoiding creating speech that creates divisions between
people, that divides people, that's divisive speech. So avoiding speech that
has the intention to divide, and avoiding speech that has no purposeful
intention at all, the idle chatter. And it's important, I think, to connect
with the intention side of it. We stressed this a little bit last time to
look at what is the intention behind speech, what is your purpose for
speaking. Because sometimes, for example, I gave an example with idle chatter, you
know, it might be that at a holiday gathering, if it's a gathering with some
people you don't know, you might start with a conversation about the weather,
and that maybe seems like idle chatter. But the intention behind that is to
connect. So the intention behind that speech isn't to just speak with no
purpose, the intention has a kind of a nonverbal purpose. And so, you know,
that we need to look at the intention behind our speech as we're exploring
these these kinds of speech. And it may be that we say something that is not
intended to be harsh, for example, but somebody receives it as harsh. And in
that case, you know, then the way I look at that for myself is, okay, that my
intention was not to create pain in the listener, and yet pain was created in the
listener. So what can I do to understand what I didn't understand? So that it's
like, I'm not feeling like I spoke harshly, but I would like to
understand why the other person received it in that way. What did I not know? What
did I not understand about the context of the situation? What did I not understand
about something about the person? And so it's like, we want to not just look
at the intention. Sometimes there's this in some of the explorations around
diversity and equity and inclusivity. There's a language about looking at
intention and impact, and that we need to also look at the impact of our
statements, the impact of how we are. It's not just about our intention. That
it's useful to have a wholesome intention. It's useful to have an
intention that is connected with wanting to create harmony, an intention to want
to connect, and yet sometimes our actions may not have that effect. And so
what's the impact of how we are? And what I like to explore is, okay,
if my intention was, at least to my understanding, was intended to connect
with kindness and meta, and yet the effect wasn't that, so the impact wasn't
that, then there's something for me to learn. There's something for me to
understand, something to explore, something maybe a broader picture to
understand. And so it's, you know, the intention is important, but we do also
have to look at the effect. How does our speech affect others? And not just
dismiss. It's like, well, it's your problem if you took it that way. You
know, that's not looking at the bigger picture of the
creating harmony in the field. So the other side, another side, so the
why speech often described as these kinds of speech to avoid, but then the
Buddha also pointed to speaking what's true, what's beneficial, what's kind, and
at a time that it can be heard. So when is it time, when is an appropriate time
to speak? Is it true? Is it beneficial? Is it kind? And kind doesn't necessarily
always mean that it's pleasing. It doesn't always necessarily mean that it's
something the other person wants to hear. And the Buddha emphasized that if
something is not pleasing to a listener, then it's important to speak about that
at an appropriate time. And so to reflect on these pieces as well. Is it true? Is it
useful? Is it kind? Is it an appropriate time to say this? Will the other person be
able to hear me? Is the context such that it's an appropriate time to bring
this up? So really, you know, we do have to think about a broader container. You
know, we need to bring our mindfulness to bear not just on how I am internally,
but externally what's happening in the environment, in the context of the
situation. And in this in this kind of a relational field, we also need to take in
externally the content or the context in which something is happening. And this
is not something that we're often doing on the cushion, right? We're not often
looking at context so much on the cushion. We're more looking at just how we are,
how the feelings are, what is it, what's arising in the present moment. And so
this is kind of broadening our capacity to be mindful in a broader
context, in a bigger container, understanding how we are, how others
are taking in, how people are responding. That's another way to understand this
external mindfulness the Buddha talked about in the Satipatanasuta in the
Buddha's instructions on mindfulness. He talked about mindfulness internally and
externally. And while in the Satipatanasuta itself, it doesn't describe so much what
external mindfulness means. It is pointed to elsewhere that external
mindfulness means understanding how other people are. And we do that largely
through observing them, through being sensitive to how they are expressing
themselves, how they look, what's the expression on their face, what's their
body language, what are they saying. And so the internal and external
mindfulness encourages us to be very sensitive to how others are in a
situation. And so when we speak, being mindful not just about how we are when
we speak, but how it might land for somebody else. How are they taking it?
Can you see or get a sense of how they are receiving what you're saying? So I
wanted to leave lots of time for questions today. So about this topic, if
there's any comments or questions. Since we talked about it last
week, maybe there was something that came up for you during the week. And I'm
just curious if you have any reflections on how you worked with this in your
practice or questions or comments. Anthony. Hi, Andrea. Hi. Yeah, what came to mind
just now, just as you were finishing that last phrase, was that how do we not
confuse that with our perception and our, you know, our conditioning to, you know,
think that that person is, you know, such and such. But really, it's just our
perception of what we think, you know. This is a great question. And all we have
is our perceptions, you know, that we can't know actually exactly what's
happening for somebody else. It is filtered through our conditioning. It is
filtered through our perception. And yet we do the best we can. You know, there's
there's certain things it's interesting. You know, we are designed to resonate with
other people. And I think the more we are aware of ourselves without judging
ourselves without reacting and just allowing, well, this is what's happening
for me. The more we get that sensitivity, that ability, that capacity to know how
we are without judging, without analyzing or reacting to how we are, then as we
see other people, you know, we have this capacity, we are designed in a way as
human beings to resonate with other human beings. There's a lot of studies,
modern-day studies, done about this kind of thing about how, you know, if you see
somebody like babies, you know, if you smile at a baby, a baby will smile back.
And it's like, you know, it's kind of like a mirroring that happens. And there's
also some studies that are done, like if you just put a smile on your face, it
will make you feel happy. You know, it like brings some
delight into your mind. It's just, it's an interesting thing. Our faces are
very attuned. If we make a frown, then there's a feeling that kind of can go
with that. And so, you know, I think we're kind of designed to almost mimic body
language, or if we kind of are there to receive how somebody else is and are
attentive to how we are, we may get a little bit of a sense, especially if
we're just curious and not, you know, overlaying, overlaying it with judgments
or opinions. And again, you know, we are, it is our perception. There's no way
around that. And yet, the more we have that capacity to just meet ourselves, I
think the more there's the capacity to kind of resonate more clearly with other
people and have a sense of what may be happening for them. And you can always
ask too. You know, I do this, I do this quite a bit in my, in my practice as a
teacher, you know, just kind of checking in, like, you know, gee, I'm feeling, I'm
feeling, maybe this is relevant right now, how does that land for you? Or, you
know, so, you know, we can check, you know, not, I think we have to do that, you
know, not just to assume that our perceptions are correct, but to kind
of check if that's possible, if there's a way to have a dialogue with the other
person. Sometimes there's not, and we just do the best we can. But that's an
important question. And I think it's definitely worth not assuming that you
know, you know, not assuming that you know what somebody else is experiencing.
But the possibility of seeing, you know, you see somebody's face change after
you've said something. And then maybe you get a little hit of, oh, something hurt
there, you know, so, so then check it out. It's like, oh, I didn't intend to say
something that would hurt you. How, how are you right now, you know, you know, so,
so to, to check it out in that way. Thank you, Andrea. Great question, Anthony.
Thank you. Yeah, Ali. Hi, thanks, Andrea. Yeah, I was just wondering if you could
speak a bit more or opening it up, open it up to as far as like white lies with
good intention, particularly on the situation that, you know, you're giving
somebody hope. So, you know, so they can keep going or whatnot, even though you
don't think, you know, that's very possible. But it's all in good intention and
everything else. But, you know, you're framing it that, you know, frame something
a particular way. So it lands well and then they go for it or continue on without
really believing it yourself. Yeah, I mean, this is, this is, this is often a
question that comes up in, in particular around refraining from false speech. And
there's a, you know, there's, there's a couple of things to explore there. You
know, often this comes up, you know, like a white lie, if I don't want to hurt
somebody, hurt somebody's feelings or something like that, or you said to give
somebody hope to give somebody the possibility of, you know, maybe it will
be different, you know, maybe it will come out in a certain way, even if you
don't believe that. I mean, in certain, in certain situations, it's not, you know,
looking at the important, the important piece here is to look at, is it, is it a
lie? You know, are you actually telling them a lie? And so there used to be this,
this very ethic in, in certain, I mean, I think it was, it's, it's old. I don't think
they do this so much anymore. But it used to be that doctors would routinely lie
to people about, you know, their health because they thought that it was better
for them not to know. And yet, you know, it actually ends up overall, it is not
usually the best, the best course to, to lie to people about their health. Because
often they have a sense that something's wrong and they, you know, they might feel
like they're, they're going crazy or something. And so there's, there's, you
know, there's, so that's, that's one, that's one kind of thing where you do
know it's a lie or is it, you know, in one case it might be, yeah, you know, you do
think, you know, 99% chance it's going to turn out this way. But there's always a
possibility, you know, you know, you don't know what's going to happen. And so, you
know, just saying something like, well, you know, you never know it, it could, it
could turn out in the, in this way or something. So that's not technically a
lie. It's just not something that you believe is very possible. And so that's,
that's, that's something to look at. Is it actually a lie? Are you intended, you
know, are you intending to deceive them that, you know, this is, so the intention
to deceive is, is important, I think. Now the Buddha did come down pretty
strongly on, on lies to his own son. At seven years old, he said, you should not
lie, even as a joke, you shouldn't lie, even as a joke. And yet there's, there are
other situations that often come up, you know, even in looking at it that
firmly, not to lie, even as a joke. You know, I've heard some, some people ask the
question, well, what if you're lying to protect somebody's life? You know, this
doesn't happen for many of us, but it could, you know, it could, it could happen,
you know, the kind of the classic example of, in Nazi Germany, lying to
protect Jews, that you, you know, the Jewish people hiding in your house. And so
there's, there's, there's multiple intentions behind that, right? There is,
there is the intention to deceive the Nazi. There is that intention to deceive.
And there is the intention to protect the life. And there's a potential, potentially
also an intention to prevent the, the, the Nazi from causing harm to another
person. And so there are, there are multiple, you know, intentions at play
there. Now I can't say, and my understanding of the way karma works,
because this is essentially, you know, this is essentially, you know, the
intentions are all in effect here. The intention to deceive is in, is in play.
The intention to, the intention to prevent the harm is, is at play. And all of them have
their momentum. They have their consequences. So, you know, it's not, I would, I would say
for myself, you know, sometimes I just say this, like, I hope I would have, I
would have had the courage. I would, I hope I would have the courage to lie if
somebody comes to my door saying, are you hiding somebody? I'm going to take them
off to, you know, send them to a concentration camp. I hope I would have
the courage to lie and, and to protect that life. And, you know, the, the
understanding that I have is that there is still some, there is going to
potentially be some fallout from that lie. You know, it's like, that's just not,
it's not that somehow the protecting of the life, you know, makes it okay to lie.
It's, or, or, or somehow mitigates the fallout from that lie. You know, it's, but
it, but it is, I would say that in the balance of the harmony of, of, of the
context of that situation, lying is what I would go for. You know, just because it
feels like the lesser harm. And yes, I would take the consequences of that lie.
You know, it's like, yes, I know that that, I mean, and maybe that the consequences
simply the mind getting very agitated, like, what if they, what if they find out
I lie? You know, what if they find out I've lied? You know, that's, that's a
consequence of lying. You know, so, so, but, but at the same time, I think we do
need to look, we need to look at the bigger picture, look at the intentions. So
in that case, that intention is to deceive, but, you know, what's the bigger
picture? So there's a lot, there's a lot of gray areas in the, in the particular
scenario you're talking about, you know, a white lie to give somebody hope, you
know, I would say there might be some way if you think about it. Now, it's not
always easy to come up with these in the spur of the moment, you know, but if you
think about it, there might be a way to give somebody hope without deceiving them.
And, and so, you know, what might that be? And it might be, you know, it might be just
acknowledging that you don't know, you know, what the outcome is, what the
outcome is going to be, but there's always the possibility of, you know,
something unusual happening. And so, and, or, or just, you know, I'll be here with
you, whatever happens, you know, to, to give them a kind of a different kind of
hope, a sense of, you know, I mean, I'm here with you, no matter what happens. So,
so there's just different ways to think about in those situations. And I think
that's what the Buddha was encouraging with this son, you know, really think
about it before you lie, you know, what, you know, is there some other way, is there
some other way to go? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, it's ultra power. Yeah, actually, I
remember a story from Sylvia Borstein, where she said to her father, let's go
to the movies today. And her father said, why do you want to take me to the
movies? I'm dying. And she said, Yeah, but not today. So anyway, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
that's beautiful. Yes, more like twisting it as opposed to saying, Yeah, you're
gonna die. But she said, Well, not today. Not right at this moment. Ice cream. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. That's a beautiful story. Thank you. Thank you for bringing that in.
Yeah. Yeah, Fred. Hi. I want to thank you for talking about intention and impact.
Because it is something that that I've been wondering about, because in the
Buddhist circles that I move in, the the focus has been on on intention. And I
don't believe I've ever heard someone talk about impact. Well, you know, the
Buddha, the way I connect this to the Buddhist teaching is actually in that
same taught teaching that the Buddha told his son, you know, don't lie even as a
joke. He went on to to encourage his son to reflect on his actions before he
acted, while he acted and after he acted to to see will this cause harm? You know,
is so before acting, you know, will this cause harm to yourself or others or
both? And if if you don't foresee that it's going to cause harm to self or
others or both, then go ahead and do it. Then while you're acting, check it out.
Is it causing harm to self or others or both? And so that's checking out the
impact in the present moment while you're doing it. And then after he said,
after you, you know, he don't stop. Then it's like after you have done something.
See if it did cause harm, did cause affliction to self or others or both. So
again, looking at impact. So, you know, that's that's the teaching that I really
think brings brings clearly in this this checking like looking, you know, what
how do our actions affect others? You know, he really he wanted us to engage in
in ways that do harmonize. And so and I understand that teaching to his son very
much to be about learning from your mistakes, you know, learning from the
impact, not to it doesn't say, you know, it doesn't say beat yourself up and tell
yourself you're a horrible person if it created harm. It's, you know, it says
undertake restraint in the future. Tell a wise person what happens, you know, and
potentially, you know, make amends. So it does it does. And I think also it brings
in this question or reflection of what can I learn? What did I not understand
that that harm was created? So it lets us learn from our mistakes without
judging ourselves for them. You know, it's like, yes, if I if I didn't have that
intention, if I didn't intend to be harmful, you know, it's like, but yet harm
happens. So what can I learn? And then there's a whole other set of things to
work with if we did intend to cause harm, you know, then there's there's actually
quite a bit of pain that we that we go through ourselves. It's like, oh, I did
want that person to hurt. And then and then the Buddha encourages us again not
to hate ourselves for that, but to see if we can undertake more skillful action
in the future.
