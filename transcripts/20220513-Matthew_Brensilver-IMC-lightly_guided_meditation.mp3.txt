 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome everyone. It's always sweet to see the chat line. Okay, let's reset.... Just all at once embrace all the experience that is your life.... I trust wherever you are.... Safe enough not to read all the signals, here are all the alarm bells of threat and opportunity. Safe enough just to melt into this moment.... All the vigilance and all the armoring, all the bracing, the numbed out disconnection. All that just melts into the moment too................... We surrender to the reference points, the referentiality. Sandwiching this moment between the past and the future. Diligently keeping track of where I end and you begin. All the tabs on what we like and what we don't like. All of these reference points squander the intimacy. All of these are what's arising and passing............................... We're truly not getting anywhere............................... So natural for us to get called back to our reference points. What I want, what hurts. It's like we try to take up some perch and some sara and see everything from there. The perch is really just more experience. The illusion of all our reference points. So we tolerate not knowing, tolerate some concern about not getting. May that the heart rest.......................................................................................................
