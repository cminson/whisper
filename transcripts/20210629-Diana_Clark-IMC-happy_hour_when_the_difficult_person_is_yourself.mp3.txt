 So welcome, really warm welcome, everybody. How nice it is to practice together. So for those of you who have been practicing happy hour with me before or in other settings, it's very common that sometimes classically the teachings are to start with oneself and then go to a benefactor or a lovable being and then maybe a dear friend and then a neutral person and then eventually get to a difficult person. Idea being start where it's easy. Start with what's possible now as opposed to what seems impossible. And then this experience of loving kindness just allowing it to grow and expand without like forcing it, without making it, you know, demanding that it go a certain way or unfold at a certain pace. But today I haven't upon a sentence in a book I was looking at that really made me think about these things a little bit differently, this progression that we do, this idea from easy to most difficult. What if we are the difficult person? What if we are sometimes part of loving kindness practice or just meditation practice is learning to be kind to ourselves and part of learning to be kind to ourselves is we just whether we intend to or not, it might just be noticing how we're unkind to ourselves that might get highlighted not all the time and maybe not in the most obvious way. But in some sometimes we just might be noticing, oh yeah, in loving kindness for myself is not so easy. I'm so used to being critical. But to be kind is not so straightforward or I'm so used to being a perfectionist that when I'm trying to be kind to myself extend loving kindness to myself. Instead what's showing up is all the ways in which there isn't perfection. So maybe sometimes it is that the difficult person is ourselves. So tonight we'll do some loving kindness practice and I'll switch up the order a little bit so that we can practice with those parts of ourselves that sometimes feels like it's we kind of want to exclude or ignore or pretend they're not there. And just with this invitation that all aspects of ourselves this invitation that all parts of ourselves are welcome that we can extend some loving kindness towards them. And then maybe one more thing I'll say about this is that we might notice maybe we have already noticed that this the way that we might be overly critical or perfectionist towards ourselves this might show up in other ways. Maybe in different magnitude a little bit different flavor or different tone. But chances are the way that we treat ourselves is related to the way that we view others or a it's a lens or a frame of reference that we might use with others. So this learning to be kind to ourselves to extend loving kindness to ourselves is not only for our own benefit but it's not just so that we will have a better relationship with ourselves of course that will happen with this practice. Maybe you might have discovered this those of you who've been practicing with this but also maybe there's some greater understanding and there might be some shift that might happen with our relationships with others as we start to see oh yeah the way that I am with others also shows up the way I am with myself or oh yeah the way that I am with myself also shows up in the way that I am with others and I'm using this expression the way I am with I think all of us know often is the case we don't speak to others like that often have the inner dialogue is but maybe there's ways in which we have certain expectations or certain standards or certain wish or preferences for how things go and so the invitation here is just to be curious about this way that we treat ourselves the way that we consider ourselves how does that show up with the relationship with others not so that we can beat ourselves and better like oh yeah the way I'm here is I'm also there but just as some self-understanding is a way that can shine a little light on our experiences relationships with ourselves and with others so with that as an introduction we'll do some loving-kindness practice so we'll start by taking an upright posture posture that reflects our intention to meditate now so upright either literally or symbolically maybe for some of you at the end of the day it was better to be lying down and just feeling into the body does it feel like to be here now can we bring some ease some allowing and soften any secret demands we might have about how this moment should be and we want it to be as best we can can we just let it show up how it is feeling connected grounded whatever we're contacting maybe a little bit of a body scan checking in with the face around the eyes around the mouth common places we hold tension the shoulders let the shoulder blades slide down the back away from the ears the upper back the lower back we're just bringing our attention to these different areas enlivening them with our intention our attention it might be that there's some softening of tension or maybe not the chest the belly the seat where we're contacting whatever it is we're sitting on lower legs upper legs and feet arms and hands letting the attention rest on the sensations of breathing and when the mind wanders with that kind-hearted tone attitude we just begin again with the sensations of breathing and a reminder that you can always come back to this practice if ever it feels like loving kindness isn't right for you or a little lost or feeling ungrounded you can always come back to this just being with the breath or being with the body and then to begin our loving kindness practice bringing to mind a lovable being that being for whom it's easy and complicated to feel warm-hearted care love kindness respect and to connect with this being whether that's by bringing an image to mind maybe there's a favorite memory it helps you connect and feel the warm-heartedness some people use kittens puppies babies some people use an individual that has really helped them supported them in their life some people use somebody they don't know but through their teachings or their writings just really been it had a big impact on them and then to support our connection and our intention of cultivating loving kindness can say these phrases may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may you live with ease may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may you live with ease may you be healthy can you feel into your wish for this person to be happy warm-heartedness within you that is generating this goodwill may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may you live with ease can check in with the body and see if there's a warm-hearted feeling maybe some spaciousness or ease and if so allowing that experience to get as big as it would like it's perfectly fine there isn't a distinct or clear physical sensation but if it is there allow it to support you and then to expand our loving kindness to a good friend our relationships with friends sometimes are a little more complicated there was that time that they did that thing still haven't returned that thing whatever it might be but can we extend the same warm-hearted feeling to them to bring into mind a good friend may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may you live with ease may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may you live with ease of course our good friends extend warm-heartedness even though our relationships may be different than for the lovable being it's okay and then to do loving kindness for ourselves maybe the way that we are now sometimes when we do this the invitation is to bring to mind perhaps a photo when you were younger a child is there a way that version of yourself today you can extend loving kindness towards if it feels difficult you're welcome to do a younger version of yourself or but is there a way in which we might have a complicated relationship with ourselves but we want to extend some warm-heartedness anyway not so different with a good friend may I be safe may I be happy may I be healthy may I be healthy may I live with ease may I be healthy may I be healthy may I be healthy even though sometimes we may be critical of ourselves sometimes we may not feel satisfied that we've done enough it's okay may I be safe may I be healthy may I live with ease may I be healthy we don't have to feel like we have to make this happen force it to happen this loving kindness for ourselves what if we allow it to happen more of a letting it happen than making it happen being supported by any feelings of warmth or openness or spaciousness or ease in the body being supported by the loving kindness that might have been cultivated for a loveable being or a friend may I be safe may I be happy may I be healthy may I live with ease what happens if we allow this goodwill to expand in all directions encountering so many different beings can we extend a goodwill to all beings if this doesn't feel right we don't have to go there might be a wish may all beings be safe may all beings be happy may all beings be healthy may all beings live with ease may all beings be safe may all beings be happy may all beings be healthy may all beings live with ease may all beings live with ease may all beings live with ease and then to end this meditation feel your feet on the ground for the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body and when you're ready you can gently open your eyes sometimes to loving kindness for ourselves it's not so easy we sometimes can be our worst critic and we say things to ourselves that even the difficult person quote unquote that we have in our lives wouldn't say to us so is there a way in which we might extend some loving kindness and warm heartedness even the inner critic or the aspect of ourselves that seems to never be satisfied or always wanting more something like this so it can be helpful to talk about this with other people kind of explore these ideas so i'd like to put you into some breakout rooms you can talk about this idea of loving kindness for yourself when you are the difficult person like this this idea is it helpful to consider that or does it just get complicated and not so helpful so we'll be in for 13 minutes so you're being groups of three or four and if it's helpful you can choose which order to go in by and just alphabetical order by screen name all that amies i guess i guess anthony i'm gonna hear your your you'll go first you're the only one that starts with the letter a and so it's helpful there's no need to like say everything that you know about this topic so it's helpful just to make one point and then allow it to go to the next point next person and then they just make one point and then it goes to the next person they make one point and then it goes to the next person and then it just goes around kind of like a spiral like building and creating something together rather than just a series of long monologues so here we go hi trudy so welcome back welcome back does anybody have a comment or a question a question something they'd like to say no what was it like yes trudy and then anthony trudy can you unmute yourself please okay there we go yeah um i just want to say that um

appreciative and very grateful thank you very nice very nice thank you trudy anthony yeah i just wanted to add that uh when it comes to loving kindness and being uh kind to yourself um i seem to be able to connect with the dharma a lot better when it's dealing with being kind to myself rather than with someone uh you know someone that you uh what is it uh that's hard to to deal with uh as far as the dharma applying the a lot of concepts of the dharma i i could connect with the easy uh when it when it has to do with being kind to myself relating to all the a lot of the key uh topics of the dharma yeah yeah as as opposed to like for a difficult person like somebody yeah yeah of course sometimes you know loving kindness for difficult person is a tall order and it's a long journey to find our way there it's uh and we don't have to be in a hurry we can take care of ourselves along this journey yeah thank you anthony anybody else have a comment hi um i have uh such a a rapport with my group tonight um that when when this one person was was speaking about um gratitude practice and other practices besides you know that are fundamentally um a loving kindness practice to yourself uh

with for this this group that's lovely i'm so happy to hear this right it's quite something um how sometimes like just a little drop of something can shift it like a little drop of sugar can turn
