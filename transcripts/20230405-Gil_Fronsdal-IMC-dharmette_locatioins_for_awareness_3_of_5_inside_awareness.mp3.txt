The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So here we are at the third talk having to do with the locations for awareness or
the different locations for awareness. And it's one thing to be aware, it's one
thing to be mindful, and know that there's an only know one way to be
mindful, one way to be aware. But how we're aware and where we are
aware from can be a choice and can be variable, can be different. And to be
aware, to be able to have some, you know, a range of how to be aware and then to be
able to adjust how we're aware depending on the circumstances we're in is so
important. Because if we only have one way to be aware, in some circumstances
that way of being aware is not, doesn't serve us. It doesn't really work. And so
if we're only aware intimately the feelings and the emotions of what's
happening, and we're feeling our own suffering or other people's suffering
and might feel overwhelming. But if we can be aware, not through feeling and
sensing, but be aware in the mind's eye or in the knowing mind, in a sense,
stepping back and having the bird's eye view of it, then the impact of the
emotions that we have might not be as difficult as if we're living in them. But
then sometimes if we're too distant and, you know, observing from the head or from
the hillside far away like I talked about yesterday, then it might be too aloof
and not connected. Sometimes it helps to connect that way and sometimes it
doesn't. And sometimes if we're a lot in our head thinking about things and we
don't feel what's going on for others or really ourselves, then it's useful to
know this way of being present intimately. And as we become more intimate, we
generally come in closer to where the sensations are. And the sensations are
closely also where emotions are and how they're felt. And there's two ways of
being intimate, coming in close. One is like, like there's, you know, two things
touch each other. And sometimes I've given people the instructions to let
awareness be like a soft, soft cotton gauze, soft cotton ball ball. And if
there's a lot of very difficult things inside, pain or difficult emotions,
imagine that awareness is a soft cotton ball that just gently taps against the
difficulty and then pulls away, comes close and taps and pulls away. And then
we're there to acknowledge, we feel, we make space for how it actually is and
really, you know, come in contact. So we're present, but we don't overdo it by
staying there too long. And knowing how to pull back and be a little bit further
away makes room for something to discharge, unravel, settle for some
confidence to be built, to begin feeling that we have some agency with what's
going on. We don't have to just be aware in one way and then stuck there. So this
this ability to kind of come close and then pull away, come close and pull away.
And then sometimes just be right there, being really present. Sometimes that
intimacy is even deeper where we are going inside the experience and inside
the emotions in a sense, or inside the physical sensations we're having. And
to penetrate it inside, it's almost like we're knocking at the door, we
push the door gently and it opens up and we're able to step inside. And what
that does is it's kind of like from the outside of the, you know, outside it
just seems like things are covered. It seems like a single, single object. But
if you unwrap it and go inside, then you find out there's many presence inside.
There's many factors, sensations, things going on inside of it. And that can be
true even in a little square centimeter of pain or tightness or warmth or
pleasure that we feel. That it's possible actually to kind of almost feel like
you're going, you're not staying in the surface of it making contact, but you're
actually going into it and sort of feeling what's in the inside there and
really sense it and feel it. And that's true with ourselves as well with
awareness. Awareness can be, as I've been trying to say this week, can be variable
where, where, where, how we're aware, where we're aware from. We can be in the
head, we can be in the, you know, more distant, aloof. We could also discover
where does it feel most intimate, where is the innermost place where there is
awareness knowing deepest places of sensing ourselves and that deepest
place of intimacy and, and to settle in there, to rest in there and feel, that
takes time to feel it and get to know it and let it expand and spread through the
body and then to know from there. Maybe the breathing will help here because you
can breathe with it and through it and into it as a way of staying connected. So
to come close to the experience, to sense it and, and that could be, you know, on
everyday life experiences where it's kind of at the kind of the largest life
level where you, you're in a difficult situation and you stay, stay connected
for a while and then you choose to leave a while to regroup and then you come
back. You go to a distance and watch the whole situation from a distance and then
you come back. If people at work are as a team kind of working in hard and hot and
trying to figure something out and, and you're part of that kind of, you know,
intensity of people huddling together and not managing to figure out what's
going on or some difficulty, find some way to step away and look at it from a
distance. See if that regroups you and gives you a different perspective and a
different way of coming back and joining and participating. In many social
situations, I think it's a useful skill is to step outside, get some fresh air and
then come back in. So there, here we have this intimacy, you know, close, close in
and then we learn how to step away. One, one place that people allow you to step
away is you excuse yourself saying, I need to go to the bathroom and most
people are not going to question what you're doing in the bathroom. What you're
doing is you're going to breathe. You're going to meditate sitting, you know, on
the toilet or not using it, but just, just there's a place to chill. So in all
kinds of circumstances, this art of coming in close, feeling it, being with it,
and then learning how to step away and then finding the right balance and
finding out what's the right distance. Sometimes the right distance might be not
as far as the ways you could be, but it could be kind of, you know, it's like, like a personal
space. How much personal space do you need around people? If they can come into
your personal space and it feels like it's too much. Some situations, it's good
to be three feet away, someone who could be 10 feet away. Where's the right
distance where it allows you to be more settled and present in a useful way? And
the same principle applies then to the inner awareness, inner knowing and
mindfulness, that we can adjust how we're aware and when we're really intimate
and when we're not so intimate, when we're feeling it and when we're more
cognitively knowing it, which is most useful in different situations. Different
ones are useful. So then repeating myself, but it's such an important point. If
you only know how to be aware one way, then sooner or later that one way is not
appropriate. That one way is not going to be helpful or useful. It might actually
be difficult or cause more problems because some situations feeling
what's happening is not really the best thing to do. So the situation, it is the
best thing to do. Some times being more in the head, maybe even observing or
thinking about knowing it in some cognitive way is the best thing to do.
And sometimes it's not that good thing to do and sometimes being far away,
imagining you're kind of from a distance. And so all these different ways of
knowing and locations of knowing. So for today, if you want, try
intimacy. Try what it's like to really be in touch with things and maybe even
imagine you're actually going into it. It could be something even as simple as
eating your food. What would it mean to be intimate with your food rather than
eating while you're listening to the news or something? And what's it like to be
intimate with sitting in a chair? How would that feel here? Intimacy, how
would it be? What's intimacy like in meditation? What's a certain kind of
intimacy that doesn't cross inappropriate lines? Certain kind of
knowing awareness intimacy as you're listening to a friend. They don't have
to know that you're feeling intimate. But what's the way of being really there
and touching, feeling what's happening internally? So you really feel connected.
So intimacy. So thank you. And we'll kind of continue and build on this
tomorrow. And I hope that you kind of can appreciate playing around with
awareness and mindfulness and knowing and sensing and begin living in the
playground of these things. Thank you.
