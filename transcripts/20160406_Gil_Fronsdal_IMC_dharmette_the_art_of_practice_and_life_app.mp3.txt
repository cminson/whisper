Dharmette: The Art of Practice and Life  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

An important part of the art of practice – and probably 
the art of life – is to know the balance or the interplay 
between taking responsibility and not taking 
responsibility. Understanding what we can take 
responsibility for , and what makes no sense to be 
responsible for . Sometimes, w hat we don’t take 
responsibility for is other people. We don’t take 
responsibility for other people’s choice , or the 
consequences of those choices. Responsibility for other 
people is a whole topic  in itself . 
 
For some people, like me, it’s their Achilles heel  – like 
it’s up to me to  make them better, to support them. They 
aren’t going to be happy unless I do things for them. I 
can spiral down and get exhausted pretty quickly from 
that. So how do we  care for people and be engaged in a 
caring way without taking responsibility ? How to be 
“respons -able” (able to respond) without being 
responsible in the wake of that is part of the art.  
 
What I’m thinking about right now is not so much about 
our relationship to other people , but about what to be responsible for , and what not to be responsible for , in 
our own inner life. One of the principles or instructi ons 
of Buddhism is not to take too much responsibility for 
the cause of our happiness and unhappiness , but be 
responsive to the conditions that bring about happiness 
and unhappiness. Buddhism focuses a lot on putting in 
place the conditions that allow the movement toward 
liberation, to ward  freedom and peace – rather than 
becoming the one responsible for that movement.  
 
Plenty of people who have done meditation practice 
have taken too much responsibility for their meditation. 
They are constantly trying to fi x, to adjust, to make 
something happen – as if it’s up to them to make the 
practice unfold : “It’s up to me and I have to huff and 
puff, force myself.” It’s possible to create too much 
agitation in the mind for some deeper process to 
happen.  
 
Rather, you d o certain things with the idea that  – if they 
are in place, if the Dharma is willing, and if the 
conditions are right  – then the meditation will unfold in a 
certain way. You are not in charge of it , and you may 
not even expect it, but you do your job by pu tting the 
conditions in place.  
 
A lot of the conditions Buddhism focuses on involve 
living an ethical life, and living a life where you don’t get 
too actively or too easily caught up in the sense world. The sense world can mean anything , like getting caught 
up in  Facebook, email, what’s in the refrigerator, the 
news, websites , all kinds of things. Another key 
condition is that  you don’t get caught up in the 
hindrances. These are the tendencies of the mind to get 
caught up in desire, in ill will , in sloth and torpor  (in 
resistance to being engaged in a good way ), in agitation 
and worry, and in doubt. Being  caught up  is related to 
the movement towards not believing in these things, not 
believing that th ey are the answers to life, not giving 
these things  authority. Those are not the conditions for 
your well -being, and so you let go of them.  
 
Our movement in relationship to  these three things is a 
very important part of Buddhist spiritual life:  
• To not do things that are unethical.  
• To not get caugh t up in the sense world.  
• And to not get caught up in the inner world of the 
five hindrances.  
This is mostly a description of what we don’t do.   
 
What allows is for the mind and heart to have space and 
time is when they are not caught up and preoccupied. 
When they are not agitated, then there is much more 
room. When the mind and heart are caught up, it’s like 
they are claustrophobic or really tight. So you create the 
conditions that give space for the mind and heart to 
unfold , and trust the un folding. You don’t take 
responsibility for the unfolding of the heart, but you create the conditions that best allow it to unfold.  
 
It isn’t that  being ethical , or not being caught up in the 
world , or not being caught up in the inner life will cause 
us to be happy  – but these are conditions that allow 
something deeper to move and unfold within. It’s a 
remarkable thing to start feeling and trusting a deeper 
movement that is not of our doing. It is within us, but we 
are not causing it. The idea that I am goin g to cause 
myself to be happy is more agitation , more ways of 
getting caught and contracted . 
 
How do we make lots of space for things to unfold and 
move?  
 
Happiness o ne thing that can unfold i n the space that  is 
created when we’re not caught up. The Buddha was 
quite explicit that there is happiness in living an ethical 
life. There is happiness that comes from not being 
caught up in the sense world. And there is happiness 
that comes from not being caught up in the inner world 
of the hindrances. He doesn’t say to let go of these 
things and then check them off on the happiness 
project. It’s more like if we create space, then our 
natural state is one of wellbeing. The sense of wellbeing 
that can arise is not a static thing . Rather,  it begins to 
move through us, and unfold within  us.  
 
The heart is designed to unfold in certain directions. It is deeply affected by conditions. When the right conditions 
are in place, the heart will move and unfold. You can 
take responsibility for those conditions . One thing 
practitioners can do is to get out of the way , so that 
there are no obstacles to the beauty of the unfolding 
heart  – and to the healing, reconciling, and wisdom 
aspects of the heart.  
 
To take too much responsibility might not make space 
for something which is not you to operate and unfold. If 
you constantly take responsibility as the person at the 
helm, then there might be no space. While it might be 
good in some ways, it doesn’t allow for some deeper 
insight or understanding of a Dharma process within 
that can unfold if you get out of the way. It’s not so 
mystical. If it’s been a very busy day , your body is 
tense, and you sit down on the couch and relax, then 
some of the tension will di ssipate. If you meditate, more 
of it might dissipate. You don’t have to make the 
dissipation. It just unfolds on its own. It’s a natural 
process that if you stop fueling the tension, then over 
time it will relax.  
 
My understanding of the Buddha’s teaching s is that we 
take a lot of responsibility for the conditions , but not for 
the consequences. We put into place certain conditions , 
and then make space to allow those conditions to 
unfold.  
 One thing that helps is time, not filling life with things, 
but hav ing time. Have time to meditate, to look out the 
window, to go for walks, to have the kind of time that 
allows for something to move and bubble up and unfold. 
That can’t happen if you’re always doing, always 
engaged.  
 
So, one of the conditions to create is space  – space in 
time, space in territory  – just space. I hope that coming 
here today was one way to do that.  I hope that 
something here could unfold here that was not of your 
doing  – and that over time, you come to trust something 
inside of you that is not you.  
 
Isn’t that nice? Because if it’s you, we’re all in trouble! 
[Laughs] But there’s something inside of you that’s not 
you. It’s still you, but it’s not in the place you identify as 
you in the control tower running the whole show.  
 
Thank you.
