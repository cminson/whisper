Dharmette: Q&A – How We Hold Our 
Concerns  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short discussion with  
Gil Fronsdal on March 14, 2012  
 
 
Gil: I’d like to do something a little different today , if 
you’re game for it. At the beginning , I gave  a short  talk 
about concerns  – how you hold them, the weight of the 
concerns . Did you apply that in  your practice in the last 
hour and a half? Did you look at your mind , at the 
texture and quality of your concern,  and at  the weight, 
strength , and intensity of it? W as that interesting for 
some of you?  Was it meaningful for you? I thought 
maybe  some  of you might like to say something.  
 
Participant  1: I had a bit of a revelation.  I wasn’t 
conscious that I was actually applying it , but one of the 
concerns that always comes up for me is other people’s 
violation of my internal sense of how things go . What I 
realized today when I looked at that as a concern was 
that it wasn’t really  … What annoyed me wasn’t … 
There was  something deeper  under that annoyance , 
and i t was this sense of my system  letting me down . I 
had never connected to that before . I was still 
externalizing the suffering  that I encountered . I realized 
that I’m  not annoyed at other people ; I’m annoyed at my system. I t’s fal ling apart . I know it’s supposed to fall 
apart , but I’m pissed about th at, and not havi ng a good 
time dealing with it. I’d never connected that before . 
 
Gil: So you’re saying that when people  don’t uphold the 
order of the u niverse, in a variety of different ways, t hen 
you get annoyed at people, disappointed . But when you 
looked benea th that, what fuels it is actual ly your own 
body, your own self. Y ou’re letting yourself down . The 
order of the u niverse according to how you’re supposed 
to be is not be ing held up , so the annoyance is really 
towards yourself.    
 
Participant 1: Yes. Well, not exactly . I recognized that 
the annoyance at others was masking a deeper thing 
which had more to do with fear . I had this whole order 
on purpose.  
 
Gil: That’s wonderful. I think it’s fantastic. We shoul d 
celebrate.    
 
Participant 1: When I was sitting there I was like, 
“Okay. I can deal with that much better than dealing with 
making everybody else do things the way I want them 
to.” 
 
Gil: Great. Thank You.  
 
Participant 2: I came in during the little talk toward the end of it , and it tied in with other processes that are 
going on . I’ve been trying to incorporate meditation into 
my life , and quite often I don’t think I have time for it , 
because I have to be frenetically active , doing things for 
other people so that I can be right in the world . When I 
go to the beach , I’m totally res ponsible for the waves 
coming in , and I worry about it . I worry about what  the 
beach is doing without me there? What’s the situation 
doing without me? How can I manipulate what I do to 
get other people to just co-operate in the greater good – 
because  I know what that  is. I’ve been trying to be 
consciously aware that I am not that important , and to 
be more aware of how my body feels . If I can just get 
everybody else whipped into line , or every other 
situation in my life  – if my house is all clean  and the cat 
isn’t throwing up,  then I can  feel good. T hen my body 
can feel good and my mind can be rested . So I’m 
starting to be aware that when I am meditating, when I 
am aware of how I fee l, every issue seems to have the 
same emphasis, the same importance . So I have to do 
it all, and all at once . So my next inquir y is, “Well, what’s 
the next thing  to do? Maybe it’s to meditate.” E verything 
has the same importance for me emotionally , and I’m 
pivotal to it all . I want to be aware of what I can actually 
have a part in , and what I need to let go.  
 
Gil: Great. Beautiful . Great exploration. Thank you. 
Important to see.  
 Who else is trying to control the universe here  
[laughter] ? Anybody else  have  any different perspective 
on what I brought up this morning about the weight of 
your concern or the quality of the concern, the intensity ? 
Not looking at what you’re trying to do or what your  
concerns are , but how they operate, how they function 
in your mind . Did a nything come up for you , or didn’t 
you come with any concerns today?  
 
Participant 3: Well, I wasn’t here at the talk  but I do . 
When the conce rns slow down – the thoughts or 
whatever – usually  there  is the sense of contraction.  No 
matter what the subject matter is, to release t he 
contraction seems like being able to let go and allow 
space around it.  
 
Gil: Nice. So part of what comes with having con cerns 
is being contracted? And if you let go, then it’s easier, 
lighter?  
 
Participant 3: Right, and then  it’s like the movie sort of 
goes to the side a little  bit, and it’s not so compelling.  
 
Gil: Great.  So what makes it compelling has a little bit to 
do wit h the contraction. The energy of that makes it 
compelling.  
 
Participant 3: Yeah. Whether it’s worry or  anger or 
sadness or whatever, it seems it do esn’t matter what the flavor is.  
 
Gil: Great. Wonderful. Thank you.  
 
Participant 4: Well, I had a similar experience . It was 
nice holdin g the concern more as a texture , or more as 
a physical event  than the content of what the concern 
was. Both of the things that were just mentioned – 
relaxing the muscles that were involved , and creating a 
more spacious feeling around the texture of the concern 
allowed the content to leave more easily . So thank you ; 
it worked well.  
 
Gil: Great. Thank you.  
 
 
I’m glad to hear all  of that – your engagement with it . 
You’re finding your way with your minds.
