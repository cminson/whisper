Namotasa Bhagavato Arraha To Sammasambuddhasa Namotasa Bhagavato Arraha To Sammasambuddhasa Bodham Dhamam Sangham Namasami One of the most useful and simple teachings of the Buddha He didn't have to deal with microphones. 
One of the most simple and useful teachings of the Buddha was what is called the teaching of the arrow, or the two arrows. 
And this is in relationship to physical pain. 
And he uses the simile of a soldier being shot on a battlefield. 
And he says physical pain, by the way, I think he can leave the notebooks down and just listen. 
I would encourage that. 
Physical pain is something we all experience, whether you are a young child or an old person, whether you are totally enlightened or whether you are just an average, unawakened being, where we all experience physical pain. 
Having a body has sensations. 
And so we have pleasant feelings, painful feelings, neutral feelings. 
The Buddha said the very fact that this body experiences physical pain is that with that comes discomfort. 
But it is also possible for us to live with that painful feeling without adding anything to it. 
The second arrow is what the mind adds to that physical pain. 
The feelings of resentment, of fear. 
By the way, our friend in the corner on the windowsill, if you could put the notebook down. 
Thank you. 
So the second arrow is the anguishing, negotiating, fretting, fearing, worrying about that physical pain, what the mind adds to it. 
And similarly the Buddha pointed out that the first arrow is non-negotiable. 
As long as you have a body and have a mind, we can experience physical pain that is intrinsic in the mix. 
The second arrow we can dodge. 
If we are mindful, if we are awake, then we can avoid the second arrow. 
Now this is a very simple but extremely significant teaching because the mind immediately reacts to discomfort by just sitting together for the last day. 
I'm sure we've all had experiences of physical pain. 
And the mind easily moves to, oh, what's going to happen? Is it going to get worse? Oh dear, what's going on in my knee? When is this going to be over? Stressing, fretting, tensing up and anguishing about the discomfort. 
In this simple teaching what he points to is that the physical pain in and of itself does not produce a state of suffering. 
It's uncomfortable, but the suffering, the dukkha, is what the mind adds to it. 
So the teaching of the Four Noble Truths, the dukkha that we talk about, the suffering that we talk about being brought to an end, is that the suffering of the second arrow. 
It's like that even though we might experience physical pain, the mind can be completely at peace with that. 
If you're worrying now that I'm going to institute like a four hour sitting where no one's allowed to move, then don't worry, I'm not going to do that. 
But rather to see how that when we are experiencing physical pain, there is a possibility in the attitude that we have towards that to just know that that pain as a feeling and to relax the attitude towards it, to relax the body around it. 
So say for example when we're sitting together and you feel pain in your knee or your back or wherever it might be. 
First of all, rather than thinking of that the pain interrupting your meditation and oh I wish this would go away, I can get back to my breath, get back to the practice. 
Instead we can actually make the feeling of discomfort the object of our attention. 
And bringing the mind to that and say the feeling of pain in the knee, then they can notice how much the body tenses up against that so that we feel pain and so then the body resists that and stresses as a natural reaction to physical discomfort. 
And yet we don't realize that that very tensing up increases the causes of pain in the body. 
We bring more attention into the system and we create greater causes for pain. 
So what we discover is that if you bring attention to the place where you're feeling the pain and you relax the muscles around it like if it's pain in your knee to relax the muscles in your legs and your hip joints and the whole lower area of the body and particularly around the joint itself you begin to see the causes of pain are reduced, they're diminished. 
And then even so maybe a level 7 pain goes down to a level 4 pain but even at the level 4 pain you realize that that is an uncomfortable presence in the mind but it's not something that we have to hate, it's not something that we have to fear and there can be an attitude of acceptance. 
So yesterday I was talking a lot about loving kindness and radical acceptance. 
So to have loving kindness doesn't mean to say that we're trying to pretend that we like pain. 
Or how marvellous. 
It's that agony in my knee again. 
Oh jolly good. 
Hello, welcome back. 
It's not so much that at all but you're not pretending to like the unlikable but you're recognizing here it is. 
And so that we begin to see that the pain is one thing and what the mind adds to it is another. 
And just as there can be the discomfort in your knee and then the body tensing up against it or we can relax and the discomfort is still there we can also change the attitude towards it whereby we don't create hatred towards it, we don't feed a sense of fear or anxiety about it. 
It's just simply present. 
And so the usual encouragement around sitting meditation that our teacher Ajahn Chah would give would be to say when you feel pain in the body and you want to change your posture and always stay with it for a few minutes before you shift your posture. 
So I like to put a qualifier on that as well to say it's fine to change your posture but it's very important and very helpful to work with your attitude to work with relaxing the body first of all and then to work with your attitude so that there's a quality of acceptance, a relaxation of the body an attitude of an acceptance towards the pain and then what you're able to do is to have much more of an accepting, spacious relationship towards that feeling and then your own intuition of what the body's limits are can function more accurately so that then you know okay I've been sitting with this pain in my knee for about 10 minutes and I think that's just about enough. 
I don't want another trip to the emergency room, yeah had surgery two years ago so let's say that's a limit there, draw a line under it so you're not forcing yourself just out of sheer will to endure something that is in the long term injurious to the body but also you're not just reacting in a blind way to the discomfort the more you're feeling your body's own intelligence you're letting your body's own intelligence, its own natural systems function in an unobstructed way and so then by being open and attentive then you can feel when enough is enough just like with food if you pay attention as you're eating your body knows okay that's enough you're interested in the food when you're hungry and you're eating and then if you're not completely entranced by the flavors or the active eating or the conversation that you're having you just pay attention to the active eating itself then again your body's own intelligence steps in and says okay that's enough, put your spoon down and call it quits our whole system has its own wisdom, its own intelligence if we listen for it so in this respect the way that we relate to pain can be changed in a radical way so that rather than hating it and fearing it and trying to get away from it and then trying to invest in places where we're not feeling it rather we see that peace or freedom doesn't come from an absence of pain but it comes from letting go of the negativity, the fear, the negotiating and the fretting around it which in this simile of the Buddha we would call the second arrow we can dodge the second arrow or as you often see in bumper stickers or t-shirts here in California pain is inevitable but suffering is optional this being Bay Area, those kind of bumper stickers haven't quite made it to England yet but even though you might see it on a bumper sticker or a t-shirt or stuck on a fridge magnet there's a lot of wisdom there, that's a very valid and useful perspective and the Buddha pointed right to this as a very significant teaching the usefulness of this is not just within the realm of physical pain because of course physical pain and mental pain are very closely related and even though this principle can be seen to work on the level of physical pain you can also in the meditation you can see how it works with mental pain also the uncomfortable and difficult mind states, feelings of regret or feelings of sadness, of grief, of anger or fear or any kind of painful or difficult emotional state, obsessive thoughts or unresolved doubts and conflicts that we experience these are uncomfortable mental states, they're painful mental states but they work in exactly the same way, I would suggest it's not the quality of the emotion itself that is problematic but the attitude that we have towards it and so it's very interesting in the Satipattana Sutta the Buddha's main teaching on meditation that informs the Theravada, the southern Buddhist tradition main teaching on mindfulness and meditation practice the third section of that is called Chittanupasana mindfulness of moods or mind states and in that he outlines a variety of different states knowing the angry mind is angry, knowing the mind free of anger is free of anger knowing the agitated mind is agitated, the mind free of agitation is being free of agitation and the concentrated mind is concentrated, the unconcentrated, the scattered mind is scattered so in that particular Sutta, that particular teaching he makes no moral or qualitative judgment, he doesn't say anger is worse than non-anger he doesn't say that concentration is better than being scattered he just says knowing the scattered mind is scattered and the concentrated mind is concentrated then the agitated mind is agitated, the calm mind is calm and that he points to the establishment of mindfulness is in a way independent of the particular quality and as long as there is mindfulness there, oh this is the agitated mind or this is the angry mind the degree to which that mindfulness is clear and established then our mind will not get drawn in to that state it won't buy into and embody, identify with that state it will know, whoa, this is a busy one, this is painful and that is a tremendous capacity that we have and if we learn these kind of skills with the simplicity and directness of physical pain then we find that we can apply these very useful lessons to the much more complex and testing realm of mental pain of sadness and grief and the whole range of mental disquiet and disturbance that we can experience I encourage this as we are spending this time together and having this time of sitting and walking together and living together in this place to be using this time to see if you can tease those things apart to see if you can distinguish between the first and the second arrow and to see how the second arrow can be dodged, can be avoided and the mind can live with an attitude of non-contention even with something that we would really dislike physical pain or feeling of grief, maybe someone who is close to you is passed away or feelings of resentment or anger maybe you've had an argument with someone at your work or you've been fired from your job and you're full of righteous indignation how dare they treat me that way or you're worried about whether some business deal is going to go through or not going to go through and we can see by watching those waves of feeling come through the mind remembering that conflict or seeing those kinds of emotions arising to be able to recognise this is the feeling of fear or this is the feeling of worry about is that deal going to work or this is the feeling of resentment this is the how dare they feeling that's what this is and you're not pushing it away, you're not justifying it you're not wallowing in it you're not trying to wipe it out it arises, it has its characteristics, its quality, its shape, its form and it passes away and so that we begin to see how we can live in a sensitive and appreciative attitude towards those different aspects of our life but not creating contention against them and with a non-contentious attitude then our wisdom faculty can function so that we can see okay well maybe there is resentment arising about that particular exchange or this particular situation but let's not make that the deciding factor what else is there playing into the picture what else is there that's a part of this and you're able to use your capacity to reflect to look at the whole pattern of things and to use your wisdom to guide your actions and speech in relationship to that situation today just in terms of the meditation instruction that I've been giving it's mostly just been in terms of the development of concentration or focus but of course that's not the only aspect of our meditation this place is called INSIGHT, IRC, INSIGHT Retreat Center so obviously INSIGHT Vipassana meditation is a big thing here I would imagine it's on the tea towels, it's there on the label so it must be important and so sometimes within the Buddhist world you can get this sense of we're a Jhana outfit we do concentration and Vipassana it's a kind of fake meditation really they like to think of it as INSIGHT, they call it that but it's really just a lot of thinking they just do that because they can't really meditate like us they're not real kind of true Jhana warriors like us and then the Vipassana team say well they're just concentrators really they just know how to focus their mind but they don't really have any wisdom and if you think this is just a 2014 debate this has been going on for a good couple of thousand years since the Buddha's time itself even in the scriptures you have this account of the the Buddha talking to some of the monks and they're asking about well when we have a big gathering how should we decide who stays in which kutis and who's going to live where in the forest and the Buddha said well you put the Vipassana people in this section here and you put the Jhana people over there and you put the reciters over there and you put the ones who like to sit around and complain about everything over there not much has changed in the last two and a half thousand years human nature carries on but one of the themes or characteristics of Ajahn Chah's approach towards meditation and practicing and teaching Dhamma was that you point out that the mind isn't really divided into Samatha and Vipassana it's not divided into concentration and insight it's all the same mind it's all this mind and we're talking about particular attributes or particular capacities and so you can take an idea a way of labelling some particular thing and you can say it's completely different like saying that's ice, well that's steam that's a cloud, that's a river it's all water it's just different ways that water manifests but it's all just water there's no real difference between it it's all made of the same stuff it takes different forms according to different conditions and what he would always emphasize is that Samatha and Vipassana concentration and insight they work together and very useful similarly that he would give would be to say it's like a candle so he said concentration, Samatha the ability to focus the mind it's like a candle, you've got a wick and you've got a lot of wax and you've got a candle and you go into a dark place and you've got your candle but it's not much use if you haven't got a match right? holding your candle up there's a lot of potential there you've got the wax, you've got the wick but without the match without something to light the candle with you can't really see and he said so Samatha concentration is like a candle Vipassana is like a match you strike the match and you can see it doesn't matter how dark it is or how long it's been dark if you strike the match then you can see what's going on in the space but the match doesn't have very much fuel it's just a little stick or a little kind of piece of card and very quickly it burns away and so insight Vipassana on its own, insight yeah it's valid, you can see and you can understand there's vision, there's clear seeing but without much fuel that vision can't be sustained but if you take the match light the match and then put it to the candle then the fuel from the candle and the ignition from the match that work together so that you can carry your candle around and you can see clearly for a long time I feel that's the most apt and useful way of understanding how concentration and insight work together I'm also conscious of the fact and many of you are old-time Vipassana warriors have been doing this for decades and decades and others have just walked into the theatre and this is all very new and so just to talk a little bit about what we mean by insight of Vipassana when we are developing the meditation training the mind to focus on the present moment then we are using a single object to help they bring the mind to steadiness integration of attention so that the mind the attention rests easily in the present moment so that focus brings a quality of peacefulness, stillness and there's a an enjoyment and a clarity that comes with that focus of attention but that focus just having the mind still and clear and paying attention to the present that isn't intrinsically liberating it's not something that really frees the heart because as soon as something comes along and disturbs the object or distracts the attention then the mind is carried away so Vipassana the insight the in and the sight is looking into the very fabric of experience so just as here we are in this hall and we can say here we are at IRC in the hills around Santa Cruz and this is where we are but this hall and the center is in our minds I think I was talking about this yesterday evening how in this moment what we're experiencing each and every one of us is experiencing our mind's representation of this moment I don't see you I see my mind's representation of you so at the moment I haven't got my glasses on so the people and the chairs at the back there I think that's Gauri in the black waistcoat but I can't be sure because I haven't got my glasses on I put my glasses on and I go oh it is she's nodding I think so I think that must be Gauri so if I put my glasses on then I see more clearly if I close my eyes the hall vanishes open my eyes you all appear again so in very simple ways we can see that the mind is piecing together our version of this moment and each one of us will have a different perspective according to our language, our conditioning our education, our family our gender, our age our character traits our personal experiences all of that and the fact that we're human beings rather than spiders or ticks maybe there are some ticks in here we don't know about that we experience this moment in this place in this way but it's a compounded pattern of experience it's conditioned, it's formed just by closing your eyes the visual element disappears open your eyes it reappears I put my glasses on I can see clearly at the back of the room without my glasses it's all a bit fuzzy back there so the persona is recognizing that this moment is put together, it's pieced together from sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, memory by patterns of consciousness of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching thinking, remembering, imagining according to the language that we use and the mental faculties that we have and the conditioning that is here that and in the persona what we're looking at is that very fact that this is a compounded pattern, it's put together and the naming of things is inside or outside the naming of things is good or bad, as mine or yours with the development of insight we're looking at the very process of experience and we'll see oh that's how there's a sound and I call that outside there's a thought and I call that inside there's a there's the process of meditation and I call it me meditating I say there's a me as an I meditating, I say this is my mind and that's you coughing that's me over here you over there and with the persona we're looking into how the patterns of experience are put together and looking at the essential qualities that every pattern has and looking at those essential qualities we're deliberately letting go of well it doesn't really matter whether it's venerable kachan or venerable tita panyo or whether it's a a clock or a bell these are all they're all in a state of change this building is in a state of change three years ago it was an Alzheimer's institute now it's a Buddhist retreat center it's in a state of change when it was acquired by this group it was finally configured then you spend a whole bunch of money and had a lot of meetings and decided how you wanted it all to be and now it's this shape and you have the walls here and the staircase is there and things are done in this particular way so we're deliberately letting go of all of the detail and say well it doesn't matter whether the walls put here or put there the walls are in a state of change the the content of what I'm saying doesn't matter in terms of vipassana the particular words I'm using are not significant the fact that they are changing and that that quality of change is in a sense the most fundamental universal characteristic of everything that we experience inside or outside coarse or fine, near or far everything that we experience is in a state of change all patterns of experience are constantly changing the second element of all experience is that of unsatisfactoriness so we might say what a beautiful sound and then you might say well I really want a bell like that that's a really beautiful bell I really want to have that but if we heard this bell ringing like this for 10 minutes an hour the mind would probably find a way of screening it out if it went on constantly one hour, 10 hours, 20 hours a week, a month that this bell keeps going that this sweet, delicious sound would become really irritating and probably make a lot of trips to the doctor a doctor, I got this bell going in my head it won't go away it's the irritating Buddhist bell won't leave me alone so even the most sweet and delightful experiences they're unsatisfactory in so far as they can't remain pleasing to us there's no experience that we have that can be continually and permanently satisfying some of you might already be coming up with a few suggestions well Arjan actually you can make your own little list if you like but the suggestion that the Buddha made was that if we look and if we explore we find that there's no experience that can be owned no experience that can be felt and tasted and known that can permanently and completely satisfy things become boring the mind habituates itself even to the most delightful beautiful it becomes ordinary, it becomes normal it stops being pleasing the mind habituates itself to that level of input and then the third characteristic of experience is that of selflessness that when we say this is mine, this is my body or my robe or my water bottle I've got my name on it I didn't put their name on there but I just saw this yesterday evening oh that's mine it's got my name written on it therefore it must be mine but these are just black marks on a piece of white tape even if I say well this is my water to look at that and say what's the me that's the owner what's the bit here that actually does the owning what shape is that is that male, is it English is it dual nationality how is that mine what's the thing here that is the owner and we realise that if we explore that all of those ways that we say this is my mind or my robe or my cushion or my retreat my memories that to to greater and lesser degrees all of those eyes and me's and minds these are what I would call convenient fictions they're useful fictions but they're convenient fictions like saying this is my seat I'm the teacher my name is on the programme if I came in here and Venom Bookachana was sitting in this seat with a microphone over his ear we think interesting but the conventions are that I'm leading this retreat but those conventions are something that we decide upon we bring them into their being in this country you drive on the right hand side of the road in Britain you drive on the left so that's a convention that's agreed upon that we take that and say I'm driving on the correct side of the road that's what I'm doing and we don't realise oh that's just an agreement that we've decided upon we brought that into being and something like the side of the road that you drive on is kind of obvious okay that's just an agreement but when we think well this is my memory this is my body these are my thoughts it can seem very convincing these are my decisions, my choices but with meditation and one of the great usefulnesses of vipassana is that as we look at the process of thinking and learn to let go of that habit of identification there can be a clear and clear recognition well there's a memory memory arises shape and dissolves but really what makes that memory any more mine than the sound of cars on the road or the sound of Ajahn Amaro speaking or the sound of the the frogs and the crickets in the evening what makes that mine and what's this me what's this I that is the owner what is that it's also helpful in looking at this to understand that the Buddha didn't put forth these what are called the three characteristics in each adhuka anata of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and not self he didn't say these are absolute truths and you should believe in them but more like here's a set of tools to investigate your experience to be able to explore and to look and to see what the reality of our experience is and so vipassana meditation the insight is a way of investigation it's a way of exploring analyzing in a sense deconstructing the experience of each moment and in that deconstructing what we find is that that there's a freedom that comes when we recognize oh it's this what I've been calling my pain or my problem to be able to shift the view although it's it's pain but it doesn't have to have an owner it doesn't have to be me or mine it arises, it does its thing it fades away the letting go of that identification and claiming of experience the way that the mind takes hold of it and says this is mine this is what I am and look at that and see even that feeling of I this is mine mine to see well that that feeling of mineness or inus is also another pattern like the sound of a car passing by on the road I mine mine and that when those qualities of I and me and mine are also seen as empty as passing patterns of nature just like the shape of a cloud or a leaf that forms in spring and grows up through the summer and then falls off in the autumn then there's a whole change of attitude towards it so with vipassana meditation then once the mind has arrives at a quality of steadiness and focus and can stay with the present moment in a reasonably well established and firm way then we consciously let go of paying attention to the feeling of the breath or the rhythm of the feet touching the ground and quite consciously just let the mind be open to be non-discriminating in terms of the objects you're not trying to focus on a particular object but instead really you kind of broaden the range so that the whole moment becomes your object the present reality becomes your object and then as the mind then allows the pattern of the present to arise take shape sight, sound, smell, taste and touch then as different things are noticed like the sound of a car or a feeling in your legs or the sensation of your clothes and your skin or the sound of somebody else in the room then seeing that the mind jump in and labor or that's out there that's the road or that's my leg or this is my memory and to meet every pattern of experience to say well whether it's inside or outside is it changing whether it's coarse or fine is it something satisfying is it something that complies me permanently is it something that's intrinsically satisfying forever or is it not this memory is it truly mine if it's mine what's the me that does the owning what is that where is that what shape is it is that sound mine no it's experienced here but it's not mine I wouldn't own the sound of that car okay so why would I own this memory or own this plan huh so we're not trying to make ourselves believe that that everything is impermanent unsatisfactory not self but we're instead using these principles as tools to like a set of magnifying glasses or kind of like socket wrenches or tire levers to dig into the nature of the vehicle and see how it works and to unpick the workings of experience and the process of doing that because we're doing that in a deliberate and mindful attentive way then that in a sense deconstruction of the habits of ego centered thinking rather than being something that freaks us out or is unsettling or threatening rather it's liberating it's the effect of that is to free the heart and to directly experience a sense of unburdening there's a feeling of fear might be quite strong it arises it passes away that which knows the fear is not afraid there might be a feeling of annoyance like that's really annoying that which knows the annoyance is not annoyed and something in our heart is aware of that and realises that already and that's like even if the sound is very loud like you can be sitting right by the freeway and there's a real racket and it's like it's noisy it's really loud Ajahn Amaro's voice is getting really loud as he's making a point but that which knows the sound is silent that which is is knowing it is not tied is not entangled with the object so that that which knows even intense emotional states of excitement or inspiration that which knows excitement is not excited that which knows irritation is not irritated that which knows agitation is not agitated so a symbol that Ajahn Chah used towards the end of his his teaching career he was paralysed and couldn't speak or move for the last 10 years of his life but during the last couple of years that he was teaching there was a particular simile that he used to use to describe this mixture of qualities and when people would come to visit he liked to ask people put kind of conundrums to them little impossible questions and he'd say have you ever seen flowing water yes the usual answer did you ever see still water yes very common everyone's seen a river everyone has seen water sitting in a pond in a glass and then he would say did you ever see still flowing water and usually people would think what he was using some kind of local expression that they didn't understand what was that did you ever see still flowing water now I'm lying no I don't think I ever did and then he would explain what is like still flowing water it flows we hear, we see, we feel we remember, we think, we plan we taste, we smell, we touch you know the sense world flows constantly through the mind even refined states deep concentration or clarity states of great compassion or love they flow they arise, they take shape, they dissolve they are constantly flowing through the mind but that which knows the flowing states and patterns of the mind is perfectly still it's outside of the world of time and space that quality of awareness and knowing is not tied to the sense world and is perfectly still because it's outside of the realm of time of coming and going, of here and there it's ever present and aware, awake and free from time free from space, free from individuality for the mind embodies both those qualities it's like still flowing water as the flow of perceptions and thoughts and there is this profound stillness so earlier today when I was talking about the ending of becoming and I don't know how you did with the exercise at the meal time maybe you totally forgotten piling up the piling up the spoon as per I don't have spies no one was taking notes or there were no cameras on you don't worry but when we talk about the ending of becoming it doesn't mean just freezing ourselves in halfway down the path Nirvana is the ending of becoming can we move Ajahn? it's not the ending of becoming is not stopping the world in terms of freezing stopping our speech or not moving or eating or talking but the ending of becoming is in a sense embodying that quality of stillness embodying that awareness as I was saying yesterday evening I think if I remember correctly when we talk about taking refuge in Buddha it means being that very awareness being Buddha being that awake, aware, knowing quality now maybe the last thing to say before with this afternoon's talk when we practice vipassana or inside meditation often we use the kind of language like being the witness or being the watcher or the silent watcher and that's a valid enough approach but what can happen when we're trying to just be the witness or be the watcher of experience is that we can unconsciously create a kind of abstracted dissociated awareness so that we kind of unconsciously try to turn ourselves into a close-circuit TV camera like a data reception unit thinking, thinking, seeing, seeing hearing, hearing, feeling, feeling and that might work okay in the meditation hall but if you try doing that over the breakfast table with your partner or your kids or you're taking your mum out for a drive driving, driving it's not going to work or the common sense of your dear mother will say why are you why are you acting like a zombie why don't you just talk normally or how come you're all kind of stiff or remote and so that I would suggest this is a way that we can grasp the idea of watching or awareness in an incorrect way that being aware or being awake or being the watcher is useful but then if we cling to that or identify with that I am the watcher or being the one who knows or being the watcher then we can create this unnatural and very awkward dissociation from the sense world in a way make the world of senses or that kind of grubby conditioned world I'm just going to identify with I'm just going to be wisdom or that kind of grubby conditioned world can kind of arise and pass away it can sit all over there I don't really want to bother with that I'm into the unconditioned and we can kind of have this sort of rejecting and nihilistic approach towards the sense world but it's also it's really interesting how in the qualities of the Buddha even though he was the most supremely wise and awakened being he was also incredibly clued in the material world and even people who weren't his students or supporters when they described his actions and the way he operated they pointed out how he was extremely attentive and careful in all his actions everything he said everything he did, the way he moved the way he ate his food the way he cleaned his arms bowl after the meal the way he walked everything he was perfectly attuned to the time the place and the situation so he was not dissociated or just kind of out of tune with the material world and one of the characteristics when we recite the qualities of the Buddha one of the characteristics is in Pali is called Vijacharana Sampanol in the English version it's a perfect and impeccable in conduct and understanding translation the let me have a look impeccable in conduct and understanding Vijacharana Sampanol Vijachar means awareness so those of you I noticed on the go round yesterday a few of you have been involved in Tibetan Buddhist practice so Vijachar in Pali is the same as the word Rigpa in Tibetan it means awareness or knowing so Vijachar, so the Buddha had this quality of transcendent awareness transcendent knowing that his mind was completely attuned to the the ultimate reality but there is also Charana means conduct means your activity, your actions, your speech your way of being in the world and those two are like a single unit Vijacharana it's not like the Charana is second rate and the Vijjo is the most important but they're a unit Vijacharana, so wisdom and conduct and so his complete freedom from entanglement in the world was also manifested in a complete commitment to the world and so his actions and his words were always perfectly attuned to the time, the place, the situation so what I like to use this as an example because it helps point the way for us when we're talking about being the one who knows or establishing the mind that's watching and aware that is not a kind of disconnected or dissociated awareness that's sort of just trying to be this data reception unit recording the phenomena of our life but it's also completely attuned so rather than using phrases like being the watcher I like to use the phrase unentangled participating a few too many syllables, I like to shrink it down a bit but you can shrink it down to something like a free action rather than reaction but unentangled, so the heart is unentangled, is not caught up, is not identified but it's participating in the world it's fully attuned to the sense world it's not rejecting or dismissing or belittling the world of senses and the conditioned reality but is so free and that quality of freedom and awareness is fully attuned to the sense world and works in a harmonious relationship with it rather than trying to occupy a little kind of bubble that's separated from it somewhere else which is also in a way it relates back to what I was saying about practice doesn't equal what just happens here in the hall but it includes everything, it includes the tea time and getting in the car and driving down the freeway and talking to people going back to work and all of the other things dealing with your emails that have been piling up and that way of meeting the world and receiving the world that our Charana, our conduct if the Vijara and Charana are balanced with each other then the presence of the sense world and our responsibilities and the conditioned reality is no imposition it doesn't inhibit our freedom it doesn't inhibit the natural the limitless nature of the mind.
