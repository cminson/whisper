Good day, everyone. Before I begin this talk, I want to 
mention that when I finished giving the morning talk 
yesterday, I thought that I didn ’t really have my words 
together well, or I wasn ’t quite as clear as I probably 
could have been. And maybe it was a little confusing 
the way I talked about conditionality. So I record ed it 
again , and hopefully it ’s improved and clear.  
 
So, today is today. I ’ll take a little detour first. There was 
a Japanese priest in Japan Town in San Francisco in 
the early 1960s, from a sect of Japanese Buddhism that 
was different from Zen. But this young priest  went to Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg - 2 - visit the Zen  master,  Suzuki Roshi, the founder of the 
San Francisco Zen Center. Since he was a Buddhist 
priest and had studied Buddhism , at some point Suzuki 
Roshi asked him if he ’d give a talk at his Zen temple in 
English . But the young  priest said, “No, no  – my English 
is not good enough. ”  
 
The next time the priest came to listen to Suzuki Roshi 
give a Dharma talk, Suzuki Roshi ’s talk went like this : 
Today is today. Today is not yesterday. Today is 
not tomorrow. Today is today .  
 
Hu used  just five  words in English. That was the entire 
Dharma talk. The youn g priest was there. He told me 
that he believes Suzuki Roshi gave him an example of 
how to give a Dharma talk with very little English.  
 
I say this today because of this way of letting each thing 
be discrete. Today is today, just today. Today is not 
yeste rday. It ’s not tomorrow. This moment can be just 
this moment. It ’s not two minutes ago, two seconds 
ago, it ’s not two minutes in the future  – the 
discreteness, the uniqueness of each moment. Of 
course, there is past and future. But there ’s a way in 
which the past and the future belong, or are 
reconstructed, in our memory, through our ideas, our 
stories. We sew it together. Once the present moment 
is gone, it exists as kind of a memory in ideas and 
stories to a great extent.  Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg - 3 -  
As the meditative mind b ecomes quieter, we ’re more 
and more living just in the present. A nd as the 
meditative mind stops the activity of making stories, it ’s 
more and more just th e experience of the moment that 
happens. A s we go  deeper and deeper, at some point 
we start seeing th at all the experiences we have, as 
experiences, are coming and going, appearing and 
disappearing  – not because we ’re searching or looking 
for that, but because the mind i s very quiet  and still.  
 
When instructing his monastics, t he Buddha said : 
Develop con centration  – for those who have 
concentration will see things as they are. They will 
see suffering, the arising of suffering, the ceasing of 
suffering, and the practice of the ceasing of 
suffering .  
 
So, that looks like wording that we ’re familiar with in the 
Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the 
arising of suffering, the truth of the cessation of 
suffering, and the truth of the practice leading to the 
cessation of suffering.  
 
What ’s interesting is that the Buddha begins by saying:  
“Develop concentration, ” which means samādhi , 
meditative mind. With a concentrated, clear, and quiet 
mind that ’s not sewing things together, constructing 
things with thinking  – then we ’ll see things as they are. Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg - 4 - We’ll see the inconstant nature of phenomena, how 
things come and go, arise and pass. We’ll see into the 
nature of impermanence, inconstancy – the chang ing 
nature  of phenomena. The Buddha repeated this in 
many ways. He sometimes was explicit , saying :  
Develop concentration; you ’ll see thing s as they 
are. Then you ’ll see inconstancy or impermanence 
– the coming and going of experience . 
 
Develop concentration ; then you ’ll see things as they 
are, you ’ll see things appear and disappear. But he also 
express ed it this way:  
You’ll see suffering, th e arising, the ceasing , and 
the practice leading to the ceasing .  
 
Hundreds of times in the sutta s, the Buddha speaks  
about the insight, understanding, and deep knowledge 
of: the experience of suffering, its arising, its ceasing , 
and realizing the practice for the cessation of suffering.  
 
This refers to seeing moment -to-moment  – the discrete 
moments of experience – seeing how experiences 
come and go, arise and pass, and that nothing in our 
experience is constant. It might be cont inuous , in that it 
keeps reappearing.  But it’s like those ants that are 
discrete, each one. 1 
 
1  Here, Gil is probably referring to a metaphor in the Vammika Sutta  (MN 23), where the Buddha 
explains that our experience may seem like a conglomerate, but it’s actually many fleeting moments. 
Rather than being like a n ant -hill, our experience is more like a succession of thousands of discrete, 
individual ants continually moving around, appearing and disappearing.  Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg - 5 -  
With insight into whatever suffering, distress, or 
discomfort we have – in a meditative mind, we see the 
way it unfolds moment -to-moment before we overlay 
our id eas on top of it and sew it together . Our suffering 
is actually not so solid. It comes and goes , rises and 
passes. This, the Buddha described, is the insight that 
leads to liberation. So I call it liberating insight. He talks 
about this over and over and o ver again.  
 
Generally, when people read the sutta s, and the  
Buddha talks about , “suffering, the arising of suffering, 
the ceasing of it, and the practice leading to the ceasing 
of it” – most Buddhists assume  he is talking about what 
we think of as the Four Noble Truths. There are all 
these talks about suffering  and the aggregates of 
clinging. There ’s a cause for suffering , and that i s 
craving. There ’s the cessation of suffering. And then 
there ’s the Eightfold  Path, which is the path leading to 
the cessation of suffering. That ’s the common 
understanding.  
 
The Four Noble Truths  are thought to be  the most 
central teaching of the Buddha. But in the ancient texts, 
the Buddha almost never taught the Four Noble Trut hs. 
If they were so central to his teaching, you ’d expect him 
to teach this a lot. He explains the Four Noble Truths 
only five times in these ancient texts. Five times. And 
each time is different. Three of them are very similar  – Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg - 6 - the differences are minor.  But it ’s surprising how little 
the Buddha teaches this.  
 
It’s given pride of place because it ’s said to be the 
Buddha ’s first sermon. But really what ’s recorded as his 
first sermon couldn ’t have been – because he teaches 
these complex Buddhist ideas, using Buddhist words 
that would have been unfamiliar to people who were 
just brand new to Buddhism. So for this to have been 
his first sermon probably d oesn’t make sense.  
 
Furthermore, i t’s also in a genre of writing that belongs 
to a period about 100 years after the Buddha died. So 
scholars genuinely believe that the so called “first 
sermon ” doesn ’t really belong to the Buddha  himself .  
 
But what the Buddha did emphasize over and over and 
over again, was deep insight into impermanence – deep 
insight into seeing things come and go. This is 
liberating, because when  we see things arise and pass 
in experience, then we have a much clearer sense of 
how we want to tie it together, how we want to hold on 
to it, or how we resist it.   
 
We see, in the appearing and disappearing of things, 
that there  is space around them. There are times when 
they’re not there. They ’re unique phenomena. They are 
not anything to hold on to.  
 Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg - 7 - Seeing this  support s the movement of the mind in 
meditation to  not sew things together, to keep letting go, 
to keep allowing things to be there , and be there , and 
be there. And th is cultivates very deep equanimity, 
deep non -reactivity to our experience. And this non -
reactivity  – just seeing the coming and going of 
phenomena  – leads to the mind letting go in the 
deepest possible ways.  
 
So, one of the interpretations or one of the 
understandings of what ’s called the Four Noble Truths 
is not about the cause of suffering, no r the conditions 
that lead to suffering, but rather it ’s a deep insight into 
the nature of suffering. Whatever it is that we call 
suffering or experience as suffering – the nature of this 
is a process of inconstancy, of change, of coming and 
going. And some how, seeing into the nature of th is is 
deeply liberating.  
 
It doesn ’t require us to find the cause or the conditions 
of suffering . But there is a very deep letting go of 
clinging, letting go of craving, that does go on there. But 
this is not because we ’ve understood that craving is the 
cause. What we ’ve understood is the changing, 
inconstant, impermanent nature of suffering.  
 
We realize that suffering is not an inherent part of the 
human experience, and that what we can do is to let go. 
This was the Buddh a’s big insight.  Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: JAS _mg - 8 -  
So what I ’m offering here now, on the third day  about 
the arising of suffering , is a variety of different 
understandings for the Four Noble Truths. All of the se 
understandings are great. What we ’re doing is 
expanding the range of how we can use th e framework 
of the Four Noble Truths to understand our lives in 
different ways. And i n different circumstances, different 
ways are useful.  
 
We are maturing, growing, and understanding our lives 
better in all the ways possible to interpret the Fo ur 
Noble Truths. They are the central framework to 
organize our human experience on the path to freedom.  
 
So thank you very much. Tomorrow I ’m going to talk a 
bit about  the classic explanation of the Four Noble 
Truths as found in the first sermon of the B uddha. And 
it’s fascinating to see how this works out.  
 
So thank you all very much . I look forward to our time 
tomorrow.
