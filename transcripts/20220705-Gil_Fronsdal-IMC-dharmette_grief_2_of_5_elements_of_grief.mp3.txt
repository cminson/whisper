The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Welcome to this second talk on grief, a topic and a state of being that can be
very difficult and also can be very deeply connected to our love and the
depths of who we are and what we think is important in this life. So it's a very
important topic to be able to learn how to be present for and recognize and then
get under the surface of to see more clearly. And grief is not an enemy or
grief is not a illness or a problem. Grief is a part and parcel of a human life
and becoming wise about it and knowing how to be with grief is one of the great
benefits of mindfulness practice. So I'm defining grief as the pain is
the pain arising in the emptiness born from loss. The pain that arises in the
emptiness born from loss. And this definition I'm hoping will span all the
different ways in which griefs are experienced because there's an infinite
number of ways that grief is sometimes it's more emotional sometimes it's more
physical sometimes it's more relational in nature and there's all kinds of very
different cultures grieve in different ways different ways different different
cultures experience the pain of loss in different ways. But because it involves
a loss that loss means there's now an emptiness an absence of something and
that absence that emptiness can be huge. As some people feel it's so huge that
it you know nothing will ever fill it again and will always be in this great
vacuum or great place of meaningless or loneliness or loss. But the bigger that
emptiness is the bigger that absence is that actually the more it gets filled
and it gets filled with many many things and part of mindfulness practice is to
begin to enter into this world of this emptiness to be able to see clearly
what is it that fills the emptiness that we're in what is it that characterizes
this pain this discomfort that comes with loss and and so rather than taking it
as being a singular thing my grief we can put a little question mark after it
what is this maybe we don't really know the grief so what is this grief and to
sit with it to be with it not so much to investigate and think about it but rather
to enter into grief as if it's a temple a sacred spot or place where we enter
into quietly peacefully non assertively without our needs without our demands
and our wants but to really be present in the middle of this emptiness to make
space and room for what's there and then to see all the different elements of it
and one of the key things to think about or that I think I find helpful is to
not give a lot of preferential treatment to the world of thinking to thoughts
and stories and memories and meanings that we assign to the situation but rather
to be entering into this emptiness and start seeing there is stories there are
meanings there are thoughts ideas associations there those are there a
part of the big picture including the emotions and the feelings and to begin
seeing making space for all the component parts grief is a composite of many
different pieces and parts some of them come are very personal some of them are
cultural some of them are come from our life experience some of them come from
our hopes and aspirations that we have that have been maybe been the rug has
been pulled away from them and so to begin to see the different be entered into
this carefully and make space and quietude to really recognize oh this is
what's happening make space for it and to become quiet the thinking mind can
become quiet in the relationship to grief and this is not easy but it's
probably one of the most respectful things to do to really make room for
the natural or inner process that our body has for being with grief and
allowing grief its space and its time so to be able to kind of begin
understanding the component parts of grief I want to talk a little bit about
what these might be and one of them is to appreciate the kind of grief it is
or the source of the grief so some grief is very relational in nature it has
been severed and lost like there's been a death death of a parent or a child
or a spouse a sibling or a friend and that relationship was so important and
so there's a lot of lot about that relationship that comes into play with
the grief there might be a divorce and lot about that relationship comes into
play with the grief and that relationship is what is the emptiness is the loss
of the loss that has created the absence and so to understand that quality
of the relatedness that's no longer there or is lost or is other kinds of
grief are more functional that isn't so much a relationship with another person
but we're losing our abilities so there's a grief about aging when we get
some of many of our abilities become less and less and there's a grief from
an accident that some abilities we have functions we have no longer work and
we've lost maybe been paralyzed by something and we'll never be able to
do things we did before because our body doesn't function the same way
and so the loss of functioning of abilities that we've had there's a loss of
roles that sometimes people retire they've lost the role that was so important
for who they were children leave home and the role of being a parent is no
longer there and it's that's the grief is not being able to care take care of
someone or have breakfast ready for someone you know that and there's a
someone dies and part of the grief is not the loss of the relationship or is
the loss of the relationship but another part of it is now we can't have that
role of the caregiver of the lover or the friend of someone which was so
valuable for such an important part of our identity who we were and then
there's more clearly the identity itself that being some person isn't you
can't be that person anymore when this kind of loss has gone away and not the
way that you experience it before the loss of identity loss of who you thought
you were and who you thought you were going to become that you know spouse
dies and you expected that you'd be in retirement together traveling around
the world or playing bridge or something with yours but now this the spouse
has gone and the anticipated futures are no longer there some people are
grieving lost futures lost anticipated ideas of what was going to come but
also lost identities of who we were going to be we lost we lose material
goods we might lose all our money in a stock market crash and our identity is
someone who is financially stable or secure or even wealthy is gone or our
identity is someone who can do certain things that requires money goes away
and and so it's a loss of grieving the identity grieving loss and then there's
a loss of material goods all kinds of you know lossing of wealth like I said
money but losing a valuable piece of property that we have or losing our
financial security or losing our home that we've had for many times a divorce
and we lose something that was so important for us so these are all
different kinds of losses that come into play when people experience grief
or on these things and some of these griefs are very personal in nature and
some of them are more social and interpersonal in nature there's a
personal and interpersonal quality to it some of them so for example the
personal is an individualistic culture like maybe the United States many
people that are not living in a rich dynamic social sphere of family or
clan or tribe or different things and so there's a loss maybe a couple has
been living together alone they're old and and maybe you know there's no one
who's taking care of them particularly and so one person dies and it isn't
like now they're part of a rich network of family and the clan tribe and so
the grief is very individualistic very alone and so grief can be very lonely
other popular people who might be living in an extended family in a compound
or a town or village or a tribe and the elder of the tribe dies the grief is
very social it's collective it's something that everyone shares and the
social dynamic of the village has changed with this death and people
let the whole social world begin shifting and changing and so grief takes
a very different form then when it's not it's not so lonely it's a it's
collective when it's collective it's more cultural and there's cultural
aspects that come into play with the how we grieve and so there's so grief
is a composite it's made up of many different things grief is not a
singular thing though each powerful grief that we experience might seem
like this is the end of the world this is it that you know this is the thing
you know that is so huge and how could anything ever be the same again
but to enter into the world of our grief maybe in meditation and let the mind
become quiet this is one of the gifts or the approaches of the meditation
world life and that is to enter into what's difficult be present for it but
don't let thinking get the upper hand but to feel and sense and begin allowing
the pieces of it to show itself and to be recognized and be known some very
different things can happen in with grief when we're not churning and
thinking and spinning and living in the thoughts and the ideas and the
histories and the memories and the and the ideas but they become quiet
quieting the stories the stories are important but there's another way so in
these few words I have in this 15 minutes I hope that this has given you
something to consider that the emptiness of grief we fill it with many
many things and to sit quietly in the middle of it so all the different
component parts can be recognized and that which is extra those pieces of
the component parts of grief which are not needed can quiet and settle and
some of that has to do with the stories we tell ourselves and the meanings we
assign to grief and that'll be the topic for tomorrow so thank you and care
for yourself well and think of mindfulness of however you are and as
mindfulness as a powerful way of protecting yourself caring for yourself
by not asserting your desires and needs on top of yourself but rather to listen
deeply to respect here so thank you
