The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
I would like to share a little bit of this idea.
I was listening to Matthew Brent Silver this week, last week.
He mentioned one of his talks. He was talking a little bit about how to deal with each other.
And he mentioned this Sutra, or Gatara, or Gatara Nasuta.
It is very nice to see how many of the teachings of what Buddha offered were based on analogies.
It is easy to tell stories with which they have a meaning, like you know what they are talking about.
It is not a very intellectual question, but rather it is something that you can almost feel when you tell the story.
There are a couple of analogies about this idea of how to cross the current, how to cross the floods,
the rivers of intense currents.
In particular, I found it very interesting.
I was reflecting on what my mother had said. She is very ill. She has been in the months of high and low, and sometimes I feel like I am thrown into the river.
And it seemed to me that this also describes the experience, and I wanted to reflect a little about it.
Someone asks Buddha how he did to cross the current.
And he answers, I am going to phrase it. I did not find any translation that was completely satisfactory, but there we go.
He says, I crossed it without staying still, static, and without forcing myself forward.
I am still and moving. How is this?
He answers, and it depends on the translation that I find, but he says something like that.
When I stayed static, I sank.
And when I forced myself forward, I dragged the current.
It made me think a little about the current of the flood, which is sometimes in the sea.
These currents are of a great speed that they distance you from the shore, from the beach.
But they are very strong, so they try to swim against the current, they drown you.
And then people drown themselves for fighting against the current.
Sometimes what they suggest is to let yourself be dragged, because the current will not take you very far.
Or maybe try to swim, swim, parallel, but it is also a little to stay still.
It is a little this idea that I am going to be quiet, but not swimming.
Swimming obviously elaborates much more on that.
But I appreciate that it was an image that we can all understand a little this idea of floods.
Especially in our Latin American countries where sometimes the infrastructure is not the best,
or where it is simply normal that at a certain time of the year there will be floods.
And we have that knowledge, we have seen it, it is something that we can feel.
So what is this?
What are the floods? What are these currents that drag you?
And thinking a little about the experience of the last few months, it is a little that feeling,
a feeling trapped completely without control of what is happening.
There is nothing to do, it doesn't matter what you do, there is nothing to control.
And then obviously a detonator becomes.
So we feel aversion, confusion, or suddenly if something happens,
you don't want, you don't want things to change at that point.
I hope it will always be like this.
We are always, not always, in difficult situations.
It is so easy to fall into that trap of wanting to demand that things be in one way,
or defend themselves with confusion, distraction, where you think that sometimes even in meditation,
when we do this meditation that I propose to you today, which is an open meditation,
I am going to follow my thoughts and I sometimes completely lose my thoughts,
but I have the illusion of how I am doing a meditation on my thoughts.
It is not real what is happening here.
And it happens to us on a daily basis, especially when the temperature of the experience is too high,
when it is too intense.
So I think that, and the texts say it, this inundation, this current,
they are basically the three of us.
Demands to defend themselves, to distract themselves, or to cling to rejection and ignorance,
as you want to see it.
So first of all, why do we want to cross the current?
Once we start this practice, we do not have another alternative.
Although we are already, we no longer have the excuse to not cross this current.
We know that there is a possibility that, although there is pain, we can free ourselves from suffering.
And then how do we cross that current?
And that is where the practice becomes so important, so, it gives us so many tools.
We can see them from a practical point of view, although there is no formula,
no equation, no recipe for when I feel sad, then I have to do this and this and this,
then sadness disappears, it is not about that.
But we have this practice, it gives us support, a way to handle yourself,
to be in a more balanced way.
What I find interesting about this analogy is that at no time are they telling you
that you are not going to get wet crossing the current.
We are there, put in the water, there is the neck.
The practice is not going to avoid that.
The practice that helps you to keep floating.
And suddenly the other side arrives.
I have heard people, I think that for many of us,
the way, the door that brought us this practice was intense, suffering, a difficult moment,
where we felt that everything was falling.
For me, that was the entrance to the practice.
And I know that many people enter the practice looking for an antidote,
not having to suffer any more, not even experiencing any pain,
and we know that that is impossible.
We are going to get old, we are going to have health problems,
there is a pandemic, you are going to lose your loved ones,
you are going to have lost breaks.
And what the four truths suggest is not that we are going to live on top of the pain,
it does not mean that you are going to have a super luxury yacht to cross the current.
You have to put effort, you have to put work for that.
And a little discussion is then how to do it in a way that is possible.
We have the practice that we have heard from Tara Bragg, for example,
that is to recognize what is happening, to allow, to give space to the experience,
to investigate it, not to identify with the experience and to try to be one with amazement and compassion,
which in some way sums up a little what we do in meditation.
When I invite you in meditation, when the mind is distracted,
do not come so quickly or that I return to my respiration, to the sounds, to the anchor that you are using,
but what is happening when I am distracted and start to recognize in this system our how the suffering feels,
how it feels, how to familiarize ourselves with the emotions,
familiarize ourselves with the rejection of what is happening in that way in which we react.
It is not because we want to torture ourselves, it is because that is human nature.
Ignoring it does not help us at all.
On the other hand, if we know and understand how this being expresses itself, the rejection, the version, the desire, the doubt,
we start to have ways to relate to our experience in a more subtle way.
To be in situations of intense frustration or aggression and to realize
and to realize that one is still in that state, that is the path, that is the path.
And I know it sounds a little like, well, a lot of people comment on it and misinterpret it many times,
what you mean by that.
The way we observe and relate to that experience is not as if we were doing something wrong,
as if something was wrong with us, something that does not work.
On the contrary, we are connected knowing that there is goodness in this being,
that there is something very good inside us,
that what is happening is simply a manifestation of our humanity, not to be identified.
So, when the Buddha says that, not even with a huge effort,
but not staying static, this is my interpretation.
So, sometimes when we are facing a difficult, complicated situation,
many times what I do, and I am talking about myself,
is, I know how to fix this, immediately my mind goes,
I already know that if, better said, I fix everything in my mind,
I completely ignore the pain that is happening,
because I know that there is a way I can solve it.
And I paint it, look, I make the map, I know exactly what to do.
And that is what it does, is bring me more suffering.
So, it is when, for me, that is the effort too much, it drags me,
drags me the current, and there I do not have, there is no way to get out of the flow.
It is more difficult to get out of the flow there.
But when I am able to realize that I am doing it,
or when I realize the suffering, then there is,
then a possibility is created.
I will still be looking for air on the surface,
but I have the faith, the confidence that this is going to happen.
This is not forever.
And this is part of life.
Okay, then one begins to calm down the nervous system.
On the other hand, to stay static, passive.
Sometimes it is like a state of resignation,
not a state of acceptance, but more like,
ah, there is nothing to do here,
completely give up any sense of autonomy or election that one can have.
And it happens, and it happens, yes.
So whatever it is, how many times,
well, I have several experiences,
ah, I don't care what it is,
and that is always counterproductive,
it ends up causing more suffering than it really would be necessary.
Those two ways, or forcing yourself to fix it,
or solving it, or staying static without doing anything,
disconnect you from the experience.
It is starting to see through all those filters that we have,
of those, of the beliefs that we have so many times,
and that sometimes it is so difficult to realize what we are doing,
because many of those beliefs and things that are considered normal,
they are just that, beliefs, they are not really true.
And the WhatsApp, my family, I have a family on both sides,
my parents are very, very big families,
and well, they are everywhere,
they created this list,
they are connected with the family,
and it starts to see the jokes that count,
to the point that I decide to leave the list,
because I started to realize how one begins to get a little more used to it.
The jokes about women don't know how to handle,
they are innocent, they can sound so innocent.
The jokes about the drunk husband and the woman who scolds him,
all these types of behaviors that, yes, it is a joke,
innocent, but they are so involved in our psyche,
in our habits, in the way we see the world,
that I think it is not healthy.
And just like that, they are small things,
questions of colorism, of racism, of aversion,
of poverty, of the Indians,
that sound like very innocent, this drunk,
but it is not true, they have a cultural card
and that they don't benefit from anyone,
they don't benefit from anyone,
which is not easy to realize,
I am looking a little bit,
but it is simply to have that ability to question everything,
although the things that seem simpler,
the points of view that seem more obvious,
sometimes they have consequences that we don't even imagine.
And when I was in Colombia,
a few weeks ago,
in the news we were showing
the case of a population that was attacked by the army,
there were shots, there were people who were killed,
very dramatic, a population of poverty.
And the next day they were talking in the media,
at that moment that happened,
they were at a party, they were drinking,
there was music, there were people who were drunk,
maybe not the most suitable,
but a party in the town.
And the next day,
many of the people who were defending what had happened,
they were talking like,
but those people were drunk,
surely they were doing something that should be done,
they were hiding something,
all those prejudices begin like this,
I don't know,
what's happening here, what's happening here?
It's an extreme case,
but just to say that sometimes those small ideas
that are considered the absolute truth,
have a load and a poison that is important to discover.
I went completely out of my way,
but...
What does this practice offer us?
What happens when the current is too much
and we can't, we feel that we can't handle it.
And in the teachings they offer us several alternatives,
what the Buddhist psychology offers us.
Take a walk,
take a walk in nature,
take your attention to breathing,
take your attention to the palms of your hands,
contact with the chair,
what we do in meditation.
What we do in meditation,
when we start to focus,
to feel more present,
are strategies that we can use in daily life.
They are there, at the disposal.
The more we practice,
the more accessible they become.
And we start to realize,
intuitively,
we start to get to know each other a little better,
that suddenly there are times when we are able
to face the situation with everything.
It can be painful, it can be intense,
and sometimes we have that presence of,
let's see what there is here.
So it's not that the practice gives you tools
to hide from what is happening,
but on the contrary, how to regulate myself,
and how to learn,
to understand me,
to know when I can
jump from stone to stone,
to have a little more effort
without reaching the current.
Or when it's time to be a little more stationary,
and I look at my breath,
I go to the room next door,
I calm down and return.
The practice offers us options,
for example,
when something is very loaded, very intense,
the goal is always in your hand,
and it starts by yourself,
that you find calm,
that you can be good.
What makes sense to you at the moment,
we have the desires of compassion,
that is free from suffering,
that can be free from suffering,
and from the causes of suffering,
to offer something that is relevant at that moment.
Or when there is absolutely nothing to do,
when there is enormous impotence,
practice like tonglen,
that you feel the strength enough
to take that pain that is present,
to transform it into your heart
and to send good wishes to the people
who are present and suffering,
or with one another too.
This practice of a wealth
is incredible.
It is to take one in the day to day,
like training in the gym for the marathon,
to bring these practices,
practice of goal, practice of compassion,
of concentration,
that we can,
that we can definitely use
when we are,
until the neck with the water.
Then going back to that image,
it is not about we are wet until the neck,
feeling that we drown,
that is part of the practice.
That is something that happens to us
by the simple fact of having a body,
a mind, a heart for being human.
It is part of our nature.
It is inherent to our own nature.
Not because there is something broken or wrong
that we have to fix within ourselves.
It is part of our human nature.
It does not mean that we are not able to see
when our behavior is not the most wise,
or when we observe behaviors in other people
that are not neither capable nor suitable
and that they are sedentary, toxic and dangerous.
The practice,
a phrase I use a lot when I talk about compassion,
the practice does not convert us
into the tap at the entrance of the house.
It gives us clear value,
but it allows us to respond
from a point of view more,
more balanced, more balanced.
This practice will never put us,
it must cost us our security, our tranquility,
our integrity for nothing.
And of course, the impermanence that is always,
always, always very, very, very present
and learn to relate to it
in a balanced, balanced way.
That everything that arises,
it goes away.
I wanted to find an image that I really liked,
I wanted to share it.
You can see it.
We do not have the idea of the practice,
the life, you can put what you want in this line,
so we believe that we are going to go,
and reality is completely different
from the moments in which we are going to fall,
in a moment where we have to work hard
and learn to balance
where we have to put the effort,
what is what we have to leave.
I really have to load all my shoulders
or I can deal with a situation at the same time.
That is another thing that we tend to do.
We have a thousand different problems,
because life is like that.
And we load everything,
everything is always present,
so maybe start finding that point of balance,
that point of equilibrium.
