So I'm very happy to be here today and to have this opportunity to spend this time with you all. 
So I thought we could just begin the day with a short sitting together. 
There will probably be a lot of words, even though the theme of the day is nibbana, which obviously has connotations of this peacefulness and silence and ease. 
There will be a lot of words that help hopefully to guide the way there, but we'll start off with a silent time together. 
So it probably has to have a short sitting for about 20 minutes or so. 
So please just make yourselves comfortable and take this time to let the mind settle and to focus. 
So the theme for the day is the safety of the island. 
And as I was saying just before, the sitting will be using this book for all of the sita quotations for the day. 
So we bought a number of copies for free distribution. 
So if you haven't got a copy with you, there's I think still a number out there on the table. 
So please do help yourself to one of those if you would like. 
So the main idea of the day is to give, and hopefully by the end of the day, it will have been able to have this effect, is to give a bit of a sense of what the word nibbana is referring to, why this is the central goal of Buddhist practice. 
And what are some of the ways that we can go about realizing that and living our lives in accordance with that. 
So I did a workshop on this years and years ago, I think probably early 1998 with the sati center. 
And that was actually the suggestion of that workshop was one of the causes for this book being written. 
Nancy Van House, who is probably not around, I don't see her around today, but she was the one who suggested the topic. 
And so then drawing together some sita quotations and notes for that particular event. 
After a very long 10 year gestation, finally turned into this book that was printed a few months ago. 
Also it was an invitation by James Barras for the first community dharma leaders program back in that era, 1997, when he said that lots of people are very committed to vipassana meditation and they are very long standing members of this group. 
They love to do retreats, but for teachings on ultimate reality, everyone seems to go to Advaita Vedanta or Dzogchen. 
That was the dharma du jour of back in the late 90s, remember? And so he said, I'm sure there must be teachings of this nature in the Theravada, but I don't know where to track them down. 
And we're doing this community dharma leaders program and if you can come along to the first session of this, it would be great if you could do a presentation on some of these ultimate reality teachings from the Pali canon. 
So that was the initial spark and then the invitation to sati center was a follow up from that. 
So that was part of the purpose of originally drawing these teachings together, was to point to some of these areas where these same kind of directly liberating teachings are contained within the Theravada classical teachings. 
But maybe you are not so well known or not so emphasized or not so given such central prominence over the ages. 
So that was part of the story behind it. 
Another interesting thing was when I was in Thailand and probably a larger part of the Theravada tradition, when I was in Thailand back in the late 70s and I was starting monastic life there, almost all of the teachings revolved around methods of practice, how to train your mind in concentration, how to develop insight, how to be mindful and so on. 
And then never seemed to be any kind of discussion or talk about nibbana or ultimate reality or that kind of metaphysical side of Buddhist teachings. 
And it was all like 99. 
9% of what was spoken about was about the path and how to practice. 
And the nature of the goal was sort of, well, don't worry about that, it'll all be obvious when you get there. 
And think, well, I'm kind of curious but this is what everyone else is doing, so okay, I'll go with that. 
Because I've grown up with a lot of questions about what's the nature of ultimate truth and who is God and or what and where and how and if. 
And so it was striking that this was almost brushed aside in this particular Buddhist form. 
Then when I came to England after a couple of years in Thailand, I joined Ajahn Someto who had already moved to Britain in 77 and so I didn't meet him until I had already been a monk for a couple of years. 
Even though when I was finishing my university degree in London, he lived about a mile away. 
The Vihara in London was about a mile away from where I lived but I had no idea that these monks were just around the corner. 
Little did I know. 
So when I came back to England and then was listening to Ajahn Someto teaching, then, lo and behold, it was the ultimate reality, the unconditioned and even God making a few appearances in Dhamma talks several times a day. 
And I thought, well, this is really interesting. 
He talks about ultimate truth and nirvana all the time. 
And so one of the very few times I actually asked him a question about why he did things the way he did. 
He gave a very interesting answer which was that in the West, many people interested in Buddhist practice, they've become disaffected with a theistic approach. 
They've grown up with Christianity or Judaism and such like. 
And they've become disaffected with a theistic religion. 
And so they are attracted towards Buddhism because it's a spiritual path that has no God and no soul even better. 
We Buddhists believe in we have no soul. 
And so it's easy for the English, you know. 
But it would drift from, on the one hand, a sort of spirituality being either this sort of theistic based approach on the one side or a sort of mechanistic methodology on the other side, a sort of mental training methodology on the other side. 
And when Ajahn Someda came to Britain, he realized that the way people related to Buddhism was that they had sort of trimmed out that side of any kind of apperception or apprehension of an ultimate reality. 
And they were focused on the sort of the brilliance of the Buddhist philosophy and was almost a kind of antitheistic sort of pushing away that metaphysical side of the teaching. 
So he's a very reflective person. 
He thought, well actually, you know, in Thailand we never talk about it very much because it's kind of an assumed reality. 
It's an assumed backdrop to everything that you're doing. 
Well, of course, this is the purpose of it, and there's a tremendous faith in that there's fundamental liberating transcendent qualities. 
And so it wasn't really spoken about much, but it was there as an informing backdrop to all of the practice that people followed in their devotion towards Buddhadharma. 
But he said, realize in Britain there wasn't that. 
There wasn't a backdrop. 
You had the path, and in this blank sort of, not even really a question, but it's a blank non-interest in what's beyond, or you couldn't even really use words like transcendent. 
People would sort of recoil at the idea of that sort of realm. 
And one of the famous quotations from Bertrand Russell, a Cambridge philosopher, was that mysticism, it begins in mist and ends in schism. 
So it was kind of dismissive, we don't talk about that. 
Or Russell sort of dismissed the Wittgenstein in his later years as sounding almost spiritual or religious, how ridiculous. 
He's obviously devalued himself completely. 
So that's the agents made to realize, well, people need to have a sense for the numinous. 
Or they wanted to try and convey a sense for that which is transcendent, the numinon, or that which is beyond our ordinary perceptions, but which is the informing reality behind all of Buddhadharma. 
And so he started to talk more and more about Nibbana, about ultimate reality. 
Because he saw that was a huge piece that was lacking, from the sort of theistic approach on one side and the materialistic approach towards Buddhist practice on the other. 
So he started to emphasize that a lot. 
And so it was in the same spirit that Ajahn Pasna and I thought, well, maybe it would be a good idea to put all these teachings together into a book. 
And to gather, also out of our own interest, to draw together these teachings and have a little compendium. 
It shouldn't take long. 
I mean, we know most of where the things are already, you know, have it knocked out by the end of the year. 
That was 1998. 
And there's a wonderful American thinker and writer, Douglas Hofstadter. 
Hofstadter's law is that it always takes longer than you think, even when you take into account that it always takes longer than you think. 
So that's Hofstadter's law, very accurate. 
So anyway, this isn't a sort of a book tour promotion, but just to give you a bit of a sense of where the idea or the, in a way, the spirit for today comes from. 
And also, hopefully, in bringing these teachings into light and putting them into a form that people can easily digest and comprehend, it'll be helpful. 
And to give more of a sense of not only that transcendent or that ultimate level of the teachings, what's called paramata-satcha in Pali, the ultimate reality, ultimate truth. 
But particularly ways that that is something that can be directly realized rather than just being a nice idea off in the distance that we write poetry about or have kind of a kind of admiration for, but it's something that's a remote and vague possibility or a concept that's far away from us. 
So I'll read a few quotations now. 
And the first one is from Ajahn Smeta's introduction. 
He said, Ajahn Chah would use the words, this is little, this is Roman 13, X, 1, 1. 
Ajahn Chah would use the words, the reality of non-grasping as the definition for nibbana. 
The realizing the reality of non-grasping, that helps to put it into a context because the emphasis is on awakening to how we grasp and hold on, even to words like nibbana or Buddhism or practice or sila or whatever. 
It's often said that the Buddhist way is not to grasp, but that can become just another statement that we grasp and hold on to. 
It's a catch-22. 
No matter how hard you try to make sense out of it, you end up in total confusion because of the limitation of language and perception. 
You have to go beyond language and perception, and the only way to go beyond thinking and emotional habit is through awareness of them, through an awareness of thought, through awareness of emotion. 
The island that you cannot go beyond is the metaphor for this state of being awake and aware as opposed to the concept of becoming awake and aware. 
So you might think, what? Perhaps it's a little too early on Saturday morning to get the nuances, but this is a pretty crucial difference. 
Now, later on in that same introduction, Ajahn Smeta then quotes a poem from Swinburne, which he discovered in William James' book, The Varieties of Religious Experience, and this is on Roman 15, XV. 
Here begins the sea that ends not till the world's end. 
Where we stand, could we know the next high sea mark set beyond these waves that gleam? We should know what never man hath known, nor I of man hath scanned. 
Ah! But here man's heart leaps, yearning towards the gloom with venturous glee, from the shore that hath no shore beyond it, set in all the sea. 
And as he says, I found in this poem an echo of the Buddha's response to Kappa's questions in the Sutta Nipata. 
So this is Dr. 
Saratisa's translation, Sutta Nipata, verses 1092-95. 
Next was the Brahmin student Kappa. 
Sir, he said, there are people stuck midstream in the terror and the fear of the rush of the river of being, and death and decay overwhelm them. 
For their sake, sir, tell me where to find an island. 
Tell me where there is solid ground beyond the reach of all this pain. 
Kappa, said the master, for the sake of those people stuck in the middle of the river of being overwhelmed by death and decay, I will tell you where to find solid ground. 
There is an island, an island which you cannot go beyond. 
It is a place of nothingness, a place of non-possession and of non-attachment. 
It is the total end of decay and death, and this is why I call it Nibbana, the extinguished, the cool. 
There are people who in mindfulness have realized this and are completely cooled here and now. 
They do not become slaves working for Mara, for death. 
They cannot fall into his power. 
It is interesting the image of the island. 
When you reflect on this, it is interesting that the island is both in midstream. 
People are stuck in midstream, but then it is also an island you cannot go beyond. 
That seems like a bit of an odd metaphor. 
Right then what Ajahn's Tomatoes is describing, and the emphasis on awareness, it is pointing to the very fact that the island that you cannot go beyond is pointing to the quality of awareness itself. 
Awareness is the island. 
That is the punchline of the whole day. 
Give it to you in paragraph one or two. 
The island is the quality of awareness. 
That is the safe ground. 
Being that very knowing, that aware quality, that is the safe island. 
I cannot go beyond awareness because there is awareness of the feeling of I arising and passing. 
We know feelings, perceptions, thoughts, moods arising and passing away. 
What is pointed to in all these teachings and the image of the island is that it is pointing to that experience of resting in awareness, being that very awareness, and that is the safe place. 
You have all been practicing Vipassana meditation for years and years, I am sure. 
Maybe some of you are new, but at least have done some Vipassana meditation. 
So that very process that is involved in Vipassana of being that quality of aware with that detached, unentangled knowing, that is a safe place, isn't it? Whether what is being known is painful and agonizing in the body or a painful emotion or a delightful, sweet, blissful feeling. 
That which knows bliss or that which knows pain is unentangled with it, essentially. 
The more that we develop that insight meditation, the less there is a quality of entanglement and the more there is a clarity of knowing. 
Things come and go and pass through our awareness without confusion. 
So the description of Nibbana, Nibbana is a word that comes from the language around heat and coolness. 
It literally means something like cooled down, and that quality of coolness or peacefulness is a description of an experience. 
So Nibbana is like an adjectival noun. 
It is like when the mind truly and completely rests in that quality of awareness, then what is felt, the felt experience, is Nibbana, is coolness. 
And in fact the first, if I remember correctly, the first words of the first chapter, what I wrote, is Nibbana, this is page 25, Nibbana or Nirvana in Sanskrit, is a word that is used to describe an experience. 
When the heart is free of all obscurations and is utterly in accord with nature, ultimate reality, dhamma, it experiences perfect peace, joy and contentment. 
This set of qualities is what Nibbana describes. 
The purpose of this book is to outline the particular teachings of the Buddha that point to and illuminate ways that these qualities can be realized. 
From the Buddhist viewpoint, the realization of Nibbana is the fulfillment of the highest human potential, a potential that exists in all of us regardless of nationality or creed. 
So that gives a basic framework for these concepts of what Nibbana is pointing to and then the idea or the principle of the island. 
So does that make sense? You can see how that maps on to the process of insight meditation and how the more fully and deeply that insight is rooted, then the more that quality of coolness, that quality of Nibbana is realized, is manifested. 
So also as we go along during the day, people are more than welcome to ask questions and so if there's anything that I said so far that needs any clarification or comment, please speak up. 
I think there's a microphone that wanders around for people to say their questions with. 
Just a clarification. 
There's the use of the word heart. 
Is it synonymous with mind or is it something, an aspect of mind? It's printed all over the book and in your teachings and everybody's teaching. 
Just want to know what we mean when we say heart is free of obscuration. 
Well, it's a word that's used by different people in different ways. 
So generally I use the word heart as a translation for the word chitta in Pali. 
And so the most commonly used phraseology by the Buddha for describing liberation is saying the heart is liberated. 
He uses the word jitta in relationship to that. 
So what is liberated when there is liberation is the heart or the jitta. 
Mind, again people use it in different ways. 
Sometimes people will say mind as if it has a capital M which is meant to be a similarly all encompassing quality. 
But more often in ordinary everyday usage people tend to think of mind as the thinking mind. 
There's no hard and fast definitions. 
People have written whole books on what's the difference between mano jitta and vinyana, mind, heart and consciousness. 
But generally the Buddha used fairly broad brush approaches towards language. 
But the way I tend to use the words heart is generally what I'll use in terms of referring to the entire field of mental activity including both the conditioned and the unconditioned aspects. 
And so mind or mano often is referring just to the conditioned aspects of mental activity. 
So the mind as a sense organ, like eye perceives light, ear perceives sound. 
Mano, the mind organ perceives mental objects, dhamma with a small d. 
But jitta or heart is generally that sort of more encompassing description of the entire mental field. 
So it's actually the self with the capital S which includes everything, the souls or whatever it is? Not really in Buddhist language, maybe in the more the Vedanta language but we don't have self in here. 
No soul, no self. 
But it's all just vernacular really because in terms of that there is a very close mapping. 
In a way it's just a usage of words so the way that say someone like Sri Ramana Maharshi would use the word self is very different from the meaning or the sense of it that someone using it in a Buddhist language. 
So you have to look at the context in which words are used. 
So but within the general Buddhist vernacular then we don't, at least in the Theravada world, the idea of a big self or a self with a capital S is generally not used. 
So the capital self is not the island. 
Well I leave that for you to find out. 
It seems like the goal of Nibbana is very difficult, very obscure, but there's a controversy over momentary Nibbana. 
I don't know if you're planning on getting into that later, like experiencing the moment and then completely letting go and if you have any comments to make on that. 
Well it's a question of degree, to me and my experience, it's a question of degree. 
So the word for momentary is tadangana and so they talk about momentary liberation, tadangana vimuti or tadangana nibbana and to me that's a totally valid quality. 
I mean it's not saying it's not real nibbana because it's also when the Buddha says, there's an interesting exchange where the Buddha is asked to define deathlessness and yet the lead-up to it, it sounds like he's going to launch into a big exegesis on this topic. 
Ananda comes to the Buddha and is asking about what is the nature of deathlessness and the Buddha just says the cessation of grasping is deathlessness and that's the kind of place where Ajahn Chah would be quoting that, like Nibbana is the reality of non-grasping. 
So I would say that at the moment that the heart is free from grasping, then there is the possibility of realizing deathlessness, not as a sort of total enlightenment forever experience but just in that moment then that quality of the deathless or the transcendent qualities of our nature can be realized because it's the grasping that's obscuring it and so that in that moment when there's no grasping right there in that peaceful open quality then that can, I wouldn't say that as soon as the mind stops grasping then Nibbana is fully realized but that's like a momentary Nibbana is right there. 
When the mind is free of grasping what remains is the deathless. 
I mean that's a somewhat sweeping statement but it's pretty accurate and that also is what you can notice in meditation that when you say you take hold of something like this, like this bell striker and you're in state of tension, you're grasping it so like my arm is shaking, my body is agitated as a tension even as I'm speaking and then you stop. 
You stop grasping and in that moment when the grasping stops there's a natural peacefulness the mind is paying attention and in a moment of letting go there's no sense of self, there's alertness and so in a way it's like the curtains are parting and that quality of peacefulness, purity of mind there's no sense of selflessness or things being not self are right there. 
Now what happens is that we miss that because it's not interesting. 
If you watch this process then in that moment of relief there's a sense of 1, 2, and by about the third second what else is happening around here? What's an iTunes this morning? You're looking for the next thing that's interesting because peace is not interesting. 
It doesn't catch our attention. 
Space is not interesting. 
In a way you could say that we have the possibility of really experiencing those momentary qualities of Nibbana a lot but we miss them because it looks like a blank spot till the next interesting thing comes along but if you really bring your attention to that and focus on that quality, what remains when the grasping stops then you are really able to realize Nibbana. 
So one of the things that is in the Four Noble Truths that Ajahn Smeta would often emphasize is that each of the Four Truths has a particular way in which it's to be worked with. 
So like suffering, dukkha is to be apprehended, its cause is to be let go of, craving is to be let go of. 
The ending of dukkha, dukkha niroda is to be realized. 
Satchikata Vanti is to be realized and then the path is to be developed. 
So to be realized means you've got to notice it. 
You have to develop that, oh look, there's no dukkha. 
Because if you don't realize it, if there isn't that bringing the attention to it and fully cognizing it then it doesn't seem like anything because it isn't anything. 
It's a place of no thingness. 
You don't notice it because it doesn't grab your attention because the senses are geared towards what's interesting. 
Can I eat it? Can I mate with it? Is it going to eat me? That's what our ancestors, back to the zooplankton where that's what their senses developed to do. 
Can I eat it? Can I mate with it? Is it going to eat me? Do I need to be afraid? Do I need to get hungry? Do I need to get attractive? And that's the conditioning of the senses. 
It doesn't say, oh look, there's that really interesting piece of the carpet just next to Cindy and in front of Gita. 
Cindy is much more interesting than the space on top of the carpet. 
Because she's got a name, she's a human being. 
Robert, he's interesting too. 
But the space just above the carpet in front of Robert. 
What's to say about that other than including it in a dummy talk? In a space that is not interesting. 
And so the more that we can train ourselves to notice that quality of peacefulness, the more that we realize nirvana, whenever we're training ourselves to stop grasping, letting go of feelings of self and other and all the different domains of grasping, then that we're able to notice that quality of peacefulness that's there. 
If you're looking at sort of realizing nirvana as some sort of grand finale at the end of Act 5, and you're thinking, oh it's some sort of wonderful thing that's going to happen at the end of a long retreat when I've really got my practice together, we're missing all of the other opportunities to realize that, that are happening there right at the traffic light as you're waiting for the kettle to boil. 
It's always here, but we miss it. 
And so I would say that the deathless, the ultimate reality is always here. 
It's not that it's only available on certain dates or in certain situations. 
And those qualities of a momentary nirvana are just those opportunities where the observations that occlude that fall away, and that when there are other different stages of enlightenment, which hopefully we'll talk a little bit about as the day proceeds, they are certain benchmarks whereby beyond that point you are not able to, the awareness of that fundamental quality of the dharma, the presence of ultimate truth, that something is so well known or so fully experienced, that quality of clarity and peacefulness has been so regularly and completely recognized that you can't forget it like you can't unlearn how to ride a bicycle. 
It's like something just can't forget that. 
It's embedded and so that the levels of enlightenment like stream entry, once returning, non-returning and arahantship are those benchmarks whereby that insight is so deeply rooted and the ephemeral nature of experience is so clearly understood that you can't unsee that. 
So then the full realization of nirvana, if you like, is something that would come with arahantship with total enlightenment. 
But it doesn't devalue the experience of that same quality that is known prior to that full irreversible realization. 
So like a brief glimpse of the truth is the same truth, whether it's a brief glimpse or sort of an unrelenting realization. 
It's the same quality that's being known. 
What interests me is the middle area. 
You have the momentary, you have the ultimate nirvana. 
And most of the time it seems that in the middle area when people go through these midlife transitions where they live such compressed professional lives and I would use myself as an example for 15 years I practiced. 
I was in healthcare, very successful. 
But I got to a place where I was burning out emotionally, mentally, and started getting some health issues. 
So I went through a process of disengagement. 
And to the degree that I was willing to let go and not allow myself to be labeled as giving up too soon that I was still young in my career, things started to happen in a very positive way. 
I would say it would be a personal transformation that exalted feeling for a few years, a couple of years. 
Then it left. 
And after that it was grasping to try to get it back. 
So is there that state in the middle, more than just the momentary glimpses that all of us get? Is that something that is spoken about in the teachings at all? Certainly those kinds of experiences are talked about. 
More often it's in terms of the different levels of enlightenment like the stream entry and being a once-returner and so forth. 
But that kind of experience where everything comes together and life seems grand and before the glamour wears off. 
That's not talked about so much. 
It's a common experience. 
But to my knowledge it's not really talked about so much in the scriptures. 
But it's a common enough pattern where inspiration wanes or the power of an initiate of beginning insight. 
The brightness of that diminishes and then the other unfinished business starts to come into the picture. 
Often it's talked about in terms of the power of concentration. 
And so the Buddha would talk about that sort of thing as that Samadhi or the strength of concentration is suppressing the hindrances, the kind of language. 
And you can think of that as your unfinished business is all on hold but you still haven't closed that account. 
And that's all still waiting because you're currently running on this particular sort of enthusiastic splurge. 
But because of the power of concentration in bright states of mind it's very pleasing, it's very invigorating and it brings a lot of happiness. 
Well, this is great. 
Wow, these things have really come together. 
This is marvelous. 
But then there's all those other unclosed accounts that are still there. 
And so then as that sort of that which was supporting the concentration and the brightness and happiness of the mind as that subsides then that other unfinished stuff emerges. 
So that's talked about quite a lot. 
But that's more of the language that it's spoken of. 
Isn't it true? On retreat we often talk about the subject of Nibbana comes up. 
But the lay teachers primarily say that in the teachings that the Buddha actually discouraged the monks in terms of entertaining any questions about it because it took you away from the present moment. 
If you're thinking of something to attain, the state of mind it's taking you away from being present. 
That's part of it. 
It was not so much not encouraging people to think about Nibbana. 
It was more creating speculations about ultimate reality or life after death or past lives and that kind of thing. 
So like in the Malunkya Putta Sutta, in the middle-length discourses. 
Malunkya Putta has this whole list of questions he wants to ask the Buddha and he says, what happens to an enlightened being after they die and how was the world created and so on? And he says, and if you don't tell me, I'm going to just rope, so there. 
And so it tries to threaten the Buddha that he's going to leave him if the Buddha doesn't answer the questions. 
And so then it's that kind of thing where the Buddha then spells it out. 
I'm not answering these questions. 
I never answer these questions in Malunkya Putta. 
And why don't I? Because these questions don't lead towards liberation. 
So it's more like the sort of mental proliferation around those issues. 
So it's like the speculative, chattering, proliferating mind that he's pointed to discouraging rather than having a goal. 
Because it's certainly directing the mind towards peacefulness, towards realization, towards insight. 
It's a very helpful thing. 
We use goal direction a lot, but you have to use it in a skillful way. 
Okay, thank you. 
Okay, so one more and then we'll carry on with it. 
So this place in Nibbana has not a feeling state connected to it like you wouldn't say it's pleasant. 
You mentioned a little bit prior to this state maybe feeling pleasant. 
So that's one question. 
Is there any feeling state connected to it? The second part of the question is, well, it's a whole different question actually, that the Tibetans talk about the clear light of reality. 
And is that the same thing? Well, actually there is a feeling tone associated with Nibbana. 
And the very final passage in the entire book, the De Numo, our Act 5 Scene 5 is, you can find on page 350. 
And this is talking about, in the Buddha, is talking about an Arahant who's just passed away, Dabba, the Malayan. 
And it says, just as the born is not known of the gradual fading glow given off by the furnace heated iron, as it is struck with the smith's hammer, so too there is no pointing to the born of those perfectly released who have crossed the flood of bondage to sense desires and attained unshakable bliss. 
So that's one of the very few instances where the Buddha talks about someone who's realized Nibbana, like what the experience is like even after the death of the body. 
But in the ordinary situation where the body is still alive and someone realizes Nibbana, then there are phrases used like it's the perfection of happiness or it is complete happiness or it's unshakable bliss. 
And that's the one quote that we use in that particular, which is after Dabba the Malayan has passed away. 
Those kind of qualities are there. 
But it's seen as a kind of happiness that is beyond a kind of worldly pleasure. 
So I'd say ordinary worldly happiness would be getting what you want, that kind of quality. 
But the happiness of Nibbana is the happiness of not wanting anything. 
There is nothing lacking. 
So it's a different kind of quality. 
And Ajahn Buddha Dastar talks about that a lot in his teachings. 
There are two kinds of happiness. 
So it's certainly not less like a blank feeling and that is kind of the most profound contentment and happiness that's there. 
Sometimes we sort of hear a term like coolness or cooling down. 
That's a little bit off-putting. 
But being hot is something that can be admirable or desirable. 
But it's also based on the idea that the Buddhist teachings came from India, which is a land of sizzling heat. 
And so shade and coolness is deeply attractive. 
Which is also something that is pointed out in the chapter Fire, Heat and Coolness, which is the second chapter. 
I said it's important perhaps to bear it, this is page 39. 
The Buddha taught in India that a land of blazing heat and in such environments coolness can easily gather to it an aura of intrinsic goodness and attractiveness. 
This notwithstanding the quest for tapas or spiritual heat. 
In the northern regions where English language originated, warmth takes on a similar aura of desirability. 
The source of oppression and danger is not the merciless sun, but the chill bitterness of winter through the dark, cold and empty desolation as T. 
S. 
Eliot has it in East Cocoa. 
So that kind of, if you bear in mind your own conditioning when we relate to these words. 
Now, speaking of definitions, it's also interesting that Ajahn Tanisaro has pointed out that the physics of fire, as it was understood in India at that time, is also related to the usage of the word nibbana. 
Because the Buddha was the first one to use the word nibbana as an embodiment of the spiritual goal. 
And it's a kind of counterpoint, because the yogis of his time and today, a lot of their ascetic practices and self-mortification was around generating what's called tapas or heat. 
So a yogi or an ascetic is called the tapasin, someone who practices tapas or austerities. 
So you're trying to create this psychic power or this spiritual power that's called heat. 
So the Buddha was being kind of shocking and revolutionary. 
I said, no, no, no, we don't want tapas, we want nibbana. 
And it's a way of catching people's attention. 
And I said, what? None of it heats good. 
He said, no, no, no, coolness. 
We want to cool down. 
And so that that, as a way of getting people's attention to say, look, we've been looking in the wrong direction. 
So this is quotation 2. 
2 that Ajahn Tanisaro cites here. 
Nibbana, which literally means the extinguishing of a fire, derives from the way the physics of fire was viewed at his, the Buddha's time. 
As fire burned, it was seen as a cling to its fuel in a state of entrapment and agitation. 
When it went out, it let go of its fuel, growing calm and free. 
Thus when the Indians of his time saw a fire going out, they did not feel that they were watching extinction. 
Rather, they were seeing a metaphorical lesson in how freedom can be attained by letting go. 
And then the next passage. 
The image of an extinguished fire carried no connotations of annihilation for the early Buddhists. 
Rather, the aspects of fire that to them had significance for the mind-fire analogy are these. 
Fire when burning is in a state of agitation, dependence, attachment and entrapment, both clinging and being stuck to its sustenance. 
Extinguished, it becomes calm, independent, indeterminate and unattached. 
It lets go of its sustenance and is released. 
This same nexus of events applied to the workings of the mind occurs repeatedly in canonical passages describing the attainment of the goal. 
And that's the kind of interesting thing, so it's like the fire element is released from its fuel, and it's also interesting that the word fuel in Pali is upadana. 
And the word for clinging is upadana. 
Exactly, it's not two different words spelled the same, it's the same word. 
So the word for clinging and the word for fuel is the same. 
So when the Buddha uses the word, he was brilliant in his use of language. 
And there's many words that he coined that weren't really in use in the same way before his time. 
And this is one of them. 
So the use of nibbana as a way of embodying the spiritual goal is brilliant, because he had the insight that it's through non-clinging, through letting go, that ultimate spiritual reality is realized. 
And so then he saw it as when there's no more fuel or when the things are not burning, that when the heart is not agitated and inflamed, that's when that truth is realized. 
So he adopted using the word for coolness to point to that process. 
And then seeing the means whereby that was recognized was through non-clinging, through letting go. 
Now another definition, a set of definitions that we have here is a lengthy passage, but I'll read it out because it's Bhikkhu Bodhi being incredibly brilliant, as he almost always is. 
And this is part of his introduction to the Majima Nikaya. 
So this is in, back in chapter one, so this is page 36, 37. 
The state that supervenes when ignorance and craving have been uprooted is called nibbana, Sanskrit nirvana. 
And no conception in the Buddha's teaching has proved so refractory to conceptual pinning down as this one. 
In a way such elusiveness is only to be expected since nibbana is described precisely as, quote, profound, hard to see and hard to understand, unattainable by mere reasoning, unquote. 
Yet in the same passage the Buddha also says that nibbana is to be experienced by the wise, and in the suttas he gives enough indications of its nature to convey some idea of its desirability. 
The Pali Canon offers sufficient evidence to dispense with the opinion of some interpreters that nibbana is sheer annihilation. 
Even the more sophisticated view that nibbana is merely the destruction of defilements and the extinction of existence cannot stand up under scrutiny. 
Probably the most compelling testimony against that view is the well-known passage from the Udana that declares, with reference to nibbana, that, quote, there is an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned. 
The existence of which makes possible escape from the born, become, made, unconditioned. 
The Majima Nikaya characterizes nibbana in similar ways. 
It is the, quote, unborn, unaging, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, undefiled supreme security from bondage, unquote. 
Which the Buddha attained on the night of his enlightenment. 
Its pre-eminent reality is affirmed by the Buddha when he calls nibbana the supreme foundation of truth whose nature is undeceptive and which ranks as the supreme noble truth. 
So there are actually five noble truths. 
Nibbana cannot be perceived by those who live in lust and hate, but it can be seen with the arising of spiritual vision and by fixing the mind upon it in the depths of meditation. 
The disciple can attain the destruction of the taints or the asavas, also variously translated as outflows or corruptions. 
The Buddha does not devote many words to a philosophical definition of nibbana. 
One reason is that nibbana, being unconditioned, transcendent and supramundane, does not easily lend itself to definition in terms of concepts that are inescapably tied to the conditioned, manifest and mundane. 
Another is that the Buddha's objective is the practical one of leading beings to release from suffering, and thus his principal approach to the characterization of nibbana is to inspire the incentive to attain it and to show what must be done to accomplish this. 
To show nibbana as desirable, as the aim of striving, he describes it as the highest bliss, as the supreme state of sublime peace, as the ageless, deathless and sorrowless, as the supreme security from bondage. 
To show what must be done to attain nibbana, to indicate that the goal implies a definite task, he describes it as the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion. 
Above all, nibbana is the cessation of suffering, and for those who seek an end to suffering, such a designation is enough to beckon them towards the path. 
So, well done, Vigubodi. 
I think just that would be enough for the whole day, I think, in some ways. 
And then many of these passages we'll revisit during the course of the day, but I felt that was a really superb synopsis of these main teachings about that and gives also a healthy overview of those different dimensions. 
It also refers to those elements of bliss and happiness. 
I have a question. 
Interesting reference to the fifth of Noble Truth, but how is it different from the third? The cessation of suffering. 
Well, it's sort of an interesting thing to explore in your own meditation. 
Often, dukkha niroda is taken to be synonymous with nibbana. 
And so, really, one way you can read that same passage is saying, actually, that that third Noble Truth is the supreme one. 
So, of the four, you can say that's the supreme one. 
But it's also the only time in that sutta, Majima 140, the exposition of the elements, that's the only time that the Buddha actually refers to nibbana in terms of the four Noble Truths. 
So, it's just a kind of unique little reference that's there. 
But often that dukkha niroda is seen as synonymous with the realising of nibbana. 
There's one way at the back there. 
If you can wait for the microphone. 
Good morning. 
I don't know if this is an aside or it ties in directly with what you're talking about. 
But one of the precepts I get and enjoy from Buddhism is the interconnectedness of things, apparently disparate things. 
When you had us turn to page 350, I noticed on the opposite page there was a quote from Yogi Berra. 
And I never would have imagined a quote from Yogi Berra in a Buddhist book. 
And I'm not sure how many people here are familiar with Yogi Berra, but he was his famous manager for New York Yankees and a player. 
But I think he got the name Yogi from watching cartoons about Yogi the Bear. 
Now it's made me think maybe the word Yogi has something to do with the Buddhist definition of Yogi. 
So it's just struck by the interconnectedness of everything. 
Yes, the universe is filled with strange loops. 
It was actually, it was an afterthought of Ajahn Pasna. 
He thought at the end of all of this philosophy and refinement, that that kind of an observation on life of Yogi Berra, if you don't know where you're going, you'll find out you'll wind up somewhere else. 
If we're indicating that we're now leaving the realm of words behind. 
But it was a nice little sign-off. 
Okay, so let's carry on a little bit. 
And one of the chapters that we, the book is divided into several different chunks. 
So the first part is definitions. 
And then after that we sort of go into the second section, which tries to map out the landscape of the Buddhist approach to the, what do we mean by words like the unconditioned or ultimate reality and what's that referring to. 
So there's the next chapters all referring to that domain, but from slightly different angles. 
So there's the approach of the Buddha in many different circumstances. 
He uses different ways of approaching this area. 
And so one of the principal ones is through the teachings on not-self. 
And so there's a whole chapter here, chapter five, called to be or not to be. 
Is that the question? And so that begins on page 85. 
So there's many teachings in there. 
So I thought in terms of mapping out this terrain, that's a useful area to begin with. 
And so the teachings on not-self, because as everyone here has been involved in practicing Vipassana meditation, insight meditation, you know that this is in a way the main engine of wisdom development in Buddhist practice is exploring the insights into unsatisfactoriness and into uncertainty or change and also to not-self. 
Whereas Dukka and Anicha are unsatisfactoriness or suffering and change, transiency or uncertainty, these are pretty easy tangible concepts to get the mind around the whole realm of not-self. 
And what that means, what the teachings of Anathar refer to, can be a bit of a murky area. 
And again, Ajahn Tanisro has written and has taught a lot on this area very, very helpfully. 
And so some of his teachings on this are extremely brilliant and insightful. 
So I know he's taught here at the Sati Center group many, many times. 
But I'm guessing that you're probably well informed and have a good basis of understanding in this area. 
But I thought with today also you could look at some of the sutra quotations that refer to that same teachings on not-self and how the Buddha really pinpoints this as of all of the different kinds of clinging that obstruct the realization of nirvana, that all the upadhanas that are there, probably the most subtle and tricky is what's called atavad upadana, or the clinging to the concepts and constructions of self, of atta, or atman in Sanskrit. 
So it's the atavad upadana. 
And vada is the same as teravada, like the way of, so it means atavada means like the way of the self, the way of me and mine, following the path of I, me, mine, and that kind of clean. 
So I thought the first passage to look at is page 86 is from again from this sutra, Majima 140, which is an incredibly rich and wonderful teaching. 
That was the one that mentioned the supreme noble truth. 
And this is the Buddha talking to a monk. 
Actually, he's been sharing a comment. 
The Buddha arrived in town late in the evening, didn't have a place to stay, couldn't get to the monastery. 
So he stayed in this, asked to stay in this potter's firehouse, and there was already another yogi, another wanderer, staying there. 
And even though this wanderer thought of himself as a disciple of the Buddha, he didn't actually recognize who it was that came in the middle of the night to share the room with him. 
So they get into this dialogue and so the monk, the Buddha is talking, he doesn't realize that he's actually talking to the Buddha. 
And so the Buddha gives him this really great dhamma talk. 
And it's only back when he's three-quarters of the way through. 
And he's talking very casually to the Buddha, like, oh, hi, buddy, you know, yeah, right. 
And because he thinks of himself as a disciple of the Buddha and he's actually much wiser than his other guy. 
And then about three-quarters of the way through, he realizes, oh, dear, I think I know who I'm sharing this room with. 
So he hits the floor and starts apologizing. 
So this is within that same discourse. 
So this is quotation 5. 
2. 
Bhikkhu, I am is a conceiving. 
I am this is a conceiving. 
I shall be is a conceiving. 
I shall not be is a conceiving. 
I shall be possessed of form is a conceiving. 
I shall be formless is a conceiving. 
I shall be percipient is a conceiving. 
I shall be non-percipient is a conceiving. 
So those latter ones are all about life after death concepts and speculations. 
So different states of post-mortem realms. 
Conceiving is a disease. 
Conceiving is a tumor. 
Conceiving is a barb. 
By overcoming all conceivings, Bhikkhu, one is called a sage at peace. 
And the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die. 
They are not shaken and are not agitated. 
For there is nothing present in them by which they might be born. 
Not being born, how could they age? Not aging, how could they die? Not dying, how could they be shaken? Not being shaken, why should they be agitated? Simple, right? And so this is also another instance where the Buddha is talking about death as not so much as a physical death but a sort of psychological death on birth. 
Also not as a physical birth but as a psychological birth, like being born into some project or some idea or some born into an opinion or something of that nature. 
So it's talking more about that kind of process of buying into things, being born into things and then dying with disappointment or dying on stage. 
And that's kind of psychological ego, what you could call ego death. 
That's one of the instances where he talks in those terms. 
So the qualities of not-self, again, this is an area that there's a lot of misunderstanding or often times people say, well, Buddhists believe that we have no self or no soul. 
It's less common these days. 
But one of the things that Ajahn Tanisro has emphasized very, very hopefully is that, and it's exactly the same way that Ajahn Chah would talk about these principles, is that these are tools that particularly the inside into not-self but also into anicha, into change or uncertainty and into dukkha, unsatisfactionness. 
These are tools which we use to unpick presumptions that we make about life and about who and what we are. 
And so they're not like a belief system in themselves. 
It's not like I believe in dukkha or I believe everything is impermanent. 
I believe I don't have a self. 
Taking this tool, then we examine what the things are that we believe ourselves to be or we pick it up and challenge our assumptions that something is permanent or stable or is predictable and so that they're tools for examining our opinions and habits and patterns of thinking and belief. 
That's what they're for. 
So it's like a set of socket wrenches or kitchen knives and graters and things. 
They're a toolkit rather than a set of beliefs to hang on to. 
And so in that respect, it's supporting what's called wise reflection. 
The Pali is yoniso manasikara. 
And this process or another virtually identical word is dhamma vichaya. 
And so these are extraordinarily important qualities for the development of wisdom. 
So this is the faculty of mind that is able to. 
. 
. 
It's basically the pattern recognition aspect of our mind, seeing what fits in with reality and how things work. 
So dhamma vichaya literally means the investigating reality or investigating the dhamma, the true nature of things. 
Yoniso manasikara means bringing attention to the origin or to the source, attending to the root of things. 
So that these are ways of how does this. 
. 
. 
looking at something like, what's happening here? How does this work? How does A lead to B? What's the connection between C and D? How does this fit together? It's that exploratory, interested, investigative pattern recognizing capacity that we have. 
And so these basic characteristics of existence in Ichiduka Anatar, these are tools to support that quality of investigation. 
That's what they're for. 
That's how they work. 
So it's not just a thing to believe, but a way of picking up our habits of thinking and exploring them and seeing them more clearly like a set of lenses or microscopes or something that we can open things up and examine how they work. 
So when this teacher, when the Buddha says, I am is a conceiving, I am is an affliction and so forth, he's pointing to that way that any. 
. 
. 
if we look at it, we explore, when we examine that, that we see that any possible internal or external qualities that the teacher says, I am a man or I am English or I am American or I am teaching at Sati Center, we see that even matter-of-fact realities like that, that we can see that those are presumptions or they're just half truths or that there can't be any kind of absolute reality to that, their conventions. 
And what is Sati Center? Sati Center has. 
. 
. 
and actually there's also, again, plugging this book endlessly, but there's a. 
. 
. 
I describe an incident where it's in the chapter called the Unconditioned and Nonlocal. 
. 
. 
the Unborn and Nonlocality. 
And it describes an incident that is supposed to be a true event, I'm told, by someone who was a lecturer at an Oxford college and apparently there was an encounter on the street in Oxford where there's a tourist, an American tourist came up to this professorial type, so clutching her map of Oxford and saying, excuse me sir, but can you direct me to the university? I'm here in Oxford, I've been here in Oxford all day, I can't find the university. 
And he said, madam, the university has only metaphysical and not actual existence. 
There is no place where the university is, because Oxford has separate colleges, there actually is no Oxford university as a place. 
There are individual colleges that are scattered all around the town, so you have Somerville College, you have Worcester College, you have Mordling College, you have Balliol College, they all exist and the university is an agreement by all the colleges to call themselves Oxford University. 
And the university issues degrees and the university drafts exam papers, but it doesn't exist in any place. 
So exactly like Sutty Center. 
Sutty Center has only metaphysical but not actual existence. 
Right? Sutty Center uses the IMC building, but it doesn't actually exist in its own, it doesn't have its own place, so it's unlocated, this is very dharmic. 
This is a wonderful example that, and so that Sutty Center is a conceiving, right? QED, it's a conceiving. 
The thing, if we believe that Sutty Center has true and actual permanent existence, we will suffer. 
It's a very convenient agreement, if we didn't have it, we wouldn't be here today. 
It's not saying it's worthless, but it's like when we take a conceiving and we buy into it and say, I am this, this is real, this is absolutely true, this is substantial, then we create the causes of dukkha, because that we're taking a conventional truth and we're imputing, we're imbuing it with more substance and solidity, more absoluteness than it really has. 
We're imbuing it with a reality it can't, a solidity it can't possess, so that when the Buddha is talking about this kind of area, he's saying, look, we use the inside into anathara, look, that when we say, I am a man, or this is Sutty Center, that's a convention, this is a convenient fiction that we use to get through the day. 
When you get to the immigration, or you get stopped by the highway patrol, you don't say to the officer, all dharmas are not self. 
You say, good morning officer, and you hand over your license, which has got a name on it. 
And so one of the interesting things to meditate on in this respect is to use, to investigate this feeling of I am. 
There's different ways of using it, but I'm sure you have your own styles of vipassana practice, but developing this quality of investigation, dhamma vichaya, and so on, you can deliberately investigate this feeling. 
So just when your mind is quite calm and focused, rather than just tracking everything in terms of this is anitra, this is dukkha, this is anathara, and deliberately bringing up the words, I am. 
I am. 
And when you do that, doesn't it feel strange? And even better, if you, in the quietness of your own mind, just say your own name to yourself. 
The quieter the mind is, the more weird. 
The more peculiar your name stands, like Robert. 
What the heck's a Robert? Now, I mean, I'm just conveniently a convenient target, infinitely forgiving, but it's very interesting. 
A word that we use all the time, and maybe even if we've changed our names, the name that we're currently using, use it all the time, who are you, this is who I am, and then we don't realize how much we're concretizing that, but then when you just sort of invited into the space of the mind and you say, this is what I am, without any kind of commentary to it, just that sense of, oh, that's so odd. 
And so it's like a conjuring trick, and that's why the Buddha uses that analogy also. 
It's like a conjuring trick or a mirage. 
It's like, through the sleight of hand, we create ourselves with this personality. 
You know, I'm a monk, or I'm an IT executive, or I'm a yogi. 
I'm a this, I'm a that, and then in that moment, that's who we are. 
But then we forget that this is just fabricated. 
So what the Buddha's pointing to is like, let it be remembered that this is a fabrication. 
So we're not trying to annihilate an already existent self, we're more like just seeing through the conjures trick, and just seeing that who and what we are and what is is actually much bigger and more multi-dimensional than we have actually think things are. 
So that it's rather than just being an interesting teaching, it's when we are able to see that all of these conceivings, and the word for to conceive is manyati, when we see all this manyati as that, then we're able to, in that moment, because even in that part of us that sense of, oh, to our ego that's a bit unsettling, but to the heart itself it's like, oh, the room suddenly got a bit more roomy. 
Somehow I can breathe a bit more easily, oh, life suddenly got a little less burdensome, how strange. 
Does that seem comparable to what you've picked up? That's what I find, and then as the Buddha says, by overcoming all conceivings one is called a sage at peace, and the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die, so that that being in that space of awareness, being that knowing of things rather than identified with, I am this and that is so and so over there, that then we're not born into things, we don't tie our hearts to those changing qualities, and then we don't die with them, we don't die with disappointments and failures, but more we're able to witness things as changing patterns of nature. 
Another very famous verse on this theme is from the Dhammapada, also on page 86, it just kind of follows right along from this, and this is Ajahn Sumaita's favourite passage from the Dhammapada. 
Heedfulness or mindfulness is the path to the deathless, heedlessness is the path to death. 
The heedful never die, the heedless are as if dead already. 
A bit blunt for some, but helpful and liberating in its own right, so when he says that the heedful or the mindful never die, it doesn't mean to say that if you're mindful your body will keep breathing forever, but it's in exactly the same way that that passage about a sage at peace does not age, is not born, does not age, does not die, but it's only the body that is born and ages and dies, or moods are born and they age, they have their pattern and they die. 
If you're not attached to the moods or not attached to the body, then the body can be born and age and die, or moods can come and go, projects can come and go, events can come and go, but if the heart's not tied to them, then there's no quality of burdenness or disappointment associated with that. 
I mean, you don't get the flush of becoming that is the thing that pulls us into birth in the first place, which is the kind of promise that the so-called consumer culture runs on. 
Like, wow, look at that, oh, that's interesting, wow. 
Which we might think, well, what's wrong with that? Especially if you're in advertising, you know, that's not my entire life trying to create that effect in people. 
But that is by following that blindly and being swept up by that, oh, wow, look at that, that's interesting, and then that's the precursor to birth. 
And then there's a certain thrill in that, there's a gratification that comes with that charge of, oh, wow, look at that, oh, look at this, a new one, oh, they've done an upgrade, wow, that's great. 
Windows 7, I hear. 
Wow, that's great. 
And then buying born into it, I think Windows 7 is going to make me totally happy where Vista was deeply disappointing, right? And then, dang, still doesn't quite, I wish it would, well, maybe eight, or nine will do the trick. 
And so, yes, the Buddha pointed out, yes, there is that flush of gratification, there is that zing of, wow, look at that, that's interesting. 
There's what's called asada in Pali, asada is the word for that gratification, yes, that does have a power in us, but also its partner is adinava, which translates as the liability or the downside, so that we're not trying to turn ourselves into sort of emotionally flat data registration units, to sort of just registering the arising and passing of phenomena in a sort of blank and flat, soulless way, but more seeing how when we really bind ourselves to some enthusiasm or some fear or some aversion, some pet peeve, it doesn't have to just be, that zing doesn't just come from what we like, it can come from what we dislike, I mean, nothing like a good enemy, right? Nothing like a good, I mean, George Bush did a really great job being a sort of pet peeve for most people I know. 
He served a great purpose, being someone that people loved to hate, so that charge of becoming has a certain thrill to it, but there's a downside, there's the adinava that comes with that charge, and so that when the Buddha pointed to that, he pointed out how if we're wise, we'll recognize that process and not just blindly get caught in it. 
They've done some experiments in recent years where they wire people up with ECGs and galvanic skin responders and send people on a shopping trip, wired up with these different monitors, and the moment of maximum excitement, and when the endorphins are going at full flush in the system, when there's a moment of maximum happiness, is when you hand over the credit card and just before you get the product that you bought, when you know you're going to get it, but it hasn't quite arrived yet, and when you actually get the product in your hand, already it's a disappointment. 
The endorphins are dropping, and the excitement level is. 
. 
. 
It's the. 
. 
. 
That's the kick, that's the thing that drives the whole consuming system. 
So the Buddha said, get familiar with this, see how this works, and so the ayam, it's using a bit of a different language, but that ayam is a tumor, ayam is a dart, it's kind of being shot with a poison arrow, it's kind of blunt or aggressive language in some ways, but it's pointing out, yeah, that's. 
. 
. 
we get addicted to that same kind of pull, that thrill, because in that moment, ayam, this thing, I'm going to get this new tushiba, this new product, this new thing, I'm going to get to. 
. 
. 
Nibbana, you know, we get cranked up on that, and then that is the precursor to birth, and then birth leads to the inevitable end of death, psychological death, so that when we are recognizing that process and we're able to step back from that, then as we see those qualities of interest or enthusiasm, then we keep that. 
. 
. 
when there is mindfulness, when there is a true heedfulness, that mindfulness that's really aware of the situation, then we can go along with the things that we need to do and we can acquire the things that are useful, but we're not getting bored into them, and we can lose the things that we love or things fall apart, they can go, but we don't find ourselves totally bereft and broken-hearted when they go, it's like, oh, that was sweet. 
Now it's a memory, okay, and so it goes, so that it's not an emotional flatness, but in a mysterious way, it's actually like an emotional maturity, so that we are fully feeling the qualities of life, but there's a profounder appreciation, a kind of more fundamental happiness, so that even though there's a bitter experience, there's something that's just fallen apart or someone that we know has just passed away, or it's just some kind of painful experience, but even in its passing, that has to be recognized as well, it had to go one day or it was sweet and now it's over, that we're able to tap into, yes, this is how life is, how could it be otherwise? And there's that, the profound happiness of that, the rightness of that, or the basic orderliness of that, yeah, this is how nature works, how could it be otherwise? So it's that kind of basic richness that we're able to tap into, so it's important to realize that with these teachings on Nibbana, we're not just trying to make ourselves into a kind of non-responsive numb, it's not like the development of numbness, and trying to truly nullify our lives, it's not it at all, it's the opposite, and then it works in a mysterious way, that you can both experience the quality of peacefulness and clarity in Nibbana, even when there's a painful experience happening, you can have a physical pain, or some kind of emotional pain, but there can still be that basic quality of peace and clarity and a heart free from contention with that. 
Does that make sense? Yes. 
I'm afraid it doesn't make sense to me. 
I think that while you were saying that, I was thinking of this, an android called Theta, which was very popular in Star Trek, and he was someone who would fit into your pattern quite well, because he realized all the logical inroads and outroads of all the things you were saying, but he didn't really get upset about it, and he was able to function even in the presence of great emotions both ways. 
So I think that some of the things you might be asking for us to feel all the great positive things and the great negative things, and still somehow just kind of let them all go, even if it's great grief or great pleasure, it seems a bit contradictory to me. 
It seems that you're asking, even though we are humans, not dogs or cats, and we know that, I think, you're asking, I feel that it's too much to ask of a human being to be able to do those things that you just got through asking, my own health base, am I wrong? Well, on one level it is too much to ask, and that's why the Buddha, his first thought after his enlightenment was, there's no point trying to convey this, because he thought, this goes so completely against the stream of our ordinary everyday thinking, but then he was persuaded, well, for the sake of those who have a little bit of dust in their eyes. 
So it is difficult to understand, but also it's a thing that we can get a feel for in ourselves, just in the meditation. 
Also, I'm just reminded of a verse of William Blake's where he says, and you have to excuse the gender bias language, he who binds himself to a joy doth the winged life destroy, he that kisses a joy as it flies lives in eternity's sunrise. 
It's missing the joy as it flies, so it's that binding our self to a joy. 
It's a very human habit, it might seem like, yeah, but I love the tear, I mean, I want to weep, and I want to get really excited, and I want to weep, and not being that way is somehow kind of non-human, and I'm not belittling that or negating that, because that's very natural for us to feel in that way, and for many of us that's where we felt most alive, or most deeply connected with life and the world. 
It's in those times of intense contact, it might seem like we're just trying to push that away or negate that, but it's a mysterious thing, it's like the more that you truly let go of that quality of identification and entanglement, then it's mysterious, but the more fully identified with it, you find yourself to be. 
It's like, because of one friend of ours, I remember him, he quoted it back to me that I'd said it, I don't actually remember saying it, but I remember he told me I'd said it, was that when we're following the practice, because we love the world so much, we let go of it completely, and it's paradoxical, but it's also when we are in meditation or in our clearest moments, we can see for ourselves, there's a sense that when there's a complete openness to the situation and no reservation on our part, then we find ourselves attuned to others, and attuned to our own inner nature in a way that we aren't, when we're swept up in a kind of more reactive or entangled mode, and I can only describe that in words, but it's more helpful maybe in meditation and using those quiet times to look at that and to notice for ourselves that in our moments of deepest qualities of attunement, then there is an unclutteredness, a naturalness that's there, that is really the essence of that, what I mean by non-attachment. 
I'm not attempting to make you feel different, but I can't change your experience, but that's how I find it for myself, and that it's not trying to just be a data reception unit, but actually there's a mysterious way, but in a way you can only get a sense of it around people who manifest that, and so like my teacher Ajahn Chah, there was times when you'd see him, and there'd be some person who'd come and they'd be describing some kind of terrible experience in their family, some terrible crisis, and they're very upset, and they'd be telling him the account of it, and so part of him you could see was being very sort of cult-consoling and warm and compassionate, and part of him was extremely still, it was incredibly calm, but also you couldn't tell whether he was laughing or crying. 
He was like, how's he feeling? Is he just crying because they're upset, or is he actually laughing, or what's going on there? But when you let yourself just pay attention, you could see he was actually being all of those things. 
He was both completely unshaken in himself, but also totally responding to the person that was there. 
He was feeling compassion for their suffering and their difficulty, but he wasn't getting wrapped up in it, and so you try and sort of pin down the expression on his face, and you couldn't quite pin it down, and you realize you can't pin it down as a concept, but when we are fully open-hearted in that way, then we both experience that strength of feeling that goes with the moment, both the rejoicing or the sadness that it's there, and we also experience the kind of absurdity of it, and also the naturalness of it, that how painful that we get caught up in such things and get carried away on how utterly human it is to be so completely involved, it's like this. 
And there's a kind of embodiment of that quality. 
There's really beyond words, and so that's why having a study day on Nibbana is tricky, because it's pointing to a wordless quality of achievement that enables us to respond to life in different ways. 
You have to follow up a little in this gentleman's comment. 
In the latest issue of the Inquiring Mind, Les Nisker has his usual article where he talks about the firsters and the thirders, where he talks about how many people in the practice are really in the practice as a way of working with the first noble truth, the truth of suffering, which is getting our lives together and working in a way where we're not quite so caught up in all our stuff, and he describes himself as a firster. 
He also describes what's called the thirders, which are people who are really looking for some kind of transcendent experience and some kind of understanding of this coolness and this kind of. 
. 
. 
He's describing a different kind of relationship to the practice. 
Do you have any kind of comments on that? Have you read the article? I did, yes. 
Yeah, Wes' column is the one I always read in Inquiring Mind. 
You can quote me on that. 
Yeah, I thought it was quite insightful. 
He has a very accurate vision in many ways of how the world works. 
I think the Buddha taught four noble truths for a purpose. 
I think in a way we need four. 
I appreciated Wes' perspective that you can maybe divide people into those patches in different zones or different styles. 
But in order for the process to work, I think we need all four, and that we will have tendencies to dwell upon the one or the other, and that if you're a thirder, you might want to not really bother with number one and just go straight to transcendence, and if you're a firster, you might want to. 
. 
. 
You're really enjoying your wallowing. 
But the Buddha taught the four noble truths in that format because it's mapped onto a traditional Indian form of medical diagnosis. 
The precursor of Ayurveda used the same format. 
So you start off with the symptom, dukkha. 
That's the nature of the ailment. 
Then the second one is the cause. 
What's caused the ailment? The third one is the prognosis. 
Is it curable or not? And then the fourth one is the treatment. 
And so he shows that format as an approach, so that if you're going for a medical, and then all you get is the, well, let's just really spend all our time looking at the symptom and paying attention to the symptom, then it's. 
. 
. 
or let's just worship the idea of a possibility of a cure, then you're missing the point in both those respects and that you need both the diagnosis, the cause of the illness, the prognosis, and then the main thing is the treatment. 
The fourth truth is, in a way, in terms of a treatment, that's the main thing. 
But the third truth is the possibility of health. 
That's what it's aimed towards, is the state of well-being. 
And so the Buddha just mapped that medical format onto the spiritual malaise of dukkha. 
That kind of internal and mental illness. 
Well, I think he's talking about things in terms of people's emphasis on what they're looking for. 
To work with the first noble truth, you need to work the path as well. 
But I think it's coming. 
. 
. 
I'm thinking about this as I speak, I think it's coming from a different orientation of getting our lives together and having this idea of nirvana as an experience, whether it's momentary or for an hour or for the rest of your life, and working more toward that. 
I think people are working with Janas, if it's important for people to focus on working with Janas, I think they're moving more toward that experience of the openness and that kind of oneness and absolute reality, whatever you want to call it. 
But yeah, of course, it takes the four noble truths to work through them all. 
I can't say I remember in detail what was in ways I did read it. 
I can't say I remember in detail exactly how I put it. 
But to me, it's also having. 
. 
. 
One of the aims or hopes for today is to get a sense of. 
. 
. 
Yeah, this is something worth nirvana, something worth understanding and worth aiming for, because we don't have much of a language of defining that well-being. 
It's one of these mind and life conferences with the Dalai Lama. 
I think as Alan Wallace pointed out, that in the DSM for the Diagnostic Manual, that you have two-and-a-half thousand pages of ailments and a half a page on well-being. 
The concept of health is very good, very good on ailment. 
And so there's a culture. 
And the Dalai Lama says, oh, this is very strange. 
But having a sense and getting a feeling for what is the state of spiritual well-being when the heart is really in tune with reality, what is that? How do we feel that? What's that experience? And then you can take some of the ideas of talking about coolness or about non-entanglement, and the words carry certain associations with them, and we ascribe to them certain qualities. 
But the experience of that might be very, very different. 
And so what I hope to with today is to get a sense for encouraging people to explore, well, what is it that I'm working towards, to relate to these qualities that Buddha is talking about and all these teachings, this aspect of nibbana, of a deep coolness and clarity within ourselves. 
Why is that so valuable? Why would he highlight that as the goal of all spiritual development, the pinnacle of spiritual development? Why would he characterize it in that way? And to have that as an impetus for investigating, looking at that and saying, what am I really doing this for? Yeah, I'd really like to come to IMC and hang out with these people. 
I see it makes my life a bit better, but what am I aiming towards? And then clarifying that goal and then seeing whereby that goal can be arrived at, then that helps us along the way. 
If we don't really have a clear goal or a sense of what we're aiming for, then it's hard to know whether we're following the right signs or not. 
I mean, that's what Yogi Berra said. 
If you don't know where you're going, you might end up somewhere else.
