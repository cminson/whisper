The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So warm greetings to everyone and today I'm going to mark the 40th anniversary of
having been ordained as a Zen priest. So it's a little pause in our series on
Satipatana and it's a I feel very kind of fortunate to certainly to reach this
40th anniversary and spent these 40 years in the Dharma and practicing and
teaching but also the fact that I'm here at Insight Retreat Center is also very
special that this also is a part of the wonderful Dharma life that I've been
able to be graced by or blessed by that to have this wonderful retreat center
that to practice in and be on retreat in and to teach in to be able to open the
doors of the center to so many people to come and practice here and then
coincidentally the reason I'm here is that we have a two-day
retreat for our teacher training. IMC started its very own teacher training
back in April and in the past people who got trained in our tradition kind of
got trained through Spirit Rock or Insight Meditation Center and so here
they started our own training for 15 people and it's kind of special to
kind of a culmination of 40 years of Dharma practice more than 40 years 45
years or more that come to the wonderful circumstance of training others to be
full teachers and so all this came together being at IRC my anniversary of
my ordination and teacher training that I feel so fortunate to be able to do so
I wanted to market so 40 years ago I was ordained with two other Zen students
Victoria Austin and Gary McNabb and I felt very fortunate to know them both
and both of them dedicated their life to the practice for then their case Zen
practice and and the life of what became a priest and I say became because at
the San Francisco Zen Center where I was ordained at at the time my ordination
it was called a monk ordination and the word monk being used both for male and
female and to a monastic ordination and that's what I thought I was doing was
ordaining as a monk and I knew that it was you know there was a track to become
a teacher someday but there were so many other monks priests ordained people at
Zen Center when I was there that I calculated that it'd be something like
25 years before my turn to move up into even just the very beginning teaching
roles or to be trained as a teacher but I wasn't I wasn't being ordained to be a
teacher was ordained to be a monk and to my surprise a few months after I was
ordained the abbot decided that to stop calling the ordination a monk
ordination monastic ordination but rather a priest ordination and maybe
partly because in traditionally in Buddhism monastics are celibate and in
Japanese Soto Zen there's no rule of celibacy so there can be marriage and
sexual relationships and maybe that's one of the reasons but also there's a
way in which the Zen priest is a life it's a little bit of life that's in the
world in all kinds of ways and participating in all the different
aspects of life and in a way that sometimes traditional bhikkhus monastics
hold themselves a little bit apart from the world and participating in like a
small example would be that monastics are not allowed to marry people and Zen
priests are so it kind of represents a little bit that's that distinction and
but what it represents for me this ordination and is that one of the things
is that every time that I in my life and my adult life where I chose the dharma
that I chose the dharma practice over any other possibilities that it always
worked out fantastically wonderfully I could never have imagined how well it
was going to work out and and there even times where I had almost no money and
living a poor life and it's a practitioner and where I thought the
reasonable thing to do was to go find work and and but I was it no no I you
know even had a job lined up once and then I said nope that's not what I'm
dedicated to my life is dedicated to the practice and and come what may that's
what I'm going to do and so and then periodically you know it just became
clear that this dharma path was opening up in front of me the decision to
become a monastic to be ordained wasn't exactly a conscious decision or reason
decision I was sitting at the monastery looking at the creek that runs
through it and reflecting about my life and what I should do with it and what
direction to go and and there was like a lightning went through my body and
suddenly I just knew that I was going to be ordained and generally I'm a person
who does things for reasons and kind of a rational person perhaps tried to be or
something and and so then afterwards I thought of reasons for that and the
reasons were sincere but the the decision was not reasoned it was just a
deep knowing like suddenly I just knew that this is what I was doing and one
of the reasons I gave myself was ahead was that I wanted to live a life that
responded to the suffering of the world at the deepest place of suffering and
the only thing that I knew in life up to that point that somehow was able to
touch the deepest places of suffering in myself and in other people was Buddhist
practice I didn't necessarily think that that was the only way to do it but
that's the only thing that I knew and I wanted to dedicate my life to responding
to suffering at its deepest level I was going to I was going to go back to go
to graduate school to study soil conservation and I wanted to go support
and help the world by you know doing erosion control in different places in
the world where there was a real serious problem and but I felt that somehow
there was something inside of me that as important as that work would it would
have been it wouldn't have reached into the depth of the human heart to where
suffering really lies at the core and I didn't know if I'd be effective as a
someone who somehow touched that and people or supported people to but I
wanted to be in an environment that that's what the environment is for and
just support it and my image of my long-term image of myself with as a Zen
priest was to have a little neighborhood storefront meditation center just a
little maybe a one-room storefront kind of thing and my job was to open had the
key keep the place clean and open up and allow people come and meditate and that
was a you know that was kind of what I wasn't much more thoughtful about what
I was going to do in the long term than doing that but then I had this
wonderful life of things just kept unfolding after I was ordained and even
things that were tragic for many people somehow kept opening up to you know
going further and further in the practice and the tragic thing was that
the abbot of the Zen Center had an abbot's ethical scandal and he left
and it was devastating to many people but I was invited by someone to go to
Japan and my father actually he was working in Japan he said when you want
to come to Japan and and just coincident it was coincidental with
this the abbot's leaving and I said oh sure I'd like to continue my Zen
training in Japan and and so then I went to Japan for a while but in order to
stay in Japan I had to go to Thailand to get a new visa and in Thailand I
discovered this practice we do here vipassana practice and that opened up
wonderfully for me and that then it continued for a while this dual track
of both Zen and vipassana and that's still a dual track and the Zen is very
important for me still it's a kind of orientation or provides kind of a
fundamental I don't know religious orientation for myself and and it's an
orientation of participation in the world of being fully present in this
world practicing in the world and and as a place to be free and then the
vipassana practice is equally deep and valuable for me and and that is a practice
of
deconstructing the world in a very deep way to discover the deeper potential
capacities we have for freedom and this wonderful synergy of these two of vipassana
allowing for a really a depth of deconstruction of seeing through the
conditional world the conditioned world that we live in and the constructed
world and really open up to greater and greater capacities for freedom and then
and then learning participation learning to give yourself to the world be
enter the world and and participate with that freedom one of the teachings or
ideas in Zen that was very influential on me was the idea that we express our
practice that practice our understanding the depth of our practice within us how
we mature in the practice is something not just to kind of be in enlightened
retirement but it's something that is expressed or enacted or and the there was
this person many years ago who heard all these Buddhists kept talking about
practice practice practice practice what kind of practice do you do I'm going to
retreat to practice I'm practicing the word practice is used very very quickly
and a lot in our scene and the person heard all this and he said you guys all
you ever talk about is practicing when's the performance and so is and the
idea that it's you're you're lit you live the life of the performance so it's
how you enact how you express your understanding that is the fulfillment of
it and and and for me they to the combination that the vipassana teaching
freedom and Zen teaching living that in our life that's a dual and that for me
that was this dual tracks that were so important and it's not inherent that one
is just one way and one is the other way just that's the way that these two
lessons came through to me and I'm very grateful for it and I feel so fortunate
to be able to live this Dharma life and and find my practice in everything I do
and you know so I have this fortune of being able to teach like teach here to
all of you on YouTube and which is a kind of little bit of a manifestation of
my practice but it comes around is that it's also the place that I want when I'm
teaching it's also the place where I practice it isn't that this is only an
expression of whatever practice I have but it also I see it as this is the
location there for practice when I'm teaching so I'm tracking myself and
noticing what's happening inside of me and my thoughts my feelings my body kind
of being present for the whole show so that so that it is a practice them
tracking myself and mindful of what's happening so that I keep discovering
more freedom or more depth or more fullness more participation more getting
out of the way of this life so and someone I saw in the chat earlier asked
me for my what my Zen name is by ordination name it in Japanese it's a
Japanese name Ryuge Kojun spelled R-Y-U-G-E and it's one word in the second
word is Kojun K-O-J-U-N and the way that the Abba to gave me the name he
translated it as a dragon tusk sunlight revere and so one of those names is
supposed to represents how you are when you're ordained and the other is
supposed to represent your potential what you can become so I don't know
which is which but it's kind of a little bit of a nice I hopefully nice
pairing these two words ideas dragon tusk sounds a little bit ferocious and so
I maybe I'm a little bit dangerous and but then the sunlight revere and so that
that was the name I was given and my Pali name you know you get lots of names
in Buddhism sometimes and my Pali name for this in the Theravada
and Vipassana world where I teach is dhamma dasa and that means a servant of
the Dharma so both the Zen ordination and being a Zen priest and being a Vipassana
teacher and practitioner I feel very much that I'm a servant for the Dharma and
I love serving it and supporting it and letting it grow in our hearts and and
spreading across the lands so thank you so then tomorrow I'll be back at IMC and
we'll continue with the Satipatana.
