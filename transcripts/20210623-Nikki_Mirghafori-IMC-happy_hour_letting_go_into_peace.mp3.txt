 Okay, great. So, hello and formally welcome to this edition of Happy Hour. So for today's practice, my invitation is to explore letting go, letting go as a way to make space, to make space for more peace, for more love, for more space within, letting go of what is not necessary in the moment, what is extra, and there is so much extra, often, both internally and externally. Internally, often many thoughts, many self judgments, criticisms, you should do this, you shouldn't do that, just all extra, so much reactivities, just extra, extra, it's not needed. What is extra? Can it be, just put down. So for that, we need to notice it with mindfulness, with awareness, and simply putting it down. And by putting it down, then we can notice, oh, there's more space for silence, for peace, for goodness, for love, for care, for nurturing, for nourishment. So making space for love, making space for love by letting go. And before we start, I'd like to share a quote by a john some made up. And the quote is is longish one and a funny one. And paste, cut and paste the resource. It's here we go. And later, this is especially for Neil, who's going to be thank you, Neil, for sharing for finding it later and sharing it with the Sangha in the Google groups. But here we go. So here's the quote. So I john some made up who is a monastic in the Turavada tradition in the Ajahn Chah forest forest practice. So he says, the practice of letting go is very effective for minds obsessed by compulsive thinking. You simplify your meditation practice down to just two words, letting go rather than try to develop this practice and then develop that and achieve this and go into that and understand this and read the suttas and study the Abhidharma and then learn Pali and Sanskrit, then the Madhyamika and the prasanaparamita get ordination in the Hinayana Mahayana Vajrayana, write books become a world renowned authority on Buddhism, instead of becoming the world's expert on Buddhism and being invited to great international Buddhist conferences. Just let go, let go, let go. I did nothing but this for about two years, every time I tried to understand or figure things out. I'd say, let go, let go until the desire would fade out. So I'm making it very simple for you to save you from getting caught in incredible amounts of suffering. There is nothing more sorrowful than having to attend international Buddhist conferences. Some of you might have the desire to become the Buddha of the age, Maitreya radiating love through the world. But instead, I suggest just being an earthworm, letting go of the desire to radiate love throughout the world. Just be an earthworm who knows only two words, let go, let go, let go. You see, ours is the lesser vehicle, the Hinayana. So we only have the simple poverty stricken practices. So it definitely has a sense of humor. So let go, simple practice, simple practice of letting go, making space, making space for peace, ease, love, letting go of whatever is extra. You think it's simple tonight. So with that, I'd like to invite you to get into meditation posture, whatever it is, comfortable, supportive, nourishing for you in this moment, sitting or lying down. And letting go, letting go. Whatever is extra, whatever is not needed. Letting go of any tension or holding in your head and your forehead, your face, behind the eyes, letting go of any tension in your jaw, muscles of the face, releasing. What is extra? Let go of any tension in your chest. Let go of any tension in your chest. Let go of any tension in your chest. Let's go back to neck and shoulders. Yes, neck and shoulders. Releasing, releasing the arms, the hands, letting go of their weight, letting gravity, support, pull down the arms and hands. Releasing any tension in the chest. Inviting your heart to relax, heart center, the proverbial space of emotions. Releasing any tension. Ah, tightness in the belly. Lower abdomen, sit bones, releasing tightness, letting go. Ah, any holding in the upper legs, knees, lower legs and feet. Letting gravity support the entire weight of the legs, the sit bones. Letting the body be breathed naturally on its own, with each breath. Letting go of any tension in your chest. Letting go of whatever is extra in this moment, the tension in the body, tightness, any muscles, extra, not needed. The natural state of this human body, heart and mind is of profound peace, clarity. And if thoughts, preoccupations, anything that comes up that's not needed in this moment as you give yourself wholeheartedly to this practice. Notice what's arisen. This is needed right now. This is really needed right now. This is needed at all. Simply let go. Then notice what opens up, what happens when letting go, when something is let go of. Then turn your awareness to the space and the heart and mind and body that opens up. Notice if there's more peace, more freedom, more ease, more space to love, to be, to care, to be still. Self-care, self-love in the stillness. Whoa. you Mindfully notice what's extra Let go Let go and notice what opens up mindfully What is here when what is extra not needed is let go of a simple practice Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love Let go of the foundation for more peace, self-care and love
