 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Just to offer a few opening remarks tonight. So the Buddha and his teachings in the early Buddhist tradition at Insight Meditation Center tends to adhere to. He often refers to the process of practice as cultivation. In fact, that's one of the translations for the Pali word Bhavana, which also translates as meditation. And one of the themes that runs throughout early Buddhism and the later kinds of Buddhism as well is this notion of planting seeds and of cultivating them and of the flower and fruit as practice matures. So we can plant and cultivate those seeds in ourselves. Others can plant seeds in us, society can, family can, and we can plant seeds in others around us. And tonight I want to talk a little bit about, or actually read a poem about planting seeds of kindness. Planting seeds of kindness. This is a poem by Rosemary Watula of Trauma. And it's entitled Kindness. Consider the tulip. How long ago someone's hand planted a bowl and gave to this place a living scrap of beauty. How it rises every spring out of the same soil, which is of course, not at all the same soil, but new. Consider the six red petals. The yellow at the center. The soft green rubber of the stem. How it bows to the world. And how the longer you sit beside the tulip, the more you want to bow to. It is this way with kindness. Someone plants and someone else a bit of beauty. A kind word perhaps, or a touch. The gift of their time or their smile. And years later, in that inner soil, that beauty emerges again. Pushing aside the dead leaves, insisting on loveliness. A celebration of the one who planted it. The one who perceives it. And the fertile place where it has grown. So, talking about our inner soil, our inner receptivity, impressionability of the kind acts of others. And I'd like to invite each of us to consider some of the seeds of kindness. Little acts of kindness. Large ones that you've received in others. Maybe from one other. We'll start with the benefactor from. And the other invitation is to consider some of the many kindnesses, large or small, that each of us have planted in other people. And that's what I'm going to consider almost any of us have. This can be as small as a smile to a stranger or as large as you can imagine. No scale is a problem. With that notion, I'm going to for now make it to where you cannot unmute just in case people come in late and are rustling their phones or their devices. And invite you to settle back. Before we go completely into meditation mode, I just want to check how is the volume for people. Good. Okay, great. So, invitation is to settle back into a comfortable alert posture. If you want to turn off your camera, please feel free. You can also turn aside from the screen if you've seen too much of screens today. All of course stay on. And start by taking one or two intentional breaths, perhaps a little longer or slower than you might in daily life. Be sighing out, breathing out any excess tension, excess energy that it took to get to this point in your day. By setting the intention, the resolve, to be with whatever comes up with as much kindness, gentleness, graciousness as is possible. You don't need to make anything happen, but to cultivate the intention of kindness and gentleness. Now noticing your body, your whole body, perhaps by sweeping your attention through from the crown of the head, down through the neck, shoulders, chest, back, core. Inviting your upper body to soften. Noticing your hip points, lower back, or whatever part of you is resting comfortably on a surface, maybe a chair, a cushion, even a bed. Now feeling of being held by the earth, and then including the legs, upper legs, knees, lower legs, ankles, feet, and inviting tension to drain out of them. Releasing, and then allowing awareness to fill your whole body. All of the pulsing and tingling, contraction or relaxation, vibration of aliveness inside and the contact of air or clothing and skin on the outside. And then settling the attention, gently, lovingly, on the breath, or whatever anchor of attention you know works for you. Noticing the sensations of the in-breath and out-breath, perhaps by the rising and falling of your belly or chest, perhaps by the coolness of air becoming breath at the tip of an ounce, and the warmth of breath returning to air. Let me exhale, resting on this rhythmic, wave-like motion of breathing. And appreciating all the little differences in each breath. Maybe one is deeper than the one after it. Or maybe there's a little bit of pleasure at the beginning of the breath. A little bit of extra relaxation at the end of the exhale. If extraneous thoughts or sensations come along, acknowledging them with respect and inviting them to fade to the background or the periphery, returning the attention to this moment here. Thank you. Perhaps if the attention is settling a little bit, inviting the deeper sense of being in this body, noticing the quality of this heart and mind, exactly as is. Whatever it is, it's okay. Welcome. Welcome here. And now gathering the attention in the center of your chest or the area around your heart, however you define the heart center, the seat of the emotional life in your being. And calling to mind someone who's easy to feel good about, someone who can bring a smile to your heart and your lips. It could be a person, an animal. It could be some other kind of being that fits into your religious tradition if you have one. Someone from whom, a being from whom you've received some kind of kindness, maybe more than one, but at least one, large or small. And feeling how it feels to acknowledge that kindness. Perhaps with a sense of gratitude or reciprocity or tinker-return-kindness. Breathing in a sense of this other one. Breathing out good wishes, whether they be gratitude, kindness, generosity, any kind of good wishes. Breathing in, appreciating the kindness of this other one. Receiving, remembering. Breathing out good wishes. If it fits with this other one, intentionally recalling any acts of kindness or gratitude or generosity, you've offered them or on their behalf. And breathing with that too. And then as if they're beside you or nearby, perhaps seeing yourself through their eyes, recalling any acts of kindness you have offered more broadly. Maybe in the last of a while, minor ones, or maybe a big one comes to mind. Anything as small as opening a door, as large as changing life. Breathing in, soaking in this sense of your own kindness, offerings. Breathing out kindness towards this other one or towards whomever it's been offered. Breathing out kindness towards this other one. Allowing the sense of receiving and offering kindness to saturate through this body, this heart, through the organs and viscera, the torso, through the bones and skin and cells of the body. Radiating it outwards and receiving it from this dear one or from others. And if it's helpful to focus these good intentions. Please feel free to use words or phrases of your own devising in your own language at your own pace. And I will offer a few here. The invitation is to build a rhythm with them, even a rhythm with the breath if you like. May you be safe from inner and outer harm. May you be happy. May you heal and be healthy. May you be peaceful. May you be free. Be safe. Be happy. May you heal. Be peaceful. Be free. Perhaps imagining you in this benefactor, offering these wishes both to each other and to a broader community of beings. Maybe those you've received kindness from or offered kindness to, or just those nearby. One to run across in your day. Be safe. Love be peaceful. Be free. Thank you. Thank you. From time to time, noticing the effect of these intentions on the body and the breath. Perhaps intentionally radiating the sense of breathing through the body, kindness through your body. Meaning whatever's there. And then renewing, generating these kind wishes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now allowing a circle of recipient kindness to expand. above and below, around, to everywhere, in all directions, shining out like sunlight, or perhaps nourishing the soil of this body and heart and mind and all others in its path like rain. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In the last moments of this meditation, releasing any visualizations or phrases, just being, breathing, perhaps savoring, or kindly being with whatever is flowing through this body, heart, and mind in this moment. Thank you. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. Now, this has become the custom that I teach here. The invitation is to take a little time to send kindness, metta, to all of your fellow meditators in this Zoom room, seen and unseen. You can, if you like, turn your video on, you'll know that people have a face to send it to, but it's just fine if you leave it off. Just sending, looking through and sending kindness, knowing that as you are sending those kind wishes, you're receiving them from everyone else here. May the goodness of this Sangha spread to those who are not here, listening later, who have come in the past or who have come in the future. Thank you for that. So, we open up the floor to any questions or comments, responses to the practice tonight. Any reflections from anyone? Just thinking about the virtue of this traveling out to our loving kindness, traveling out beyond our Sangha, and to the greater world. I heard a quote today that said, there was the scent of virtue travels upwind. Nice, nice. I haven't heard that exact quote before, that's beautiful. They do say that in the suttas and the discourses that virtue does have a pleasant scent to it. I love this idea of a traveling upwind. May it travel upwind more often? Could you repeat that for me? I couldn't hear it very well. The scent of virtue travels upwind. Thank you. Any other reflections or questions? Stumbling blocks are also welcome. Yeah, it's Fred Satterberg. Yeah, to Fred's tonight. Great. Doesn't happen. I was just taken with the nature of reciprocity, as you were suggesting. I've had friends here this week, old friends, who were really deeply helpful and loving with my wife in her last couple of years. And now one of them is quite ill. And as her husband says, well, we take turns taking care of each other at this time of life. And that's really been my experience with them, that being a great model for how I might live, how we might live. And you've put it in the frame of the practice and the language and the thoughts to keep that present with many people will come upon for the rest of our lives. Thank you. Thank you, Fred. That's a beautiful reflection. It's very touching to hear. Yeah. Yeah, we take care of each other as best we can. Right. Any other last comments, reflections before we move into the smaller discussion groups, people who want to be in those. Again, I'll just read the last part of this form by Rosemary Trauma. It is this way with kindness. Someone plants and someone else a bit of beauty. A kind word perhaps or a touch. The gift of their time or their smile. Years later, in that inner soil, that beauty emerges again. So, I'm going to create some optional breakout rooms. And those of you who want to participate, please do if you don't you can stay in the main room. The invitation tonight is to talk about whatever feels up for you in this practice but perhaps along this theme of the benefits and or challenges of giving and receiving kindness in your life. How it's helped you. How it might support you. Any challenges you have with it. So I'm creating these to probably have about three people in them. If there's some that don't seem balanced, I may shuffle you around in the next first minute or so. Okay. Enjoy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sure everyone else will be popping back in in just a moment or two. Welcome back, everyone. So I'm curious, any thoughts based on those conversations that you want to share Neil. Hi. So we talked about how you say thank you for your sincerity at the end of the practice. You know, and, you know, it just means so much to all of us. You know, yeah, you know, like, it just doesn't matter what happened. You know, right, which of course is, you know, frequently I hear you know it's the intention not the outcome, but, you know, it's just a one way. It's just a wonderful reminder. Thank you. That's beautiful. Yeah. And, you know, I didn't have this in mind when I say it because I'm just so touched and moved by the sincerity of doing this practice, but just inspires me that people want to cultivate these intentions in their hearts. It's beautiful, right. And I'm remembering a quote I've heard Suzuki Roshi say the founder of San Francisco Zen Center and various seemed to teacher. Someone asked him if I do this practice will I get enlightened. And he said, if you practice sincerely that almost just good. Almost just good. So, say it to all of you, be practice sincerely it's very good. Anybody else. Sign in with a comment or question. Hi. We talked about the little things, you know, that we do every day it's not those grand things that we do. It's the little things that same soil, but, you know, just the little things that we do throughout the day, the market, or, you know, walking down, and do quite a bit of walking, just a smile to someone it's, you know, and I think that just cultivates that loving kindness that it's always there, doesn't go anywhere. And you can share it anytime. So, it was just the little things and it was sweet how we when we were in our breakout room how it was shared. So yeah, so thanks. Thank you for always. Yes, including all of us together it's, it's very endearing. So thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Makes me happy to hear you talk about the little things. We never know those little things might not be so little to someone. Might be the only smile they get that day. Anybody else, we've got just a minute or two left, but I'm about to hear any other thoughts or questions. Silence is also fine. I'm just going to dedicate the merit. Thank you again for the sincerity of your practice. May all beings everywhere, no a sense of kindness and compassion. May all beings experience love, belonging, healing, safety, and freedom. Be well good people. Feel free to unmute yourselves and say goodbye if you like. Thank you, Fred. Good night all. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody. Thanks everybody. Bye. Bye. Bye, Fred. Bye. Neil, everyone. Take care of Diana. Bye.
