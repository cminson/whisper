 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome everyone, and thank you for being here. As we train our minds by practicing meditation, we're not looking for some special experience, but rather we're putting in place wholesome tendencies of the mind, wholesome conditions, so that we can open up and greet our experience in a way that is liberating, rather than stuck and reactive. So, as you know, this is a gradual path, and we begin by accepting and getting to know who we are. And our theme for this week, Opening the Dharma Heart, to me that means learning to trust what the present moment is offering us, without needing to change how things are in order to be okay. And for those of us who have been conditioned by trauma, it can be that trusting anything can be quite a tall order. So, let's begin our meditation by formulating our intention, the idea that motivates us to practice. On Monday I shared with you my personal intention, which is, may I be a safe haven of kindness and emptiness for all beings everywhere. So, take a moment now to formulate your deepest wish. What brings you to practice meditation? And assuming your meditation posture, whether you're sitting or lying down or maybe even standing, and feeling the support of the Earth, trusting the Earth to support you. Feeling that contact of the buttocks or the back or the feet with the Earth. And sending your roots down deep. And then gently aligning the spine so that the energy flows nicely from heaven to earth and back right through your spinal column. See if you can land in a posture that gives you a sense of quiet confidence and you feel alert and balanced. And now we'll give ourselves the gift of letting go. To the extent we can. Relaxing, first of all, the body. The head, the neck and shoulders. Relaxing the arms, the elbows, wrists, hands. Relaxing the heart area, the belly, the hips, the legs and the feet. And letting go of any obvious tensions that we can let go of. And just bringing a sense of softness to those tensions that are difficult to let go of. And now we'll begin with a short practice of metamedicitation, just to warm up our mindfulness a little bit. So if you like, you can bring a benefactor to come and sit in front of you. Someone who invariably brings you joy when you're with them. Or if you're comfortable. If you've met it to yourself, then you can just do it that way. May I, may you, may all beings be safe and protected. May we be happy. May we be peaceful. And may we know moments of freedom. So lighting a little candle of well wishing in our hearts, for ourselves and for everyone, for this community, the whole world. And we bring in the wisdom factor of asking, where do we place our trust. Do we trust the mind that is spinning with preoccupations, or is the invitation to choose stepping into the present moment. Leaving all our preoccupations outside the door for this brief half hour. As you may know the only word for mindfulness or awareness is sati. And I often think of sati as my best friend in this endeavor. And I invite her to come and sit with me. Consciously choosing, resting in, relaxing into open awareness. Like putting my head in sati's lap perhaps. Okay. Let's let the mind settle down now. And staying with our ever changing experience of the breath as our meditation object. Gently taking in a long slow deep breath. Appreciating the whole cycle of the breath. As the inhale progressively flows into the exhale. And the exhale flows into the inhale. And full awareness inhabit the process of breathing. Trusting it is possible to let the mind settle down. And enjoying the beautiful connection of just settling into the world of the breath. Breathing in and settling. Breathing out openness. Trusting the company of being with the breath. And letting the eyes close as you settle into the breath. Being here with this ebb and flow of the experience of breathing is all we need. And let the mind settle down. Forehead. Eyes. On the eyes and behind the eyes. Sinuses and the cheeks. Lips and mouth and the jaw. And enjoying the breath. On this quiet journey. Breathing in and exhale. Breathing in, feeling settled. And breathing out the clarity that comes from open awareness. Thank you. As we settle the body and the mind breathing in, this makes the space for the clarity of open awareness. And we can offer that clarity to the world. And to each other. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And with a warm heart, kindness, breathing in, settling. Breathing out, open, and clear. Thank you. Thank you. And if the mind should wander, as minds tend to do, coming back with a smile. Settling into the breath and the clarity of awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for joining us. Thank you. Thank you. And as we come to the end of this sitting with a mind that has benefited from appreciating some of the goodness in ourselves and in our world, and through the goodness of our practice, may we, from our center of settledness and clarity, now radiate our heartfelt wish that all beings everywhere be safe, may all beings be happy, may we all be peaceful, and may all beings be free. Thank you. Thank you.
