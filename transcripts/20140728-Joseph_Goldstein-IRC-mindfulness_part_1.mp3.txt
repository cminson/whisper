Before we begin, I'd just like to express my appreciation for all the people who made this center happen. 
This is my first visit here, it's quite extraordinary. 
Really a beautiful environment for practice. 
So, thank you to you all. 
We'll start with a short meditation. 
But I wanted to share with you some little instruction that just in the last few years I've been working with both of my own practice and in teaching. 
It's very simple but it has really been very helpful both for myself and a lot of people, yogis. 
I've gotten good feedback about it. 
And the instruction actually is a line that's in the Satyapathana Sutta, in the discourse on the foundations of mindfulness. 
And you're probably familiar with that there is a refrain in the discourse that happens 13 different times after each particular set of instructions. 
And one of the lines in this refrain, which is repeated, but in this specific case is with reference to the body. 
It says, be mindful and then in quotes, it's like a direct statement, be mindful there is a body to the extent necessary for clear knowing and continuous mindfulness. 
It's very simple, be mindful there is a body to the extent necessary for clear knowing and continuous mindfulness. 
Well, of course, I had read this a million times over the years, but a few years ago, for some reason I read it and the line kind of jumped out at me as being a specific instruction. 
And the fact that that phrase, there is a body, be mindful, there's a body is in quotes, as I'm told in the Pali, this is in Analiya's book, he makes this point. 
I started to use that phrase in my practice to actually be repeating that phrase, there is a body in the sitting, in the walking. 
So it's not exactly a mental note, but we might say a mental reminder, there is a body. 
And just as I was exploring this, this was a time when IMS was in the middle of its own construction project, and we were building a new building. 
And in the process of building, as you will probably know, they frame it. 
And just in the process of framing it, the studs are in for the walls, but before the walls enclose the building, the frame is there. 
But you can see through it, so you can see what's going on inside. 
And so I started using this phrase, there is a body, as a reminder to simply settle in to that grounding awareness, there is a body as a frame, as the framework. 
So the mind is not zeroing in on anything, it's holding the more general framework, there is a body, and then being aware of whatever arises within the frame. 
And so what may arise is the feeling of the body breathing, or different sensations coming and going, thoughts or emotions or sounds, whatever. 
But instead of the mind zeroing in on these objects, it's just holding the frame, there is a body, and allowing the awareness of all these other objects to be there and to see how they come and go. 
So I'd like to suggest that you just experiment with this in play and see if it's helpful to you. 
The last part of that instruction in the text also is a bit illuminating, be mindful, there is a body, to the extent necessary for clear knowing. 
So just now, as you sit and you become aware of there is a body, how much effort does that take? Not a lot. 
It's just to the extent necessary for clear knowing, so for me it was a reminder not to over effort. 
But it's really a question of relaxing into that awareness, just relaxing there is a body, to the extent necessary for clear knowing. 
It's very simple and continuous mindfulness, which suggests that we keep that awareness with whatever is arising within that frame. 
So we'll just sit for a little bit and I may remind you from time to time of this. 
It'll be interesting for you just to see whether this is helpful or not. 
It allows for the experience of the body breathing and everything else without a forcing, without an effort, without a striving. 
Just for holding that more general framework. 
I found it helpful to repeat the phrase periodically as a way of coming back to the simplicity. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Repeating the phrase, there is a body, settling into that simple awareness of the body sitting as a framework. 
And then aware of whatever arises within it. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Within the frame there is a body. 
You might be aware of the sensations of the body breathing or other sensations or sounds, thoughts, all arising within that framework. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Be mindful there is a body to the extent necessary, just to the extent necessary for clear knowing and continuous mindfulness. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Using the phrase and the felt sense of there is a body as a framework for being aware of whatever arises within it, but grounding the awareness in the frame. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
So if you found that helpful at all, I also found it interesting using that same framework in the walking meditation. 
Just in walking and especially walking at a more normal speed rather than necessarily the very slow walking. 
Just in walking there is a body becomes the frame and then simply being aware of whatever is felt within the frame. 
And the experience very often is just somewhat ironically losing a sense of the body and the experience simply being sensations in space. 
You know, we have that frame and then movement and then simply aware of what's felt within the frame and no self, no eye, no body. 
It's just sensations being known, sensations moving through space. 
Anyway, it's something to play with if you found it of interest. 
So this afternoon, the title of the talk is, What is mindfulness and what isn't it? What it's not. 
It's especially given the great interest and spread of mindfulness teachings now in the country in all sorts of venues. 
Reaching out from meditation centers to business and schools and neuroscience labs and the military. 
It's just, you know, it's amazing. 
It's the mindfulness revolution. 
But I think it would be helpful to clarify, given the popularization of it, what exactly mindfulness is and to be discerning of what it isn't. 
So to ask what is mindfulness, somebody actually asked me, I was sitting in the staff room at IMS and somebody was visiting and they said, can you say just in a few words what mindfulness is? And I thought to myself, it's a bit like asking, you know, what is art? What is love? Please just say in a few words. 
It's hard. 
So this will be more than a few words, but maybe it'll provide a framework of understanding. 
So the first thing that often comes to mind, you know, if somebody says, well, what is mindfulness? The first thing that we might respond is, well, it's living in the moment. 
You know, and that's a big part of it. 
It's like, as you know from your practice, we spend an inordinate amount of time lost in thoughts of the past, lost in thoughts of the future. 
So being in the present, just coming back and being in the present is a first step. 
But it's really not enough because there's something which I call black lab consciousness. 
So, you know, the dog, the black labs, and it could be any breed or really any animal, but I particularly find this for black labs just because they're so friendly and playful and engaging. 
Well, as far as I can tell, they're living in the present. 
You know, they are really in the present, just, you know, wear sights and sounds and particularly smells. 
They don't look mindful. 
You know, it's hard to say. 
It is a projection, granted, but they certainly don't seem mindful, but they're in the present. 
So mindfulness has to mean something else. 
It has to mean something in addition to being present. 
It's like necessary, but not sufficient. 
And so we need to kind of expand our view a little bit. 
So then we might think of mindfulness, okay, we're in the present, and then we might think of it, well, it's the observing power of mind. 
You know, it's knowing that we know, right, which maybe the black labs don't have that, you know, interest or capacity. 
So there was a woman who was at a retreat, and she came up after a talk and she said she had recently been on a cruise. 
And in the room, her room, her cabin on the ship, you know, there was the map of the ship with the layout and the arrow, you are here. 
And she said that for the whole cruise, that was her mantra, wherever she went, you are here. 
So that's kind of this observing power of the mind. 
And we can have all experienced the power of this when we really pay attention to the difference in our experience between being lost in a thought and being aware that we're thinking. 
There's a huge difference. 
As you know from your practice, very often thoughts come and we're not aware that they've arisen, and we get caught up in the content, and are carried along on this train of association. 
You know, we don't know that we've hopped on the train, we have no idea where the train is going, but at some point we become aware. 
You know, it's like we wake up to the fact that we're thinking. 
So at that point, it's the observing power of the mind that comes into play. 
And you know the difference. 
You know, when we're lost in the thought, it's really, it's like being lost in the movies of our minds, you know, in the drama, in the story. 
And yet as soon as we wake up and become aware that we're thinking, as soon as the observing power of mind comes into play, really something very interesting happens, we begin to really see and experience and understand the essentially empty nature of thought. 
You know, here are these thoughts which are so compelling in our lives when they're unnoticed. 
They're basically driving our lives. 
You know, thoughts come, go here, go there, do this, do that, get married, get divorced. 
It's like the thoughts are like little dictators of the mind when they're not noticed. 
So they have this tremendous power. 
And yet when they are noticed, we see that they're a little more than nothing. 
They're just these little energy blips that are completely ephemeral and insubstantial. 
So this is quite revolutionary to really understand this about our minds and the nature of a thought. 
And this comes through the observing power of the mind. 
So when we're lost in a thought, we may be present. 
We're present and lost. 
So we need that observing power of the mind to really know what we're experiencing. 
But this observing power is also not enough. 
And there's a very important distinction to make between perception, the mental factor of perception and mindfulness. 
So the observing power of mind, at least in big part, is the factor of perception. 
And perception in the Buddhist understanding, it means that faculty of recognition. 
We recognize what the present object is. 
So we recognize man or woman or house or building or thought. 
And the tool of mental noting, for example, is really about perception. 
We're strengthening the clear perception of what's arising. 
And the perception can then serve as a vehicle for mindfulness. 
And I'm going to get more into that. 
So the first thing we want to know about perception and understand our experience of it is that sometimes perception is accurate. 
Sometimes it's inaccurate. 
And there are many examples of inaccurate perception and one which I understand has been demonstrated very clearly right in this hall. 
So just over lunch, Gil and Andrea were telling me about the birds that kept flying into the window, pecking on the window, seeing the reflection and thinking there's another bird there. 
That's misperception. 
It's like the bird is perceiving something that's inaccurate. 
Well, we do this a lot. 
Also, we misperceive things. 
And sometimes in very significant ways, sometimes in humorous ways. 
So once I was on retreat, it was the first time I was sitting with Saada Upandita. 
This was in 1984. 
Very, as you might know and know of him, a very demanding teacher. 
It was very strictly treated. 
There was a lot of pressure. 
So I was doing the walking meditation outside and I looked up at a window in the room that he was staying in and I saw him watching me do the walking meditation. 
I slowed down, left, move, place. 
So I'm going under the gaze of the master. 
So I'm walking back and forth and I look up again. 
He's still watching. 
And this is going on for about 10 or 15 minutes. 
And meanwhile, you can imagine my mind state pretending to be mindful. 
So finally, after 15 or 20 minutes, I just didn't understand why he was standing there watching me. 
So I just looked up and I looked a little more carefully. 
And it wasn't Upandita at all. 
It was a lampshade. 
So I had created this whole inner environment. 
I created a whole mind world based on a misperception. 
So one of the things we need to understand about this factor of recognition is sometimes it's accurate, sometimes it's not accurate. 
An example of playing with this in meditation practice in a way that was very helpful for me. 
So one time I was sitting and I was just going through a lot of sadness. 
That was the emotion that was coming up. 
And I was noting sadness, sadness, sadness. 
But it really felt locked in. 
In some way, I just felt caught in the sadness. 
So at a certain point, I got interested in why, you know, what's going on here? Why am I so caught in this? So I looked a little more carefully at what I was feeling and I saw that it wasn't sadness. 
It was unhappiness. 
And these emotions are kind of close, but they're really different. 
They're different feelings. 
And it was so interesting to me because as soon as the perception became accurate, it was as if I could align my awareness with what was actually there before it was slightly misaligned. 
And so I wasn't able to actually be accepting, you know, because I was slightly off. 
As soon as I got aligned with what was happening, then the acceptance could be there and the emotion started to wash through. 
So that was just an interesting thing to learn, you know, about the relationship of accurate perception to acceptance and mindfulness. 
The reason that this observing power of mind or the factor of perception of recognition is not enough, it's not yet mindfulness, is that very often, even when we're perceiving things accurately, you know, so we are recognizing what's actually there, but we are often looking at what's happening, observing what's happening through a filter of wanting or aversion. 
You know, we can be looking at things and if they're pleasant, we're wanting them to continue or wanting them to get stronger. 
If there's the filter of aversion, we're looking at it and maybe recognizing it accurately, but wanting it to go away, not liking it. 
If there's desire and aversion, then again, it's not mindfulness. 
So the perception is there, we're in the present, we're knowing what's going on, we're observing it, we're recognizing it accurately. 
All of that is there, but it's not yet mindfulness because we're looking through a filter, you know, of unwholesome mind states. 
So just a few examples of this, of the filter of desire of the wanting mind, because there's no shortage of examples, you know, and I think we're all familiar, but one of my favorites, I've used this example often, it's what I call catalog consciousness. 
So have you ever made the initial mistake of opening a catalog and then turning pages, waiting for something to want? Nothing on this page, maybe on the next page I'll want something. 
Not yet. 
It's like we're wanting to want. 
We're attached to wanting, and you know the sense of relief when we finally get to the last page, we put the catalog down. 
It's like we're being let out of the grip of desire and the sense of ease, which comes from that. 
Well, I mean that's a rather blatant example of desire in one thing, but it comes up a lot in our meditation practice, just with pleasant meditative states. 
Or there's aversion, the filter of aversion. 
We can be recognizing what's happening, how often are we experiencing painful sensations in the body? They're unpleasant, this burning, a tightness, a pressure, in a very unpleasant way. 
We're in the present, we're observing it, we're recognizing it, so all that's there, but we're observing it through the filter of aversion, we don't like it, we're watching it so it will go away. 
So that's not yet mindfulness. 
And I had a very powerful example of this, I'll give you a few examples. 
But one, again, which I've talked a lot about over the years, because it was such a learning for me. 
So of all the various afflictive emotions that can arise, the one that was most powerful for me in my practice over a long time was the emotion of fear. 
Lots of fear was coming up, and not about anything in particular, it was just like the primal emotion. 
I had no idea what it was about, and often it was completely irrational. 
At one point when it was really intense, there was fear about going from sitting to standing. 
It didn't make any sense, and yet it was like the raw primal emotion was coming up. 
So I had been working with this for a long, many, many months. 
Obviously not in every moment, but it was a predominant experience. 
So I was recognizing it, I mean I knew it was fear, and I was noting it fear, fear, fear. 
It took many, many months of being with it. 
And then I remember I was doing walking meditation, I was actually in the same place I was walking when I was looking at the lampshade. 
Right in front of IMS. 
And then something shifted after all of this time of being with the fear. 
Something shifted in me, and the shift was expressed in the phrase, if this fear is here for the rest of my life, it's okay. 
And that was the first moment of acceptance in all that time that I had been with it. 
And recognizing it, and thinking that I was being mindful, I was not being mindful. 
I was being with it, wanting it to go away, because it was very unpleasant. 
And so I was deluding myself, and it was only when the mind finally dropped into a place of genuine acceptance that was really the first moment of mindfulness. 
And it was so interesting, first that phrase, it's okay, if it's here for the rest of my life, it's okay. 
It's okay, it became a great mantra for me. 
With difficult experiences, I would often remind myself, it's okay. 
Just let me feel it, just let me be with it, whatever it might be. 
So it was like a shortcut reminder to be accepting. 
And what was so interesting in that moment of genuine acceptance and mindfulness, that whole constellation of fear and all the sensations, the whole thing washed through. 
It was totally amazing. 
The acceptance allowed it to flow. 
And it's not that fear never comes up again, but the relationship to it has changed. 
So it's no longer being with it, with aversion, wanting it to go away, pushing against it. 
It's with more mindfulness. 
Okay, it's okay, let it be here. 
And in that relationship to it, we're seeing that fear or anything else, pleasant or unpleasant, it all has the nature to arise and everything is impermanent. 
And I saw so clearly how we lock things in through wanting and aversion. 
That's what kind of damns the flow. 
So this points just to an important further understanding of what constitutes mindfulness. 
It's being in the present, but that's not enough. 
It's the observing power of mind, so we know we're knowing and we're recognizing and hopefully coming to an accurate recognition, but that's not enough. 
We really need to be in the present to know what's happening without desire and aversion, with acceptance, and then we're really entering the field of mindfulness. 
So one of the little catchphrases I use to watch out for these filters in the mind is to keep an eye out for what I call the in order to mind. 
Are we with something in order for something to happen? If there's an order to mind, that's a signal that we're not genuinely accepting. 
We want it to be different in some way or another. 
And sometimes it's so tricky. 
We think we're being mindful, but we're not. 
And so I had an example of this practicing in Burma, with Sida Upandita. 
I'd been there for maybe a month or two, and the practice seemed to be going well. 
My whole body was like just a free flow of energy and light and felt pretty good, except for this one kind of knot in my neck. 
Everything was open except for this one place. 
So I go in and give a report to him on my experience describing that a nice pleasant free flow of energy, but there's an energy block. 
And I thought I was just describing this objectively. 
It's just, yeah, there's a free flow and there's a block. 
He got on my case for calling it a block. 
Because just in using that word, already there's desire in a version, block, no good, have to open it, you know, don't like this, want this. 
And it was so interesting to me because I thought it was just an objective report, not seeing kind of the defilements that were in the mind. 
And he was very good at pointing out defilements. 
What was really there, I wasn't experiencing a block. 
That was a concept, I was overlaying on it. 
I was experiencing tightness. 
There was the sensation of tightness. 
There's no sensation called block. 
And when I could be just with the tightness and really be accepting of it, then it's possible to see all the nuances of change within the tightness. 
It's not one unchanging thing. 
There's a lot of nuance, a lot of variation. 
So this is just an example. 
If there's an in order to mind, with something in order for something to happen, that's a signal, that's a feedback. 
So in our practice, keep an eye out for this. 
Okay, so now we're in the domain of mindfulness. 
We're in the present and we know what's happening, we're observing, and it's not through the filter of desire and aversion. 
So this brings us to a fuller, or going into a fuller meaning of the word sate, which is how mindfulness is sate, the Pali word. 
The root meaning of sate is to remember. 
And so one of the meanings of mindfulness is remembering, of course remembering the present moment, that's in some way perhaps its most essential meaning, but it also means remembering or calling to mind what is skillful and what is unskillful. 
Wholesome states of mind and unwholesome states of mind. 
So it's remembering that, it's bringing that to mind. 
And this begins to connect us with the ethical dimension of mindfulness, which is often not talked about in kind of the spread of mindfulness in the culture, that actually mindfulness has an ethical value, it's ethically wholesome. 
Because it's only mindfulness if wholesome states of mind are present. 
If desire is present, if we're looking through that filter, it's not mindfulness. 
If aversion is present, it's not mindfulness. 
In the Abhidharma teachings, mindfulness is a wholesome factor, and it calls all the other wholesome factors to arise with it, and it's never associated with unwholesome factors. 
And so in our exploration of what mindfulness means, it gets very interesting to explore the mind in this fuller sense. 
What's really going on? What factors are arising in the moment? Is it wholesome? Is it unwholesome? Some of you may have heard of coming to contact with Saita Utejnir, a younger Burmese Saita. 
One of the things he emphasizes, which I found to be really helpful in this regard, is he encourages people a lot in their practice what he calls to check the attitude in the mind. 
So as we're going along with whatever we're experiencing frequently, just to check the attitude. 
The attitude means how we're relating to what's happening. 
And I found this a very useful tool, technique, to actually illuminate whether wholesome factors are present, whether unwholesome factors are present. 
I'll just give you a very simple example of this. 
So I was sitting and just feeling the breath. 
I mean, it was completely simple. 
I was just feeling the breath come in, feeling the breath go out. 
And then I remembered this instruction of Saita Utejnir. 
You know, just check the attitude. 
So that's the question I guess, well, what's the attitude in my mind? And it was so interesting in the very moment of asking the question. 
It wasn't even for the answer, it was just to ask the question. 
I felt my mind relax back from a wanting that I didn't even know was there. 
But in contrast, once the mind relaxed back, I saw, oh yeah, as I was feeling the breath, it was wanting concentration. 
It was wanting calm. 
Sometimes there's even kind of the wanting of the next breath. 
You know, it's like, just we're leaning forward a little bit. 
And simply by asking the question, well, what's the attitude? The mind, the mind relaxed, more open, more free, and then it was just feeling the breath with wholesome states. 
So there's one teaching of the Buddha among many that I just found so direct and powerful a reminder. 
He said that what we frequently think about and ponder upon becomes the inclination of our mind. 
So it's so obvious, you know, when we're in the habit of thinking about certain things or, you know, really having certain thought patterns or emotional patterns, when we go over them again and again and again from the neuroscience perspective, those neural pathways are deepening, you know, and it becomes easier to have those same thoughts or those same emotional patterns happen again and again. 
They become the inclination of our mind. 
So given that it's really a challenge to us to be mindful of what patterns we perhaps are unconsciously strengthening. 
Because they are going to become the inclination of our mind. 
And so here's the meaning of mindfulness, of calling to mind what is wholesome, what is unwholesome. 
It really is very important and it's not to assume that, you know, we do this and all of a sudden all desire disappears or all aversion disappears. 
But if we are practicing mindfulness and this dimension of mindfulness, calling to mind what's wholesome, what's unwholesome, it just reinforces our understanding and our recognition, yes, what's happening in our minds is important, it has consequences. 
It's not just something of the moment, you know, it's creating a pattern, it's deepening a pathway. 
So this is another meaning of mindfulness. 
When we see that and take in what we frequently think about upon and upon becomes the inclination of our mind, there are so many examples of this then playing out in our lives. 
I had just a delightful experience of this. 
I was in a department store buying something and kind of an older guy, I don't know how old he seemed older than me, of course I'm now in that category, but it's all relative. 
But this older guy seemed older and came up to the checkout and he was buying something. 
So he paid and the salesperson said, have a nice day as they often do. 
And without missing a beat, he said, I intend to. 
I love that, you know, I was like, that's a good neural pathway to deepen, have a nice, I intend to. 
Because our intentions have power, you know, and you could just see, yeah, he was shaping his life, you know, with that thought. 
And so we can really do this if we understand the importance of doing it. 
So Ajahn Sumedo, I'm sure most of you know of, you know, the American monk who was in the Thai Forest tradition and brought it back to the West a lot. 
He had a teaching which has always struck me as being really helpful. 
He said, our practice is not to follow the heart, but to train the heart, you know, and so much of kind of spiritual circles. 
You know, let's just follow your heart. 
Well, one of the things I think we see, and this is one of the great challenging virtues of a Pasana practice, we begin to see that not everything in our heart is worth following. 
You know, we're a mix, there's a great mix of motivations, and some things are beautiful and wholesome and skillful, and some things are not. 
And so our task is not just to follow our heart, it's to see what's there, to be mindful of what's there, knowing that what we frequently do will become the inclination, you know, of our mind, of our heart. 
And so we really want to be training our hearts to have this discerning wisdom. 
I mean, one application of this, which I'm sure you've all practiced to varying degrees, is the practice of metta. 
We can choose to cultivate the metta channel within us. 
You know, sometimes I think of, you know, mindfulness is like taking control of the inner remote. 
You know, we have a remote control, and what channel are we on at any particular time? Are we on the judging channel? Are we on the aversion channel? Well, if we see it, you know, and once we recognize it, we don't have to, we can just, oh, let's go to the metta channel. 
So what is the cause for metta to arise? The cause is seeing the good in others. 
And it's just so interesting, so often our habit of mind, you know, when we're with other people, what really jumps out of us, out at us, is what we don't like. 
You know, so it triggers the critical mind, the judgmental mind. 
We see all their annoying habits and all the irritating things they do. 
Well, that's just, you know, a particular pattern, and if we can see that, if we can be mindful of it, calling to mind what's skillful, what's unskillful, choosing the metta channel, and then focusing on actually what is good in the person. 
And it doesn't mean being sentimental, you know, it doesn't mean that we're ignoring the totality of the person. 
We can have a very full appreciation of the whole mix of qualities in them. 
But what are we focusing on? What are we giving attention to? So this is all made possible when we're mindful, when we are actually aware of what's going on in ourselves. 
We're aware of what's wholesome, what's unwholesome. 
We're aware that what's arising in our mind over and over again becomes its inclination. 
So it inspires us to make wiser choices. 
So then the question is, given all this, so now we hopefully have a little better understanding of what mindfulness means in its fullness. 
Right, it's not just being in the present, it's not just knowing and recognizing what's there. 
It's being present in a particular way. 
It's being present free of the unwholesome factors, free of desire, free of aversion. 
And then understanding the fullness of mindfulness and calling to mind what's wholesome, calling to mind what's unwholesome. 
So it reminds us to make wiser choices. 
The question then arises, well, what does all this have to do with liberation? Because that's what the Buddha declared in the opening paragraph of the Satya Bhattana Sutta. 
This is the direct path to the overcoming of grief and sorrow and lamentation, to the realization of the true way, to the realization of Nibbana. 
So what's the connection between mindfulness and freedom? At the retreat I just finished teaching at Spirit Rock. 
So I opened one talk with that question and somebody was at the talk and said, she had been wondering about that for the last 25 years, just what is the connection between being mindfulness, between being mindful and freedom. 
So in case any of you have been wondering, I just thought I'd give a five minute. 
When we're mindful, when we're actually mindful in all the ways that I talked about, what is it that we see? Well, we see what it is that's arising, unobscured by desire and aversion, but what we also see with greater and greater clarity are the three characteristics. 
We see, we experience very directly the changing nature, just the flow that whatever has the nature to arise will pass away. 
You know, that line is found a lot in the texts, just that one line. 
Whatever has the nature to arise will also pass away. 
As it said, many people heard that line and got enlightened, so I'll say it once more. 
Whatever has the nature to arise will also pass away. 
The implications of that are profound, but it's so ordinary. 
And we don't really give it much attention, you know. 
But if we really understood that, if we really saw that not just on an intellectual level, but we were seeing it in our practice and in our lives, we wouldn't be attached, because we would know that everything is arising and passing. 
If we're not attached, we don't suffer. 
But as we know, we do suffer because we're attached, because we're not seeing it. 
So mindfulness allows us, and this is our practice, mindfulness is in the service of wisdom. 
The reason we're being mindful is so that we can begin to see with greater and greater clarity the changing nature, the changing flow. 
And in that, we also see the dukkha aspect, the unreliability, the unsatisfying quality. 
Things can't ultimately be satisfying precisely because they don't last. 
So even though things can be pleasant and we can enjoy different experiences, they're not going to provide a lasting completion or a fulfilling sense of peace. 
They don't have that capacity. 
So we see that, we see that clearly. 
And we see the selfless nature of it all, the ungovernability of it. 
The things are following their own laws. 
Things arise out of conditions, pass away when the conditions pass. 
So this just becomes increasingly clear. 
One of the things I love to do on retreat, and I do a lot of self-retreat now at home. 
In reading the sutras, I'll do a little reading when I'm on retreat. 
And of course, reading the sutras on retreat somehow, they really go in in a very different way, at least in my experience than if I'm reading them just in the busyness of my life. 
And one of the big differences that I found, and this was true for many years, that I would read the teachings and read the sutras and read them mostly as being descriptions of how things are. 
Descriptions of our reality, what we're experiencing. 
But in recent years, being on retreat and reading the sutras, I've begun to take them not as descriptions, but as instructions. 
And that has made a huge difference. 
So instead of reading and, oh yeah, that sounds right. 
Yeah, yeah, that's a good description of things. 
Yeah, things are impermanent. 
I would take different lines, like the one I mentioned at the beginning of the guided sitting. 
I would go through, and different lines would jump out at me as being an instruction to do, rather than a description to agree with. 
So one of the lines, which again happens frequently in the sutras, which I found has become a very powerful practice, has to do with the wisdom aspect that mindfulness serves. 
Okay, so we're practicing mindfulness in the service of wisdom. 
That's its connection to liberation. 
And there's a very direct line. 
It's almost like a shortcut to freedom. 
It's really short. 
We can get right there in the moment. 
So one of the teachings that we find in seeing impermanence, which happens when we're being mindful, in seeing impermanence, the mind doesn't cling. 
When it doesn't cling, it is not agitated. 
When it's not agitated, it personally attains nipana. 
So this is like right to nipana. 
Impermanence, not clinging, non-agitation, nipana. 
So again, taking this from a description of things to an instruction, what I started doing is turning the mindfulness, the attention, at those times when I'm experiencing the flow of change. 
And many of you probably have had this experience. 
You're just in the momentum of the flow. 
And seeing just the arising and passing of sensations, the sounds, the thoughts, whatever, we're really experiencing just things coming and going, we're experiencing the impermanence. 
At that time, to look back at the mind and to see that at that time of experiencing impermanence, the mind is in fact not clinging. 
Because if it were clinging, it wouldn't be seeing the change. 
Do you follow? And so at those times when we're in that flow and we're seeing the change, turn the attention back and we have very direct experience of the quality, the nature of the non-clinging mind. 
We're in that. 
And this is really the third foundation of mindfulness. 
It's mindfulness of the mind. 
But we're turning back to it right at this time of seeing impermanence. 
And so then we just hang out for a little bit in that experience of the mind that is not clinging. 
And then we begin to say, yes, when it's not clinging, it is not agitated. 
And I just found it really interesting. 
Often when we think of agitation of mind, we may think of it in some gross sense. 
Just a lot of agitation and restlessness. 
But it also refers to the very subtle agitation of just the slight reactivity of liking and not liking impermanence. 
Just little bits of agitation. 
So to see and to experience when the mind is not clinging, it is not agitated. 
So we're already back. 
We're mindful of the mind when it's not clinging. 
Experiencing the mind very directly, not clinging. 
And then we say, oh yeah, this is not agitated. 
So we're experiencing a quality of stillness of non-agitation right in those moments. 
And we can get a very intuitive sense that it's out of that non-agitation that opening to freedom, opening to nirvana is possible. 
That is, that, I could say, is the ground out of which illumination happens. 
So it's a very direct, it's an experiential application of the teachings as an instruction, not simply as a description. 
So this is what mindfulness is in the service of. 
This is why we practice mindfulness. 
And it's why the Buddha declared at the beginning of the sutta, this is the direct path to liberation. 
So I'd just like to close with a few comments made by a group of folk who were in a six-week mindfulness training program in schools. 
There were second graders, and a friend of ours was doing this program in the schools. 
I think maybe it was once a week, I don't quite know, but it was over a six-week period teaching mindfulness. 
And at the end of the six weeks, they asked the kids how they liked or what they thought of mindfulness, and some of the comments were, mindfulness calms me down. 
Mindfulness helps me go to sleep at night. 
This, I think, is my favorite. 
Mindfulness is the best thing I have done in my life, second grader. 
And then the last one was, I love mindfulness. 
But I think that kind of covers the range of appreciating its value.
