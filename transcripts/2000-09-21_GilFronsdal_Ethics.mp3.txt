 I like the week before I started introductory course, I like giving a talk on ethics. And since I won't be here next week, I thought I'd do it tonight. And the reason for this is that classically in the teachings of the Buddha, the spiritual path that he was promoting for people to follow, was built on three... In the foundational tier, the foundation for it was that of ethics, ethical practice or virtue, establishing, creating a certain field of virtue within and around oneself, which is a foundation upon to do the work of meditation, which is a second tier. The third tier, kind of like a cake, would be wisdom or insight. Not just simply the practices of virtue and meditation, but the insights and the purification that can come from those practices, the transformations. And that's the way the Buddha taught. And so when in the ancient discourses that survive with the Buddha, he would sometimes lay out what's called a graduated path, graduated discourse, where he would start with talking about the importance of ethics. And it's interesting, the first thing you talk about in ethics was not moral rules, which many people in the West associate with ethics, but rather he advocated the practice of generosity. So that was kind of like the first kind of first practice that he would say a Buddhist person should practice. And it's a beautiful kind of corollary or relationship between generosity and awakening. The awakening that the Buddha was pointing to, the pinnacle of the spiritual path, is the experience of non-clinging, where there's absolutely no clinging in the heart or anything at all. And generosity is a movement towards non-clinging. It's to be generous, you have to let go of something, you have to hand something to someone. More importantly, generosity, being at the foundation of the path, is an inter-relational event. We're usually not generous to ourselves, we can be, but generosity is usually put us in relationship to other people or other beings or to the world. And whereas the pinnacle of the path, awakening itself, is in a sense a very personal experience. It's the kind of shedding of all the inhibitions, all our fears, all our clingings, all our resistances, all our hate, all our aversion, all the kind of all the fetters that kind of shackle the heart are dissolved with the experience of awakening. Some are personal. But the beginning of the path is interpersonal, and interpersonal because it's very important to establish healthy interpersonal relationships as a foundation for doing the personal work. It's also, there's a lot we can learn about ourselves and learn about our relationship to the world around us by engaging in interpersonal practices. And without doing that work first, some people, they, it gets a little bit unhealthy when the focus is very much on the personal aspect of meditation practice and awakening. We have a culture here in the West which is very self-focused. I think we all know that. And from a Buddhist perspective, some of this self-focus is okay, and some of it is a little bit excessive. The line between spiritual practice and narcissism is not always so clear for some of us, and we spill back and forth across that line. And sometimes people's involvement in spiritual practice is more narcissistic than it is liberating. But by being involved in interpersonal practice at the beginning, we begin kind of seeing how we fit, how our lives fit into the lives of others. We begin feeling, developing, and clarifying our relationships. Because we're involved with other people, the experience of empathy becomes important, and we get to feel and sense and find out who other people are in relationship to ourselves and who we are in relationship to other people. And because hopefully spiritual awakening, even though it's a very personal thing, is not something that occurs in isolation, but happens in the context of your wish for a well-being of all beings. So the first path was that of generosity. And he advocated that you go, the Buddha advocated, that you try to go and spend some time practicing generosity as a practice, not as an obligation, not as a moral should, that you should do it, but rather, and not really necessarily for the benefit of the other person, perhaps, so much, but you do it as a practice for yourself. It's useful to do. It's helpful. It's a kind of training, training of the heart. And to go around, look for opportunities to be generous. It doesn't have to be with your wallet. It could be with your smile, or your time, or your kind words. But to extend yourself and find opportunities to extend yourself and enter into relationships with other people in this vehicle of generosity. And one of the things, of course, that you'll find, part of the power of the practice generosity, is you'll start seeing the places where you're holding. Wait a minute, I can't give that. I can't give up my precious time, or, you know, I can't do without that. I talked to Ajahn Amaro a couple of weeks ago. Ajahn Amaro is this wonderful Buddhist monk who lives up in Yukaya, very wise guy. And he has this, I don't know what they're called when they're not a palm pilot, because Hewlett Packard makes them, right? But then they have palm pilots. What are they then? Hewlett Packard pilot? What? A core pilot? Anyway, you know what I mean, right? Palm pilots want to be by Hewlett Packard. What's it called? Personal? Here's Hewlett Packard. In general, you just call it a personal digital assistant. Oh, the personal digital assistant. So this Buddhist monk has his personal digital assistant. And it's also a very expensive personal digital assistant. And the first time I see he was showing, he was using it, you know, it was kind of amazing. He showed me all the neat things you can do with it. It's really amazing. Maybe some of you have them. And I was kind of admiring, you know, my impression is that most men get them because their wives give them to them. And he doesn't have a wife, so how did he end up with one of these? So last couple weeks ago I saw him. Somehow he came up in conversation again and explained to me how he got it. And it was a gift, of course. And we were talking about the whole financial arrangements of monkeys. He doesn't have any, he's not allowed to possess any money anywhere at all. He doesn't have a bank account. He doesn't have any money. He doesn't handle money. He can't hold touch money. He seems to manage to get around with life just fine with having any money at all. He said that he was in kind of a financial district one day and he's from England. And so he was some man was explaining to him how American finance works and how American economy and all that. And this man turned to him and said, you know, you're actually wealthier than most Americans. And he took him by surprise. What do you mean by that? I don't have any money. How can I be more wealthier than most Americans? Most Americans are in debt. So he's a very wealthy American who has his personal digital assistant. So we were talking about all this and then he said, what do you say? I'm getting to the point. He said that it's his practice not to have a possession, not to possess anything, that he isn't convinced that he could give to someone if they asked him for it. So someone had asked, so I thought, oh, here's an opportunity. But I wanted him to have it, so I didn't ask for it. And so that's a wonderful way to live. Imagine such a radical way to live. So many of us, you know, we start wanting to give and it's not so simple because, wait a minute, you know, you only give to that person or we don't want to give that thing or whatever. I know some people who do the practice of, at least, you know, not all the time, but maybe for one week or one day, to act on the first impulse to be generous and see what that's like. Go around, spend a day and see what it's like to actually follow through on each impulse, short of, you know, use your common sense, but, you know, to give and not to hold back, see what that's like or, you know, look for opportunities to be generous. It changes your whole relationship to life. If you're looking at life as opportunity to be generous as opposed to life as an opportunity to get something for yourself. And it's very easy with a very busy life many of us live and with the demands that are on us to get very much focused on being self-concerned and by wanting to get things done or want something for ourselves. And we can make something for ourselves and we can get kind of almost possessed in wanting, wanting, wanting. And it's a very radical shift to actually spend some time and say, okay, I'm not going to be so concerned about wanting now, but rather what can I do for someone else? What practice generosity can I do? And the process of doing that, as I keep saying now, we really, it's not so easy. And so we see ourselves in ways that are very dramatic, highlight our clinging, our fear, many different things about ourselves. And that's the beginning of the practice of mindfulness, of awareness, self-awareness, self-reflection, to see all these things in relationship to other people. The second developed, the kind of step in the graduated practice of the Buddha after generosity is the practice of virtue, of ethics. And this also is an inter-relational issue for the most part. Most of the precepts that the Buddha advocated for lay people are inter-relational, how you're going to relate to other people. So the five precepts for lay people are not to kill, not to steal, not to engage in sexual misconduct, not to lie, and not to abuse intoxicants, alcohol and drugs. And the first, the last, the one on drugs and alcohol might be seen as kind of all personal, not so interpersonal. Though we see the tremendous cost that alcohol and drugs has on society around us. It's a bit hard to keep it just in the personal realm. But the first four are clearly interpersonal, harming others, killing them, harming them, stealing from others. Sexual misconduct, I think, pretty much always involves someone else. And then lie. I guess some people lie to themselves. But usually we lie out loud. It's towards someone else. So it's very important to look at these five precepts that the Buddha gave, not as commandments, not as moral obligations. And one of the ways to help us do that is to see as really they're beginning to help us explore our interpersonal life. What is it like to be in relationship to other people? What is the sensitivity that has to be present for us when that allows us to start living more ethically in relationship to other people? How do we clarify a relationship to others so that they're healthy? The healthier our relationship is to others, the easier it is to do meditation practice. The more unhealthy our relationship is to others, the more difficult it will be to do meditation practice. If you go out and rob a bank at 6 30 Thursday afternoon evening and then come here to meditate at 7, you're probably not going to get very calm or very concentrated. And so that's kind of maybe a dramatic example, but there's much more subtle examples like that. So ethics then is a wonderful area where we start developing and understanding our relationship in relationship to other people, understanding our life relationship to other people. When I practiced at the San Francisco Zen Center in my early 20s, one of the things that struck me was that a lot of people were very sincere practitioners practicing very hard meditation and Zen practice. And they would practice for maybe three, four years there, and then they would leave, do something else. And I never had any sense it was wrong for them to have left. But what I sense, the other people, the teachers in the center, especially noticed who are much more in touch with these people, is a lot of people when they initially came to do Zen practice, they had a very weak sense of themselves and very weak sense of their purpose in life and their relationship to the world around them. And the primary function of Zen practice in the early years was not some personal quest for enlightenment, but the Zen practice was helping them straighten out their relationships to themselves and the world around them. And it was really remarkable to see how a lot of the Zen students in the early years of the practice would often leave the Zen Center to go back to their families. They were estranged from them to work those out and clarify and improve the relationship with their family or their friends or sometimes with their birth religion. It was kind of wonderful. They'd go and throw themselves into Zen practice for three, four years and discover that they loved their Judaism or their Christianity. And so they went back to it and that's a nice thing. It can be a nice thing. I hope it's a nice thing. Usually it is. And so the idea being that in the early years of these people's practice without really being their intention, their overt attention, really a lot of what was going on was a clarification of themselves in relationship to the world around them. And once that was somewhat established and clarified, they were no longer motivated to continue with the Zen practice until they went back into the world in a sense to work and go to school or whatever they did. Our interpersonal life is very, very important. And to separate our interpersonal life from our spiritual life is to do ourselves a disservice and is to kind of actually is to sever a part of who we are. And I say this because it's very important to say it. There are many people who I run into who have a kind of narcissistic bent to their spiritual practice or maybe a little bit confused bent and they think it's really all about themselves. It's all about for their own benefit and their own kind of well-being and you know it's kind of like protection from the world around them or you know it's for their own you know it's all for themselves. And I don't think that spirituality can work that way. I think spirituality requires us to be to some degree to occur in relationship to other people. We understand how our own well-being and our own spiritual development is directly relevant for the well-being of the people around us. So the practice of generality and aesthetics are as a practice that helps us develop healthier relationships to the world around us. And this in return makes it a lot easier for us to feel content, calm, at ease, settled, unconflicted about ourselves when we come to sit down and meditate. If we've been doing a lot of unethical things there'll be kind of inner conflict. There cannot be unethical behavior without some inner conflict. Some people are out of touch with that inner conflict but if they really open up and really sensitive to what's going on inside it arises out of conflict. I was reading today an account of I never read the book Summerhill but maybe many of you read it. It was kind of a classic that people read in school and it was about the teacher in England who created a different kind of school like maybe in the 1950s in England. He gave children complete freedom to do whatever they want which was the opposite of what some of the English schools were doing. And he said that when he got kids from the most repressive English schools into his schools it would take about six months for them to be reformed. And the first six months they'd rebel and he would just let them rebel. There was one girl apparently who was the first months of being there. Every day for school she left and went into town. So it was fine. So he just whatever they wanted he gives all his freedom to everyone. And after a while they relaxed and realized they didn't have to rebel anymore. And when they realized they didn't have to rebel anymore then they got interested in learning something and some other part of them came out. And he had this quote where he said in each child there's a God or God like qualities in each child and if that gets squashed or repressed it gets transformed into the devil. In a very dramatic language perhaps. But the idea being that kind of rebelliousness which often takes unethical directions can arise out of deep inner conflict or deep inner pain and frustration sometimes caused by society around us. I think that real ethical behavior always arises with some deep conflict inside of us. So Buddhism is not interested so much in the moral judgment of our ethical behavior. But it's very interested in how our ethical behavior reflects this inner conflict, inner tension. And so ethics in Buddhism the practice of ethics the practice of the precepts is not meant to be judgmental and something you set yourself up so you can fail at doing it. But rather it's a very gentle kind of like this gentle kind of mirror that says hey you should look at this area of your life and if you look at what's stimulating or the impulse for this kind of action killing and stealing and lying and so forth. If you look at this where the origins of that is inside of you maybe you'll discover some of this places of tension and conflict and fear and then use your mindfulness there and look at that very honestly and directly explore that deeply. Because what Buddhism is trying to get us to do is not to become virtuous people by putting us into a moral box. This is how you should behave. But rather what it's trying to do is kind of like this man in the book Summerhill was trying to do is to give us the freedom so we can begin unraveling from the inside so that the natural goodness our good heart can shine forth so that we can resolve the conflicts within us. So the mindfulness is about inner transformation. Buddhism is about inner transformation of the very motivations of our behavior. It's not about assuming some behavior from the outside as being the thing you're supposed to be. The end result might look the same. The end result of someone who really looks very deeply into their hearts and transforms those inner conflicts and fears, purifies them. That person is going to live an ethical life. That person will not kill, will not steal, will not lie and so forth. And it might look the same as the life of someone who's living in a restricted kind of confined way by moral codes. But when one person is refined and constricted by the moral codes and kind of box themselves in and the other person has no bhakars at all but rather is the purity of their heart which is being expressed. And then upon the foundation of ethics the Buddha taught meditation. Now what's happened here in the west is that if I said I was going to teach a fiber introductory course in ethics, not many people would come. But if I teach a fiber introductory course in meditation a good number of people will come. It's somehow we're very tuned in to, we're interested here in the west in the meditation part, the personal part of the you know and that's okay. But that's why the week before the introductory course I do the actually the first week of the introductory course so that you know I can say that I taught the whole the whole path. But it's okay because it works the other way also that and this is what many many people here in the west have discovered is we enter into the world of meditation. And after a while the sensitivity that comes in meditation will sooner or later will force you to reevaluate your behavior. And hopefully because you've been using the mindfulness practice more deeply and more importantly reevaluate the motivations for your behavior. What's the impulse for the ways in which you behave? And then because of the meditation practice there is an interest in trying to begin to change or transform our motivations and our behavior in daily life. Who we are in meditation and who we are in daily life is really not any different. We're the same person so the capacity for wholeness capacity for calm and settledness and peace and being conflict free that can occur in meditation. We naturally want to begin exploring that and bring that kind of mindfulness that allows that to happen into our normal life. And if we bring it into our normal life then we have to sooner or later very honest who honestly look at those places in our life where there's conflict where there's tension. And our ethical behavior is one of those places. So sooner or later so here in the west we don't start with ethics we start with meditation but it brings us to the same place. Meditation is an ethical practice not because it's more realistic to do it and you should do it but rather it's ethical in a sense that transforms us from the inside. It transforms our motivation naturally so that I think that the sensitivity of the heart is more developed and the sentiments of compassion and care for people around us and for ourselves become stronger and stronger. But ethic is very important and just as a person can practice generosity not as a moral should but as a useful training. So a person can practice with ethics not as a moral should but as a training. And there's one other way to practice with ethics is to take the five precepts seriously and it doesn't have to be all at once even. It can be one you know one a week or one a month just okay this week I'm going to explore the first precept not to harm not to kill and really kind of explore that and kind of find out what my relationship to that precept is and how I feel about it and what is my motivation what's going on inside of me when I'm going to harm something when I you know some people want to kill the insects in their house or in the garden or maybe extend it to harming you know there's all kinds of ways in which we harm other people besides killing them. You know how do we feel about that what's our relationship to that to develop our sensitivity and a reflection on what it means to have reverence for life. I don't think sooner or later the meditation practice will transform you so you have phenomenally deep reverence for life. But you can also begin by exploring the question of life exploring the question of the kind of food you eat. If you eat animal food for example there's no moral obligation for Buddhists to avoid eating meat. But it might be a very interesting area of reflection for you. Maybe you'll learn a lot about yourself to explore that. Not stealing actually the precept for not stealing is to take what is not not to take what is not given. It's a little bit more inclusive than not stealing. It means if it hasn't been offered to you don't take it. And there's a lot of opportunities to look at this precept. I think there's all kinds of ways in which basically very decent and good people will still kind of take what is not offered. I know there was a one person recently who was practicing with his precept not taking what is not given. And he'd been given a pen at work. I guess it was kind of a nice pen but he was given a pen at work. And he was having lunch with his wife and his wife admired it and asked him if she could have it. And it threw him in his spin. And he said I don't think I can do that. It was given to me so I could use at work as part of my job. It's not for me it's not mine to give to you. She got a little bit pissed off. But you know so then he went back and he kind of conjured it for a while then he figured out well I think I think I have a way around this. What I can do is my boss really wants me to do my work. They gave me the pen to do the work but what they really want is to help me do the work. What I'll do is I'll go out and buy a pen for myself. I'll use that pen at work and that way I can give this pen to my wife. So it's kind of silly in a sense this whole thing but I thought it was really beautiful that someone is thinking that way. Is concerned about those kinds of things and beginning to kind of engage in the creative work of thinking about alternatives. It's really creative. Rather than taking it for granted it has to be a certain way. Are there alternative ways of being more virtuous and more ethical in our behavior? Sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct basically means sexual activity that causes someone else harm. So to commit ourselves for a week or a lifetime or many lifetimes to the practice of not harming others through our sexuality. Very powerful practice. It becomes a phenomenal mirror for many of us on our motivations and our impulses and our relationship to our desires. Because a lot of what Buddhist practice is about is to discover a liberated relationship to our desires. And then not lying, not exaggerating, not sliding with the truth. And intoxication. Yesterday someone called us at home and she was living in great distress. She had finally found herself a really steady partner she was living with for a long time now. After many many years of having a lot of very troubled relationships with man and never really finding one to settle into. And then she had gone out and gotten drunk. And in her drunk state she had gone necking some other guy. Necking and groping. And now she felt awful. And she felt that she had to tell her partner. But she didn't know what the consequences of that would be. And it was very dramatic in her case of how in her normal state of mind she never would have done that. But being drunk, her inhibition, not inhibition but her good judgment. Was put on hold. So the question of the precepts is a question or the issue of the precepts, an issue of helping us develop the goodness of our heart. It's certainly not an issue of judging ourselves or being critical of ourselves or measuring ourselves of how badly failed at living by the precepts. But it's like this wonderful container, this jewel of a box, jewel of a mirror that we use to live by to help us look inside and see what inside can be transformed. And that's really the heart of Buddhist spirituality is the inner transformation. And you don't have to practice the precepts because sooner or later the mindfulness will have the same effect, will transform you. But you get kind of a jump start. It's really phenomenal aid to the practice of mindfulness to use the mindfulness to help you focus on particular areas of your life. And one of the beautiful things that can happen is that you'll find that your virtue and your good behavior, your ethical behavior that comes from your virtue will bring you a sense of joy and peace and delight. And I think not many of us here in the West are disposed to feeling joy and delight in our inner virtue. In Buddhism you're encouraged to be disposed in that way. And it's actually possible to feel a kind of sense of well-being from becoming increasingly virtuous. Not again from kind of forcing yourself to be virtuous. You don't have it it be hypocritical about it, but rather from really being dishonest inner transformation. From the point of view of mindfulness it's better to be unethical and be totally honest that you're doing it than it is to be externally ethical but completely dishonest for what's really going on inside. So this movement towards a greater honesty and clarity and kind of cleanliness, kind of purification inside is the result of this practice of ethics. Now one of the interesting things about the precepts is that they're worded negatively. Not to kill, not to steal, not to lie, not to be involved in sexual misconduct, and not to be involved in intoxication. Some people protest, these Buddhists, they're always such a downer of a religion and they tell me what I can't do. And I'm kind of into affirmation of life. So I'm going to do away with these negative precepts, and I'm going to state them in positive terms rather than saying I'm going to not kill, I'm going to practice reverence for all of life. Rather than practicing not stealing, I'm going to practice generosity. Rather than practicing sexual misconduct, I'm going to practice loving relationships. They're beautiful sentiments, people want to do that. But we have actually very little, let's see, I say it carefully, the feelings and motivations that arise inside of us is often something we don't have much control over. So we can't will ourselves to be more loving, we can't will ourselves to have more reverence for life, we can't will ourselves to have more generous disposition, we can't will ourselves to be more loving towards our partners or whatever. It's a good thing to have, but you can't say, okay, I'm going to sit here and kind of, you know, turn it up. But we can practice I will not kill, I will not steal. We have veto power. Power, the tremendous power that we have as individual power is our power, we have the veto vote. It's not our responsibility what impulses arise inside of us, what thoughts and what feelings, what desires arise inside of us. And hopefully the practice of mindfulness will teach you that you can be really generous to yourself. And free in yourself to let whatever arises inside of you, come and let it come. Let's horrible, evil bubble up inside of you, let great angelic things bubble up inside of you. Just let it get it's okay. But we always remember that you have the veto power. And the veto power is one that says, I'm not going to act on this. It's fine for this to bubble up, but I'm not going to act on it. So why one of the reasons why the precepts are stated negatively is they're realistic in that sense. They're actually pointing to what we can actually do. We can actually have the veto. Oh, I might feel like killing that guy. But no, I'm not going to. You might feel like you want to kill someone, and then you tell yourself, I'm supposed to be loving. And you're going to be like, and then you can tell yourself, I'm supposed to be loving or compassionate. It might be hard to generate that, you know? But rather, so the veto power is actually what we can do. The mind is kind of like a board of a major corporation, or maybe nonprofit. I don't know where the most conflict is. But the mind is kind of like a board, and all these people on the board have all these opinions and voices and desires and wishes. And you're like the chair of the board. And the chair of the board has veto power. So use your tremendous ability to have a veto for your benefit. And if you find that having a veto feels confining or frustrating, the greater the frustration, probably the more useful it is to go really deep inside of you, to see what's really going on. What's the impulse really, the heart of the frustration? What's the fear? What's the sense of insecurity? What's the loneliness that's there? So I have no idea whether I've succeeded in conveying to you that the ethical practices of Buddhism probably can convey to you that the Buddhists think they're important. But what I really want to convey to you is that they're joyful, that they're a delight, and that you can take them all and be interested in them from the point of view of that real kind of appreciation. Wow, this is something I can do, and this is really something that I can do for myself, for people around me, in a way that brings joy and delight, and even a sense of eagerness. Yeah, this is really great. So if I didn't manage to convey that, then I hope that sooner or later you'll discover that for yourself. So that's my thoughts on ethics for today. It's kind of a general introduction, and maybe it'll spur you to greater consideration of the topic. Yes, please. With respect to your precepts about not taking that which is not often, how does asking for what you want or need fit into that concept? Oh, asking, saying, this is just expressing, stating if you have a desire, a wish, or a need, and then letting the other person respond. And if the person doesn't know you have a need, then they can't give it to you. I'm sure that if I told Ajahn Amara how much I needed that personal digital assistant, he probably would have given to me, but I didn't let on. Who makes the veto? Who does the vetoing? Why do you ask? Because in the context that you expressed it with the precepts of not killing and not stealing, it's very easy to side with that. Easy to side with? The vetoing. I'm not going to do that. Meaning you can see that this is a better thing to do, to not do it. But for myself, I feel a lot of times that I veto things that maybe I should do. Which can be outside just by precepts. So you have to be something ethical. Well, yeah, if I may, the people who are repressed or self-denying are also exercising a veto power, but they're using the veto power in unhealthy and useful ways. And now in relationship to the precepts, it's also possible to use the veto power over the precepts in an unwise way. By just knowing, oh, the Buddha says don't take what's not given, so I'm not going to do that. But really, you kind of force yourself into that position. Okay, I'm not going to be that kind of virtuous person and not do it. But there's no attempt to understand oneself more deeply. It's kind of like holding a dam, putting your finger in the dike or something. It's like holding the pressures. I'm not going to do that. No way. And your person only gets tense then. And I think it's going to bound to backfire. We don't want to do it in kind of forced way. We want to use that veto power in a wise way, which is really not to do something, but then to use that no as a mirror to try to understand more deeply what's going on. Does it make some sense? And for people who use the veto power excessively, the other members of the board have to have a serious discussion with the chair and say, you know, you need to lighten up a little bit here and not be so serious, or not be so afraid. Yes. When you're talking about generosity, I'm just thinking about salary negotiation. What kind of negotiation? Salary. Salary negotiation. No. I was thinking that from your side, you want to go for the most, which is not really generous to the company. You know, if I want to practice generosity and I want to do these negotiations, I don't think about these until today. I don't feel qualified to answer that question, but I think that there are in different areas of life, there are games that people play. And if you're going to participate in that game, you should play by the rules. So, for example, when I was younger and when I was 19, I traveled around Morocco. And I was a very good bargainer because I kind of figured out how to play the game really well. And so I got really good prices from things. And I didn't feel like I was ungenerous. In a sense, I just said, they're playing a game and if I was going to enter their world, I had to know the rules and I had to play the game as well as them. I wasn't being greedy. I was just, okay, I'm just going to play the game well. I think if I went to Morocco now, I would probably be more interested in being generous. And I wouldn't care so much about getting the best deal. That's because I don't have the same need. When I was 19 in Morocco, I was dirt poor. So with salaries, solid negotiation, I think it's a game. It's a very important game. And you're expected to hold up your end of the game. And you can do that with compassion and kindness and all those things, but also with great firmness and use your wits. I don't think it has to be understood as being ungenerous. What? It can be. It can be. It can be phenomenally greedy. It could be, you know, miserably greedy to try to get the most amount of salary, but it doesn't have to be. And I think if the game requires this negotiation, then you have to figure out how to go into it wisely and also to know what you're willing to accept and what you're not willing to accept. And rather than kind of going for the most possible, go for what you need and what you're willing to accept. Yes, please. I wonder what's the antidote for self-focusing, self-loathing, and self-cherishing. Would it all be the same? Oh, that's a very good point. If a person is involved with self-loathing, then self-cherishing can be the flip side of that. And actually, that kind of self-cherishing might actually not be so healthy, because it's a kind of reflection on gratitude. Reflect on what you're grateful for. Reflect on things that you can be grateful for. Our lives are supported and sustained by many, many people. And just start thinking about the people who've made your life possible and support your life. Simple things as the person who brings you your mail. Someone brings you your mail. Someone brings you your bills. Can you hear me? No. And so, gratitude is a very powerful practice. And there are some schools of Buddhism that use gratitude as the primary antidote for what you brought up. Yes. I lost that. Self-cherishing and self-loathing were both on the not desirable side. They can be, yeah. Can you expand on that more? That doesn't make sense. Real nice thing to do? Self-cherishing is needed if you're un-cherishing to yourself. But if you're not un-cherishing, there's no need for it to be cherished yourself. Just go ahead with your life. Thank you. Don't bother with it. But if you're not feeling worthy, you're good enough. Yeah. So what happens is if you're not feeling good enough for unworthy, that's a doing that we're doing. Okay? You activated something inside of you. And where self-cherishing can be unhealthy is that we simply use it as a counter to the unworthiness. Kind of as affirmation. But still we're left in this system of trying to build up a certain kind of self. And so we tried to find ways to self-cherish. We tried to build and create this affirmation as a strong sense of self. But it's another kind of doing. And it creates this kind of tension with the first doing. And then the pendulum is just set up to kind of swing back and forth. Because now we've become a self-cherishing kind of person, and that has to be held into place for a lot. But life is not very kind to any kind of fixed identity. So then that's not going to be very, it's going to be fragile. That's going to swing over to the other side. And so what Buddhism encourages you to do is to actually step outside of that system entirely. And so it pulled the rug from underneath your self-concept. So you're not living in the game of self-concept. And part of the power of meditation is to give us, hopefully with time, an experience of our self which is unmediated, which is not mediated through a concept of self. And this for some people gives them a radically new way of living, of feeling who they are. And then you discover meditation, oh, I can survive and be quite content and happy without any image of myself or any idea of who I am. Now let me see if I can go out and function in the world without carrying some notion of who I think I'm supposed to be. So self-cherishing in the extreme form can be narcissism. It could also be narcissism. But we have to be a little bit careful with these words because they can have different references for different people. Right? And there are also healthy forms of self-cherishing. So I know I want to traumatize all of it. But she used, she talked about something all in one sentence. So I kind of took it as one package that I'll function together. Yes. I want to thank you, Gil, for filling me time with two topics that I've been grappling with in my practice. And that was the issue of interpersonal payoffs or aspects of why I do using meditation. And I think that's something I like to hear more often because I tend to be more, I think, in a judgment here, but a lot of narcissism, a lot of easy, it's very easy for me to take this practice as a real personal trick and not have any personal requirements or demands or obligations. And I think that's what I was taking out of your mentioning about that tonight. And the other theme you talked about that I've been grappling with is the idea about joy. And seeing where does joy happen in all of this? And I see what you were saying, that joy comes to pay off, practicing your practice. It doesn't come to something that you would get by coming into this room for two or three nights a week, wherever it is. Right. And it was nice to hear those two themes dressed because I was trying to get some understanding of how I could wear, one of the years, and it was narcissistic, hey, why am I not getting more joy? Yeah, I'm doing some of the things in my daily life of people that I need in interactions and so on. I can see where your forms take true. But it's interesting to see, now there's the answer to the joy question. One of the reflections that Buddhists sometimes encourage people to do is to reflect both on your own virtues. Good qualities. And also to reflect on the good deeds you've done. And rather than being kind of unhealthy form of self-cherishing, it could be, but it's also going to be a very healthy move to have a realistic sense of who you are and to have appreciation of the good qualities inside of you. It doesn't have to be narcissistic at all. Just wow, you know. So I mean, to actually do some things in life, more ethically or actually do acts of generosity. And then to give yourself credit for that, spend some time reflecting and thinking, well, give yourself the opportunity to enjoy and appreciate these acts or these kinds of inner life can bring joy. And I know that a lot of people in the West find it very odd and kind of, isn't it selfish to think about your own good qualities? It can be, but it doesn't have to be. And if you avoid it entirely, you're avoiding one of the sources for joy. And then the last thing I'll say is, I think I would prefer joy or be self-cherishing any day. So let's sit just quietly for two minutes.
