 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. This morning, part of what we're cultivating here is mindfulness, not just mindfulness, but a stable mindfulness, a mindfulness which has some steadiness in the present moment. Sometimes that stability and that steadiness is called samadhi. How do you cultivate steadiness, stability here in the present moment so the mind doesn't wander off a lot into thought? There are many answers to that question. One of the things is that these qualities of stability, steadiness, concentration, tranquility, they're all kind of related. When they start appearing a little bit, they have symptoms. There's evidence in the body that this is happening. One of the ways of cultivating more of them is to notice those symptoms in the body or in the mind and then rest in them or open up to them or let them support you to continue to be steady like an encouragement, like, I'm on track here, let's open to this or study myself in these feelings. You have a different reference point for where the mind can be resting than resting in your thoughts, like getting involved and getting distracted. Those symptoms might be very simple. You've been sitting long enough, maybe after 10 minutes, that you feel a little bit more stillness in your body that feels soft and comfortable. And that stillness, physical stillness, if it's comforting, that becomes the support for further stillness. You might feel calmer and that calmness is support for more calmness. So don't try to hang on to it, don't focus on it, don't try to do something with it, except to feel it and let it kind of fill you or let it kind of pervade in some nice, gentle, simple way. There might be some feelings associated with breathing, if you're focusing on breathing, that breathing starts feeling a little bit nice. There's kind of an influence on breathing or an after effect of breathing or on the edges of breathing that feels like it's kind of a softness or a lightness or a kind of feeling of light or ease or glow or some pleasure with it. So if there's some pleasure that comes with this feeling of steadiness and stability of concentration, to let that support you. So there's a lot of symptoms that might happen. Some of them can be quite subtle. And there's an art to not ignoring them, but not focusing on them, not trying to make them big, but also not getting in their way of them there to support you. Oh yeah, this is good, like a cheerleader. Oh, this is good. So they're there in the peripheral of attention. Oh yeah, I'm on the right track, this is good. Let me stay close to this as I breathe and focus on breathing. Let me stay close to these feelings that are kind of good, that come with the meditation practice. So if that happens to you, then you can maybe support you in both walking meditation and sitting. And if what I say doesn't make much sense, you're welcome just to forget it. So thank you.
