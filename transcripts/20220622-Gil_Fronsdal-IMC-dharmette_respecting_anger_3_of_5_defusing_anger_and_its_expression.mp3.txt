The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning, good day, good evening, and so we're continuing with this
discussion of anger and I said now that anger is a sign and one way of saying
a message and one way of understanding that is that it's a sign that
something is wrong somewhere or other something is wrong and some wisdom is
needed to not assume automatically that what's wrong is out in the world or to
assume automatically that what's wrong is within oneself but it's a sign that
something is off that something needs attention and one of the first things to
do is to learn from it find out what it is to stop and take a good look what's
really going on here and when we meditate especially this is a great place
because we don't have to then hopefully when meditating saying things to anyone
or do anything in the world you can just really be present and feel it be so we
want to learn from it one of the things to learn is that how anger motivates us
and that's part of the danger of anger that sometimes anger comes with very
strong motivation to do something to say something just very forcefully to
someone or to act forcefully or something and and and when the
motivation sometimes has the upper hand and that's why for example example
expressions of anger speaking angrily people lose touch with themselves as
they say it the motivation is so strong and so powerful that they don't really
know what's happening in their body and their hearts their minds they've lost
sometimes in extreme versions they've kind of possessed by anger and they
don't have not really touched into what's happening here and this losing
touch with oneself when we're angry is a great hindrance a great shortcoming the
wisdom the clarity the ability to be able to act wisely and speak wisely in the
world happens a lot from being grounded in one's body to be present here and and
that can happen even when we're angry and that's why we won't lose ourselves in
the anger and so training ourselves to kind of be in the body stay present so
it helps to think of of anger as being a part of part of what anger is is if
there's a motivation in it and to ask yourself what is the motivation here
what is the desire what's the wish that you see happen and and regardless of
what the degree of anger might be it could be irritation it could be and no
even annoyance I think relatively mild what is that this becomes particularly
important when anger annoyance irritation is hostility has become is a low
key and chronic and so it has nothing to do with any particular incident that's
happened but rather it has to do with it become a way of living a way of kind of
an attitude which we have and the whole assessment of chronic anger hostility is
very different than the analysis or the consideration of incident specific anger
where there's something happening right in front of us and the chronic that goes
on for a long time that's that is particularly debilitating that tends to
have a powerful force to help people actually not be in touch with themselves
that they might feel the opposite because the energy of anger is so strong
that they feel humming with it but actually there's there's such a big
cost we lose something the Buddha gave this list of the downsides of anger of
being angry especially maybe chronic anger that maybe he gave it to
people to motivate them to do something about their anger not to live this way
and so he said that the ill effects of anger include looking ugly being in
pain making mistakes the loss of property falls into disputes and
disgrace loss of friends and then rebirth in hell so the so I don't know
if that motivated some of you like oh wow all those things can be there with
anger chronic I think of it as chronic anger this kind of persistent stream of
it so so one of the ways to respect anger is I think I believe is not to give
into it as a motivational force to say or do something but rather take the time
to feel it and to know it and to feel and know it in the body and the body can
process this the body knows how to unfold and relax and open up and reveal
and and sometimes when we just take the time to sit down and feel anger in the
body it gets stronger there can be murderous rage that arises but when
you're sitting still maybe that's the and that's the whatever has happened is
so powerful that something has been is erupting inside of us and we and if
we're not acting on it or expressing it meditation is about letting that
eruption happen or meditation about letting the whole thing dissipate and
dissolve because sometimes what keeps it going is telling yourself stories
repeating ourselves that the injury that's been done or it's the repetition
of certain trains of thought which keeps the anger the annoyance the irritation
going and so to sit quietly and feel it in the body is an alternative to all
those stories and then the body then you can allow the body to do what it wants
to do you know the deeper process to do what it was to do and it might be an
eruption or it might be dissolving and it's not your job to choose which it is
but to really be attuned to see what needs to happen here and hopefully be
quiet enough still enough go for a walk long enough that you allow the whole
process to to maybe come to some completion in ordinary life especially
with incident-specific anger and we have to kind of act on things it's very
useful to learn how to diffuse the anger how to be with the anger so that it
doesn't automatically trigger motive motivational actions we'd say or do
things and here again training ourselves so it's second nature to be
mindful of the body so we feel what's happening the body can be a source of
stability come back to the body and just sit be or stand feel you feel your feet
on the ground the body can also be the means by which we diffuse some of the
energy of anger some of the tension and motivational force of anger that
interferes with our ability to really be attuned more deeply what's happening
attuned to the deeper emotions that might really be that bigger issue that's
happening more attuned to the situation we're in and to take a better look at
what's happening more attuned to ourselves to if we're if the anger
arises because of a story we're telling ourselves to question the story is that
the right perspective that we have so to tune into the body and then to find ways
to diffuse some of that energy of anger by relaxing breathing breathing breathing
breathing deeply and relaxing breathing and relaxing on the exhale breathing and
feeling the expansion of the rib cage in the torso as a way of kind of grounding
yourself in the body and feeling something that's really primary the
primary experience of breathing notice your posture when you're angry maybe the
posture is one that is not doesn't lend itself to diffusion to settling if you're
you know both both hands are in a fist it may be it's not that difficult to
relax the fist to relax the hand to open it and doing that as part of the
diffusion process settling it to quieting down and diffusion is not the
same thing as repression or denial or escaping from it diffusion is to settle
some of them some of the ways in which we're getting disconnected from ourselves
and to feel more deeply what's happening to be more present and to settle the
trick the motivational triggers that might come with with anger so that we're
not speaking from the anger or acting from the anger and and we can kind of
feel and sense what's going on and so finding out where you are each of us
probably has our own specialty of where in the body anger is most expressed it
might be tension tightness in the belly it might be in the chest it might be in
the face or the jaws might be in the hands sometimes the eyes I've seen
angry people in their eyes or feel so tense and fixed and locked in it might
be somehow in the forehead and places where we get headaches because of all
the the tension associated with maybe irritation and anger so wherever your way
is your place get to know it so that when you go about your life and it's an
incident of anger you know to go to that place and maybe relax and settle the
learned skills of diffusion lose skill learned skills of being grounded in the
present so that anger doesn't get the upper hand so that you can learn from
the anger rather than act on the anger the expression of anger is not something
what we want to do very often I once asked one my Buddhist teachers if it
was ever appropriate to express anger and the teacher says I said something I
forgot exactly that the date the time frame but the teacher said yes once in a
blue moon once at once in a great while like once every you know five years or
something so I don't know if that guideline is the right one but it was
fascinating to me this idea there might be a time but not that often and so to
have the ability to step back and the advantage of that is that if anger
involves something that needs to be addressed in our life it's often addressed
much more usefully motivated by other emotions and feelings and ideas than the
motivations that come from anger itself so again it's not denying the incident
was anger producing it's not denying the difficulty of the anger but it's
questioning the motivational value of anger and that's where it's very rare
that the anger is useful as a motivational force some people are quick
to defend anger because a lot of good gets done in the world with anger that
people are motivated for justice and fight for it so there may be that's good
but it's not so healthy for the person who's angry and I feel a little sad when
people justify anger for that reason what I wish they would do instead is find
an equal or even stronger motivation from compassion don't set up anger as don't
justify anger if there are better motivations to get the job done so
diffusing anger so for this next day you might that if you find yourself
irritated annoyed angry rageful simmering resentful whatever about you
might feel today see what you can do by tuning into your body and like we did
in the guided meditation tune into what's going on in the body really well
and see what the body wants to do see if the body wants to relax see if the body
wants to be energized if you're if you do this during a walk as I've said
before I process strong anger with walks I just about but there's a body want to
walk faster does a walk slower what what does a body want to do here to and and
then also explore where can you relax what settles you into with the emotion
and this is a personal skill that each person needs to learn for themselves so
how do you diffuse anger so thank you
