Sit in a comfortable and alert posture. 
And gently close your eyes. 
Take a few deep breaths and with each exhale, settle into your body, relaxing any obvious tension or holding. 
Allow the breath to return to normal. 
And get a general sense of how you feel right now. 
How is your energy? Do you feel relaxed? Do you feel alert? See if you can get a global awareness of your whole body. 
Allow your attention to wonder around the body, feeling it, sensing it. 
Relax where you can let go of. 
If it's not possible to relax an area of tension, that's okay. 
Just try to soften around it. 
Now bring your attention to your breathing or ever the breath is easiest to notice. 
And allow that area to be your home, your anchor, the center of your attention. 
Stay focused. 
Stay focused on the sensations of breathing. 
Keep your attention connected with the physical sensations of each breath. 
Stay connected with the entire length of each breath. 
Notice the gaps between the breaths. 
Stay focused. 
If the mind wanders away, gently bring it back to the breath. 
There's no need to judge the wandering mind. 
Just allow your mind to rest on the breath.

Thank you for watching. 
Now bring to mind the quality of alertness, energy, vitality. 
If those qualities are not strong right now, encourage those feelings without forcing them. 
Alertness, energy, vitality. 
Incline the mind in that direction. 
If it's helpful, breathe a little deeper for several breaths. 
It doesn't matter how much energy you're able to bring forth. 
What matters is what is the best energy you can bring to this. 
Thank you for watching. 
Thank you for watching. 
Now bring to mind an attitude of being relaxed at ease. 
An attitude of acceptance. 
There's nothing to resist. 
Just being okay with whatever is going on within you. 
Applying the mind towards relaxation. 
Thank you for watching. 
Notice how your energy is. 
Are you alert? Are you relaxed? If you're leaning in one direction or the other, can you incline the mind back towards balance so that it's both relaxed and alert? If it's helpful, breathe a little deeper for several breaths. 
Thank you for watching. 
Thank you for watching.

For the last two minutes, see if you can stay connected with every breath.
