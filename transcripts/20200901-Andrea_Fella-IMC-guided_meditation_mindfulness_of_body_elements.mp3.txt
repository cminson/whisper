The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
These morning sessions, the last little while, I've been exploring four foundation,
I'm sorry, not the four foundation, so four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path,
and we've been exploring wise mindfulness, in particular mindfulness of the body.
So in the guided meditation, I'll offer a particular exploration that is offered
in the Satipa Tadasuta around the body, and that's the elements practice.
So I'll talk a little bit more about it in terms of the context and everything,
but think of it in the guided meditation as a kind of an exploration of the felt
sense in the body, that what we could call the elemental actual bodily experience.
But we'll begin with relaxation, because no matter what kind of exploration we are
doing in mindfulness, it's very supportive to begin with a body and mind that relax,
which then allows us to be more available to notice what's happening to receive
our experience.
And so finding a posture that feels both easeful and yet alert,
sometimes finding a posture that expresses dignity can encompass both of these together,
relaxed and alert.
We can explore relaxing the body and being aware while relaxing.
Connecting, perhaps scanning through the body, exploring if there are places of tension
and whether they might be able to be softened and relaxed.
So perhaps checking in the face, the head, maybe that area can soften, relax.
Maybe there can be a softening around the eyes, around the mouth, the jaw.
Softening the neck and shoulders, the arms, the hands.
Relaxing the chest and upper back, softening the muscles around the rib cage.
Perhaps the stomach, the abdomen can relax.
Maybe the middle and lower back can relax.
The hips, seeing if the hips can soften the legs, the feet.
And maybe there can be a softening inside the body.
Maybe the inside of the throat can relax.
Maybe the heart can relax.
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax.
Then perhaps too, the mind can relax.
Recognizing that the awareness has been supporting you through this process of allowing relaxation, exploring relaxation.
Aware, while relaxing.
With awareness we can become aware of our experience in the present moment, the processes of body and mind that are happening here and now.
It can be useful to become curious and familiar with the experience, the actual experience of bodily sensations.
This helps the mind begin to tease apart what experience, what parts of the experience are related to the body and what parts are connected to our minds.
This may seem like something that's easy to recognize the difference between what's the body and what's the mind.
But our minds actually confuse this quite a bit.
Attuning to our bodily experience, getting familiar with the sensation level of experience can be very helpful.
And so, with this next part of our time together, opening the awareness to the physicality of the body.
Receiving the experience of body.
The Buddha offered some simple explorations of our physical experience.
He offered this in the language of his day through the elements, earth element, the body.
The presence of the solidity perhaps of the body might be available.
Sensations like heaviness.
As I name these, just you don't have to look for them, just see if there's a resonance as I name each one.
A sense of touching into that aspect of the physical part of the experience.
Solidity, heaviness, hardness, softness.
You might have a sense of the weight of your body as it rests on the earth, on the ground.
Earth, resting on earth.
You might have a sense of the solidity or the structure of the skeleton of the bones that allow us to be upright.
Again, not trying hard, but just seeing if there's a sense of the aspect of experience connected to solidity, weight.
Earth, resting on earth.
Earth, resting on earth.
And then there's a different aspect of experience.
The aspect connected with movement.
And this, the Buddha called the air element. Perhaps sensations of tingling, vibration, pulsing.
The movement perhaps of the breath, the expansion, the contraction of the chest while you breathe.
A sense of the air flowing through your throat.
Your mouth, your nose.
Maybe a sense, a broader sense of the feelings in the body.
A field of vibration.
Pulsing, tingling.
You might notice this in a broader area of your body or maybe just in a smaller area such as your hands.
This, the air element, the Buddha called this the air element, the aspect of movement.
And then there is the area, aspect of temperature.
You might notice heat or coolness. Perhaps areas of warmth in some parts of your body that are covered by clothes.
Maybe coolness on areas that are exposed.
And then there's the area of fluidity, of water.
You might experience this as moisture, stickiness.
This can be obvious in areas of tears or saliva, perspiration.
You can explore perhaps this in your mouth noticing whether there's moisture or dryness there.
So, receiving the experience of body, this kind of exploration helps us to drop underneath the concepts around the body.
The concept of hand or shoulder or foot to the sensation level of experience.
Just receiving perhaps the body in terms of pressure, hardness, softness, vibration, coolness, heat, movement.
Exploring this way the body kind of communicates with us at this level of sensation.
Thank you.
