Okay, so hello and welcome everyone to Happy Hour.
So lovely to see you, to be with you at this time wherever you are joining from this world
and whatever the weather might be externally and internally wherever you are.
So for tonight's practice, I'd like to invite our attention to the joy of generosity, joy of generosity
in a particular way to actually treat, not just generosity, because when I say generosity, maybe what is conjured up in many people's minds is giving, giving money, giving resources, giving gifts.
I'm not just talking about that. Yes, that of course is one aspect of generosity, but generosity includes so much more.
Really, it's generosity of spirit, generosity of our heart and the way that we can give others the benefit of the doubt in the way that, say, when we see someone else's success, we can feel happy for them,
even if it's something that we would want, we don't say, oh, well, I wish my name was there, you actually have the sense of generosity. Oh, yay, yay.
Feeling happy, so muddita, vicarious joy as an act of generosity of spirit, as if it were your own goodness, as if it were your own well-being, your own happiness, your own success.
Because really, on the ultimate level, there is no separation between you and the other.
There is no self and the other or the given or the gift or the receiver or the giver. We are so intricately, amazingly interconnected that, again, through our limited sense of this human life, we see our separation, me, you,
mine, yours, etc., and on an ultimate level, it's all us, it's all this goodness, this beauty of divinity, of Buddha nature, whatever word you want to call it by,
that it expresses itself through these actions of kindness, generosity, goodness, goodwill.
And one way, again, that could be seen is that we do, in our limited perception, until our perception opens up, or there might be many moments that actually our perception opens up and maybe closes down again, that we do, we practice, we keep practicing,
we incline our minds as a way of expressing this goodness, this ultimate goodness and beauty in all of us.
And another way also to see that is that generosity, goodness, beauty, all these beautiful
goodnesses in the world need to be expressed through us beings. So, in some ways, it is said that divinity needs us to express itself.
Divinity, Buddha nature, goodness, God, whatever words you want to put it, needs us humans to express love, to express goodness, to express generosity, to express giving others the benefit of the doubt.
So, it is actually through our being and through our these seemingly small actions of every day that goodness is co-created, it is expressed in the world.
So, I'll pause, there are so many ideas there, these are some things I've been sitting with in my own practice. So, I'd like to invite you to let the words drop away now, so much.
And let's just practice, let's just practice with some of these themes, let's practice with some of these themes that I will invite us and if you're new, great, whatever you need to know will be shared with you during the guided meditation.
So, landing, arriving, arriving in your seat, arriving in your body, letting go, letting go of all the words, letting go of thoughts.
Arriving, arriving here, in this moment, in this body, this human body, breathing, sitting.
Just here, wonderfully here, connecting with each in and out breath in the abdomen just to settle in and arrive some more, to tell the soil of presence, here, here.
Now, now.
This breath, this breath.
You're seeing through your lungs, your body, feeling it with oxygen, both yours and not yours.
Can you receive this gift in this moment of appreciation?
This gift of this breath.
Each moment, a fresh gift.
A new arrival.
Each breath.
This breath.
This in-breath.
This out-breath.
Receiving generosity offered to us is just as important of having a generous heart, of generosity that gives,
both receiving and giving.
Receiving, opening up our senses to receive.
The good that's offered in this moment, not making pain, suffering, challenges, the only measure of our attention.
Opening up our senses.
Yes, there might be challenges, difficulty, heartbreak, heartache.
That too, that too, and goodness.
The gifts of this moment.
A body that works well enough, a mind that is clear enough.
Enough safety to be sitting and practicing.
Safety from the elements in this moment.
Enough sustenance to feel this body and the gift of this breath, this air.
This life, this being alive.
Relaxing the body.
Receiving, opening the heart to receive.
And appreciating the goodness in this moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now as we feel, we feel our lungs, our lungs are filled on their own.
Their body is nourished by oxygen by the gifts of this moment.
Fighting our heart to open and share its goodness as an expression, as a reflection.
Perhaps even as a wholesome duty.
To our inner goodness.
In our buddha, buddha nature, or the divine, whatever words we call it.
To allow our hearts to express.
Co-create goodness, kindness, generosity by bringing to mind someone who has some good fortune.
Perhaps starting with someone easy.
They don't have to have good fortune in every aspect of their life, but some aspect that's going well.
As if it were ours, as if it were our happiness, our goodness. Celebrating.
It is ours. Others' happinesses are our happiness.
For a moment, what if we just dropped, just simply dropped the sense of separation.
It is our goodness. It is our happiness to celebrate. It is our joy.
I am happy for you. I am so happy for you.
As if it were my own happiness. It is my own happiness.
I wish you happiness to increase.
I wish this happiness, not yours or mine. I wish this goodness to increase.
I wish this goodness, happiness to never end.
May it continue.
May it never cease. May it grow.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now if you wish, maybe moving to someone who's just a little more challenging,
still bringing to mind their good fortune, their gladness, as if it were your own.
No separation, this human family.
And again, if this relationship you're about to bring up, there's been some hurt, not to condone.
See, perhaps unskillful and hurtful behavior.
And can we still relate?
Is it possible, maybe not, in this relationship, in which case it's okay, don't judge yourself,
but is it okay to still relate to this person's humanity, feel happy for their happiness,
good fortune, knowing that there might be some repair, some forgiveness.
It still needs work that isn't just swept under the carpet.
It's acknowledged, but we can still have the spaciousness and the heart to feel happy for this being.
You might be surprised.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm happy for this happiness,
for this good fortune.
The world may increase, may it never end.
I'm happy for your happiness.
Taking your place, as if it were my own.
We are not so different to you and I, after all, as human beings.
We have so much more in common in our humanity.
Having bodies that hurt, that age, that die,
hopes, aspirations, challenges, pain, sorrow.
I can be happy for your happiness, for your goodness.
May there be more of it for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Is it possible to see yourself in the shoes of the other person living their life with their hopes and dreams, their challenges, their physicality?
As the life is so random, you could have been born as them, they could have been born as you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You could have had the same perspective on life as they do.
Opinions, behavior.
We are such a product of our environment.
Our culture, our family, our upbringing, our genes.
It's all dependently arisen, dependent on so many causes and conditions.
Can you take their perspective?
Even if so different from yours?
From this perspective, letting there be generosity of spirit of heart, as much as it's available right now.
For the last minute of this practice period, being generous towards yourself for whatever this practice period was or wasn't, distracted, sleepy, it's okay, it's okay.
You did your best, you planted seeds, and that's more than good enough.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
So we have a few minutes for reflections, for questions, comments, and in the spirit of offering your reflections for the benefit of sangha community, if there was an aha moment, or if there was even something challenging or difficult.
Richard, see your hand, please.
Am I unmuted? Yes, you are unmuted.
Oh, one of my teachers, who loves to teach the parames, is always telling us that gratitude, she considers gratitude the 11th pyramid, and when you were talking about receiving generosity, it rang a bell for me, because she's really getting it, she really is having us get into gratitude practice all the time.
Yeah, yeah, great. Yeah, it's so interesting because, yes, there's so many places that gratitude fits in the practices. I mean, one place is, as you said, teacher of yours, putting it as the 11th pyramid, for those who may not be familiar with that terms, is 10 teachings, the 10 perfections, 10 qualities of the heart.
And also, so it's a perfection, it's a beautiful quality of the heart.
Also, another couple of places, and one place that actually I usually put it, is in the Brahma Viharas, in the four Brahma Viharas, with muddita, with vicarious joy, when you feel happy for the happiness, for the good fortune of others, when you turn it to yourself, when you're happy for the good fortune of yourself,
oh, that's gratitude, it becomes gratitude, you become grateful, there's no other way to be happy for your own good fortune, without it being expressed or felt as gratitude.
So, so given that this is happy hour and we covered Brahma Viharas, gratitude is definitely part of the Brahma Viharas, so that's something else for you to bring in also to further, further plant in your practice, Richard. Thank you.
Bell, I see your hand, please. And there. I was able to think of the first person that to have joy for, muddita for. The second person, I wasn't able to come up with a distinct person that I knew was doing better, or I knew how they were doing and who I had difficulties with.
And I ended up cycling through a number of people that I, you know, where I had, maybe not the best relations. The odd thing was it actually came much easier than I thought it would be possible.
So I don't know that I followed instructions, but it actually went okay.
I love that bill. That's fantastic. That is so great. Yay. You know, as you know by now, these practices take some creativity and I just love that you didn't give up like, well, I don't have a person, okay, I'm done.
This is hard. I can't, you know, like, oh, well, let me, let me try it in this other way. Let me kind of cycle through these people like, great, fantastic. And creativity is absolutely encouraged.
And what I love about your practice report is that it was easier than you thought. Like, yes, you could feel happy for these persons, for these persons that you had some, you know, a little bit of unresolved something with. Beautiful.
What a lovely report. Thank you, Bill.
Thank you.
And Deborah, I see your hand, please.
Well, similarly, I, but I found it sad that I couldn't find a lot of people in my kind of in my close circle that are really thriving right now.
It's quite the opposite. And, but what was helpful was toward the end, you talked about just finding generosity for people and there had been today a few people that really irked me, just really let me down, you know, and so
then I realized, oh, I can use the generosity there too. So that was helpful.
Nice.
But I had to search for people like way outside of my people I don't even know, you know, like, successful, whatever's.
Yeah.
And I know that if I knew them, I would realize there probably wasn't anything to, to practice with, because I think a lot of people, you know,
having challenges. So this is what I'll say actually, Deborah, I appreciate that you brought this in. And this is a line of invitation or instruction I fit.
But it might have been just once and it might have gone unnoticed, which was the person may not be happy in every aspect of their life.
There could be just one aspect of their life that they're happy about. So, so that's what actually makes this practice
work. Otherwise, you're right. If you, you know people well, you love them and you know everybody has sorrows, everybody has challenges.
There's not a single person, especially the time of the pandemic right now, it's like, oh, yeah, this is great. And like me, your happiness and every aspect of your life increase.
So don't try to do the practice that way. Don't. Because as you said, that's the problem you would run into.
Like, maybe some, I don't know, figures out there whose lives I don't really know. Yeah, maybe they're happy, but, but find someone for the first part of the practices that you know, and, and there's an aspect of their life that's going well.
So yes, maybe they're having financial trouble. Maybe, you know, their health is not great, but oh, they're in this really loving relationship that really supports them.
May your happiness continue. May it never end. So you see that the modification there. Yeah. And so may that help that work better for you. Yeah.
Great. Yeah. So you say you're, if you want to add more, you're welcome to. You found that you were happy for them. Yeah, I found that I couldn't find the places where I wasn't feeling happy for their happiness.
Like, yeah, I would think of people that have, you know, success in some area that I'm still working on, but I do feel happy for them.
So it was really a stretch to like say, Oh, but I mean, I'm kind of thinking of it as jealousy. I see. I see. I understand now what you, what you're saying and the distinction.
I see it wasn't every aspect of their life. It was that, well, yeah, even the things you would like in your life when they have them, you're still happy for them.
Beautiful. What a beautiful, you know, how beautiful to, to, to know and probably you already know it, but also rediscover, reconnect with that generosity of your own heart.
Wow. Even, I, even though I want this for myself, I have, you know, I can be generous with this. I don't have to get jealous or envious or tight.
Beautiful. That's lovely.
It happens though, but it just didn't happen tonight. I'm sure it happens. I'm not, you know, perfect here.
None of us are, are perfectly enlightened. And yet it's, let's celebrate the areas. Let's celebrate the areas of our heart that are generous. Yeah.
Thank you for, I know you're trying to bring in humility. Yes. And, and also let's celebrate, celebrate beauty where there's Melanie, I see your hand.
I will make this last comment before we go into groups, please.
I'm amazed that everyone here, how generous and a quantum is everyone.
Well, I was like struggling. But I kind of had two examples that I noticed the difference. One of them was like the person I talked to.
And it's very future looking like the thing that she has that is making her happy. I hope to like one day have a future.
And so then it was like really easy to like feel very warm and comforted and it felt very like not zero.
And then I noticed the contrast with another person I was thinking of where I was like, it should be easy. I should be happy.
It felt stuck. I was like, oh, but I'm kind of annoyed because I used to have that thing and now I don't have it anymore.
And like, should I go back to having that thing. So like, the past looking wine felt like more of a comparison or stuff, even though that also wasn't a zero something.
Like the thing that she has, I could also have something in the future and her having it doesn't prevent it.
So it was this interesting contrast that there might be something there like it's easier to, you know, like the difference of how it feels to have to feel something that's gratitude but it's truly doesn't feel like a zero something
versus, you know, when you do have those feelings, yes. And it's interesting for me to see the contrast in itself.
Yeah, interesting. So thank you for sharing that. So what I'm hearing you say is that when it was future oriented, there was a sense of aspiration like, oh, yes, I'm happy for what you have that inspires me.
Whereas, you notice like how interesting when it's past oriented, there's a sense of loss, almost loss. And, and it's inviting you what I'm hearing and correct me if there's more that you're saying that I'm missing but there's a sense of oh, this is interesting.
You know, it's not a zero some game. I know that.
Oh, sweetheart, what's going on here. Like there's some curiosity. Is that what I'm hearing you say.
Yeah, yeah, beautiful. Yeah, beautiful investigation. Lovely. Thank you for sharing that.
Yeah, may you discover more of it in this non zero song game of goodness in the world. So dear ones, let's transition to small group practice groups of roughly size three or so.
And the invitation is to just we'll start with about 15 seconds of silence meta for one another. And then you can share as little or as as much as you like about your practice with each other.
Really, with generosity of spirit generosity practicing movement practicing with our eyes closed and silently but can you actually not do it with a couple of other human beings practice generosity with a couple of other human beings such a precious sandbox to be able to do these little
groups so here we go. I'm going to open the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other.
Welcome back everyone the rooms are closed and we have just about a minute. So if there any reflections that came up running reflections you'd like to share can type them in chat raise your okay Neil I see your hand shut up. Go.
So, how do you deal with someone who you are in direct competition with.
Right where they're winning could, you know, in some ways mean you're losing. Yeah, yeah, I trust it's it's more challenging right it feels more challenging so.
Yeah, it's.
I think it's it's a case where a different framing because if we enter it as a zero sum game of winners and loses, you know if we enter it as a finite game versus an infinite game are you familiar with the concept of finite versus infinite games.
Yeah, so if you enter it as an as a finite game and set it up as winners and loses, then that's a that's a frame that is stuck for it's a particular perspective that is is valid to and yet what I invite is actually shifting shifting and looking at it slightly
different there are ways to look at it differently also not to say, seeing it the way of winning and losing is wrong is just one way. What are some other ways.
So, look at it that way to I yes, not not to negate it, but are there other ways that this could be seen as, and this whole practice, and actually practice in general is about ways of seeing the ways we see something.
So, I'm not going to give you a recipe, but I'm going to invite creativity what are some other ways this could be seen, and this is a longer conversation and it's already 701 so.
I'll just leave you with this invitation, not to negate. This is one way. Yes, valid, wordly, there are many other ways that it could be seen. So I'm going to invite your creativity and and perspective shifting. So maybe we'll pick this up another time.
Is that okay.
It's great. Thank you.
Yeah, thank you so much.
So, dear ones, we have come to the end of yet another happy hour. Thank you so much for practicing with Sango for cultivating your heart for your own sake and the sake of all beings everywhere.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you.
