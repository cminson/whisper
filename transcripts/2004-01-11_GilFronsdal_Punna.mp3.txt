 So this morning I would like to talk about something which I've never talked about before and which most of my time as a Buddhist practitioner I had no interest in or no taste for and basically ignored it and I never talked about it and I've never heard any Western Dharma teacher talk about this topic and in fact if I was going to guess on the attitude that many Western practitioners, Western convert practitioners, people who haven't grown up in a Buddhist culture have towards this concept they think well it's not really relevant, it's not really Buddhism or important or you know maybe that's a little more superstitious or folklore part of Buddhism and we want the real thing but it turns out that this thing that I'm going to talk about is really central to much of the Buddhist tradition as it's been taught and practiced down through the centuries and so central it can be considered to kind of be almost the essential heart of it for many people with most people are interested in it preoccupied or concerned with when they evolved in Buddhism so there's a big kind of you know disjunct in between you know something we leave out here in the West often but which is really kind of core to what Buddhism has been down through the centuries and one of the reasons I don't want to tell you what it is is if I give you the most common English term you'll probably immediately have reactions or ideas and you know judgments and you know and and it's far from clear to me that the most common English translation is a good one it's probably inadequate as often the case there's not a one to one correspondence between some of the Indic words that the Buddha used in English and so it's hard than to know how to translate it so we do the best we can and we end up using words which you know you know so I'm right now discussing I translated it's a work of the Buddhas and it's gonna be published and I'm talking with a published little bit about some of the translation words and he did not like that I had translated a certain word by the English word evil because evil has a very strong very strong connotations in the Western mind and all kinds of associations come up around toward evil and he said he is a really accurate as representing the Buddhist word and I said well probably it's not completely accurate but it's the best word I could think of all the other words just don't kind of work they don't kind of it's a really strong word in Indic you know the word paradoxically that's the word Papa and I mean that's the first house pronounced in Pali it just happens to be that's what it doesn't mean father but it means this really strong thing and so evil is probably the best so there's this problem you know with words and sometimes Westerners will or people translating will choose not to translate a word but rather continue to use the Pali and make it kind of English like the word Dharma now is kind of become almost English we don't try to translate it that often so I'm talking about so I'm still kind of beating around the bush so what I want to do is is I'll tell you the Pali word first some of you might know already the Pali word is a punya and a punya sometimes pronounced punya and and I'll read you a passage from the Buddha we talked about this term it's one of the maybe the one of the few in the only places where he kind of kind of more or less defines the term and a term that became very central then for Buddhism for the next century next next millennia monks do not fear punya punya is an expression denoting happiness what is desirable wished for dear and agreeable I know full well that for a long time I experienced desirable wished for dear and agreeable results from often performing punya so maybe by the end of the day end of the talk you'll help me come up with an English word for punya what does this word punya mean so he says punya is another word for happiness so that's you know that we don't want to call it happiness because that doesn't you know miss us too much but that's you know maybe gets us interested you know oh it's something has to do with happiness so I'll tell you a few stories one is a story that James Berez will often tell and maybe some of you are sad with James and heard his cheesecake story he was he was sitting a three-month retreat three-month meditation treat back in Massachusetts and and he was diligently practicing his practice silent retreat and some one day he was given somehow or other he was given a gift of a large I think was a large piece of cheesecake and we just for him maybe it was a birthday or something and it was you know and it made him really happy any kind of delight in the cheesecake is one of his favorite flavors and favorite things to eat and so great you get to have this wonderful thing and then we looked at it he said oh maybe some of my fellow retreatants would like some of this also so he started cutting up in half and then in quarters and then little slices and then put each slice on a little plate and left them there for other retreatants to come and take a slice of cheesecake and then he sat down nearby and watched as they came in and he saw this great expression of delight on their faces when they saw they had a chance to eat a few bites of cheesecake now what James says is that if he had eaten the whole cheesecake himself his gustatory pleasure his sensory pleasure would have been much more he would have had much more satisfaction his mouth and all this wonderful sweet flavors but it wouldn't wouldn't have lasted so long however his memory of the delight and the happiness that was in the people's faces and they saw they had a chance to eat cheesecake that's something that lasted for years for him a kind of little happiness that they carry with him that lasted for a long long time so here he did something that he chose in a sense to sacrifice his own pleasure without thinking about he was doing it for happiness but the result was that it brought him happiness for a long time afterwards are there certain activities that we do that tend to bring us happiness when we remember them or kind of somehow clarify the mind or purify the mind in certain ways on on Friday we talked about generosity here and imagine that you each gave me I told you that I was gonna I was gonna if you gave me $20 I would go and find somebody to give it to and the next week when you came back I'd tell you who I gave it to so you have a lot of confidence and trust in me and well Gil's not gonna just give it to any old you know bum and he's probably gonna use it for good purposes and so because of this great confidence maybe misplaced you haven't me you give me your 20 to 20 dollars and and you leave feeling kind of happy and you feel like oh probably Gil's gonna give it some worthy cause and so it's an act of generosity in your part so because it's an act of generosity in your part there's a certain kind of conditioning of the mind to strengthen that movement of generosity within you perhaps and there's an karmic movement that can happen because thought of it as a generous act and generosity is a karmic event and so how does karma work it's not unsure how karma works but karma is a law of cause and effect that if you do something certain things based on certain intentions those intentional acts will bear fruit either in the moment or tomorrow or in a few years or in Buddhist say in a future lifetime and so and it's the intention that affects that cause and effect relationship so if you just I don't know you put twenty dollars down you know on the sidewalk and just walk away without thinking about why you did it just did it you know there's very little karma there but if you find someone who's really worthy for twenty dollars you're giving you twenty dollars and your intention is to offer help and support then you're conditioning that you're causing a different kind of causal relationship in your psyche than just putting on the sidewalk you're kind of you're watering the seeds of generosity for example the seeds of happiness and things like that so karma is can be happiness producing if you do if you plant the seeds that produce happiness if you plant seeds that produce unhappiness suffering then it tends to create a causal connection that creates greater suffering in the future those activities which are done in healthy ways create greater health those activities which create disease create more disease and so if you act out of hate that hate tends to create further disease in the mind of the psyche both in the short term perhaps in the long term the most kind of maybe the most rational basic way of understanding it is that it creates a habit and that habit then will come back in the future or it creates a memory and I certainly I've sat in meditation for example remember things from 10 20 years ago oh how could I've said that how could I've done that and so somehow that memory was stored there and it came back and I remember or good memories came back and so they was filled with happiness so karma has been who knows all the routes of karma but this word punya is not karma so or it's a subcategory of karma it's an aspect of karma so you've all given me your twenty dollars to distribute and so you come back next week and I'm going to tell you what I've done with it I say well ten dollars of it I gave to this no good lousy neighbor of mine who he just sits around watching television you know kind of grouchy is mean to the kids in the neighborhood and he just went out and bought some beer so he can watch more football on television that's what he did with adult money he said wow gee and then over the other ten dollars I gave to this this kid in the neighborhood who's getting ready to go to college and and he's really poor but because of the ten I needed ten dollars in order to send overnight express his application to some university that he's going to go to and he needed that money he didn't have any money to send the application he needed to get there tomorrow and so I gave that money to him and he was able to get not only he was able to get the application in a time but they accepted him wow that's great that ten dollars went really you know went to a good cause and you felt oh that's really great if you'll come and you feel happy about that and maybe ten dollars for helping buy beer maybe if you remember it at all it doesn't you know you kind of regret having given me the twenty dollars to pass on but the ten dollars that got this guy to college you know it really was the kind of one of the pivotal things that got him to college because if he didn't get that letter in in time he wouldn't have gotten in and you know you would have taken a different route in his life so for years you said wow that was a great thing wow I didn't know that one little act like that almost anonymously anonymous act could have brought such happiness to someone or made such a big difference in someone's life and for years later it brings a sense of happiness to you so punya is that which brings is acts that bring happiness and acts of generosity are not all equal in terms of creating happiness so in the equation of punya if you give generously to someone who's going to go out and buy more you know alcoholic does not go off and buy more alcohol there might be benefits to doing that but chances are that you're going to feel a lot less happy than if you give a certain amount of money to someone who does some really wonderful with it imagine if james had left to have cheesecakes slices there and two years later someone came to him and said you know my practice was going really well I was really concentrated really cruising my practice and then I came to the speed bump in my practice that afternoon and I felt kind of discouraged and I was going to you know go to sleep early that day just give up go back to sleep and start the next day but because that cheesecake was there I was so glad that someone you know made me so happy this act of generosity and this wonderful thing someone offered someone cared about me or something and it was so sweet and gave me a little boost and I went right back to my cushion and I just and I was enlightened and I was going to go to bed but instead this one imagine someone came back to james and said that but then he went wow that is amazing I'm so glad I didn't eat that cheesecake and it you know it probably brings a lot of delight to him and the next time james took us down to meditate on retreat he gave this sense of delight and happiness is there with him does this kind of joy or delight or happiness can come from knowing the benefits of our good actions is it spiritually useful is it humanly useful is it something that's desirable as it says in the quote punya is something desirable wished for dear and agreeable is this is something which is agreeable desirable that for you is something you'd like to do do you evaluate the things that you do based on whether this is creating a field of happiness for yourself or for others or not and how do you evaluate what brings happiness I think one of the reasons I kind of didn't like this kind of concept in early days of practice was it felt a little bit artificial or pollyannish or saccharine doing something in order to feel happy for it it seemed you know kind of a little bit contrived and and lacked sincerity maybe perhaps and certainly can have that aspect but are there ways in which we already do acts of happiness producing acts things that would create happiness that make make us happiness but we don't avail ourselves of that happiness we don't reflect and think about it we don't remember it we don't allow ourselves to be open to oh this is a really great thing that I did you know about the people benefited they were happy oh one of the practices in buddhism that again is not practiced so much in the west is it goes by the polly name anamudana anamudana is is pervasive in much of buddhism in asia certainly in indian buddhism and anamudana is usually translated by the word rejoice to rejoice in those happiness producing activities and feelings and emotions that human beings have and so you know now we could all kind of rejoice in james's generosity with a cheesecake that's great that's great for james this maybe maybe it's a kind of a kind of a minor thing to rejoice in but there's a lot of things we can really kind of rejoice in or celebrate what a great thing that someone has done this you know something that activity and and to feel the happiness of that is considered to be a useful spiritual practice to do and so in traditional buddhist settings in india there were actually ceremonies of rejoicing that people would do where they would and my guess is from the archaeological evidence that these were very lively celebrations they didn't have kind of quiet protestant flavor but rather were kind of you know exuberant with music and celebration and singing and dancing and whistling and yeah you know kind of like a gospel revival hallelujah not our kind of buddhism is it hallelujah but i think that this is part of this rejoicing and and that you know is part of the field of what some buddhist buddhist was a were about so in the evaluation for so so there are three things that traditionally are said to produce this this kind of this kind of happiness and there's probably many things but there's a list actually further in this quote that gives it the buddha says of what kind of what kind of deed of mine carries this kind of fruit to create happiness of what deeds ripening is it that i am now of such great is that of what deeds ripening is it that i am now of such great accomplishment and power and then it occurred to me it is the fruit of three kinds of deeds the ripening of three kinds of deed deeds that i am now of such great accomplishment so here's the buddha talking about how he accomplished his buddhahood and his awakening it is because of these three things deeds of giving deeds of here he calls it self-mastery and deeds of refraining then he goes on to say in a poem he says once you train in deeds of punya that yield long-lasting happiness generosity a balanced life and developing a loving mind so there's three areas of develop so there's three areas of develop punya punya is developed through generosity through living a here it's called a balanced life and developing loving kindness other places it says that it has been said that the three primary activities of punya is generosity ethics and meditation so these can be seen as spiritual practices in buddhism for the cultivation of wisdom of liberation but here they're also talked about as creating punya and punya the happiness that comes from that is a condition for greater for for spiritual development and in his statement the buddha attributes his accomplishment as a buddha to having done acts of punya earlier you know earlier so in again in traditional buddhist settings buddhist will evaluate where they perform for example acts of generosity to give generously to those areas they will tend to create the greatest happiness for themselves and perhaps some of you do that yourself you know with fundraising letters you get a whole stack of them end of the year and then you look at society you know what is it that will bring you the most seems right to you the most happiness the most joy or the most delight or whatever and and so you maybe choose some over others and what to give to but the same kind of evaluation goes into for buddhist and so they will say so one of the one of the traditional evaluations is give to someone who is practicing is produces more happiness and giving to someone who doesn't practice the spiritual life or someone who is well advanced in the spiritual life creates greater happiness giving to that and giving to someone who has no spiritual life give to someone who's meditating and this is this system of evaluation and then is of course terribly abused in asia where they'll give lots and lots of money and things to monks and nuns who are very highly attained or seemingly so in some ways or other and the monastery would build all this marble and gold glitter and all this stuff from the temple because people are giving so much to this and then people down the street are starving there's something a little bit odd about that kind of a kind of situation then but still the the it's a became the abused but still the idea of evaluating a little bit what we do based on where is it what is it what is it that creates the greatest happiness is part of the traditional evaluation so meditation is also said to produce punya and i think this is an important point because meditation has a lot of benefits but many many people here in the west don't think of it as a punya creating activity something that creates this it's a happiness producing event in asia a lot of people are so happy that they can engage in meditation practice they feel like it's a wonderful the calmically fruitful and beneficial thing to be involved in and just brings them to light to sit down and meditate here in the west i know a lot of people sit down to meditate and the first thing they deal with is their self-criticism and self-hate or their sense of striving and you know you know it's all these all this complex kind of emotional stuff that comes up as we meditate here in the west and and often in asia that stuff comes up also but there's also a field of happiness where they feel like people sit down to meditate feel like they've come home and feel like oh great this is a this is a punya generating activity that they're involved in isn't this great but we don't have a punya as part of our equations we don't think of it we're doing this punya thing and so we don't you know we don't give ourselves that credit don't feel the happiness of doing that so i know people in asia who just feel happy the fact they sat down to meditate they'll feel happy because they just did it regardless if the meditation was awful well that was a terrible meditation it's too bad but i just did it it was so great you know i was producing this good karma just by doing it or ethics living an ethical life or a balanced life they just feel happy in doing they feel like they're creating all this good punya for themselves in doing this so i'm beginning to wonder whether i'm losing you all because you know it's a very unpopular topic strange topic so now what do you think those of you who don't know already what do you think is a good translation or you know what do you think is the best english translations for punya now that you've heard about it yes uplifting satisfaction so deeds of uplifting satisfaction okay yes well since you started out saying that you knew and had anything to do with it, i'm happy to stop sacrifice self-sacrifice yeah i never that seems a little bit far-fetched for the word punya but i can understand why you come to that yes oh no i'm sorry i'm sorry oh i'm very sorry uh yeah i you know my mind is a little bit fuzzy today but what happened was that i started to say that the word it's very hard to translate english words into a poly words into english and then i digress and said for example i'm working right now with the issue of this word papa which means evil which usually translated evil i'll translate it as evil but that's a whole different topic so i'm sorry i got confused you the word is punya and and the buddha here says it's another word for happiness so um but what do you think yes joy i know this is one word that i can't think of the word but it's about giving away is that who you want to think but even as sitting in meditation or being ethical is is punya yes contentment yeah peter sorry celebration celebratory activities celebratory celebration worthy activities there's also a term apunya which is deeds or activities which have the opposite effect so great unhappiness aspire so one of the interesting things about punya here i didn't make this clear enough either i apologize for this lack of clarity today is that the the punya the the strength of the punya the size of the punya the amount of punya doesn't only depend on your intention it also depends on what happens as a result of that intention so you might have you might have equally you might be a very generous person and your movements of generosity are equal to the various people you give to say you're going to give food to various people and and so you give food to lots of people it feels great but one person used that food for the energy of the food and went out and and worked for habitat humanities and it's became a strength and that feels really great maybe happy to see that to support habitat for humanities in an indirect way so someone else just went to use the food to be fortified to watch the football game it kind of creates a different level of happiness in you the field into which you gave to so you do a traditional word is a field you give to different fields and so you give to a field of um uh different people have punya fields some people have big punya fields and some people have small punya fields it's a traditional language so someone who likes to work for habitat and humanity has a bigger punya field than someone who spends most of the time watching football and so and so traditional buddhist like to give to big punya fields one of the biggest the biggest possible punya field around is the buddha so buddhist like to give to the buddha because that's and what happens is even if you give like a really teeny little thing like you give a flower to a buddha you go out and pick a little wildflower and you give it to the buddha because the buddha has such a huge punya field the results of happiness for you and these beneficial desirable results are said to be really huge so everything's a little bit mythic but yes shared merit okay yes reward reward and punishment yes yes uh also so the traditional translation of this word punya is merit it's english it's uh so people have merit fields and there's bigger smaller merit fields and doing performing acts of merit shared merit is it is it usually how it's translated into english and um but i'm not sure it's really the best translation partly because it has this connotation of deserving something or you know so you merit something by deserving it and it seems more complex to understanding so there's a question uh do people do many buddhist intentionally do things in order to acquire money is that what you're asking yes well uh what you can just use you know is asians i mean there are people here in the west who are very focused on merit too it's um i mean you do find that you do find um in some some settings people have merit passports and they go around to different temples and make donations and then you get the stamp the habit will stamp the passport and then when they when they die they they want that uh passport burned with them so that the yama or whatever you know whoever kind of you know checks you out after you die this you know what's happening next for you because you know they so the merits and they only make sure the merit goes with them in some way and um so there are there's a lot of behavior that seems very odd for in our in our eyes i think people are obsessed by merit and that's all they do is they go and try to get merit and um and there doesn't seem to be much spiritual practice involved it just seems to be about just getting getting getting this kind of economy of merits and the one you know they say you know you you you can't take your wealth with you uh buddhist say well you can't take your wealth with you but what you take with you is your merit you're good karma and so you try to acquire a lot of good karma and that creates good rebirth so it can have it can seem very unspiritual kind of very selfish and self-absorbed and all that but it's um it's uh central to some schools of buddhism uh in tibetan buddhism it's very very important the idea of building up merit because the understanding is that you cannot really make long-term progress over many lifetimes in spiritual life unless you build up a lot of merit first and so tibetan buddhists will spend a lot of time doing pudgyas doing worship making offerings 10 000 bows 100 000 bows 100 000 offerings of you know all kinds of things worship the guru because they're building up the merit field they need so in the future lifetime they can be a buddha uh terevad and buddhism doesn't really have that strong notion so you don't find in our tradition emphasis on merit so much and for many of us westerners who went to asia to practice our teachers never talked about it um they they they maybe they just figured we hadn't we had plenty enough merit because we'd found our way to the meditation monastery and so we were just taught meditation practice and that's and when many of us came back from asia we then practiced meditation in a much more direct way and found it's very beneficial and many people have found meditation practice to be beautiful practice independently being even buddhism certainly independent of this merit economy merit concerns um and um the reason i was kind of inspired to talk about it today was uh and the way i talked about it kind of trying to avoid the word merit initially is um in not talking about it for all these years we've been in america we're terrified in tradition in america kind of ignoring it and all that uh have um we're ignoring something we don't like so you know some of you may be uncomfortable with this discussion today it's very different what you usually get here uh but are we have we left something out is there some to some value something something to be found in this concept of punya that's actually valuable for us that's useful for us aside from the ways which are maybe not useful ways we kind of think are not really spiritual in some way um is there something useful for us to learn from this um can we can we resurrect the concept in a way uh in the way that you know is helpful for us that's that's the reason i was wanting to give this talk yeah i feel like it's a reflection on the movement of her heart not the expected outcome that's where i see happiness it's a movement of the heart yeah not what you're looking for as an outcome so cheryl says it has to do with the movement of the heart not with the expected outcome and it said that in the tradition that giving for example giving is a very punya meritorious thing to do that you create more merit if you have if you're not concerned about the outcome so if you're not concerned about getting more merit you make more merit than if you are concerned about making merit so you know but still you make merit by giving in if you want merit yes the word that i use in my in my mind is benefit benefit what is the greatest benefit um but there's so many different ways of understanding benefit it seems like you lose you lose something here don't you lose if you just use the word benefit um you know like i often you know finishes sitting with um you know um may any benefits that come here benefit all beings um and it's uh i don't know if it loses something but definitely doesn't get the reaction of marriage of the you know attainment and and counting so one of the very common practices in buddhism is to dedicate or offer up your merit so you get all this merit for doing this that's enough but then you don't keep it for yourself but you offer it for the benefit of others and it's very common at the end of practice events of sittings or day-long retreats and retreats people do dedication to merit and and often when i say it out loud i say may the benefits and merits from our practice together so i use both words and um and it's a beauty i think it's a beautiful movement yes whatever benefits i've gotten whatever happiness or calm or joy let it be for the benefit of others so we're not trying to keep it to ourselves it's not about a self-centered approach just me myself in mind see you know it it said the fact was really true that the practice was a lot better and you were more joyful and so it's also the type of promoting joyful state i know i've heard people say that practicing myself is really true and you're down with all the things you practice not going to but all of those every treaty and certain periods are going well to reflect on gender things you've done so are there can can we allow can we is it useful to think about creating conditions for our own happiness through activities that meritorious activities is happiness just something that comes from from having the most toys or having the most you know is it something that's internal that we have to kind of struggle with our own psychology to figure out how to be happy or is there some happiness that can be produced from how we act in the world and we go into the world in ways that are that then generate happy producing condition conditions so if you're sitting in your own room waiting for yourself to be happy you're depressed and i wish i'd be happy and have to deal with this and turn or you know maybe there's another way that is sometimes just to go out into the world and find some activity to do an act of generosity or some activity which is a happiness producing activity and not only something that produces happiness for the moment maybe also produces happiness for the long term when you think about or remember it the word merit is a is an odd word the benefit is and i like the word benefit except it's just too rational and the word merit has a very interesting in my mind connotation that i think karma and i think this merit stuff is punya stuff functions in seen ways in obvious ways but also functions in unseen ways the ways of the psyche doesn't necessarily understand and so the idea the word punya also implies that there's a larger kind of unseen world that we're participating in and so acts of generosity or acts of punya and whatever that they have benefits in ways that we can't even see for ourselves in the world around us yes you know listen to you talk about makes me think about parenting in these issues because you know when a child is young you often teach them to behave in a certain way because they get something back for it you know like you know they get some kind of merit in a way and then by teaching them that relationship then eventually it becomes part of who they are and the idea of doing it for something or for something for themselves tends to drop away and may become more you know less attention on the merit and a bit more attention on the generosity or the you know the ethics or whatever so i think it's just kind of i mean i look at it from the way you describe it as kind of a skillful means of getting to the point where you do something really from your heart and not is not the concern of you know am i going to get my passport stamped yeah so that's beautiful so part of part of the benefits of doing this these kinds of activities is that it kind of conditions the mind to to goodness and uh and even though you might be a little bit selfish initially it's kind of it's you know the goodness grows and grows and grows and could punya be translated as goodness yeah in verma people on their birthdays give presents away and then they come to share their joy that they're doing synthetic joy of joy that they've gotten like it is in the way that points to me to the things we've been talking about in this position and going on that culture itself you know these different hours about what the brain's doing and the type you played out in first place yeah yes please if i understand time well uh i i like i like to understand that way myself that it's uh it's the uh it's this the qualities of mind or states of mind that come from our good our goodness good activity but the tradition itself uh will not limit it to just uh that kind of kind of psychological understanding because there's an unseen ways in which this stuff happens sometimes punya is very closely connected to the word power it comes with this uh uh a person who has a lot of punya has a lot of power also you can build up a strength of certain kind of strength the power of all this live with it for a while so it's time to stop and i hope that this was interesting for you to to look at a very different topic than we ever look at them and hopefully you'll be for your benefit and we've all created more merit in the process of exploring this and may it be for the growth of your goodness in your hearts and and may you allow yourself the happiness that comes from recognizing your own goodness thank you
