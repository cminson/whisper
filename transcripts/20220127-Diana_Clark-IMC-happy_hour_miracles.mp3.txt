The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So warm welcome everybody, again.
Here we are, Thursday evening.
And somebody in a class I was teaching talked about,
why don't we talk about Thich Nhat Hanh. And I was getting a little bit remiss that Thich Nhat Hanh had died last week,
probably, I'm assuming, most people already know, died on Saturday.
And I hadn't really talked about it. I didn't talk about it. I think Nikki did.
But I didn't. And so I just want to honor an amazing person.
I didn't practice in that tradition, but, you know, I kind of feel like there's that expression that
I don't know exactly how it goes, but it's something about adding water so that all the boats
raise up, rise, something like this. So Thich Nhat Hanh was one of those individuals that
I think just made the world a better place.
With his teachings and he was a poet and a prolific author as well as, you know, of course,
established on Village in France as well and Deer Park in Southern California and these two monasteries.
And now the name just escapes me, but there was just a whole publishing house got created in Berkeley here,
specifically just to publish his works.
He was prolific enough that supported all publishing house.
Maybe it'll come back to me with the name of that publisher is a remarkable person.
So I said I didn't practice in that tradition. I never met him.
But what a he can be credited with really bringing mindfulness to the West.
And this idea of engaged Buddhism, not just sitting on our cushions, but being out there in the world,
bringing our care and our compassion to the world.
So in honor of Thich Nhat Hanh, I'd like to share one of his poems and we'll kind of leave it into some living kindness practice.
I'll say that some of you might know that I'm teaching some a few courses right now and as it just happens that these two different courses
we end up talking about supernormal powers, you know, are these real?
Is this, you know, that the suit does have them about walking on water, flying through the air, etc.
What does it mean? Can we ignore it? Is it true? What happens to us? Should we be worried? All kinds of stuff about this.
And so I kind of like this poem from Thich Nhat Hanh and the light of that as well as even completely independent of that.
So here's this poem.
People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle.
But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on Earth.
Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize.
A blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black curious eyes of a child.
Our own two lines.
All is a miracle.
This idea of being engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize. How many things do we take for granted?
Well, we need this other thing. We need something else or, you know, kind of maybe like being a little bit dismissive for just these very simple ordinary things.
And what is a miracle anyway? A miracle is something maybe that we don't understand.
Well, how did it come to be that we find ourselves walking on the Earth, but the sky is blue, whites are clouds, clouds are white, leaves are green, looking into the black curious eyes of a child.
Maybe the miracle is how we don't appreciate some of these beautiful, maybe it's not a miracle, maybe it's like what's astounding is how we don't appreciate just those ordinary, beautiful, pleasurable,
maybe even in, on triple, like how did, how does this happen? And then we don't need to know how it happens, but just to recognize the beauty in the simplicity.
And part of what gets in the way of recognizing the beauty of the simplicity is, you know, our worries, our concerns about ourselves, about others, of course, of course.
And so meditation practice, loving kindness practice and mindfulness practice is a way in which we can kind of settle down.
Literally, unfiguratively, settle down so that we can notice some of these simple things.
Friendships, things that we share with others from calls, texts, zoom, a small miracle, maybe it's a giant miracle, right, zoom.
Maybe it's just as a way for us to kind of have some appreciation or some uplift in our hearts.
Again, I don't want to pretend like everything's perfect, but everything isn't terrible either there's some things here that are simple and beautiful and
take none on saying, I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on Earth.
All the things that can involve humans and walking in Earth, and maybe the green Earth going outside noticing the weather, the nature that we're just a part of, not separate from.
Okay, so with maybe with that as an introduction, parallax press, thank you, Neil.
Well, it's the name of the publisher for to answer books.
Let's take a meditation posture is feeling into this moment.
In some ways, it's a miracle right all this conditions that had to come together for us to be here and in this moment for you to be feeling the chair, the cushion, the couch against your body.
It's amazing how many things had to come together.
Feeling the body body sitting.
And how is the body in this moment in some global way.
There's some restlessness or some drowsiness.
Maybe there's some ease, maybe some discomfort, maybe a mixture.
However it is.
And we allow it to be there.
Tuning into the sensations of breathing.
When I first learned how a hemoglobin works.
I'm exchanging CO2 and oxygen.
Why we breathe.
I thought it was the most amazing thing I've ever known.
A miracle in some kind of way.
I dedicated my life for quite some time being a biochemist, just by this simple thing of breathing.
And exchanging oxygen and CO2. It's really amazing.
Breathing is effortless for the most part if you're healthy and your lungs and body are working okay.
It's this beautiful process that we all do.
Breathing in and breathing out.
Thank you for watching.
Maybe there's just a little bit of awe of how this whole breathing thing works.
Thank you.
And then to begin our living kindness practice.
Maybe with the same sense of awe and appreciation.
Bringing to mind a lovable being.
Someone who is uncomplicated, easy, straightforward.
From heartedness, love, care.
And to support our connecting with this lovable being.
We can say these phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
Just bringing the mind back to this warm hearted connection with the lovable being.
Let's begin again when we find the mind wandering.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Extending our loving kindness to a good friend.
Maybe somebody in our family.
Maybe a good friend.
Extending this warm heartedness towards them.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be safe.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
The black curious eyes of a child.
Oh, it's a miracle.
Oh, it's a miracle.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
And then to extend our loving kindness even further to somebody we don't know.
Maybe somebody on this Zoom call, somebody you see occasionally in the neighborhood, somebody we don't have a relationship with, a stranger.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
Help us stay balanced, study while we experience all these different miracles.
Some of them are pleasant, some of them are unpleasant.
How can we not lose our balance?
How many practice can help?
So for this practice bringing to mind somebody that you care about, and is sometimes a little bit bothersome.
Not the most difficult person in your life, not the most bothersome person in your life.
Not the most irksome.
For equanimity practice we'll say different phrase.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So this idea of ordinary things, being miracles, and just appreciating some of the simple things in our lives and in nature.
Again, I'll read this poem by Tich Nhat Hanh.
We consider walking on water or in thin air, a miracle.
But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth.
We are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize, blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black curious eyes of a child.
Our own two eyes, all is a miracle.
So this idea of unkindness practice, unmindfulness practice, but any of these practices that helps us kind of quiet the mind and open the heart,
allows us to appreciate all the, well, if we want to use this word miracle, like we don't understand how so many of these things happen.
I don't know how this zoom exactly happens.
I just click certain buttons.
Shazam, you guys all show up.
So just this recognition, right, that there's so many things that we can appreciate.
And that loving kindness practice is a way that softens the heart and helps us to notice and feel the beauty, feel the miracle, if you will,
just ordinary things, ordinary experiences.
So it can be nice to talk about some of these ideas with others, maybe sharing your experience or your ideas about this poem.
Maybe you thought it was silly.
Maybe you thought it was really touching.
We don't all have to have the same response.
It could be helpful to talk about it, to share our understandings or our thoughts about it.
So I'm going to put you into groups of three or four.
And it's helpful if you just say one thing, and then allow the next person to go and they'll say one thing and then the next person goes and they say one thing and just go around the circle.
So in this way, it's not so much you informing others, if everything you know about this topic, but instead it's creating the conditions in which everybody might come to a new understanding, a new idea.
Maybe at the beginning of tonight's talk, I spoke about, take not Han, if it is like making it like all the boats rise, is there a way in which all the boats can rise in your small group just by some openness and some sharing and
maybe it goes without saying but I will say not giving advice or things like this.
So, it's, if it's helpful, you can go in the order of the last digit of your phone number.
And we'll say zero groups first.
Okay, here we go.
Okay, so welcome back, welcome back.
Does anybody have a comment or question or something they'd like to share.
Some of you are smiling.
It's a good sign.
I think it's a good sign.
No, nobody.
I discovered this maybe water the seeds of happiness from.
Yeah.
Yeah, very nice, very nice.
I interpreted as a good sign that when people come back and they don't feel like talking because maybe they feel kind of filled up a little bit with what they were talking about this feeling of maybe I don't need anything more.
It was something nice.
I'm Dan Gitta I'm always amazed how these breakout sessions we come out of a deep meditation with very little transition and are able to connect so meaningfully with people we don't know.
And I think most of us in our day to day lives have experiences where you try so hard to connect even at a very basic level with people you know well and it appears that times impossible so that's something that tonight particularly I took away from this once again.
Very nice.
Thank you.
And dare we call it a miracle.
Yeah, so it's a miracle that we're all able to connect here across vast distances and different time zones. Yeah, yeah, but even I think it as you pointed out right that there can be some intimacy and some authenticity.
It just shows up right with the right conditions, and it shows what's what's possible. It's possible. And I think, dare I say, also what humans are kind of hungry for to work hungry for this real connection with other people.
The meta practice is probably very important in this because in order to be vulnerable safety is a very important aspect. And I obviously this is a safe place. I think for most of us.
So I'm very grateful for that.
This translates directly again in my life very directly into a professional environment and so forth I'm trying to set exactly that tone in a very different environment and it's quite remarkable how like you say people are are thirsting for this authenticity and and
I think I'd say most people respond in ways that they might not have been knowing they were able to respond to like most people don't shut down. They are opening up.
So, thank you. Thank you for sharing that. And thank you for doing this in your professional life too right we want to expand out so that more and more people individuals can feel connected feel safe and have some intimacy with others.
What a beautiful thing can change change all of our lives.
Okay, maybe this is the magic of tick not home to right some of his recognizing that power, the influence that he has this beautiful being.
Even though he has died now right still has influences as we're still is being felt.
Okay, so it's one minute past the hour.
Thank you.
Say goodbye and with a heart full of appreciation. So if you'd like you can unmute and maybe we can all say goodbye together.
Thank you.
