The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we go. Okay, so hello and welcome everyone to happy hour. Lovely to be with
you, the gift giving each other, the gift of our presence, the gift of our time, our
presence supporting each other in this practice. So I thank you, all of you, for
showing up, whether it's in real time or whether later you're listening to this
on audioderma. So for today's practice, I wanted to bring our attention to a
practice that sometimes we engage with here and in happy hour and I think it
was last week and someone said that, oh, if we did appreciation turning our mind,
turning our awareness to what's good, what we often don't take in, fully in,
what is good, I could do that forever. So I thought, okay, maybe for a while I'll do
that once a week at least. As I teach happy hour three times a week, maybe once
a week we'll engage with the heartlifting practice of joy, of joy, joy and which
can show up in different ways. Gratitude can lead to joy, vicarious joy, happiness
for happiness of others can lead to joy, appreciation for what's good about
ourselves, about others, about causing conditions about the world. So there's so
many ways to turn our hearts and minds towards what's good, towards
what's joyous. And as I said before, again, it's not in a way to just be
Pollyanna, I'm just gonna be, you know, turn a blind eye to what's challenging
the world. Quite the opposite, actually, if we have a reservoir of joy, of gladness,
it serves us, it helps us to face and be with what's difficult more easily for
ourselves and for the world. So it's, it's not an avoidance, it's actually a way
of balancing. It's a way of balancing the 10,000 sorrows of the world with the
10,000 joys because they're, it's all present, it's all here. But we often,
because of our evolutionary conditioning, we often turn to what's
challenging, what's difficult, what's not going right. And we ignore, we just don't
see, as if we have blinders on, we get accustomed too easily to what's actually
really, really wonderful, really amazing.
Like paraphrase Sam Harris, he has a quote about, you know, when something
really, really catastrophic happens in our lives, we, and any of us in some ways
were just a phone call away, perhaps from, you know, bad news from a doctor or
difficult diagnosis, you know, we never know what's gonna happen in the future.
But at those times, we turn back, we turn back and think, oh, when time, when life
was normal, when life was normal or normal enough, normal enough and consider this
is when life is normal or normal enough, of course, you might be dealing with
challenges, but of course, what I'm saying, I'm offering it in general ways, when
life is normal enough, and instead our minds when life is normal enough, it turns
to finding fault with what seems boring, gosh, it's boring, nothing is happening in
my life, or everything that we want, everything that we lack that, oh, if I
had that, I would be happier or I would be happy if so and so and X, Y and Z were
in place instead of turning our minds, not to say we give up our aspirations, of
course, keep your aspirations, aspirations for continuing to develop,
continuing to serve in the best way you can, this being who is you and all
beings everywhere, continue to aspire for the best being you can be and let go of
the clinging, if I only had that, if I only there's a very different
feeling between clinging, which has an ouch to it, which has kind of painful
versus aspiration, that lifts the heart, that inspires, that motivates, so I said
plenty, more will come, more will come, of course, with the guided meditation and
whether you're new to this practice, whether you're new to happy hour,
whatever you need to know will be shared with you, so relax, enjoy the ride, so at
this time, having set the frame for our practice a bit tonight, I'd like to
invite us to land and to arrive in our bodies, embodiment, embodiment,
embodiment, as we start our guided meditation, our meditation practice
together, I'd like you to close your eyes, that's comfortable for you, settle
and in your seat, arriving, taking stock of this being here, this moment of
aliveness, here, here, as always, we start with just sitting, being breathed,
sitting and being breathed, with each breath softening, releasing, releasing
the body, releasing thoughts, releasing into what is here right now, however it is,
not wanting it to be otherwise, even if there is unpleasantness in the body or
mind, pleasant, can we release into it, release into the totality, the spaciousness,
greater, larger, more spacious, all-encompassing.
you
letting your awareness connect with the breath, the entirety of the breath, sweet
comforting breath, however it shows up, however it's breathed in the body,
there are a lot of thoughts, distractions might be helpful to attend, to become aware
of the breath, in the lower abdomen, that can help settle, ground, us, as if deep
in our belly, in our lower abdomen, deep resonances of the breath, calming, soothing,
settling,
when it falls to a rising, it's okay,
smilingly, smilingly, without any judgment release, let go as if blowing on flower
petals, gently, gently, come back later, giving my heart to this practice right
now, letting the sensations of the body and the breath be center stage, calming,
soothing.
You
You
You
You
The Buddha says whatever free we frequently think and ponder upon
That becomes the inclination of your mind
So instead of pondering pondering upon what is lacking what is
Missing
What we want one to want endless desires
With clinging and grasping let us turn and ponder upon
The goodness
The goodness in our lives
The sources of goodness
And let us first turn
The goodness within our intentions
Our aspirations
For loving caring
Being kind
Being generous being of service
Being truthful not causing harm
Whatever your values might be
Taking a moment to perhaps touch into the top three
If there are more arising it's okay
Feel feel the goodness the wholesomeness of these intentions in your heart
This is not a time for judgment
I'm thinking of all the ways you lack
But to bring attention awareness to connect with your goodness
The wholesomeness
The more we connect with the wholesomeness the more it will increase
It becomes the inclination of our minds
What inspires you what inspires you
You
You
You
You
Now I would like to invite you
To imagine
An earlier version of yourself
In some ways this earlier version maybe a few years ago or a decade ago
This earlier version of you
In some ways
We could consider
That our earlier or younger self
Has sent us into the future
In some ways we are the progeny the the child
Of this younger version of ourselves
We are living the hopes and dreams the aspirations
The goodnesses
Of a younger version of ourselves
Our younger version might have had challenges gifts
Can we have a sense of gratitude as if we were turning turning around in time
I'm thanking the earlier version of ourselves a younger version of ourselves
For their dedication, for their perseverance
For hanging in there, for their cultivation
Maybe for their hard work
Maybe for setting the direction so that we are right now practicing the dharma
There was something about this younger version of ourselves some aspiration for goodness
Maybe it was their suffering
Maybe it was their sorrow their challenge
That drove them, that inspired them
To seek, to seek practice, to seek meditation, to seek community
Can we turn around and with an open heart appreciate and thank
Our younger selves
Again, this is not a time for self-judgment
But intend to turn your mind, your heart to goodness
You can choose, appreciation, goodness, you have a choice
Perhaps the words arise, thank you
Thank you my dear, thank you sweetheart
Thank you
Thank you for sending me into the future with gifts
With your hopes and aspirations
I see I know there are times that were hard for you, you were suffering
You were in pain, thank you for hanging in there for me
For everyone and the gifts, the gifts of goodness of your character
Stay with appreciating the good, not a time to find fault
Thank you, thank you, younger version of me
Thank you
I can also thank you younger self for their wholesome actions, wholesome thoughts, wholesome actions
So the regretting or shaming our younger selves, let's really take this time to appreciate
Their goodness, their wholesome actions, deeds
As if you were saying, get beloved other, as if it's not really you
It's another being entirely, seal them with kind eyes
As if they are your ancestors, you're saying, your ancestor
The heart of appreciation, bowing to this ancestor, that is you
Turning to this moment in time, in your perception, feeling embodied
Feeling your body, being breathed
The goodness, the goodness of wholesome actions, thoughts, deeds, aspirations
Living through you, running through you
Take a moment, pause to appreciate it before we continue
Now I would like to invite you to imagine the future version of yourself
Again, life is uncertain, we don't know what's going to happen next ever
But for the purpose of this exercise, this practice, imagine yourself some time into the future
Now this future being, future self
As if they are your child, you are sending them off into the future
The future you will not see, but they will see
They look at you
They deserve your best
They deserve, they deserve, they want, they ask, the best of you
Your wholesomeness, your wholeheartedness
In service, in kindness, in love, in truthfulness
They demand your best
In the loving, in the most loving way
Can we have the sense of love, care, for this progeny, for this version of ourselves sent into the future?
Send as much goodness as gift
As gifts to equipment, to equip them
To nurture them, nourish them
The sense of wholesome
Duty, loving duty
Loving duty as an offering to our future self
If the word duty doesn't work for you, try on loving gift
Loving bestowal or anything else
Just as they thank you for your effort, for your aspirations
Inspired wholesome actions and cultivation
You love them, you want them
To shine, to serve, to be the best version of you they can possibly be
Offering them your gifts out of love, your actions, your hard work, your dedication
Both to them and to serve all beings
Seeing yourself in this line
Now your past self, your ancestor
And now bringing in other ancestors, if you wish, to send you into the future
They could not reach
And you, appreciating their gifts, bowing to their gifts
And sending your gifts, your actions, your wholesomeness, as an offering
For the future, your future self, and all beings who are impacted by your goodness
Looking at you with loving eyes, caring eyes
For our sake
For our sake, do what needs to be done
Cultivate what needs to be cultivated
For all of our sakes, they tell you
And not to feel it as a burden, but it's a sense of aspiration, opportunity, agency
Receiving gifts, giving gifts, past, present, future
All around 360 degrees, yourself and all beings
May we appreciate all the gifts we have received
From our past selves, from our ancestors
And appreciate the goodness, the capacity to give, to cultivate gifts
To the future, and to all beings everywhere
May all beings know their deep goodness
May all beings, including ourselves, be free
Thank you, thank you for your practice
Appreciating goodness internally in this moment
All the gifts of the present moment
Gifts sent to us from the past
Gifts into the future
Have some time for reflections
For any aha moments that might have come up
Your own benefit, the benefit of others offering them as gifts
You can type them in chat
If only type to me privately, I won't read your name, just your reflection
And if it's typed to everyone, I'll read your name
You can also raise your hand
Fazal, am I saying your name right?
It's Fazal
So I've made a lot of mistakes in the past
And I've actually been doing the five contemplations every day
And it's kind of like thinking about how those affect my current situation
So this is like a nice balance
It was very nice, thank you
Thank you
To the contemplation on the karma from past actions
Yeah, thank you for that
I appreciate you bringing that in
Because with the five contemplations
And just to catch people up to fifth one
For anyone who's not familiar with
Is acknowledging that I am
The owner of my actions
I'm the owner of my actions
My actions are my arbitrator and protection
And we often, as you said
We focus on the negative reverberations of our actions
And it's just as important to focus on the positive
To balance it with the positive
And not just in the past but in the present
That yes, I'm the owner of my actions
And I have to say that with the five contemplations
The fifth one is for me, for different people
Different ones are really alive and for me
All of them, especially the fifth one
Wow, I'm the owner of my actions
Whatever I do for good or for evil
I am the owner, I am born of my actions
I'm heir to my actions
It's such a rich contemplation
So I appreciate you
Yeah, realize and go yes
Bringing the goodness, like yes
If I do goodness in the world
That's going to percolate
And also appreciating the goodness in the past
Yeah, beautiful, thank you for that
Bringing that in, yeah
Any other reflections or aha moments
Please raise your zoom hand
Because of your physical hand I may not see
Or you can also type in chat
Or any reflections
Private appreciation for the goodness
You are welcome, thank you for your practice
And wonderful to see all the folks on YouTube
Joining us from Brazil and the UK
And Mariko
So since no reflections are arising right now
I will say, okay, one more
Catherine
I just had a really sweet experience
Of seeing myself through my younger self's eyes
And being like, I would be so proud of myself
It brought tears of joy to just be like
My younger self would be really into who I am now
Sweet, thanks so much for sharing that
That is very, very beautiful to connect
Thanks for sharing that Catherine
Yeah
So a couple of questions are coming
So I'll answer the questions
And then I'd like to go into the practice
Into the groups and reserve time at the end
So one question that's coming up is
How to fit with contemplation of death
Yeah, both and
As I said when I let this contemplation
Future is uncertain
We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow
We don't know what's going to happen the next moment
Absolutely
And yet there is both and
We don't just give away and stop doing cultivation
Because we might die
We live fully, we live completely
Giving our gifts into the future
Knowing that life can end at any moment
So we have to be able to hold really complexity
Both this moment could be my last breath
And oh yeah, I might live another decade
And what do I want to send into the future?
Another reflection on YouTube
That I really struggled with this meditation
Anger seems to arise on me
So how can I appreciate my goodness?
Yeah, in this case might be
Need for forgiveness practice
Forgiveness practice
For forgiving self in the past
For forgiving, letting go, letting go
And maybe even turning to the self
That is struggling right now with compassion
With compassion
Through the self that is really angry right now
To hold this present self with compassion
And make some room, make some room
With kindness, with kindness
So I do see your hand, Claire
But I would like to turn right now to small groups
So that we don't run out of time
So with small groups
I like to spend a little bit of time setting them up
And asking you, first of all
The reason we practice in small groups
Is to bring our practice from the cushion
From our eyes closed
Meet others, meet the world
In the space of practice, in the space of kindness
The space of tenderness
It's not about impressing them
It's not about educating them
It's not about managing other people's experience
Or facilitating the group
Please only speak from your own authentic experience
Not commenting, not probing others
And holding silent space for yourself and for others
When your turn comes, you can say pass
Or you can share and nugget
And please share one nugget
We're going to do the format that's called the spiral
So instead of a long monologue
If you have five nuggets, you only share one nugget
One thing that came up for you
And then you pass it on to the next person
They might say pass, they might share one nugget, one thought
Then the third person
And then it comes back to you
And then you go round and round a few times
Sharing from your own experience
Sharing, holding space with kindness for each other
It's not just go and talk amongst yourself
It's a very sacred space
It's a ritualistic way of participating this way
So with that, I'm going to create the rooms
And invite you to be kind to yourself
Take care of yourself, take care of others
Let there be a lot of, yeah, care
Let there be a lot of care
So I'm going to open the room
Take care, be kind, here we go
Welcome back everyone
We have just about a minute or two for any reflections
That might have come up during your practice in Sangha
You're welcome to raise your hand
Or type in chat
Bill
Hey, I wanted to ask a question
And maybe the answer would be too long to fit in at the hour
But I'm going to ask it anyway
We talked about aspiration
At what point does aspiration become striving?
Because it seems like there's a gray area there
Where I aspire for things
But I really want these things
I mean, in terms of development
Yeah, I don't know if there's a good answer for that
Yeah, you know, that's a very good question
And also I really appreciate how there is sensitivity
That you have, Bill, that you know
That there can be a gray area
And how to tell the difference
So I turn it back to you
And turn it back to embodiment
Feel in your body what it feels like
There is a different feeling
Between aspiration, inspiration, and striving
It's just you can feel it
And if you will know
And if you don't know, just continue to sit with it
You will know, Bill
All right, thank you
Thank you for that question, lovely
A couple of reflections before we close
Sarah says, I like thinking about my younger self
Going for her aspirations and dreams
Which produce results that I feel grateful for today
Beautiful, thanks for sharing that
Mary says, appreciation for Sanda
For the witness received, beautiful
And Donu says, thank you, Nikif
For offering this so consistently
During this whole pandemic time
It has enriched my life so much
And attending in person today
Such a joy to be with your sweet love and self
Aw, that's so sweet, Don
Thank you so much for being here
And showing up and your presence, your practice
And for you and all of you
All of you, thank you
Your presence is a gift to me
We give each other's gifts
Your practice is a gift to me
We give each other, give each other gifts
So with that
One last thing, Sheila
I hadn't previously considered the goodness
Of an earlier form of myself
Who acted courageously in the face of adversity
At one time in my life, yes
Yes, may we consider the courageousness
Aw, that touches me so much
May we appreciate
So thank you, dear ones
Thank you for your practice
Thank you for the courage of your earlier selves
That have sent you into the future
And here you are, practicing the Dharma
How beautiful
May all beings be well, may all beings be free
Including ourselves
Thank you all
Be well
And now I stop the recording
