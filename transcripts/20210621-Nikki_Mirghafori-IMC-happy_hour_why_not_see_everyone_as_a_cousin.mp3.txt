 Okay, all right, here we go. So hello, everyone. Hello and welcome to happy hour. This first day of summer, June 21st, and first day of, oh, that means winter in the southern hemisphere. Wow. Okay. Let's just turn the corner. Here we are. So for today's practice, yeah, so what I'd like to invite us to consider is how our way of seeing our way of seeing really creates, really fabricates friends, enemies, dear ones, neutral people. It's in so many ways. These categories, these categories are a fabrication of our minds. Haven't you noticed that actually someone who maybe at some point was in one category then becomes in turn, you know, maybe they say something that upsets you and then instead of being your dear person for a few days, they become your difficult person and maybe resolve it and they become your benefactor again or your dear friend or just these categories are so elastic, elastic and how the same person can be our both perhaps benefactor, good friend, as well as our challenging the person we have challenges with. Same with us. We can be our own, you know, we can be in all these different categories. So these categories aren't fixed, aren't really fixed. They are a way of seeing, a way of relating, a way of seeing another through our lens, through the lens of me, myself and mine, how you make me feel today or this month or this year or this decade. And again, a particular person is neither challenging or neutral or dear just because of who they are, but how we see them. So there is really this is one way, one way where the practice of emptiness. Now as I bring this word, please don't get scared like, oh my God, now she's going to talk about emptiness and I don't know what the heck that is and those are higher teachings and relax. I already explained to you everything I was going to explain. So if you understood what I said, that's it. So this is one aspect of emptiness, voidness, co-fabrication, creation, the way that we see the way that we see the world. It's really empty. It's really empty. It's not an inherent property of the people. It's just the way we see them, we make them, we relate to them in these ways and these qualities again, it's not inherent in the person. We fabricated given the way that we see in a given moment. It depends on our way of seeing and they're not inherent. So that's where one of the ways that the practice, the realization of emptiness, voidness, it's so elastic, it's so free, it's all so free. It's much less fixed than we take it to be. Actually this practice of emptiness in this way brings so much freedom, so much ease. It brings freedom. Oh yes, it's the way I'm seeing, it's the way I'm fabricating. So given that it's my way of seeing, given that it's so malleable, well why don't I malleate, why don't I make it into, why don't I see everyone as a friend? I have a choice. So what if I saw everybody as a friend? What would happen to my perception? What would happen to this world that I live in if everyone was a friend, if I saw everyone, if the way of seeing, the way of fabricating was a friendly one? How would my experience of being in this world operating, how would it shift and change? So with that as the preamble, I also want to give credit, this idea came up to share with you as I was listening to a beautiful talk by my favorite teacher of mine, Rob Berbea, passed away last year. And this talk is, was entitled, Love, Healing and Emptiness, and it's from 2010. And I trust later, Neil, Neil will look it up later and we'll share with you for anyone who might be interested. Again, the name is Love, Healing and Emptiness. It's on Dharma Seed and it's by Rob Berbea. So with all of that and having given credit, given I'm an academic, so it's important to give credit where ideas come from. Well, it's important for everyone. Anyway, let's start our practice, our formal practice of guided meditation. So I'd like to invite you to get into your posture, whatever posture might be supportive for you. Whether sitting, lying down, standing or even walking. Turning, turning your gaze inward. Letting go of all the words that have come before all the busyness of the day. All the plans of what you will do later today. This moment, just taking refuge. It just being. A radical choice in our society, in this world to just be and not do for a moment. Letting go of doing. Standing up, relaxing, softening the whole body. Opening to non-doing. Receiving, receiving the breath. As it moves through the lower abdomen, the sit bones, the legs, the feet. Feeling softening, letting go of all these parts. Softening, relaxing the abdomen. Letting the chest. Ah, be refreshingly filled with the breath. And empty the neck and shoulders. Ah, softening. Feeling heavy. Feeling their weight to be pulled down by the earth, by gravity. Ah, as if tension tightness. This dripping down, relieved, let go of. So too for the muscles of the face. Behind the eye. Behind the jaw. Connecting the jaw. The entire body. Inviting awareness to be close, very close. Right here, just in the body. Right here, not far. Intimately feeling, sensing, greeting all the sensations. Thank you. Thank you. If you notice the mind is resting on the thought and the planned memory, it's okay. It's part of this practice, nothing wrong with thinking per se. Just for the purpose of this practice, a calming, settling. In this moment, inviting the awareness to stay close in the body, to bow to the thought. Thank you. Please come back later. I'll be waiting for you, but now I'm giving my heart to this practice. Bringing the awareness to the body, to the breath. Receiving. Thank you. Just settling, arriving for another few minutes before we turn. Our attention to metta. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, as we stay embodied, as we allow awareness to connect with the sensations of this body and the body, connecting the cushion, the floor, connected to the earth, connected to the air through the breath, sense of embodiment right here, right now in this body. Not leaving the body, letting it be our anchor. I'm now inviting, inviting into our mind, eye, the image of felt sense of a dear friend, someone with whom we have an uncomplicated relationship ideally. Just there is a sense of friendliness, goodwill. We appreciate them, we like them. We wish them well. Maybe they make us feel safe and happy when we're in their presence. Whatever the nuance might be for you. And if it's challenging to find someone in this category, it's okay to bring someone in who's a benefactor, a dear person, maybe even a child or a pet. Just a sense of friendliness ease. Bringing them into your mind's eye as if inviting them to come and sit with you. As if they were right in front of you. Letting a sense of meta-ease friendliness. That naturally arises, could show up as a smile, could show up as gladness, could show up in your heart area, heart center area, a sense of warmth, care, goodwill. We're just happy to see this person, this being in your mind's eye. And from this, from this place wishing them well. You can use your own meta-phrases if you have them. Or offer the four meta-phrases, traditional ones. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you have ease. You're welcome to keep the free from the pain. Or let it be silent. What's more important today in this practice as we explore in this way, is to have an image, a felt sense of them, just the way you see them. Looking at them with friendly eyes. Noticing what happens in your heart when you look at them with friendly eyes. Does your heart feel more expansive, more peaceful, more spacious, more happy? Again, notice what the nuance is for you as you envision this being with friendly eyes, seeing them as a friend. See what happens for you. Notice, notice. Now having primed our heart, we'll do a wholesome, what's called bait and switch. Now, as the heart is warmed up with this sense of friendliness, seeing through the eyes of someone else, bring the image, felt sense of someone up who's kind of neutral for you, someone you know, maybe you've seen. And replace your friend, your dear being with this new image. And see if it's possible, what if you just saw this person in a friendly way as if they were a friend? Experiment. In this moment, see what it feels like. As if they were your friend, as if they were dear to you, pushing them well in the same way. And like surfing, we can surf the wave, sometimes for a long, long, long time. The energy may not dissipate, but if it does, you can always go back to your friend, and prime your heart again, and do the bait and switch. So experiment, see what happens. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to invite you to come back to invite your friend, your friend again. Sitting with them, seeing them, with friendly eyes, friendly gaze, the way you see them with kindness, and the way you feel, and the way you feel. And letting your heart feel what it feels, your body, pay attention. And I'd like to invite you, having primed your heart again, now imagine the scene from somewhere you've been recently, perhaps. Maybe you went for a walk simply near your home, and there were passerby's, neighbors walking by. Or maybe you went to a store to buy something, a grocery store, or another store, or somewhere, a park. Somewhere where there are a bunch of people, you have this felt sense of where there are people around. What if we saw them, if we took in our mind's eye, different people that perhaps we interacted with, who we just saw? Looking at them, seeing them, with friendly eyes, with good will. May you be well. May you be well. As if they were a long, long lost friend, perhaps. We didn't know this was a friend of ours. What if silently brought the image of each of them up and said, Hi, how are you? I wish you well. I'm friendly. I see you as a friend. Maybe flashing an inner smile. See what works for you. As if you had a friendly relationship, a connection with each of these beings. As if you knew them. As if they were a long, long lost friend. As if they were your second, third, fourth cousins. Hello, cousin. Hi. You were seeing them at a reunion. I've never seen them before. With friendly eyes, friendly eyes wishing you well. We are related in this web of common humanity. Thank you. Notice how your heart feels, how your body feels. Greeting, the fairness of all these long lost cousins you're related to through the web of common humanity. May our practice in cultivating our hearts and goodness and kindness and metta Be a cause and condition for awakening, for goodness, for ourselves and all beings in this world. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for your practice. So I will change the settings in chat. So if you like to share your reflections in chat to everyone, I'll say your name out loud. If you just type them to me privately, I will only read the reflection, not your name. Also welcome to raise your hand, your zoom hand, your physical hand I may not see. You like to share your insights, reflections, questions, complaints. It's all welcome, especially if you haven't spoken for a while. Love to hear from you. Friend. Hi, I found the suggestion to think of strangers as cousins to be very apt and useful. I have a lot of cousins. And, you know, my intimacy with various cousins have changed over the years some being quite close and then a rotation and somebody else will come to the west coast and they'll be very close. There is something almost arbitrary about that, that there. I can feel that we've decided that we will be friends that we will be close. It's just because of the accident of family, but now we make a commitment through through that accident and that experience seems to be a useful way for me to imagine the boatload of people I was thinking about who I was around yesterday, who were as various and as in differently composed as my family is. Thank you, Fred. Thank you so much for saying that as beautifully and as eloquently as you said, all of that. Yeah, it's a commitment you make into way of seeing the way of relating otherwise it can be kind of random. Beautiful. Thank you. I love that and actually that suggestion when I suggested for me it, it brightened the practice also it brought more dimensionality for me. Saying all the people I had seen earlier today. Like, Oh yeah, hi cousin. Hi, it just yeah. Thank you for that. Lovely. Yeah. Yeah, other reflections. What did what else did you notice Claire, please. Thank you. I wasn't so much noticing I had a very funny coincidence so that I wanted to share with you. I have a friend who is a huge fan of proofs, and somehow or other I got on the phone with them today. And instead of my usual annoyance with them. I decided to look through stuff I just, and I just googled, and I came up with a quote that I thought would just blew my mind, changed my whole perception. And it's so relevant to what you were talking about. It reads the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. And I thought that is just amazing, because it's been so true for me and that's exactly what you were talking about. And this is the same with my whole day. It's really weird. Yeah, exactly. It's beautiful. Thanks for sharing that. Yeah. A way of seeing with new eyes, not new lands, but new new eyes. I'm sorry, I lost it already. Very good question. So, the, I think the way of inviting to see with friendliness is, is to see their humanity in this case, to see their humanity it doesn't mean that you become a, you know, a doormat and say oh, I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to do that and say oh, just friends I'm just going to forget about everything, you know, abuse me, but, but allowing yourself to see their friendliness, they're long lost cousin who are causing harm. You still see them. Oh yes, they're a cousin. You know, they, they're related. You want them to be well and yeah you're going to keep your distance from this cousin but you wish them well. Thank you, Kamari Christine. Very important question. Yeah, thank you. Oh yes, beautiful. And thanks for putting that in chat again, Claire. The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands but seeing in new eyes, seeing with new eyes. Beautiful. Lovely. Yeah. Any other reflections. As I wait for you, I'll share that with this practice towards the end I felt much happier I felt my heart being really expansive just kind of. Yeah, just the delight of the people I had seen earlier who were kind of two dimensional for me they were just people, neutral people and then they became. Oh, wow. So, so, so, in fact, they became dear, I was wishing them well so I think tomorrow when I go to the same place I'll go for my daily exercise swim, if they're there like oh I'll see them with different, different eyes like oh yeah this person swimming next to me in the lane or may you be well. So, for me was quite lovely too. So, so how about we, since I'm not seeing any hands and I'm not seeing any new reflections, let's turn. We'll save some time on the other end when we come back from small groups for reflections and right now. How about we engage with our cousins are long lost cousins, who we will meet in a small group a couple of our cousins who will have the privilege to connect with reconnect with in small groups so let's practice, I'll make up the, make the breakout rooms. And how about we start with 15 seconds of silent meta for for our cousins. And after that, then you can share as much or as little as you wish. Let's see. Okay, the rooms are created, and I am going to open them now. Here we go. Welcome back everyone. Okay, the rooms are closed. I'll come back. And we have a few minutes for reflections questions your practices important, especially if you're new. And we'd love to hear from you. What did you discover was there something new that you discovered about yourself about what worked for you what didn't. What, what happened, either during the guided meditation or in the practice meetings. Is your zoom hand or type in chat. Lisa, please. Yeah, I was noticing that it felt like really like freeing or lightning to be given permission to, to notice, which I did anyway but that like the categories change for the person that I might, or being I might like pick for a category that the complexity, it's like allowing for the complexity of that, the change, depending on my view and the conditions of that moment going into my view, it just felt like even though I could know that yeah somehow it's like, oh, you saying it and offering this meditation, meditation, it just was like felt like being given permission for that and I really really appreciated it and it feels like this is a super rich teaching that. Yeah, I want to like, be with more so thank you Nikki. Yeah, thank you Lisa. One thing that I'm hearing what you're saying and don't mute yourself to see it because I want to follow up with what I'm hearing, if I hear correctly is that there's a sense of this acknowledgement that yet this is what happens with these categories, they're kind of random depending on how we see them. One person can be a friend another day and a challenging person was challenging, etc. So, so that actually gave you permission, it brought some ease is what I'm hearing to say oh yeah this is, this is how it works it's it's, it's okay this is how it works for everyone right this is, and it's based on how we see others and it just keeps shifting and changing, and that can allow a sense of okay this is how it works, given how I see. So, okay, how can I, it actually opens up practice opportunity. Did I kind of hear that correctly what you were reflecting on. Yes, completely like the, it's okay. And, and then, um, yeah like the warmth is can I don't know somehow can flow between these like categories, seeing that one day, or that half day it was like that and then that later hour it was like that and it's like, what, and just noticing my own rigidity around, but it's always be the same. And I don't, it doesn't feel good but I noticed my like, well then I can just check off that box, you know, and it's like, that's not. Yeah, this just like feels good somehow and yeah, yeah, I would like to be with, be with this more I could feel like I can be with this for a little while as a practice. Nice, you just added another aspect to it, which I want to highlight, which is not the rigidity of it doesn't have to particularly wait this is how it works. So, so not fighting against how it actually the mind makes these categories this is how it happens and opening up to working with it and another thing that I just thought about sharing actually as a, as an invitation for all of us is as different people we relate to as they shift and go between these categories. Can we still see them as our cousins. Oh yeah this is the cousin who's still my cousin, but, you know, today you know we're still related we're still connected in this web of humanity and you know for our human family we're still connected and today yeah it's just, it's kind of this way, it's the weather condition so yeah. Thank you Lisa and Jeannie says I just enjoyed meeting some new cousins so that's very sweet. Thank you, Jeannie so the time has come for us to end our time together so I thank you all thank you so much for your practice and cultivation for the sake of yourselves. Thank you for all those beings whose lives yours touches me all beings be happy, may all beings be free. Thank you. Now I stopped there.
