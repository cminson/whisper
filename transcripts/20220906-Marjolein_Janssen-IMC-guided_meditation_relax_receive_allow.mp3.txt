 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's available in a comfortable meditation posture. A posture that is somewhat upright and alert, but also relaxed and comfortable. It may be helpful to start by checking in with the body. What's the body like right now? What's the most comfortable? It's like to be a sitting posture. It might be discomfort or unpleasantness in the body, some tension. And if there is anything like that, you can go to that area of tension or discomfort and invite it to relax. To relax as far as it can go right now, even if it's just a tiny little bit of relaxation. Just an open invitation. Nothing really has to happen. Just make it relax. You can do this for several areas in the body or for you feel what's needed. And then you can also invite the whole body to relax. Make the whole body relax for as far as possible right now. May the mind relax. Relaxation is one of three practice reminders that Andrea often uses. The second one is receive. Receive experience just as it is. You don't have to go out and look for experiences and sensations. They're already here at all six sense doors, sixth sense door being the mind. There is constantly something happening. And we can simply receive whatever is most predominant at this moment, each moment again. So it's like sitting back, relaxing, and just letting experiences come to us, receiving them in this open field of awareness. Maybe it's a breath. Maybe a thought. Maybe sensation in the body or sound. Just receiving. The third practice reminder is to allow. Allow experience just as it is. We don't have to change it. It doesn't have to be different than it is right now. We don't have to push away something unpleasant. We don't have to try to get something pleasant. We can just be with what is right now. Allow this in our experience. And at times this can be uncomfortable and something is happening that is unpleasant or difficult. Maybe we can allow it to be there, open to the unpleasantness. Recognize, yes, this is unpleasant. At times it can be overwhelming or a lot of aversion can come up and be that entangled. And if that happens, you're always welcome to pay attention to something that's more neutral for a while. Maybe the breath. Maybe the touch points of the body, the surfaces, its own, like the floor, chair, cushion. Know that it's always an option. And if you're able to allow experience just as it is arising right now, then you can stay with the present moment experience. We can remind ourselves, these three practice reminders, relax, receive, allow. Continue in silence. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Remember to relax, We will remember to relax and rest a few moments in the doubt about how your birthday wasn't supposed to be when it broke. Remember to relax, You're sitting there in the weather I see. Wow. I'm coming close to the end of the meditation. We can take a moment to see if there's some gratitude present. We can be grateful for ourselves. We've taken the time to meditate. We can be grateful for everyone present. So that you're able to meditate in a group together and generate group energy, which helps us in our meditation. When we meditate, we generate wholesome and beneficial energies, so-called merit. And we can share this merit, this wholesomeness, with all beings everywhere. And we share it. We can multiply it. So may all beings everywhere benefit from the wholesomeness that they've cultivated today in our meditation. May they contribute to their wisdom and to their freedom from suffering. I'm going to say we could send Smita to all the people in the Zoom room right now, also on the phone. Let's take a moment to appreciate everyone. Smita has love and kindness. We do that through a sentence, a phrase. May all beings present in this Zoom room right now be well. May we all be free from suffering. May we all be at peace. Thank you.
