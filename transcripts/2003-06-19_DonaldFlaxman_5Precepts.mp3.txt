 I thought I would talk tonight about the senior students have senior moments sometime about the five precepts. Many teachers, many of the books that I've read in talking about Buddhist practice emphasize that without morality, Nepali-sila, that without morality, no matter how much you practice or how hard you practice, progress is essentially going to be very limited. That morality is the basis of leading a life that can lead to enlightenment, whatever that may be. So the five precepts merely point the way to looking at our ethical or unethical behavior. The talk that I give tonight is for your reflection. There is no truth in it. One man's ethical behavior will be another person's not ethical behavior and it's really necessary for us to look deeply into the five precepts to see what they mean to us and how we can use them in supporting our daily life as well as our spiritual practice. So the five precepts as generally given are first, no killing. Second one is no stealing, no taking anything that isn't freely offered. The third is no lying. The fourth is no sexual misconduct. And the fifth is abstaining, not taking intoxicants that cloud the mind. For those of you who haven't heard them before, they're still probably pretty familiar because they're not all that different from the Ten Commandments. What I'm going to attempt to do tonight is to go very, very deeply into each of these. And my understanding is that tonight most of you are beginning students and I'm going to go where it's taken me 27 years to get. And I'm doing this rather consciously because to the extent that I can open up the possibilities that lie within the precepts for each of you to come to terms with in your own way, then I think there will be value for you. The five precepts are not like a checklist that, okay, we got this one. I've stopped killing real good. On to the next one. My experience is that they keep getting more refined and when I think I've got one down, what happens is I see that there's a subtler level beneath that that I can go to. And so I find it a very dynamic part of my own practice. For most of these ideas, I'm very indebted to Titnad Han in his book Buddha Mine, Christ Mine. Much of what I'm going to say really was inspired by his discussion of the five precepts. So let's start with the first precept, not killing. That seems pretty straightforward. We probably don't have any killers in this room. Although I have to say I'm a former killer. I used to spend immense amount of time in the outdoors in the sunshine and love nothing better than the squash, flies, mosquitoes, whatever it was that was annoying me. So in the very earliest days of my practice, that was one of the first things I had to give up to take this practice seriously and to take this precept seriously meant to not kill. Now in a very real sense, we cannot avoid killing. We walk on the earth, there are going to be ants under our feet, but the intention not to kill is a very critical factor. Even if you're a vegetarian, you're still killing the plants. So that as a practical matter, it's not possible to live without killing. We all do it in one way or another. Now what Titnad Han does with each of these precepts, he turns it into a positive instead of a thou shalt not or no killing, no stealing, he turns it around and turns it into a positive. And the logical extension of non-killing, non-harming is to commit yourself to alleviating suffering in the world. That certainly is a basic tenet of Buddhism. So to the extent that we're able to start seeing our own impulses to destroy things that annoy us, bite us, whatever, and can go beyond that and then start to look to see what we can do so that the amount of suffering that goes on in the world is lessened, we now really have a positive program that we can be working on. And it definitely doesn't have to be grandiose. At one point I thought, God, I have to stop all the wars everywhere. Well, that's probably infantile grandiosity. It's enough if I smile at the clerk in the grocery store and don't complain about the prices. Just all the little behaviors we have day to day provide us with an opportunity to make life a little easier and a little lighter for the people around us. And I think that's fundamentally what this first precept points to. I want to digress for just a moment to say that don't start trying to do this down to the very deepest levels you can find and then beat yourself up when you're breaking the precepts two or three hundred times a day. If you're going to really take these precepts seriously, you'd better plan on taking a forgiveness practice for yourself equally seriously because you will, at least in my experience, you will break the precepts many, many times every day. The non-killing is for me probably the easiest except when we get ants in the house and everything else I can take outside. We get ants in the house. I go out for a walk and my wife who's not a Buddhist gets a can of something out. I think I'm a co-conspirator in that situation. So the first is not killing but in a positive sense it's about doing what we can to alleviate suffering and pain in the world. The second precept is not stealing, not taking anything that isn't freely offered to you. Again I think that's probably not so hard for most of us although the amount of time I've spent trying to figure out whether toiletries left in a hotel room that I don't happen to use while I'm in the hotel are freely offered or not. That's just one of the ways I enjoy driving myself crazy. The opposite side, the positive and the antidote to greed, which is what would be behind stealing, fear and greed, is the practice of generosity. The Buddha in his very first talk to lay people talked about generosity. It was for him one of the most important of the precepts and of the practices that as people who are trying to improve our own lives and the lives of other beings, it's an incredibly wonderful practice. If I hadn't decided to talk about the five precepts tonight I probably would have talked about generosity because it's one of my more painful learnings but also now one of my greatest joys. So it's not enough to just not steal but it's a practice of being in the world with each other, with open hearts, open hands if that's what's appropriate, but it's with the spirit of generosity even if we cannot act out financially, say, very much generosity. There's a generosity of spirit and there's a generosity that we have with our time. How much are we willing to share ourselves with members of the immediate community or the larger community volunteering our services in the hundreds of non-profits that would benefit from our committing ourselves to helping others? As I said, the practice of generosity is generally considered the prime opposite or antidote to greed and fear and certainly it's pretty obvious in the year 2003 that we live in a culture that is fundamentally based on fear and greed. I mean the Enrons and the city banks and you know the almost seems infinite number of scandals, the actions of the politicians. I mean it's throughout our culture and I think there's no way you can grow up in this culture without being tainted by the 10 or 20 or 50,000 ads that are beamed at you every day. Want this, need this, have more. So the second precept is the practice of generosity. The third precept is for me by far the most difficult and that's no lying. Now turning no lying around into a positive again is not simply just telling the truth. As a matter of fact the Buddha in one of his talks cautioned that just telling the truth was not enough. If you're going to speak it must not only be truthful but it must be useful to the hearer. So telling somebody something that's very truthful but that's going to blow them out of the water is not skillful means. For me right speech or non-lying contains a whole variety of things. Certainly includes not telling lies, including lies of omission. Oh I forgot to mention. It includes avoiding speech that is divisive, that creates disharmony among people. Certainly any form of gossip talking about somebody who isn't present is not what I would call a skillful use of words. The place where I run into a lot of trouble is that in high school and even more so I think in college I developed a litany of swear words that's earned me the nickname of trash mouth. Breaking the habit of using foul language is an ongoing challenge for me. It's astonishing to me how reflexive that is for me. Automatically outcome words, first they don't communicate anything really. They're just so I don't want to say blasphemous but they're so gross that there's nothing being communicated in them at all and they are harsh. So in my own work and it is why I emphasize that each of us has to do this process for ourselves. In my own work this has been incredibly challenging and I'd like to say that I've made enormous progress but I think I'm in the 10 to 20 percent improvement range and after 27 years that doesn't overwhelm me about how successful I've been. Still I think this having the intention to alleviate suffering, to have the intention of being generous, to have the intention of using language and words skillfully to create harmony, these are all very important and the degree to which we're successful will just unfold on its own. When I say that it's important for me to use language in a way that is harmonious and pleasing to people does not mean that I will not confront somebody on an issue that's important because not dealing with somebody else's behavior that you find offensive is for me actually a form of lying. I'm not telling them the truth of how they impact me. So even though I've been very I've been somewhat successful in improving my language I have been far more successful in being very direct and confrontive but not in an aggressive harsh way and a kind and loving way. I find that by practicing that people are able to hear me better than if I really just come up and pop them one with a really hard confrontive statement. So this whole area about how we speak is very important. I think the Buddha and certainly Thith Nhat Hanh would say any form of chit chat that's just passing time away that's wasting time in a sense is not very skillful that we could be using that time to practice or to seriously communicate and deepen our interpersonal relationships. So speaking appropriately is my single biggest challenge. The fourth precept which is no sexual misconduct is quite different actually from the Ten Commandments which limits to sexual misconduct to adultery and to coveting thy neighbor's wife or husband. It's very undefined. As a matter of fact a few years ago there was quite a lot of controversy involving the Dalai Lama. Somebody had asked him about how no sexual misconduct related to homosexual people and he said that is sexual misconduct. I don't know if he has that same stance now. There certainly was a storm around it and I think he had to go inside and look some more himself. He also came out when asked about prostitution and he said well if somebody else pays for it and you don't then it's okay. Again you know the Dalai Lama's for himself doesn't have an issue around this because as a monk he's just celibate and it's like not an issue. But for us who are alive in the real world we need to be very careful sexually. It's very easy to hurt other people. What is appropriate sexual behavior? Again I don't think there's a cookbook answer. I think each of us has to find the answer within as to what seems appropriate. Nat Han in reframing this in a positive way says that sexual activity should be used only to enhance deep interpersonal relationships. And so do we all use our sexuality in a way that is primarily about enhancing relationships or are we just looking for self-gratification? I'm getting old enough now so this isn't too big a deal for me. The disappearance of hormones is not the curse that I thought it was going to be. It's an absolute blessing. But it's a challenge. What is appropriate sexual behavior? The fifth precept which is taking no toxic intoxicants or substances that cloud the mind is pretty obvious in Buddhism because we use our mind in order to be aware of what's happening in each moment and to the extent that we mess with the mind so that we become oblivious to what's happening in the moment. We are now liable to violate all four of the other precepts. I can say based on my experience that it's almost guaranteed. But are there skillful uses of intoxicants or substances that cloud the mind is one drink such that it clouds the mind. It may be for one person and for another person it may be nothing. Chitnad Han poses the question to the extent that we're all interconnected that we are one what's the impact of any one of us as an individual having a drink on an alcoholic who's part of us. That took me up short for quite a long period of time. I didn't want to hear that one at all because well I just didn't want to hear that. Chitnad Han takes that fifth precept and pushes it a whole lot further by looking at the whole question of consumerism and what is it that that does to our relationship to other people to the extent that there are a limited supply of goods in the world and we consume more than our share. Are we depriving other people? Just a question to be looked at to be deeply felt. I have some data that I can present to you that I'm one that tends to somewhat overindulge. Chitnad Han takes a very strong stance against consumerism both because to the extent that we in the United States use something like 67% of the world's energy and that may not be an exact figure but it's a disproportionately large figure we are the problem not the solution to global warming and impact on the environment. So each of these precepts can be taken to greater and greater depth and I'm only holding that out to you really for two reasons. First so that hopefully you'll see that this is process that we're talking about there is no getting there wherever you get there's going to be the opportunity to go deeper. So it's about living the dynamic of your life experiencing the tensions inherent in being alive on the planet and being in relationship with other people and doing the best we can by constant examination of what our intentions and what our meanings and plans for our lives and for the future of the planet. I mean to me this is an extraordinarily powerful vehicle which I have a love-hate relationship with there are times when I get got enough already I just feel like having a brownie I'm not hungry but I want a brownie anyhow you know or a beer or whatever. On the other hand I think my practice has benefited more by continually working with these precepts and attempting to go as deeply into them as possible which changes as I evolve and I think you'll each find that to be true for yourselves. Please whatever you do as you start to work with the precepts or as you have been working with the precepts be very kind and forgiving to yourself. These are very challenging and for Titnad Han to be able to say these things and probably live him he's a modern day saint and there may be some modern day saints in this room actually in this room or out of this room I haven't met yet any modern day saints personally but you know it's cool for Titnad Han to put this out there and to live it I think for most of us we're still in kindergarten and you know we need to go step by step and so as you attempt to work deeper to not be aggressive with yourself or harsh with yourself when you notice that oops bad word or whatever way it is that you break or violate one of the precepts I find it's often most rewarding to sort of throw the floor open now for some discussion I'm interested in what other people's experiences are I'm also open to any specific questions about my own experience and practice in this area and I'm also open to any questions relating to practice in general so if anybody I found your discussion tonight very interesting I took my vows about three and a half years ago now and actually going through the ceremony of thanking them was really kind of emacomactic in the sense that the process I went through when I began to consider the idea of doing that and it still is with me and one of the things that popped up for me is well Buddhism is a in some sense it's a guideline for a line of inquiry into our own something and so one of the things I did while I was trying to imagine that I could actually take these vows was every time I began to lie and I could lie to the self that was huge yeah I'm not sad I'm not proud of you know this kind of thinking I would stop myself and say why did I leave that line where was that feeling coming from was I feeling like small was I feeling scared where was it and that's like you're saying accept it and when I was able to accept that and create that line of inquiry connected to why I began to break about it was it was just in my mind it was like I could stop myself before it happened it was a you know sort of a process but it just opened so many blocks I would begin to understand so I'd just cry and cry and just wall after wall after wall and so for me these vows are not like you say it's a process it's and it's the journey and not the destination what you reminded me of is I I have very quick hands I was a good tennis player and I would be outside reading sitting in the sun giving myself cancerettes I have an appointment next week with the dermatologist to get all this stuff burned off and in addition to swatting flies I could pick them right out of the air and and when I started to get involved with the non-killing precept at that very simplest level of non-killing what I saw was the ego which was saying I'm more important I'm what matters and flies and mosquitoes and insects they don't count they're not part of the dharma they're not part of God's creation whatever language you want to use to the extent that much of this practice points to ultimately seeing the ego as an artificial structure created by the mind the very act of killing and destroying things was building that illusion of an ego and so it was doubly destructive I was not only causing unnecessary suffering in the world but I was doing it to myself by puffing myself up so I think that's related when we start deeply looking at what's going on here and find our own self-importance in it it's somewhere between humiliating and humbling depending on how you're wired up thank you it's great other observations questions and if nobody has any questions you're just going to have to sit that much longer so it's your choice I don't mind sitting yeah in the beginning you said something about that addressing these things helps you to improve or to go deeper quicker some along those lines if these things are addressed and moral issues don't really concern someone who's just learning to meditate and just wants to experiment into the world of meditation do you think not addressing those things would hinder any kind of progress within that journey or are you talking about who it is specifically and the main reason I ask this is because learning meditation you know depending on where you go what book you read who you talk to is very different some people talk about experiences in their meditation where they see things or gone journeys or whatever it's maybe to acquire psychic powers do you think these issues also come into play and these type of endeavors great question first I think I believe that morality is one of the foundation stones but I don't think we all have to wait until we're morally clean before we start to practice meditation I think the very practice of meditation will help us in the development of the morality so there's there's an interconnection that's very important there is no doubt in my mind that you can meditate and be a highly immoral person and still develop psychic powers the power of concentration probably it's not as easy to develop if you're leading an immoral life because the unless you're a sociopath the feelings of guilt remorse I wish I hadn't all of those are going to distract you from the development of concentration if you're a sociopath I can't help you because I don't think I am and I don't have that experience but part of the question becomes if you develop a very concentrated mind and with that a high degree of power without developing wisdom which would certainly encompass morality then in a sense I think you become the black knight and by that I mean the white knight the good guy is always in service of the king or in service of the dharma the black knight who develops these powers but has no morality is the brigand is only interested in himself and becomes a very unskillful source of pain and suffering not only to himself but the beings around him so I don't know whether that answers your question as crisply but it's the best I can do good question the way that way that that the different facets of meditation and and living by the precepts and for those who have been exposed to and gotten involved with taking on the three refuges all of these things come in to play interact and lead to I think a happier and better life the buddha when he taught said that he only taught one thing the truth of suffering and the way out of suffering and everything else is skillful means or or assists to that fundamental the four noble truths the truth of suffering and the way out of suffering to the extent that there's an absence of morality I would say again except for a seriously disturbed personality disorder that's creating more suffering for yourself and probably for other beings and so I mean if that's what somebody wants to do they get hooked on suffering I guess it's their choice but I would suggest that that's they're probably not in a practice that's really good for them probably have time for one more or I can't answer for your system. One thing I hear, though, that touched me is that whatever you were doing, you were doing out of compassion for your parents. So even if it's a lie, you're not really being harmful. This is coming back to that question. It must be truthful and it must be useful. So would it be useful for you to tell them the absolute truth? I don't know, but I'm certainly sympathetic to the position that you're in. It's not easy to tell people who care about you and are concerned about you if something isn't going quite right. If I wanted to look at it from another point of view, however, by being fully open and sharing with them, my experience is you create a bigger arena of trust and of interdependence and of community, and this is the other side. So it's like everything that comes, that's involved with the five precepts is, in my experience, is never totally, clearly defined. We just wrestle and we do the best we can. And then when we wake up a week later and we say, oh, God, dummy, did you blow that one? Then, well, you know, that's when I start my forgiveness practice and say, yeah, well, you know, I'm not a fully enlightened being yet. I'm not God. I'm just a guy who's trying to make it through life, minimizing my own suffering and the suffering about the beings. So would intention be more important in terms of practice, precepts? Intention is always very, very important in Buddhist practice. I think I mentioned in the instructions that the Buddha said, the mind precedeth all things so nothing can happen in the universe without somebody having a thought. Can you imagine the difference in the world if George Bush woke up one morning, instead of having the thought, God, those lousy SOBs, they've got all this stuff that's going to kill us, if he woke up and said, you know, it doesn't look like an immediate threat. So there is this thought in the mind that precedes everything. And one of the functions of practice is to get quiet enough and still enough so we can see those points of intention. At one level, saying, well, my intention, there's an old expression, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. We really have to look and see if our intentions are good and then follow through on them. But the intention not to kill, for instance, is really important. And if you're walking across the grass and you're killing some ants, you know, you're not breaking any precepts. It's part of life. There's no way we can move through without it. But if your intention is pure, in the Buddhist psychology, and now I'm going to book learning, not my own experience, karma is created from the intentions, not from the acts. So an act done without an intention to do harm is very different than an act done with the intention to do harm. So in the instance that you raised, your intention is to not cause your parents to suffer. That's not trivial. It's important. But it's not the full answer. And only you'll know what the full answer is. So I see where, oops, at 902. So let's just sit for 30 seconds or so. Thank you.
