So this relationship between thinking and emotions, emotions and thinking that we're talking about this week. 
And thinking has many layers, many different within us. 
And some of the more surface layers is called discursive thinking. 
Thinking that involves having a conversation or telling a story or imagining some scenario. 
That sometimes it's almost like it's watching TV or something. 
And this can have a powerful effect on our emotional life. 
Because sometimes humans are storytellers and stories have a big impact. 
And we have the ability to imagine stories as if they're real and they feel them in our emotional life. 
So we want to be careful with the stories we tell and the discursive mind. 
But then thinking can get quieter. 
And it doesn't have to be discursive thinking, a story we tell. 
But there might be some repeated attitude, judgment we carry with us. 
And that judgment might be one that undermines us or might be one that inspires us or poise us up. 
As the mind gets quieter and quieter, then it doesn't mean that we stop thinking. 
But the thinking becomes more subtle or more foundational or more underlies everything else. 
And that's part of the advantage of getting calm and subtle in meditation is that we can start hearing or seeing or recognizing the deeper ways, deeper currents of belief, of thoughts, of attitudes that are in us, that are often overlaid by discursive thinking or judgmental thinking. 
And that deeper layer is valuable to see. 
Even sometimes if we don't even know that it's there, it's casting its influence on everything else. 
It's kind of like the root from which everything else kind of grows or the root which kind of spreads some kind of food into everything else in the plant. 
But the food might not be, whatever it takes in from the soil, it might not be healthy. 
Or it might be healthy. 
So this deeper attitude to start seeing what it is and what's going on. 
And to give you some examples of some of the kind of maybe simple, deeper attitude beliefs that might be there, is sometimes when people get really quiet and still in meditation and just really tracking the breathing, people are really doing breath meditation, you can see that certain attitudes can appear for some people at a particular point in the cycle of breathing. 
So sometimes people see that, oh, I don't want to exhale because I don't want to lose something, I want to hold on. 
And it's not safe, I have to be safe by holding on. 
Or the end of the exhale is a common place for some people to get afraid because sometimes there's a feeling of the end of loss of control there. 
Or we're kind of, everything is going away and I might disappear, I might die or something. 
I won't exist at the end of the exhale. 
Or sometimes I've known people who have an attitude as they breathe in, they don't want to breathe in. 
Like, leave me alone, that's too much work. 
It's like the world is imposing itself on me and so there's a resistance. 
It's kind of very subtle. 
And so these are kind of symbolic. 
It's kind of, we discover that in relationship to breathing is a relationship that plays itself out in the rest of our life. 
But it's so subtle and so quiet, we might discover that there are very foundational emotions that are there. 
And those emotions give birth to a way of thinking or to the discursive thoughts. 
So to get quiet and quiet. 
So as I said earlier in the meditation, one of the attitudes that I had in my early years of practice, beliefs was that if something's happening to me, it's not the real thing. 
It's not necessarily logical to have that belief. 
But that's kind of, I never thought about it, I didn't think it out. 
I didn't even know I had that belief. 
But there it was when I got quiet, deep down inside. 
It was like that wasn't a policy that I had towards everything. 
So I could never do things right or never felt satisfied or content or at home anywhere because it was always the wrong thing. 
So you might think then that we have to cultivate the opposite. 
That everything I'm experiencing is the right thing. 
It's the real thing. 
Or for example, if you've discovered deep inside that you feel that you are somehow bad, then you might think that now you have to, that's what the thoughts tell you, that now you have to cultivate thoughts that you're good. 
And so there's a trap in recognizing what's deep inside, some belief we have, and thinking the solution is to have the opposite belief, the positive version of it. 
So if you have a belief that you're wrong or bad, then you have to kind of find a way to believe that you're right and good. 
But that's kind of a headache. 
That's work and how do you do that really? It becomes kind of a strain and expectation that we live by and a challenge. 
The alternative is to recognize some of the deeper beliefs we have, some of the deeper emotions we have that are difficult, and not set up the idea we now have to experience the opposite. 
It's powerful and enough just to stop thinking, I'm wrong, just to stop thinking that I'm bad. 
So rather than thinking you have to become now a good person, just stop believing you're bad. 
Instead of thinking that because you're afraid, now you have to develop bravery and courage, it's really enough just to learn how to settle and quiet and let go of the fear, perhaps. 
You don't have to replace it with something else. 
Because if you replace it with something else, you tend to be in a pendulum that can swing too easily between these six extremes. 
And also the attempt to go into the positive, sometimes it's wonderful to do and nice to do, I don't want to say never do it, but it often carries with it even deeper attitudes, a deeper belief around self, me, myself, and mine, like I'm the agent, and then, only then will people really love me. 
And so there's a deeper belief about what it takes to be loved, for example, or concern for that. 
And so as we go deeper and deeper in the practice, what we learn is that it's powerful, it's wonderful, simply to stop this way of thinking, these beliefs that we have, and not replace them. 
And there in the depths of who we are, maybe we'll discover that there's a kind of a peace, a kind of stillness, or a kind of spaciousness, or a kind of calm that has no opposite. 
That there's a kind of joy and a happiness that has no opposite. 
And so then we're not swinging so much back and forth. 
And it can just be there, and it comes without a belief. 
It doesn't have to have a self connected to it. 
It doesn't have to have some idea of who we are, and what we have to accomplish, and what we have to do in order to be a good person, a successful person. 
And we can just be. 
We're allowed just to be at home in ourselves. 
We don't have to prove ourselves, we don't have to defend ourselves, we don't have to have any particular experience, that's the experience we have to have, that we're allowed just to be ourselves. 
And then sometimes there's the idea that when you are yourself, the Dharma is the Dharma. 
When you just allow yourself in this kind of way to live in that deep place where there are not living in the opposites that we swing by, it's just this deeper place that has no opposite. 
So this idea that there's a deeper voice, belief, attitude, mood that underlies it all, you might want to see today, to let it be a quieter day, and see if there's something there for you. 
You have to be very careful with this, and very tender and compassionate, and if it feels like this is too much for you, or if the information you learn now is something you need to digest, and work with, and get support for, by all means do that. 
Don't stay kind of right up against it all the time. 
But you might also see if this can be a day where this deeper, quieter listening, and you might have a busy day, but maybe there are little corners of the day where you can sit quietly and just kind of tap in. 
What's deep inside? And if what's deep inside, what does it want to say if you could speak? Sometimes that reveals something that won't be revealed if we're just kind of feeling or tending to it. 
So maybe you'll discover too that in the depths of who you are, that's where your wisdom resides. 
So thank you, and we'll continue again tomorrow.
