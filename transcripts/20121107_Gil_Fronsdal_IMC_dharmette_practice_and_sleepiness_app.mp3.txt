Dharmette: Practice and Sleepiness

What I’d like to do this morning, instead of giving a talk, 
is to see if you have any questions about practice , or 
something relevant to what we’re about here , and see if 
I can respond in some useful way.  
 
Participant : I wonder about m editating and find ing 
yourself nodding off to sleep . What would you 
recommend?  
 
There  are a number of things you could do . I don’t know 
which one you want to do first , but I’ll give you a list of 
things. One is to consider whether you are getting 
enough sleep. Some people in our culture are more in 
need of sleep than they are in need of medita tion. We’re 
a sleep -deprived culture, so let’s consider that.  
 
Another is to look more widely at your life . Is there  
anything about how you are living your life that might 
cause you to be sleep y? Some people are very 
susceptible to sugar surges . I’ve know n people who ’ve 
had donuts before meditating , and felt really good for 
about  twenty minutes , but then didn’t feel good 
meditating. Or it might be  not getting enough exercise. It’s useful sometimes to take  a look at  the bigger 
picture .  
 
Then there’s the question about what to do in meditation 
itself. In a strict mindfulness practice,  you wouldn’t do 
anything about sleepiness,  but rather you would be 
mindful of it . You would turn your attention around , and 
make that the focal point of attention . What is it  like to 
be sleepy? What happens around your eyes? Your 
cheeks? What kind of fog brain do you have? 
Energetically , what’s going on? What’s happen ing to 
your posture? What kind of thinking do you have? Just 
explore the whole phenomenon  of sleepiness. B e 
mindful of it . Sometimes when you bring mindfulness to 
it, you wake up  and get clear , because you are actually 
studying it . Even if you don’t wake up and get clearer,  
you are at least addressing  the issu e.  
 
Part of dealing  with sleepiness is to look at your 
relationship to it , as I talked about earlier.  I’ve had war 
with my sleepiness in meditation . I can give you gory 
war stories of my relationship to it , mostly when on long 
retreats . When I was in Burma, I would get up a t two 
o’clock in the morning , and we wouldn’t eat any food 
after twelve o’clock noon . By four or five o’clock I’d start 
getting sleepy . In the evening I was really sleepy , and I 
thought it was a personal failing I was struggl ing with. I 
thought I was a terr ible meditator . I huffed and puffed , 
and tried to overcome it  – until finally I realized that if you get up at two o’clock in the morning , and you don’t 
eat after twelve o’clock , it’s reasonable to get sleepy by 
five, six, seven, eight o’clock . Then I beca me much 
more relaxed about it . I learned that what was useful 
was not just to be clear and awake . Rather,  what was 
useful was to give the practice the best effort I had 
available . And while the best available effort didn’t look 
so good , it was still the best effort available . That’s what 
counts  – not that you ha ve to always be clear.  
 
There’s a lot to look at when you’re sleepy : your 
relationship to  sleepiness , what’s actually going on 
physically, emotionally, and psychologically . That 
doesn’t involve changing anything . But you can also 
change things . 
 
Sleepiness can mean there’s an imbalance within us . It 
can be an imbalance between effort and calm. Some 
people think meditation is about becoming calm , and so 
they use meditation to soothe themselves . They stay 
with the breath, leaning into the breath to soothe 
themselves and get calm  – often because they ne ed to . 
So it’s not a bad thing to do . But if that’s what they think 
meditation is , at some point it  gets overdone , and 
they’re soothing themselves right to sleep . They get too 
calm , and there’s not enough effort .  
 
Sometimes , if meditation goes relatively well , they can 
get complacent . It’s all okay, and things get calm and relaxed – and they no longer make any effort. So it’s 
very important to have the right balance of effort and 
calm . You don’t want to have too much calm or too 
much concentration , if there’s not enough effort to 
balance it . And if you have too much effort , then you 
might get agitated . Where is that balance?  
 
Sometimes when you’re sleepy in meditation, it’s useful 
to bring more energy into the system . There are a 
variety of ways to do that . One way is to just sit up 
straight . If you sit in a chair using the backrest, maybe  
you don’t use the backrest when you’re sleep y. Instead, 
you sit up straight , and put more physical effort into the 
posture , so the physicality is there .  
 
Some people open their eyes if they’re sleepy when 
they meditate , because they are less likely to fall asleep 
with the eyes open . It also brings more energy , 
especially if you c an get bright (not painfully bright ) light 
shining into the eyes . It’s stimulating and keeps you 
from falling asleep .  
 
Some people will bring in mental energy or effort . There 
are a number of ways to do this. You can  just feel a bit 
sharper in the mind in order to be present for what’s 
there , and look more carefully . One way to do that is to 
use mental noting , where you say silent ly in your mind , 
using  one word , about what it is you are noticing . For 
example, i f you a re following the  breath,  your mental note could be, “I n-out.” Or you if you hear something, 
“Hearing .” Whatever it might be , you note it . And if you 
are sleepy , you note it with a little more energy  – a little 
louder in your mind  – not much more, just a little bit to 
overcome the sleepiness.  
 
If sleepiness  is a regular , ongoing thing , it can be  a form 
of resistance , or a reaction  to something . Boredom , 
aversion, and fear can all lead to sleepiness : “I don’t 
want to  deal with this. I don’t want to look at this .”  
 
Being overly stimulated by our inner landscape can 
cause people  to fall asleep . It’s like little babies who fall 
asleep if they are overstimulated . Put them in a very 
loud enviro nment , and the y will fall asleep . You see it in 
meditators sometimes when they have strong emotional 
releases or repressed memories suddenly coming up . It 
can be too much for the psyche to handle , and t hey just 
fall asleep . 
 
Sometimes turning around , looking at the sleepiness, 
and asking , “What am I avoiding here ?” might reveal 
what you are avoiding.  You see, “Oh! This is what I'm 
avoiding!”  And t hen you might  actually turn and look at it 
directly , rather than avoiding it.  
 
It’s a rich world , this world of falling asleep . It’s fun to 
practice with . It’s also a bit of a drag . But it’s even worse 
if you have ideas that your meditation is always supposed to be pristinely clear and alert .  
 
The idea is to practice the best you can with what’s 
happe ning in the moment . In the end , it might be that 
learning to be patient and equanimous about being 
sleepy is a n important lesson to learn. I’ve had to learn 
that. Late at night on retreats , sitting up , the meditation 
doesn’t look very good . My mind is wandering, I’m 
sleepy . I was very judgmental of myself , treating it as a 
terrible thing . I was terrible . But eventually I learned, 
“I’m just sleepy. That’s all. When I sit there , my mind 
wanders . I’m not s o presen t. Meditation isn’t working as 
well as earlier in the  day on the retreats . But it’s not a 
problem ; it’s just what it i s. I will try to be mindful and 
present for that the best I can. ” 
 
It’s helpful if you can  free yourself from your reaction s to 
sleepiness , and to be equanimous with it  – but at the 
same time , not be  complacent  or overly accepting  of it: 
“Oh, it’s all fine, and I’ll just drift off .”  
 
Make  some sense?  
 
Well, that was a long answer. I hope it was okay. Some 
of you don’t have that problem . Maybe that’s enough.  
 
I’ll tell you one more thing  about sleepiness. This is an 
issue for me mostly on retreats . I don’t think I have 
much experience of sleepiness during meditation in daily life . But sometimes when I’m sleepy in meditation , 
my mind just won’t work to be mindful . I’m falling asleep . 
Usually my posture slumps . There’s no qi – no energy in 
the system to hold myself upright . Then the primary 
thing I do is to focus on my posture , and sit up straight 
again . And then  I try to be present . If I kind of drift off, I 
sit up straight, and I stay there . It takes mindfulness and 
effort to keep the posture good . It’s not like this great 
beautiful spiritual experience of being with the breath , 
and floating on a cloud of joy or anything . It’s just like, 
“Gil, keep your back straight. Steady . Keep straight .” 
And I just keep doing it, coming back to that, and 
coming back again . Then, because I do that,  at some 
point something kicks in. The qi, the energy in the 
system, the vitality  kicks in  – and then it’s not an issue . I 
don’t have to make any effort an ymore to hold myself 
upright . I’m there , and then my meditation changes .  
 
I’ve had that experience e nough times , that I just take it 
as part of the process . I don’t see it as a problem : 
“Yeah , that’s what’s happening now. I don’t have the 
energy  or alertness , and I keep slumping . The best 
thing to do now is just to practice meditation on having 
good posture. ”
