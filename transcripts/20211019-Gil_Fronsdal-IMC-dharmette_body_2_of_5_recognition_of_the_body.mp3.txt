 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So this week we're talking about mindfulness of the body. And I think it can be one of the wonderful results of doing mindfulness practice is to become more embodied. And many years ago I read an ancient Mahayana Buddhist text that insisted that we don't get enlightened through the mind, we get enlightened through the body. And whether that's literally true or not, it's kind of an inspiring idea that certainly as we practice mindfulness, slowly, slowly, perhaps for some of us, certainly for me, the body wakes up, the awakening of the body. And we have more and more access to sensing and feeling the body. There are people who, for all kinds of reasons, you know, important reasons, significant things happen to them, difficult things, that it's very difficult to be in their body. The body is not a safe place to be, it feels like you tap into fear or terror, even sometimes to really drop in and feel the body. So to emphasize the wonderfulness of being in the body is a kind of careful thing to do because of how difficult it is. Some people live kind of from their neck up or from their waist up and feel really disconnected from parts of their body. And so for today, the emphasis is recognition as an aspect of mindfulness practice. In these five days of the week, it's relaxation, recognition, respect, restoration and release. And today's recognition, and the read, again, part of recognition is kind of to reconnect to the body, to spend time getting to know it and to learn to do it in a way that is not frightening or not distressing, but to do it with a kind of gentleness and care. For some people to do it in, you know, in very short periods of time, spend a little bit touching in and then pull out, just as long as it's safe. And I know for some people I've given them the instructions when there's been really difficult things in the body that to imagine awareness is like a soft cotton ball that we gently reach down and touch the place that's difficult and just like touch it with that softness of the cotton ball and then pull back and let it be, just so it's known and felt and we know it a little bit and then pull back. And slowly over time, in different ways, the body reveals itself to us. Sometimes it can be through discomfort. As the mind gets quieter, as the body settles down, we go through the layers of where the body is held and where there's tension. And there's layers of tension we have that we're not aware of because the coarser tension holds it in place, or kind of hides it or covers it kind of. And so when the coarser tension relaxes, then we're aware of deeper tension, deeper tension. And slowly there's a greater connection to the body. But it's not just a connection to the body, as if the body is something separate from you. The body has its own awareness. Often we call it sensing. Sensing and sensations belong to the body. And the place where we, like if I touch my hand, I have sensations of warmth and pressure against the palm of my hand now. And those sensations of warmth and pressure occur in the location where the other hand is pushing against the left hand here for me. So sensing, the raw immediate sensing, occurs in the body in the place where the sensations occur. And I like to say that sensing and sensations are non-dual. They're not really two different things. And then separate from that, I know the body knows it's warm when I touch it, knows the pressure. And separate from that, I can have the cognitive thoughts where I put the English word, warmth pressure on it. And if I speak a different language, I would use a different sound to represent that. Just sounds that we use to represent things, these words that we have. And so we use different sounds to represent it. But the body has already sensed it. The body feels it. And so this sensing body starts to wake up as we do mindfulness. And the parts that are numb or have been disconnected get reconnected. And so this recognition is also a remembering, putting the members of the body back together again that have been disconnected. And there starts to slowly over time to be a flow of harmony, a flow of the body. The whole body just hums in a very nice way. But the path to that is to appreciate this deeper recognition. So mindfulness practice uses the recognition part of mindfulness is actually extremely significant in mindfulness practice. And it works in different ways. But it's always simple. It's not a story. It's not an explanation of why it's there. It's not a review of everything. It's almost like what we recognize doesn't have history. It's just recognizing in the moment what's here. And so if I recognize the chest expanding as I breathe in, it's just the expansion, just feeling and sensing the expansion, feeling the movement. And then in addition, we can have the mental aspect. And the mental part of mindfulness practice is sometimes to use a mental note. And that mental note, a label, a sound, is just a... using a sound, a word that recognizes what it is we're experiencing. So expansion of the chest, movement that I feel. So breathing in. But that's two different forms of recognition happening. The immediacy of what's happening in the chest. And then it's very quiet, maybe in the background almost, there's a mental recognition movement, the expansion that's happening. Or if there's pain in the knee, pain is happening. But that's very... So like 5% of what the mind is doing is a label. It's not like we're pounding the mental note into the experience. It's more like a gentle brushing of it. Now this recognition, both the mental noting and the feeling of it, to really be part of that and enter into this recognition mode, is an alternative to discursive thought. It's an alternative to a wandering off, along with a story line or a commentary line or explanation or a prediction of what's going to happen. All the ways we can kind of get involved in discursive thought. And the idea is that the recognition begins to cut through that. Sometimes I think of it as the sword that cuts through the gordia knot. That our mental world of discursive thoughts can be so complicated and so many ideas that we live in and complicated histories and stories. And then we cut through it by just, oh, just breathing. That's an in-breath. That's an out-breath. There's a sound. Listening. Now there's an itch. Now I'm back with the breathing. The stomach is tight, relaxing the belly. And it's just coming back to that simplicity. And so using the simple, simple act of recognition to help us be engaged nicely in the present moment without being hijacked or pulled into the world of thinking. We don't have to struggle against thoughts. In a few weeks I'll talk about mindfulness of thinking. But for now, the idea is to kind of cut through it. Keep it really simple, the meditation. Mindfuls of thinking and the role of thinking comes later. But for right now, the simplest, we use the simplest kind of thinking to help us stay present. And that's that very simple one-word cognition of things. Pressure, warmth, expansion. It's more than a word. It probably is not simple recognition. But don't... So use the mental noting. Very gentle, soft. Or something that's close to it. If your mind is able to really stay close to that simple recognition without a mental note, you don't have to use the mental noting. But the mental noting is a kind of way of staying honest. Really knowing that you're not wondering off in thought. And just kind of steady pace. Breathe in, out, expansion, hearing, discomfort, pleasure, whatever it might be we're feeling and sensing. And then so, whether it's the cognition of a mental note or the cognition of the body's own knowing, the knowing that's much more silent, whichever helps you to cut through the thinking mind and connect you to something that's living, alive. Because it's a miracle to be conscious. It's a wonderful thing that I started off with about human awareness. That it's an amazing thing. And to stay close to the living moment, the living experience of life where cognition, consciousness, awareness, mindfulness keeps us in our animated body, keeps us in our living body, the lived experience. And the more we can recognize and open up and be present for this, eventually we start feeling and allowing for the healing potential, healing power of this body that we have. Healing not necessarily from physical illness and injury and things like that. But it's kind of a deeper kind of healing, spiritual healing. Healing of awareness, that this hum that moves through the whole body and becomes whole. So I hope that made sense. And to really get to know the body well is such a blessing. So I'd encourage you through the day today, the next 24 hours, for those of you in a different time zone, to get to know your body better. Listen to it. Maybe even have a timer on that goes on every few minutes, 10 minutes or something, and then check in with your body. Check in with your body every time you go through a door frame, every time that you change your posture from sitting to walking to whatever you do, standing. Whenever you pick up a new utensil, cooking or eating, find different things to just check in, check in. What's happening in the body? What is the body showing? If I listen to my body now, what do I learn? Recognize the body. Thank you.
