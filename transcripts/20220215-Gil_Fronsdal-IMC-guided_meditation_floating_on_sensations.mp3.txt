 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.Adiodarma.org. Hello everyone and welcome to the meditation session. And as we're doing the section of the Satipatanasuta on what's usually called mindfulness of the four elements, I like to call it mindfulness of the four properties, I'd like to do a meditation on these four. And what it involves is first beginning with just settling in in the usual way. And then at some point shifting the focus from the breath. I like to have the breathing as the primary focus for meditation, the anchor. But to let go of it to some degree and open the attention up to have the awareness, kind of in a relaxed way, gently, slowly, calmly, let the awareness float around the body to become aware of the different sensations in the body as they appear, as they call attention, as awareness floats in that direction. So it's kind of random, maybe, and there's not much choice. Sometimes this kind of meditation is called choiceless or directionless. We're not necessarily directing the attention anywhere, but we are staying in the body to feel the sensations. And just kind of move, the attention moves or different things, kind of parts of the body speak, and some of them become predominant and strong, and we're resting there for a while. And something else sooner or later we'll get our attention and shift and change. Or if it's a compelling area of the body, it might be that the attention wants to stay there, seems appropriate to stay there. But within that area, the attention kind of floats around and feels, it doesn't get fixated, it doesn't get zeroed in on something, but rather kind of just feels it around. And the analogy that's given is having a bowl or a bell, a brass bell, and just taking a cloth and wiping it from all the different sides. So just kind of randomly kind of be with something specific floating around on it until something else takes in your attention. So it's mindfulness of the body, but with a kind of choiceless floating awareness that takes in slowly, gradually, whatever wants to come. So beginning by assuming a meditation posture. And it can be helpful if the posture itself expresses the intention to be present, to be here in this place, in this time. Sometimes a posture where we start feeling a strong, good foundation to hold the weight of our body and to feel that contact. Sometimes a posture that is sitting upright, alert. Gently closing the eyes. And then gently, slowly, some little bit deeper breaths, using the inhale to connect here to the body now. Letting the exhale be a time to relax and let go into here and now. Breathing in and breathing out. And then letting your attention, your breathing, come back to normal. And for a few more breaths, relax your body on the exhale. On your exhale, see if there can be a settling into your body, deep in your body so that you're here in your body. On the exhale, relaxing the thinking mind. Any pressure or energy to think, any tension associated with thinking. Perhaps in the exhale that can be softened, higher and out. Gently now, letting your awareness be free to wander around your body. The whole body becomes the anchor to the present moment. The whole body is the where awareness resides. But within the body, let your attention, your mindfulness not be directed, but rather receptive and open to wherever sensations appear, wherever attention wants to go in the body. There's a lot of sensations, don't try to rush between them. Just in a relaxed way, settle for a moment in one place with their sensations. And as the mind wants, as the body speaks, let the attention float somewhere else. Or if it feels nice, you can just let the attention rest in one place. Maybe gently letting the attention float in that particular area, taking it all in. Bry, Noticing when the mind gets caught up in thoughts and ideas. See if you can set them tension free again so it can freely roam through the body, in the body. Taking in whatever sensations appear and disappear, appear and persist. Whatever calls the attention to it. Perhaps there can be a global awareness within which a more intimate mindfulness, attention floats around and touches different parts of the body as the sensations there become known. Rooted in the body, letting the flow of bodily sensations be known and there in an open, relaxed awareness. Setting, settling back and observing the flow of sensations in the body. As we come to the end of this sitting, for the next few exhales, ride the exhale into your body more deeply. Ride the inhale to spread your awareness through your body. For a few moments here, almost as if you let gravity settle your awareness deeper into the fullness of your body. And then as if your body is an organ of perception like the eyes and with the body, you could feel or sense or take in the people of the world. Not through the eyes, not through the usual mind and ideas of self, but this with a deeper, the body itself in some way can know there are others on this planet. Just as our body is made from materials that rises out of the earth, so does their bodies. Just as you have sensations in your body, pleasure and pain, so do they. Just as your body is the house which holds your heart, so it is for them. And perhaps we could end this sitting with feelings of warmth and tenderness and care for others, calmly, peacefully. From this place where we're meditating, a simple warmth and tenderness, gentleness in which goodwill can glow, radiate from us. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Amen.
