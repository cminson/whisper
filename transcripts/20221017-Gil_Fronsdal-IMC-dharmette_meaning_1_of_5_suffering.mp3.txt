So hello everyone. 
I'm starting a new week with a new theme and I think maybe the title of the theme, the one word for the theme this week perhaps, can be the word meaning. 
And now to want to spend this this week exploring the topic of meaning in relationship to meditation. 
What's the meaning of meditation? And I think in years past I would have been very hesitant to take up a topic like this partly because coming out of my Zen training, the idea of assigning meaning or finding meaning was often presented as being besides the point. 
There was something very significant with just showing up and being present without inserting or meaning on top of our experience in our life. 
And I love this idea. 
It was a radical simplicity. 
So much falls away. 
But I think we cannot get away from human life, human minds. 
Somehow, one way or the other, whether it's conscious or unconsciously, being involved in questions of meaning, of purpose. 
Why are we here? What's the most important thing for us to do? And so religions provide often sense of meaning and purpose and an interpretation of what's important, what priorities are, what we do with suffering, what's the meaning of suffering, what's the purpose in our life and relationship to suffering. 
And so what I thought I'd like to do this week is that with the hope that this topic gives a kind of depth to your involvement with meditation, that it gives kind of, lets your meditation be fueled or founded on based on supported by some of the deeper values, deeper understandings you have, maybe that you're not even conscious of, that gives your meditation more motivation, more strength, more value, more like gravitas in a sense. 
And so we'll do that by looking at the connection of meditation, association that meditation can have to a variety of different things in our life. 
Today I want to talk about suffering and I don't quite remember the sequence that I have, but I think that tomorrow was the important values we have and then the connection to values, the connection to ourself, the connection to others, and the connection to what is might consider to be sacred. 
So what's the meaning of meditation and relationship to these important areas of life? There was a tendency when this vipassana mindfulness meditation that I'm teaching, when it was brought to the United States, there was a very strong wish by the teachers to make it very available to as many people as possible without the hindrance or that it might be there if it was the whole Buddhist religious package was brought with it. 
There was an idea that this mindfulness practice is a simple raw basic practice, doesn't have to belong to any particular religion, doesn't have to belong to any particular philosophy maybe, and wanting to make it this practice available broadly and widely so it could benefit so many people. 
In fact they succeeded in many ways because they inspired those first Buddhist teachers inspired generations now of people who offer mindfulness completely separated from Buddhism, you know, sometimes called it secular mindfulness and clinical settings and all kinds of places. 
And it's I think it's been overall a wonderful contribution to society. 
And I think there's some real value in offering kind of a Buddhism light where we don't kind of pile in a lot of the Buddhist meaning, the Buddhist sense of purpose, Buddhist religiosity that surrounds it and just make it accessible to people easily. 
And that's still the case but what I'm hoping the discussion this week will prompt you to not feel like you have to adopt or adapt, you know, some Buddhist idea that might come through here but rather it becomes a mirror the teaching for you to reflect and think more deeply about your life maybe more deeply than you ever ever have for some of you about maybe the place of meaning and what what meanings do you bring and what purposes do you bring what is your understanding what it means to be a human being in this world. 
So perhaps this can be an example for or kind of for the value that can be found is that someone might go to the doctor and the doctor says you know you're about to have a heart attack and you're living with so much stress that I think you need to go and learn some meditation. 
So mindfulness is very helpful and there's a mindfulness center nearby why don't you go there and learn to meditate because you know you're without just dressing I don't think I don't see that you're gonna live more than a couple of months. 
So that motivates the person and the person shows up at a meditation center and learns mindfulness and and maybe the teacher there asks why are you here what's the purpose what's the meaning of you being here and so you or this person might say well my doctor sent me and therefore I suppose it's a prescription end of story and and then the the but then you press for further you ask the person the person you could ask or something the question further what what but you know is that why the doctor sent you and and that the the doctors and so because you know the doctor said that if I don't do it I'll die and I want you know you know I don't want to die and the meaning of the meditation is not dying but then you go first you know start thinking about more you're asked more questions and and so the question becomes oh well why do you want to live oh because I want to be able to see my grandchildren. 
I want to be able to finish the work that I do I love life and I just want to be able to live it fully I'm afraid of death and I'm trying to put it off as much as I can. 
I feel like I haven't really dealt with my big issues in my life and I'm really before I die I want to finish and deal with those issues so there's all kinds of so this thing I do have that doctor says you have to go and meditate because otherwise you'll die begins being connected to other values other important ideas about why you should stay alive and and those can are animating forces there's a reason reasons some people don't know why they're alive with it people don't have a meaning or purpose that they have and some people might do it because they've discovered that they can live much more peacefully if they don't have live searching or questioning or or getting all wrapped up around issues or meaning purpose and they just happy just to kind of roll along with whatever's happening then that becomes the meaning that becomes the purpose just roll along just be present and it's the meaning is that the meaning is a hindrance and it's just nicer just to roll along with things so to there's many so what's the meaning what's the purpose what's their interpretation we have and so just might be interesting for some of you to know that in kind of classic or quite kind of standard Theravadan Buddhism that this tradition comes out of. 
I consider myself a Theravadan Buddhist in this role of teaching but I don't really have much place in my heart or my mind for some of the core teachings that give meaning give a purpose to Theravadan Buddhism some people will say this is a foundation of it some people say that without believing in this there's no Buddhism even but I take exception with that and my sense of meaning is very Buddhistic. 
I have some kind of an ultimate sense of meaning and purpose that comes from this practice but I don't share some of the core things that some of the tradition has so I'm not motivated so example would be I'm not motivated with idea that the purpose of this practice is so that we will no longer get reborn that doesn't speak to me doesn't inspire me doesn't have a place for me it's completely appropriate and fine for someone else to have that view. 
I don't have a issue with that but it's just not what animates me and and and the idea of you know that I would you know the purpose is to no longer be reborn it doesn't really do much for me and so but but do I have something else that's comparable I if anything I feel that it's enough for me the idea that to have a radical freedom from suffering they really let go of suffering in some deep way and then live this life free of the attachments that clinging that's motivating for me it's almost fundamental but in the background of that there is some kind of idea that I don't hold very tightly but some sense that of trusting life of feeling at home in this universe and so this letting go of suffering letting go of clinging is also a homecoming into this universe where I'm no longer standing at opposition to it or or or making some problem with it so these are all ways of making meaning of purpose of contextualizing interpreting what we're doing so I want to just end here now with one of the things to find that people find meaning in or purpose is in relationship to suffering and some people will inherit some meaning what suffering means what the purpose of suffering is from their religions they grew up with and there are some religions that have a very important idea that's suffering is redemptive that you're supposed to suffer it's good to experience suffering because it prepares you for the hereafter some people say that suffering is testing our religious faith and so we have to kind of you know somehow hold on to our faith when we suffer that's the key thing about what we have to do and we'll get rewarded if we hold on to our faith and and you know there's all kinds of ideas people have and in Buddhism the kind of the meaning of suffering is that it's unnecessary and that it's motivating in order to come to the other side of suffering to be free of suffering to radical liberation from suffering there's a famous quote from the Buddha where he says I teach suffering and the end of suffering and why end suffering you might say there's no need to ask why just like you take your hand off a hot stove you don't have to ask why you do it it's your body will do it immediately so it could be that simple like almost like a biological imperative to be free of suffering but there might be other things there might be the idea that yes I want to be free of suffering so I can be a better support for the world around me. 
I wanted I want to be free of my clinging so that I can act with act act from a place of compassion and care for this world take care of my family. 
I want to become free of the kind of sources greed hate and delusion that bring about the suffering so that I can live a certain way or be a certain way or do this and that the so what is your meaning what how would in terms of your meditation practice what's the purpose what's the role what's the meaning of suffering how does suffering fit into it and how does that fit into a wider circles of meaning or deeper circles and meaning in your life is it simply just to be free of suffering and that's enough or is there some deeper purpose that that serves from deeper value is it just to kind of be free of stress so you don't have a heart attack or you know what do you if you're free of suffering what what do you hope that will do for you what is your aspiration what is your sense of purpose if you can become radically free of suffering or a suffering just kind of a free freedom from suffering and coping with suffering kind of a little bit of a side show that you do reluctantly so you can get on to what's most important what is most important what is the most important kind of way then would you understand your life what your life's about what it means to be a human being what is and what is suffering and free suffering how does that fit into that in your life so I hope that this makes some sense for you and I'm hoping this is a catalyst for you to do some reflection and I would encourage you if you have anyone friends family total strangers that maybe you engage in this topic of meaning and purpose and what is the fun and most fundamental meaning and purpose that you have that you associate that you live by and how does meditation connect to that what second connection meditation might have to support that so thank you and and we'll continue these reflections over this week.
