 So, good evening everyone. And so a few announcements. The most important ones are that, which I regret not having forgotten to announce last week, and that is that a couple of our Sangha members have been seriously ill, I guess is the word, or injured in the last weeks. And Peggy Jacobson had a mild heart attack. And when she went to the hospital, I guess they did some kind of test and found out that she needed a triple bypass surgery. And the heart attack was actually a blessing because otherwise it could have been much more serious. And the operation was apparently a success and she's been home now for some time and is slowly in spurts getting better, she feels. And if things keep going better, it's likely she'll feel better. But when she's healed, then she was before she had a heart attack because of all the clogging she had in her arteries. And then Bill Nason, who often asks questions, many of you know him, he often has a scarf around his neck. He was hit by a car bicycling and broke many of his ribs and broken arm and a wrist and has been in and out of the hospital. He was in fact today for the third time, today I think to sew back muscle back onto his arm, I think. And whereas Peggy Jacobson, I think, has a lot of family around him, Bill Nason doesn't have any family. He recently lost his wife. So, mission's all, it'll be nice to all at least hold them both in your thoughts. And if you know them, maybe you want to give them a call or send them a card. And what else? Any other announcements? Yeah. The February sign up sheet for volunteers is out there and we have approximately seven volunteers. I did a somewhat intensive workshop, a letter workshop. I guess that's what it should be called. I'm not really in the workshop business. I was invited to Los Angeles to a large group of Vipassana students in LA to do a weekend, they called it a seminar, a weekend seminar on death and dying in Theravada Buddhism. And I've done this a few times now and what I've learned is that it's not very much, very interesting to talk about traditional Buddhist understandings of what happens at death and what happens at rebirth and all the doctrine, as I say dogma, doctrine about karma and how it works, that people kind of lose interest pretty quickly. And what's really vital and a lie for people is how to practice with that, how to practice with death and dying. And we didn't have enough sense as Vipassana students about the practice. We don't necessarily need to have a lot of doctrinal understanding about what Buddhism has to teach about metaphysics of life and death. But anyway, I was down there and it's still kind of in me, the topic, and so I wanted to spend some time talking some more about it today. And thinking about this topic today, I thought about one of the Sangha members here who told me recently that she appreciated that I talked a little bit about my own retreat experiences that I sat in retreat in January. And she felt that it's nice to hear more about meditation Monday night and maybe some of the topics tend to wander away from that to wider areas of spiritual life. And that could be, and maybe more people need to know about Thursday evening. Thursday evening is the evening where it's much more practical, a discussion is much more practical about meditation. And then Monday is more supposed to be about meditation, I suppose, but a life based on meditation, based on mindfulness, which anybody who practices mindfulness for a while realizes that the boundary between formal meditation and everyday life is just a relatively arbitrary boundary. And pretty soon after you do this practice for a while, you realize that the practice applies it's a way of living, not just a way of sitting in meditation. So maybe there's some permission Monday nights to go a little bit wider afield. But still Thursday nights, Thursday evening is a very nice night for those who want to kind of talk more and more chance for discussion. And I tend to focus the talks much more on the specifics of meditation. But death and dying is not so far afield for mindfulness practice. In some ways, it's one of the great companions traditionally in our tradition that goes together with mindfulness meditation itself. And if you look, if you read, which probably I'm sure most of you maybe haven't and maybe never will, the scripture, the Buddhist Sutra, which talks about the very mindfulness practice that we do, the very sutra it all comes out of. It has a number of practices in there, which we never talk about or hardly ever talk about, because what we offer, what we offer usually for various reasons is something that can look more, is more like a choiceless awareness practice. We simply stay attentive, choicelessly to whatever arises in our experience. But there are also practices in the Sutra where the mindfulness practices, which are more choiceful practices, we choose certain themes or certain objects of attention. And one of the mindfulness practice talked about in the Sutra is mindfulness of death. And it's a very important part of the Sutra. It goes on and on quite a bit. And what it is specifically is contemplation of corpses in various stages of decay. And in ancient India, it was a lot easier to find corpses in various states of decay than nowadays, at least around Palo Alto. And there's a kind of squeamishness even, I feel, that Sathya will often admit to you that this is in the very scripture that was so important for us. Isn't that kind of grotesque and gross and morbid to spend time looking at a decaying corpse? And it goes through nine different cemetery meditations in different stages of decay. And as the body decays, it's quite, you know, nature takes a quite interesting process and it's quite dramatic. So what's it doing there? Why do we have it there? And also meditation and reflections on death and dying are considered to be one of the guardian meditations or guardian practices for Buddhist spirituality. And so such things as there's four guardian meditations and one of them is thinking about the qualities of a Buddha, awake in person, kind of inspires us. Another is reflection on death and another is loving kindness. And I think of these two, loving kindness and reflection of death as being a very important complements or supports or guardians or companions to the basic mindfulness practice that we do. And so I think it's useful sometimes to talk a little bit wider than just mindfulness, but also about these companions to the basic practice. And we talk a lot about metta, about loving kindness, partly maybe because in America we need that so much. However, we don't talk very much about death and dying, even though it's equally as an important companion to mindfulness meditation. And it's said that mindfulness practice itself is a preparation for dying, for confrontation with death. And most, but however, there are all these also these specific practices that focus on reflecting and being present and contemplating death and dying. And most religious traditions I think have practices or such contemplations or practices. There are stories in the Christian tradition of monks who would spend their life with a coffin they were going to be buried in, in full view of their normal life. They'd be kind of propped up against the wall of their little monastic cell where they lived, kind of always being reminded of the inevitability of death. And then there's Tibetan and also Burmese monks and lay people who will wear a mala, one of these Buddhist kind of worry beads or rosaries that are made out of human bone. And again, it seems maybe kind of strange for us in our culture, but it's certainly a reminder of what's in store for all of us. And that's something which tends to be quite overlooked or forgotten or pushed aside in our culture. And that's talked about a lot. You find many places people refer to the kind of denial of death, which has been a big part in the last, not so much in the last decade perhaps, as the hospice movement and stuff has changed a little bit, especially in California and some other places. But there are many decades of this century where denial was the operating mode around death in this culture. And I grew up in a, and much of my upbringing was in a suburb of Los Angeles where I never saw anything, I never saw death, never saw anybody dying, any death or anything. But it wasn't surprising because I never saw my neighbors. You know, everybody had their yards in their back and they had this electric car, you know, electric garage doors and they come off the street into their garage and close and that was it. And you'd walk down the street. It was like a ghost town. So no wonder. And then I also grew up a little bit because I'm Norwegian. I grew up back in Norway and when I grew up in Norway, it was, it was kind of in a city and kind of an apartment working class area. And it seemed like it was a regular part of the life there for death to be around. I remember the main way I would see it was they'd have what's called the Norwegian Svechter Maria. The Black Maria's would come and the Black Maria was the Black Hurst that would come to take away. The structure would come out with a, with a, I guess a blanket over the whole corpse and we'd be carrying it down from the apartment where the person had died. It said that 80% of Americans die in hospitals. Whereas at the turn of the century, 80% of Americans died at home. And there's a whole very, it's a very different event when you die in the hospital and the hospital itself is kind of, it's hospital is kind of built traditionally for health and for preventing illness and preventing death. And there's a kind of denial sometimes of death that happens in hospitals. There's a kind of hope against hope, as one author wrote about that. Doctors often function under that they always want to offer hope. Now they always want to try their best to try to prevent death because that's what they're trained to do and what they're set up to do, even when death is inevitable. But the main event that you'll be taking place when you're dying is you're dying. Now attempts to prevent it if you're dying. Right? I hope you understand that one. So there's this wonderful hospice movement and it was nice to have Frank Spensky come down a few weeks or months ago, talk about this Zen hospice in San Francisco. Milarepa said, without mindfulness of death, whatever Dharma practices you take up will be merely superficial. And that's okay to be superficial, I suppose, from some points of view. People come to mindfulness practice for many different reasons. Some just want to cope with stress or help with their headaches or some people want to just be able to just cope with busy life or difficult stressful life. But if you really wanted to make it go deeper, so not just simply a coping mechanism or just a hobby, one of the ways to kind of ensure or help guide you to a deeper spirituality is a real serious contemplation of death and dying. And it's not meant to be morbid. It was quite wonderful, this retreat in Los Angeles. How many people in contemplating and doing practices on death and dying expressed an increased appreciation of life, an increased appreciation of the relationship they had. And they wanted to go back, they're kind of eager to go back and have more intimate and honest relationships with their relatives and friends and became kind of an affirmation of life to contemplate death. It depends where I mean, I can't lean forward, can I? Will you stop? You turn it off. The Buddha's own spiritual quest traditionally said to have started with his confrontation with sickness, old age and death. And he was trying to come to cope with that, to deal with that. And it's interesting that someone pointed out that many of the world's great religious leaders lost a parent as a child. And the Buddha lost his mother when he was just a baby. And other people, Zen Master Dogen lost his father when he was quite young and his mother when he was six or seven. And it said that Zen Master Dogen, he was sitting at the house by his mother when she was dead, sitting next to her corpse. And I guess they'd offered incense there. And he sat there and he watched the incense smoke floating up, the incense smoke floating up past her body. And he had a deep realization of the impermanence of life. The, what's the word? Anyway, the impermanence. And you cannot understand Zen Master Dogen's teaching without the deep appreciation of life and death and impermanence. And nor I think the teachings of the Buddha, it's central to Buddha's teaching. And then the Buddha's spiritual quest in a sense can be said to have ended the night of his enlightenment. And the night of his enlightenment involved, part of it involved his confrontation or his meeting with Mara. And Mara, the word Mara literally means death. And it's kind of a cognate with the French word mo and you know, it's a mortality. Actually the way Indo-European language kind of meanders through history or whatever. And we have the same word as a root, Sanskrit and English. Reflection on death and dying is one of the universal meditations. There are many, many meditations you can do in Theravad and Buddhism. They have said there's 40 traditional ones, but there's actually many more. But it said there's two of them which are universally applicable to anybody at any time. And the other is, you know, suitable for different people at different times and different personality types or whatever. And the two universal ones is reflection on death and dying and loving kindness. I asked Joseph Goldstein some years ago if he ever married anybody because that's often what the pasta teachers are called to do. It's interesting what we're called to do. You know, I just did, you know, I do my meditation, I become a teach meditation teacher and then I mass to marry people. Or do memorial services or do funerals or be at people's bedside as they're dying. And you know, why that connection? You might think about that. Why do someone who does meditation practice and teaches meditation, why are they called in at those periods of a person's life? So I asked Joseph if he ever married people and he said he was kind of reluctant to do it. He wasn't really into that kind of role so much. And then he said, well, the first time I ever married someone, I gave a Dharma talk on death. Which is somewhat, you know, fits some of the flavor of some of Theravada Buddhism. And but maybe it's a good time to contemplate death because I don't know. But certainly when I, you know, when you marry someone and it's supposed to be for a lifetime, part of the package is that most likely one of you is going to die before the other. And part of the package is to be there with death and dying. It's part of the package of marriage. I said that this weekend and someone then said, some woman then said, that's probably why I cried half the day on my wedding day. So reflection on death and dying, meditation is a preparation for death. It's said traditionally it brings disenchantment with greed, hate and delusion and increased appreciation for life. And also I think this is very important. It activates motivation and energy for a spiritual practice, for liberation. And to the degree in which we avoid or deny the presence, ever presence, possibility of death and death in our life, we deny ourselves a certain kind of source of motivation for our spiritual practice itself. So I spent a good number of years when I was a monk. No one told me to do this. It kind of happened spontaneously. But almost every day I would reflect on what I would do if I knew I was going to die that night, that evening, and how it's been the rest of the day. And it was very instructive to me to see what my responses were and how my responses changed over time. And I remember at some point the response was, well I'll just go to the meditation hall and meditate. And that seemed like the right thing to do. And at some point later the response was, I just go for a walk or just keep doing what I was doing. And I thought that was better somehow. And so part one of the meditations we did at this retreat was, once people get kind of settled in their meditation, we would reflect on that question. What would you do if you knew you were going to die tonight? And then what would you do if you knew, and then after that, after a few minutes, you switch. What would it be like, what would you do if you had only four hours to live? What would you do if you had only an hour to live? And what if it was only 10 minutes left? And then the last one was, what if death was now at the end of this breath? And for many people that was a very powerful meditation. And there were many people, they told stories about what it was like. But one, I remember one, she said when she had the rest of the day, she kind of got into her busy mode, which is the way she lives her life. And she kind of goes to which she's going to rush home and call everybody and write and clean up her apartment. But when she had only four hours, she realized she didn't have time to do all that. And she kind of said, well, I'll just hear with these people and I'll just be with these people here. And we got to be 10 minutes. All the different things you could think of doing, like even using the phone and everything, didn't make any sense anymore. And then she found herself amazingly just present to the sounds of the rain dripping outside and the wind kind of blowing against her cheek. And she said, she was so present that it felt like, you know, she was in very deep state of mindfulness. Just here, just this was enough, very precious time for her. And a lot of people said something similar, that the closer they got to the death, the more they kind of woke up to the present moment. And that's the point of the practice, isn't it, anyway, to wake up to the present moment. So again, death is considered to be a natural event in Buddhism. That's the kind of point it takes. And so that's part of the reason why there's a contemplation of corpses in Buddhism, because the decay of a corpse is considered just part of nature. And you want to just respect and allow nature to take its course. So what often happens in monasteries in Thailand is when a monk dies, the abbot will arrange for the monk's body to be put out in the open for some time, just so the monks, the other monks can be around and just contemplate death and what happens with death and dying. The great teacher of Buddhadasa, who died a few years ago, his instructions was, please just put me and when I die, just prop me up against a tree in the forest. And part of it, I think, was just he just, that was it, it was enough for him. It didn't need to be a big deal. And he didn't need anything, you know, but he just, it was part of, it was a natural event, put me in nature and let nature take its course. But I suspect also he was his final teaching to his students to watch nature decay. But they didn't let him do that. He was like one of the most very most famous and revered monks in Thailand. And the very kind of funeral he didn't want. Well, he had to have the king and the queen came. And that's a good, that's an important lesson, is that it's very important, maybe it's not direct, doesn't follow directly. But one of the things we talked about at the retreat is we don't know what our death and dying is going to be like. And there's a tendency in our culture to idealize it sometimes, especially in the kind of new age culture. And you have all these books about wonderful spiritual ways of dying and you can just be at peace and go into the light and live happily ever after. And people I've talked to who spent a lot of time with dying people, hospice workers and stuff like that, will say, yeah, sometimes it happens that way, but many times it doesn't. And there's no way of knowing for sure. And there's no way of controlling it. There's no way of controlling what anybody's death is going to be like. Sometimes we spend some time at the retreat talking about what kind of conditions people would like to have in place for their dying. I think it's useful to think about that and maybe even try to have that happen. But as we know from what we learned from mindfulness practice is you better not try to control your experience. And if you try to have expectation and control what it is, that's very controlled as a source of suffering. And if your spiritual practice is really challenged to the root of your being, there has to be a willingness to let go of even any notion about how you're going to die. And your dying needs to be completely, it has its own agenda anyway probably. And can it be okay for it to be awful, painful, sudden? 20% of Americans apparently die suddenly, unexpectedly. And this could happen to 20% of us. Or it's very painful, long drawn out. Or you get dementia. And you get a lot of anxiety. And you lose your mind and your memory. It seems that people die in character. So you better take care of your character while you can, to some degree. And what happens, it seems, many of us, we operate on the analogy, we're on the surface mind. We have all this kind of personality we put into place to be kind or nice or be a certain way in order to cope nice with society. But as we get senile or as we get sick and weak, the energy and the effort to hold that in place diminishes and we can't hold it in place. And the personality traits that's under the surface mind begins to kind of have a chance to be stronger. And if you haven't taken care of the subterranean parts of your life, who knows what will come out. And it's not so uncommon to hear people as they get senile just get more angry and get very, very angry. There's many reasons for that. But sometimes it's because the underlying personality trait is one of anger and they manage to hold it up, kind of repress it or avoid it or something. So I've heard of stories of known people who got very angry as they lost their mind a little bit. And then there's a beautiful story of this man who, I guess he had Alzheimer and losing his memory from many things. And some old, old friends came to see him. They were invited over for dinner. And so they knocked through the door and the Alzheimer patient opened the door and looked at these people and he said, I don't know who you are, but you're heartfully welcome in my house. So there was some kind of generosity of heart which was still present. So we die in character in part, to some degree, but we don't know. We'll die afraid. Is it okay? There's all these wonderful zen stories of zen masters and zen monks who die with great dignity and die in meditation posture or choose a time of death. And if you're really a good zen master, you're supposed to write a poem, death poem, part of the job qualification. So then there's a story of the famous zen master from a couple of centuries ago. He was on his deathbed, so his disciples brought him a piece of paper and a brush so he can write his death poem. And so he wrote something and he handed it to his student. His student went out in the hallway where the other students were kind of waiting breathlessly to see what their famous death poem would be maybe. And they looked at the scroll and it said, I don't want to die. And they thought the students thought there must be some mistake. So they went back and gave him another piece of paper. And he wrote, I really don't want to die. So who knows, you know, how even someone who's maybe should be well prepared has to be okay to be afraid and has to be okay to for it to be awful. And that's what we learn in mindfulness practice, a kind of okayness, a kind of trust that nothing needs to go according to plan or the way we want it to be. A trust that has nothing to do with what we say, the conditioned world. The conditioned world can do whatever it wishes. And perhaps there's a kind of deeper level of trust that we find. And to some of you, maybe that sounds strange, but Buddhism as a religious tradition should be taken on as a challenge. If it's really a religious tradition of any worth, it should really, I think, challenge us to our marrow, our being. And how many of us really are interested to be challenged to our marrow. You don't have to be, but that's what a spiritual tradition's job is, I think, in part is to challenge our deepest sources of attachments and views and senses of self and sense of what reality is. And one of the things that can be challenged in this mindfulness practice is our attitude towards death. Why are we afraid of death? And it's said that many people are afraid of death, not because of death itself, but because there's fear of loss or fear of pain and fear of abandonment and fear of shame. Some people, sometimes people, someone talked about this at the retreat, how he felt that for him, sickness was a failure. And he had to be a productive member of society, always kind of working and producing and doing stuff. And if it wasn't working, then he was kind of like a failure to not be healthy and vigorous and strong. And death was the ultimate failure for him. And so he was afraid of death. Well, guess what? He was guaranteed to fail because everybody's going to die. And then there's a woman there who realized suddenly in the middle of the workshop that she had, she avoided any contact with people. She was an older woman, maybe about the late 60s, 70s, who she realized that she avoided contact with anybody who was older than her around her same age because she didn't want to be around people who were getting sick and dying or reminded her of that. And she went to hikes all the time and she hung out with younger people who hiked all the time because she was trying to avoid the inevitable in a sense. But that was one day on Saturday. And then the end of the day on Sunday, she said, we were talking about what kind of conditions we would like to have as we die. And she was kind of crying. She said that what she most wanted was someone who can really see her as she died, really acknowledge, really see who she was. And because maybe she never really had been seen. And that's what she really wanted as she died. But the juxtaposition between her not wanting to see anybody else die and then really wanting to be seen when she died stood out to me really strongly. And maybe those two are closely related. And so she was really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really interesting. So the fear of death can often be broken down into other kinds of fears. And if you're broken down to other kinds of fears, like fear of loneliness or loss of control of the body or the mind or humiliation or loss of your usual self-identity, that's the world of spiritual practice. And that's what spiritual practice is supposed to address and to overcome those kinds of fears. Are those fears optional or are they necessary part of life? All those kinds of it's said that the Buddha, when he sat under the Bodhi tree and was enlightened, and Mara came and tried to dissuade him from enlightenment, death came to visit him, that he kind of conquered Mara as a traditional word, conquered death. In conquering death, it's said in the tradition that death lost its sting. And it didn't mean he wasn't going to die, but it lost its sting. It didn't have it even hold him, it didn't grab him, there was no fear perhaps of death anymore. So there's two ways in Buddhism, I believe, traditionally of, of, can we say cope with death, our fears and difficulties with death and dying. And one of them is to practice with all the things, all the fears and all the need for meaning and need for contact, the need for, to all the psychological and kind of kind of issues that come up for us, to really be honest with them and face them and deal with them and come to kind of clarity about what's going on. If you're afraid of losing control as you're dying, can you let go of your that kind of fear and let things go out of control? If you fear of pain as you're dying, can you learn to find some way to be somewhat at ease with pain? Or, you know, all these things, can you work with that so death loses its sting? And this is, I think, if you read history of Buddhism, Buddhist texts, this was the early way that Buddhism offered their students, students of Buddhism, to work with death, is to really work with all the issues you had, fears you had with death. And one of the things to work with is your attachment, if you have one, to immortality, to wanting an afterlife. And it's said that someone who's enlightened neither is attached to really concerned about this life nor a future life. It's not an aversion to life, but no longer attached either to this life or any future possibility of life. And that's kind of what comes with enlightenment, that kind of freedom and sense of ease or trust with life that you no longer need anything to be different. So that's one whole way of coping with life, with life and death. The other way which tradition offers is certain viewpoints about what happens with death and rebirth, the whole metaphysics of rebirth and what goes on there. And for some people, believing in the traditional Buddhist understanding of rebirth brings them a lot of comfort, or some comfort sometimes, because, oh, they think there is continuity. That death is just kind of a comma and a long series of causes and conditions, a long series of cause and effect. And so it's no big deal, just like one change. Life and death happens moment by moment, and death itself, at the end of a lifetime, is just one more moment of life and death, of rising and passing. And you pass away and there's another arising that happens. So there's a kind of continuity. And knowing there's continuity, people kind of can feel much more comfortable with the idea of dying. So that's one possibility, and you're welcome to investigate deeply into Buddhist metaphysics of life and death, and some people can find comfort there. But I think for many Americans, the first option, I think, is one that attracts us the most, because I think a lot of Americans don't really, aren't that interested in rebirth and offerings and possibilities of rebirth, but really interested in learning about ourselves and working with ourselves in a very direct way. So I spent some time on the weekend talking about both fear and grief, and how many of our emotional lives, our emotions, are a mixed package of things that we think often like fear or anger or grief. We don't investigate, we investigate it, it seems like a solid event. This is it, I'm angry, that's all, or I'm full of grief, and that's all, or just fear, and that's all. But with mindfulness, with investigation, we begin a sense of tease apart the different elements that make up our emotional life. And it's very important, I think, with fear and also with grief, especially with grief, because grief sometimes is denied in our culture, the possibility of full grief, just as death is since denied. I've known people who were told at some point, you know, get on with it, you've grieved enough. Can you imagine how awful, tell someone that? Oh, you've grieved, you've done, you've done a month now, or done two months now, or six months now, and that should be enough, get on with your life. We don't know how long the grieving process will take, and we have to allow for the possibility of the grieving process to have its natural lifetime, whatever that could be. But I think as mindfulness students, what we can also do is to not only give it space and respect to something like grief, but we can tease apart the different elements of it. And grief is often complicated by many kinds of concerns. Grief is sometimes nixed. I like to think of, sometimes I've talked here about anger, and I think of resentment as being held anger. And that's really poisonous to hold the anger as resentment. I think of, and this is a matter of definition, make me careful about definitions. Let me say it a little bit differently. Maybe I told you this some time ago, but in, when Jerry Garcia had his memorial service in Golden Gate Park, wavy gravy led a march through the park, and he was chanting, what do we want? And the people following him said, good grief. When do we want it? Now. What do we want? Good grief. When do we want it? Now. Good grief. So what's good grief? And what's the difference between good grief and and I think maybe not bad grief, maybe stuck grief. And that's the important thing to tease apart the difference between stuck grief and good grief, unstuck grief. And stuck grief, what is that? I think stuck grief is when the grief, the sorrow, so if resentment is held anger, then stuck grief is held sorrow. And sorrow is a natural part of life, and to feel our sorrow and mourn properly and everything is really important to do. But can we see when our sorrow is mixed with guilt? And it's often the case, you know, oh, if only I had, and you fill in the blank, if only I'd said I loved them before they died, or if only I'd brought them to the doctor in time, or if only I'd, you know, wis or that. And so there's guilt that's tied in with it. Or there's shame, or there's some kind of self-judgment that goes on. And that kind of stuck grief isolates us from ourselves and from others. And what's possible to find, and what I think we kind of hopefully find in our emotional life, in our death, in our in our dying, in our grief, is how to use our emotions as a way to overcome the separation that it can have. So to really open up to in sorrow with good grief to our family and relatives, it's actually a way of creating increased connectedness. And to shut off and be stuck in our grief can often separate and isolate us from others. And I've seen it at deathbeds, where there's a lot of sorrow among the family and friends. And they want to deny their sorrow, want to deny their their grief. You can turn it off if it's too disturbing in the back. And so it's been so difficult for the person who was dying. And the person who was dying didn't want the people of their family around them because of the level of resistance or the level of stuckness, the level of all these things that kind of attachments that family and friends can bring to a deathbed. And I've also seen situations where the family and friends share their very deep sorrow and loss. And the two people, the dying person and the family and friend, met in the sorrow in a deeper way they ever knew each other before. So can we use our sorrow to connect rather than to separate? And how do we do that? Here's the question. So that's kind of a very quick run through and kind of summary of some of the things we talked about on the retreat. And I and mostly I guess the main point I wanted to say tonight is is reflections and contemplations and thinking deeply and practicing with death and dying as themes. Is a traditional meditation practice in our very tradition. It is not considered morbid but considered to be very helpful for living life more fully. But also to come have some ease with our own death and ease with being with other people who die. This is very useful to do. And if you're interested in our tradition in a wider way than just simply mindfulness, this is one place where you can do some very good work investigation. And this is not this wasn't supposed to be a plug for anything but just be sure so that you know there's some follow-up. Not leave you hanging. In May, for those of you still here by then. I was here. Because we don't know. We really don't know. And it's true. I don't say it as a joke. Paul Howler and I are going to do a workshop or whatever for our Sangha here in Palo Alto, May 16th and 17th, Friday evening and Saturday. So there's a chance to those of you want to follow up. 16th and 17th. I'm death and dying. Death and dying. And it's not going to be advertised. So it's the idea is just mostly for our Sangha here. I'll end with a poem if I may. If I have your patience. This is by Mary Oliver. When death comes like the hungry beer in autumn. When death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse to buy me and snaps the purse shut. When death comes like the measles pox. When death comes like an iceberg between the shoulder blades. I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering what is it going to be like that cottage of darkness. And therefore I look upon everything as a brotherhood and a sisterhood. And I look upon time as no more than an idea. And I consider eternity as another possibility. And I think of each life as a flower as common as a field daisy and a singular and each name a comfortable music in the mouth tending as all music does towards silence. And each body a line of courage. Something precious to the earth. When it's over I want to say all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom taking the world into my arms. When it's over I don't want to wonder if I've made of my life something particular and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened or full of argument. I don't want to end up simply having visited this world. So I wish you all well and thank you all very much.
