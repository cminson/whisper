 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So reading the Mettasuta, I'm just going to go back a little bit here, may all be happy and secure, may all beings be happy at heart, all living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, born or too big born, may they all be happy. Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere. Let no one through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer. As a mother would risk her own life to protect her child, her only child, so towards all living beings should one cultivate a boundless heart. With loving kindness for the whole world, should one cultivate a boundless heart, above, below and all around, without obstruction, without hate and without ill will. Sitting or walking, sitting or lying down, whenever one is awake, may one stay with this recollection. This is called sublime abiding here and now. One who is virtuous, endowed with vision, not taken by views and having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure will not be reborn again. So that was reading Gil Froncell's translation of the Metta Sutta, which is published in this book, The Issue at Hand, which is free for the offering at IMC. So I memorized this Sutta early in my practice and would say it mentally to myself every day and I'd ponder each phrase and some of it sounded really lofty and difficult to achieve. And some phrases struck me as very curious. I didn't completely understand them and others really resonated with me. And one that resonated particularly strongly for me was contented and easily supported. That was valuable to me for a few reasons. One was that at that time in my practice, the word happy, you know, may you be happy in the kindness or friendliness phrases sounded way to Disneyland for me for what was going on in my life right then. I just thought happy, you've got to be kidding me. But the word contented had a different ring for me and settled more easily into my heart and mind. So tonight I'll invite us into meditation with that word as a possibility. Now I want to acknowledge that different words, one of the really interesting thing about these Brahma Vihara practices of kindness, friendliness, compassion practice, sympathetic joy practice, equanimity practice, the particular words that are used sometimes evoke different reactions in each person because we have all this conditioned experience in life. We've been through so much each of us and our lifetimes have shaped us in certain ways so that some words have a harsh ring to us. Some words have a soft ring. Some words, you know, fit perfectly for us and others are we think that just isn't the right word. So what I've noticed about these meditations though is that whatever you response to any particular word in them, it's useful. So if you find yourself rebelling against a word or resistant or just finding it slightly off, that's great. That can be information. And whether you investigate it during a meditation or you just notice, wow, that doesn't sit really well and you save it for reflection later, it can be useful. Same thing if something lands just like, oh, that's great. That just fits. It feels great. That also is interesting to notice what in our life has led to a word ringing well. And that's also worthy of investigation or sometimes some words can just be flat out confusing. Have no idea what they mean by that. I wonder what they mean by that. Why did they pick that particular phrase or words? And so no matter which way any word in a guided meditation lands, it's an invitation. It's an invitation to learn more about what you've, you know, what's been conditioned in your mind in your lifetime, whether through things that you want to have more of or things that you would like to have and or things that you don't really understand. And as with any guided meditation, I also want to note that you're always free to work with the words that I present, or you can let them fade into the background and meditate with whatever comes up for you. So with that, I'd like to invite us into a half hour of guided meditation and first maybe just finding a posture for yourself that feels relaxed enough, feels, but, you know, allows you to feel alert as well. And maybe start by noticing how you are right now. And by the way, I see a request in the chat to read the Metta Sutta again. So I will begin our meditation by reading the Metta Sutta again, so that everyone can hear the words to start our meditation. But just before we do that, allow yourself some moments to just recognize how you are. What are you arriving with in this moment? You may have been through any kind of day, an easy day, a challenging day, something that's waiting you down, something that's lifting you. Just take into account what's happening in your mind, in your heart, and in your body right now. And starting with the Metta Sutta. To reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good should be capable and upright, straightforward and easy to speak to, gentle and not proud, contented and easily supportive, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calmed, not arrogant and without greed for supporters and should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize. One should reflect, may all be happy and secure. May all beings be happy at heart. All living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, keen or unseen, near or distant, born or to be born, may they all be happy. Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere. Let no one, through anger or aversion, wish for others to suffer. As a mother would risk her own life to protect her child, her only child. So towards all beings should one cultivate a boundless heart. With loving kindness for the whole world, should one cultivate a boundless heart? Off below and all around, without obstruction, without hate and without ill will. Standing or walking, sitting or lying down, whenever one is awake, may one stay with this recollection. This is called sublime abiding here and now. One who is virtuous, endowed with vision, not taken by views, and having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure will not be reborn again. And now allowing yourself to bring up a sense or an image of you, of the parts of yourself, your heart, your mind, your body, that might benefit from some sense of contentment. In all parts of you, there may be parts that feel quite discontent, unsettled, struggling, suffering, in pain. And for the possibility, what might it be like for some small sense of contentment to arrive? Maybe it's simply being contented in this moment to acknowledge and recognize that you're not always one's experience, just as it is right here, right now. This life is not going through any great struggle, but perhaps just has those moments that don't feel quite satisfied or satisfactory. Things that you want to last that don't last or conditions that persist that you wish could come to an end. Might there be some small sense of contentment in this moment simply to acknowledge that those things are part of your life and every human life. Notice that things are as they are because conditions unfold the way they do. Perhaps you experience pleasure or bliss or happiness in your life right now. Being content that that is here now, that things do change. That do arise and pass. And as each moment of this meditation arises and passes, allowing it to content that it is here for as long as it's here and gone when it's gone. And it is showing you your experience right now. If there's another word that bubbles up for you that is more suited to you than contented, align that word, it could be ease or at peace with or aligned with any phrase or word that comes to your mind. Wishing yourself, may I be at ease, may I be aligned with what is arising and passing. May I simply be with what is here right now. May I be at ease, may I be at ease, may I be at ease, may I be at ease. And if your mind gets involved in any of the content that's arising, any of what's happening in your life right now, simply allowing yourself the wish, may I be content with what is showing itself to me right now. May I be at ease, may I be at ease, may I be at ease, may I be at ease. Not demanding anything of yourself, simply extending well wishes to yourself. What is arising in each moment of this meditation? Letting yourself know. If there is another person who has arisen during this meditation in your thoughts, may you be at ease with what is happening in your life. Whether they are someone who is easy to be around with whom you already feel a great moment, you can allow that person to come into your meditation at this point or you can continue with well wishes for receiving each moment yourself. Let your mind show you which is a good direction for your meditation right now. Calling to mind what you are facing or what this other person is facing. Letting it fill your senses, giving visual images, whatever gives you a sense of your experience and their experience. What might it be like to wish contentment or ease or even just the possibility of a little more contentment in this moment of time? What would it be like for you and for them to be contented and easily supported? What would it be like to be contented and easily supported? Even if we have no power over conditions in their life or ours to change anything, just wishing in the moment some measure of ease, some measure of support, some measure of receiving what is happening, content that things are as they are in this moment. Wishing yourself and the other person well. Wishing that it sounds blades Mick and hunch over so Ridleyha. Thank you. And allowing any other well wishes that are bubbling up for yourself or for another in your life to flood the mind and heart. Sending whatever wishes might be beneficial to sin. Just Perhaps allowing yourself to acknowledge the presence of the powerful, large or small, the ways that you engaged in this meditation is a cultivation of more ease of heart and mind, of more ability to receive the reality of this moment and the next moment. With acknowledgement of whatever comes up, appreciating whatever cultivation of well wishes, of wishes for receiving experience with some possibility of ease for being content in the moment that you see it or what it is. Letting yourself appreciate that you are here for a few moments. Letting yourself appreciate that you are here for a few seconds. Lets take a moment to realize that you are there for the So this phrase, contented and easily supported, is a very interesting one. And the longer I've reflected on it, the more I've felt that it does not mean an invitation to be complacent. Or it does not mean that life is great, perfect, you know? Many of us, well, most of us are working on our relationships with ourselves, with each other, with society, with the planet as a whole. And many are dedicating their lives to bringing about positive change on any of those levels. Just cultivating a more peaceful being in the world or trying to bring more peace to the world, whether it's in your own friends and family or in the larger society we live in. So in those arenas, being content does not mean that everything is fine the way it is, not at all. But instead, this cultivation of being content in the moment with reality as it is, I see as being content that experience is showing itself to you, that it's sending you information about what your own heart and mind need, what the conditions are that have affected you, that have harmed you, that have inspired you. Each moment of meditation, we're getting so much information about the conditions of our lives and what it will take to change our own hearts and minds for the betterment of humankind. By doing this meditation, by cultivating kindness, by cultivating these qualities that were listed in the Mettasutta, we're actually saving the world from the parts of ourselves that have not been conditioned very wisely or that continue to create suffering or discontent. At the same time, I think in doing these friendliness, loving kindness meditations, it's not necessary to drill down on them as though it needs to be a self-improvement project. If you're simply cultivating, cultivating awareness of what's happening here and now, cultivating the ability to receive information from our experiences of things we identify with that maybe we over identify with or things that are changing more rapidly than we can keep pace with or things that feel difficult. If we can just cultivate the heart and mind to be with those, that's what I see in this phrase, content and easily supported. An easily supported in that phrase lends itself to all kinds of additional reflections on what it means to be easily supported on the planet or in our relationships or within ourselves. My hope is that reading this Mettasutta and inviting you into this meditation simply surfaced some things for you that are worthy of reflection, maybe some moments of appreciation for even engaging in this heart cultivation that is aimed at saving the world from ourselves. With that, I'd like to invite you into some small groups. I'll have us go into groups of three to be able to share a little bit about what the words contented and contentment brought up in you during this meditation or other words that felt better for you or felt more useful for you like ease or alignment with and what might be, and even if it brought up complete disagreement with the word altogether or any of the words, please reflect on that together, what might be a skillful way to work with what came up? That's the arena that I'll invite you to share with one another about. In dividing you in groups of three, we'll spend about 10 minutes in the groups. I just invite you to listen very open heartedly to one another. One person share a little bit and then let the next person share and then the next, etc., going around the circle, putting in one piece and not commenting on one another's sharing, but rather just using it as an opportunity to listen deeply to one another. So one, two, three, four, five, six. It looks like we may have five or six groups and you may find yourself with two people or four people, but enjoy your sharing and let me just set up these breakout rooms. Enjoy. See you in a few. Premiere. Welcome back. Thank you, Allison. So we have a couple minutes before we end our evening, and I'd appreciate any comments, questions. Anything anyone would like to share? Just raise your physical hand or your Zoom hand. Yes, Richard. I wondered if someone, maybe not today, but in the coming days would put that version of the Metasutra in the group email, to send it out. Oh, thank you. I'll ask Diana if she can do that. I'll take care of her, Liz. I wrote a link. Thanks so much, Neil. Really appreciate it. And also you can find the link on the IMC website, I believe. So Sharon, please. Oh, I was just going to thank you for sharing where you were 17 years ago. I had the shared belief too that happiness was a pretty lofty goal. And I instantly realized before this meditation that I could definitely identify with what you said, that ease was what I would start out with. And I always thought of it as the opposite of disease. So that just seems like a really natural goal. Who wants disease or disease? Yes, really good point. Yeah, and sometimes we can recognize by the absence of something like disease, that there is some ease in that. Or in the disappearance of some of the afflictions that fall away as we continue to cultivate mindfulness, that there is a possibility to feel content, even if we're trying to change the world around us in many ways. So I just want to thank all of you for your practice this evening and for talking with one another, sharing your experiences, and for cultivating these beautiful qualities of heart and mind. And may this practice that we've engaged in benefit everyone's life who is doing this meditation this evening and the lives of those around us. May we cultivate ease and contentment and may we bring it to the world. May all beings be free of suffering. Thank you well everybody. Thank you Liz. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Good night. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody take care. Thank you Liz. That was wonderful. Thank you. Thanks Alan. Alan you.
