 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Arriving with yourself. Connecting to how you are in this moment, just in a simple way. How's the body? Is there tension held in the body, kind of habitual tension held in the body? And if so, can there be a little softening? I'm exploring a relaxation of the body. Sometimes when we recognize tension held in the body, it can release either through the simple recognition of it, sometimes just that will allow it to release, or sometimes we can consciously soften. Oh yeah, holding there. I can relax that area. Relaxation of body is such a support for this arriving with ourselves, being with ourselves. Sometimes another way into this relaxation of body is to just drop a request into our body and mind. May the body release tension that's here. May the body relax. And then rather than trying to do it, just see how that request lands. Just be available to notice how the body and mind respond to that request. May the body relax. May the mind relax. Also exploring the possibility of releasing, letting go of worries, concerns about the past or the future. Letting go of tension in our minds. This exploration of what does it mean to relax, to be here with ourselves as we explore relaxation. This is a mindfulness practice. We are being aware, mindful of where tension may be, and noticing what happens as we recognize it, as we either consciously release it or perhaps incline towards letting go. Sometimes this can be this exploration of relaxation, especially in our daily lives. This can be a really supportive part of our meditation practice. Feeling into what it means to be aware when there's even just a little bit more ease in the body and mind. And we can also, if there's a little bit of sense of a little more ease, recognizing that, being aware of that. I'm curious too about this simple activity of mind that is awareness. Being aware in this moment. Are you aware? And opening to just whatever is clear or obvious in this moment. A little slight shift of emphasis in the meditation from orienting towards relaxation to just curiosity about what's here. Receiving, not needing to go out and look for anything, but just settling back and seeing what comes to you. Often the most obvious experiences are physical. Body sensation, maybe pulsing, tingling, coolness or heat, softness or hardness, or perhaps other physical experience such as hearing, sounds, coming and going. Body sensation also coming and going. We don't need to try to hold on to any particular experience. We can settle back and notice the changing nature of experience. That physical sensations come and go, or maybe pulse and recede. Or maybe if a sound is kind of ongoing, a kind of a fluctuation in that sound. Can there be some ease or relaxation with this changing landscape of experience? It's the nature of experience to change. At times you also might notice, receive along with the physical experience. At times some aspect of the mind, mental experience, thoughts coming and going, moods or emotions kind of welling up, sometimes lingering for a while and then perhaps receding, or perhaps the welling up of some thought and emotion and then another one following on. You may notice how our mental experience also shifts and changes. Relax and receive this dynamic shifting, lifting landscape of our human experience. This is its nature. If the experience starts feeling a little bit drifty or daydreamy, you may simply acknowledge that. That's just another mental activity at work, this driftiness. And yet not to give in to the driftiness, can there be an awareness of it? And if it's useful or supportive for you, you could connect again a little more consciously to the body, the changing dynamic experience of body, support, remembering awareness. Thank you.
