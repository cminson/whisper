The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Today in the guided meditation I'd like to point in the direction just a little
bit of recognizing awareness itself just a little bit and partly because that
topic is going to come up in the discussion afterwards. So just a
little bit of kind of pointing to that so there may be a little bit of a
reference when we get to the discussion. Well we'll start as we often do by just
landing with ourselves,
connecting with how you are in this moment. A very simple way, almost as if a
dear friend were coming in checking in and saying, how are you? And not asking
for a verbal response, but just able to kind of resonate with us, awareness that
resonating with how we are curious, interested, like a friend might be
interested in how we actually are in this moment. However we are just opening to
that honestly, with honesty, with openness. This is how I am right now. Whether
there is relaxation or tension, agitation or ease, just receiving. Receiving
yourself. And in this acknowledging how you are if there's any
tension in the body or in the mind, perhaps inclining towards softening of
that, relaxing, allowing the body to relax.
It can be useful to explore relaxation in a simple systematic way, scanning
through the body. Just checking in, maybe the face, the head, the neck can relax.
Maybe the shoulders, arms and hands can relax.
Just allowing any tension that's accumulated through the day to soften
and release. Maybe the chest and upper back can soften, relax, all those
muscles around the rib cage.
Softening across the stomach and the abdomen and lower back. Maybe the hips
can relax, the legs, the feet. And maybe also inside the body, in the core of the
body, sometimes there can be a softening there too. Maybe the inside of the throat
can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can
relax. And maybe too there can be a softening of any mental tension or
worries or concerns that may be present, just for now, setting them aside, allowing
the mind to relax. Sometimes through this relaxation we may kind of move into a
drifty kind of space. It's possible not to fight that or think that's a
problem, but just almost allow that drifty kind of space can be what the
expression of relaxation of mind is in a moment. So perhaps there can be an
awareness of that soft space, if that's happening for you, may or may not be.
Not needing to change how you are.
From whatever relaxation of body of mind is available for you, opening to awareness,
being aware of what's happening in the moment, letting go of choosing anything
in particular to attend to, kind of settling back and seeing what wants to
come to you, what wants to be received by awareness. Awareness kind of like a
mirror that reflects whatever's here, and so allowing a kind of a stepping back
and receiving what is easily received by awareness in this moment. It may be body
sensation, often that's a very obvious experience that awareness recognizes.
Settling back and maybe there are body sensations arriving in awareness.
Maybe the breath, the sensations of breathing. Maybe sounds, the sound of my
voice or sounds in the room wherever you are. Body sensations might be clear and
specific like the pressure of the feet or the hands, the contact points, or there
might be more vague, ambiguous, diffuse kinds of body sensations. Just receiving.
Maybe emotions or moods are obvious or thoughts even. Can there be a steady
curiosity about what's next? What is coming to you? It may shift and change body
sensation for a moment and then a sound, another body sensation, a breath, a thought,
a sound. Exploring the possibility of awareness steadily receiving whatever is
here, a changing flow of experience perhaps.
For some of you it may be more easeful to pick a particular experience out of all
of the arriving experiences into awareness and just let your attention land with that.
It may be the sensations of breathing or maybe the experience of hearing. For some
of you it may feel very restful to not have to choose anything and just let the
experience flow through one thing followed by another. Both are fine. Whatever
feels most supportive for you in this moment, begin there.
And whether you are choosing a particular experience to connect with or opening to
changing experience, at some point the mind will wander. You'll lose track of being
aware in the present moment and the mind will drift off into something else, the
thinking or fantasizing or daydreaming or planning or remembering. At some point there's
not much we can do while the mind is wandering but at some point awareness
will return and you will remember that moment. Awareness is back. That's a great
moment to begin to be curious about what's it like to be aware right now.
What's that shift from not being aware to being aware? That moment when awareness
returns is a great moment to be curious about the experience of being aware
itself. We don't have to worry that we've been thinking. If the mind wanders
we've got an opportunity to notice this difference between non-awareness and
awareness. What's that like when awareness returns? It will return with
something, with some experience. Often it will return with thinking but maybe
there can be more curiosity in the return of awareness than in the thinking
itself. So this is an invitation. Do not worry if the mind wanders so much. I try
to hold on to being aware continuously because when the awareness returns we
have an opportunity to notice something more about awareness itself. And in that
moment when awareness returns just be really light in that moment. It's not
like trying to turn around and hold on to anything. Just kind of that curiosity.
It's like the light comes on. It's very similar to like being in a dark room and
the light comes on and you can now see things. So what's that difference? What's
that like? Just a little curiosity about the return of awareness after you've been
lost.
