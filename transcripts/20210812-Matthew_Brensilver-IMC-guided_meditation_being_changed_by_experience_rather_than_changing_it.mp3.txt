 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome. Welcome home. I'm just seeing the names stream through. And yeah, welcome to all of you. Welcome to all of you. Yeah. So here we are again together. And yeah, let us practice together. So finding your posture. Even if it's very familiar, finding it again. Taking a posture that's both supple but strong. To know it's a kind of openness to phenomena. Thank you. Thank you. We relax whatever. Tension can be relaxed. Whatever tension remains, we allow to remain. Thank you. Thank you. Our practice is to release some of the tendencies we have around pushing and pulling. Pushing and pulling on phenomena. So rather than trying to shape our experience, we just let ourselves be softened by it. Let the heart be softened by experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For all the phenomena converge on feeling. The centrality of feeling. The urge to fix, to adjust, to shape. The limits of our equanimity are felt in the realm of feeling. So we permit phenomena, sights and sounds, thought and sensation. We permit them access to our heart to feeling. We're willing to be impacted. We're willing to be still. We're willing to be changed by experience rather than change it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we stand down. Settle back. We're willing to feel our way through the flood of urges. Virges to shape experience. To shape ourselves. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
