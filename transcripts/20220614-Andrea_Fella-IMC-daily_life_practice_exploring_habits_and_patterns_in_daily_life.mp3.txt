The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
I wanted to continue this exploration of looking at our experience in our daily
lives right in the midst of what is happening. We've been exploring just the
basics of how to be aware, recognizing that we're aware, and some of the tools
that might support that. Checking into having a particular task or something
that you commit to trying to recognize happening. Extending mindfulness a
little bit through a particular chore or activity. So just some basics on how to
explore being aware. Just recognizing oh awareness is back. Today I'd like to get
into an exploration more around areas that we may have difficulty in our lives.
Last time I was here I talked about working with difficult stuff in the
world, difficult news, things like that, and explored a kind of a reflective
practice, a way to work with those things in a place, in a space that you are
kind of setting aside to explore. But this today I'd like to explore what it
means to actually begin to meet some of our challenging patterns and habits
right in the midst of our day. In our usual way of living our lives, walking
through the world, we kind of operate out of kind of habitual tendencies, deeply
conditioned patterns and habits that often are deeply rooted in our family
origins, deeply rooted in our cultural conditioning, deeply rooted in what our
experience has been in our lives, ways of orienting to the world. And a lot of
times we respond or these habits and patterns are happening below the
surface of our conscious awareness. We're not so cognizant or recognizing them,
it's like they're in our subconscious and they, we don't even know they're
happening until they burst out into some kind of a reaction or something that we
say or do that we realize, oh, that's been there, I didn't, I didn't see it. And so
we might think it's not so possible to touch into that because it does seem to
happen so fast, it's like lightning sometimes that these things happen. In my
own exploration of this in-daily life as well as in sitting meditation, I have
found that mindfulness can really begin to penetrate what we think of as a
barrier to the subconscious. And so it is possible to begin to see these habits
and patterns as they're forming, as they're beginning, but the way into that
is to start by being curious about whenever you notice them, to be mindful
of whenever you notice a particular habit or pattern there. So for myself I've
talked about this a lot because it's kind of how I got into this practice. My
very first mindfulness practice was kind of a curiosity or an interest in
understanding this habit of mine to get angry. I had a particular event in my
life that was really triggering very strong anger to the point of rage, to the
point of basically being non-functional when I got into that state. I would just
get frozen and be entwined in the mind not aware of what was going on. And so I
began to be curious to use that. I didn't have many tools for working with
it but a friend of mine pointed me to mindfulness and the simple curiosity of
can you know that that's happening while it's happening. And in that book that my
friend sent me, that curiosity about mindfulness, it also pointed to not
necessarily trying to be mindful all day long but picking some particular
projects, picking some things that you might be interested in understanding or
exploring. And so that's another piece of this encouragement that I'd like to
explore with you today. You know, don't try to track everything that's
happening for you all day long necessarily. If you can get there, that's
fantastic. But I found that at a beginning when we're working with daily
life, it's helpful to choose some specific things that you're really
interested in understanding, really interested in. So in the in the course of
my practice over the last, I don't even know how many years now, twenty-some,
twenty-twenty-two, twenty-three years, something like that. No, it's more than
that. It's like we're like twenty-five, twenty-six years at this point. Over those
years I've explored a lot of things that I found. I've had interest in
exploring. Anger was the first one. Anger was the first one. And even in that, you
know, I started with it in daily life because I didn't have experience or
instructions about meditation. And I wasn't particularly interested in
sitting in quiet with my eyes closed. I wanted to understand how my mind worked
in daily life. And so I was exploring this in daily life. And over the course of
the number of years there's been a number of things that I've explored, things
that I've been curious about. Why do I feel lonely all the time? Why do I get
impatient? What's going on there? So that curiosity of that particular pattern.
So that's in terms of exploring something that happens. I'd suggest
something that happens regularly that you're really interested in exploring.
You don't necessarily have to pick the most intense thing, although that's what
I did when I started. Before I even knew what mindfulness was really, what I knew
how to meditate. It's like, well, I want to understand anger because that's where
I am like really suffering. So there was a lot of motivation there. And there was
a lot of interest with this book that said it's possible. And by the way, it
really helps. And my friend who also said, yes, it's possible. And I found it
really helpful. So I used those kind of encouragements to inspire me. I was
really interested. I had some evidence from friends and reading that it was
possible. And so I was willing. I was willing to try it. And so for myself in
this exploration over the number of years, I've kind of weaned or pulled out
how I did this. I'm going to talk a little bit about ways that this
unfolded for me in various, you know, different kinds of patterns and habits. So
the first piece I think that I want to really want to emphasize is picking
something that you're interested in and just kind of setting that intention to
I want to know when this happens. That's essentially what I did. I want to know
when anger happens or later in my practice when I started looking at
impatience. I just want to see when impatience happens. I want to know it
when it when it arises. And then seeing if I could be aware, what was obvious?
Just the most basic, how am I? And that's why in the guided meditation I offered
that kind of exploration, just the exploration about how you are in an
emotional field. Some of that exploration in the guided meditation might be a way
in to checking in. When you notice a pattern or habit there, how am I? You
might notice some of how the body is, you know, some of the more specific
sensations. Wow, my fists are clenched, my face is tight, my throat is tight, my
stomach is clenched. Or for myself in impatience, I noticed that I was just
right kind of like bouncing off the walls, just like my physical
actions were kind of erratic, not very smooth. So I just just noticed kind of
some of the specific, we can kind of notice some of the specific body
experience. And then I really want to point to that broader sense, the more
the broader sense of how the whole thing feels. How are you in that vague
diffuse way? That can take some practice or some time. And for
myself that is something I've learned over the last, I don't know, 10
years or so of my practice, that skill. I didn't hear people talking about it so
much in my, in getting instructions. And so what I started with, really, was just
a very simple kind of high level take on how am I? And, you know, it was kind of
at the level of, wow, this hurts, this is painful, you know, that's kind of
the, the flavor of what I was aware of, especially with the anger. You know, with
the anger I was, you know, it was kind of like I was in a kind of a rage when I
first noticed it. It had, it wasn't like I was noticing it early in the process
when I first started noticing it. Yeah, it was in a full blown rage, I was frozen.
And what I could notice was that there was a rage, the mind was kind of stuck,
caught, and it hurt. That's about all I could really know. And so this points to
the next piece that I want to point to. So, you know, notice, you know, kind of
commit to recognizing a habit or pattern, something you're interested in, and then
noticing when you notice it. It may be well into the process like it was for me
with that first time I really noticed the anger well into the building up of
that anger to a rage, or it might be earlier in the process or wherever you
notice it. This is how I am right now. And then the next piece in terms of daily
life. If you have a few moments when you notice it, it's great to do a little bit
of exploration, you know, curiosity about how is the body? You know, what can you
name the emotions that are there? Can you notice this diffuse or broad quality of
experience? If there is time in your day in that moment, then take some time, you
know, maybe two or three minutes to kind of check in the little bit more
investigation about the experience. But often I find I'm in the midst of
something that is requiring my attention, or it's something, you know, that I
don't quite have the bandwidth or the capacity to be both mindful of, for
instance, driving and paying attention to this experience. And so the next piece
is really having noticed it. Can you perhaps, and this is a big
piece of what I did with the anger, it's like, wow, that's very strong. I have no
idea what to do with this. You know, I don't, I didn't actually really know how
to be mindful of it or investigate it. And so I kind of just said, well, I guess I
just get on with my day. So there was a kind of, in retrospect, what I see was a
kind of a gentle setting it aside. I wasn't trying to force it down. And the
reason I didn't have to force it down was because the mindfulness, the
recognition of, wow, look at this, this hurts, gave me a little bit of space to
be able to say, wow, yeah, I guess I just have to go back to work right now.
You know, so I didn't try to repress it. So there was a, there was a kind of a
gentleness with it, that the mindfulness allowed, you know, the
record, the simple recognition of, wow, I'm really angry, I'm frozen, I have no
idea what to do with this, it hurts, what do I do now? I guess I go on with my
day. And so that, that meeting of the experience gave me the capacity to set
it aside and just go back to what I was doing in my work. So turned to back to my
computer and went into that activity. And that actually was helpful in that
moment because I do have some capacity and this is different for all of us. And
so you may need to turn to something that's, that lets you let go of that
difficult thing. If it's a strong thing like that, you may have to turn to that,
to something that's a little bit easier to attend to. And for me, you know,
turning to attend to my work, that was something that was fairly easy for me to
kind of go into. And so it let me kind of put my attention somewhere else and let
that the anger just be there without having attention to it. And because of
that, not giving that anger attention, it began to die away. So I don't even
remember so much what happened next. I just remember, I guess I go on with my
day and going back to work. But that itself was kind of amazing because it
cut into that being frozen and non-functional. And let me go back to
being functional again. And so over the, this is, you know, kind of exploring,
working with something really challenging over the course of the next few
weeks and months. I noticed it a lot, of course. You know, I noticed the anger a
lot. And I just did this a similar kind of thing. Wherever I'm noticing, wow, here
I am. I'm angry. There it is. And what do I do? I guess I just go on with my day.
Again, with that very gentle setting it aside and just going on with whatever
else I was doing. But there was a turn, I think there was a turning of the
attention to the something else. Like it wasn't just spacing out what else I was
doing. There was a redirection of the attention. And I think that's an
important piece of this process in working with the challenging emotion. It's
this not now. It's a kind of a setting aside tool. When something's really strong
and it's stronger than our capacity to be mindful of it. I kind of like, you know,
I bow to it. I see you. And not now. I'm going to turn my attention to something
else. Something that's simpler. And it may be, at a certain point in my practice
with anger over, and it was a several year process, over a certain point with
my practice with anger. I noticed, I frequently noticed that would happen when
I was taking a walk. You know, when the mind was kind of just drifting and
wandering and and it would drift into that particular situation and that person
I was really angry with and it would start thinking about it and it would get
angry. So I was no longer paying attention to the walking. I was just lost
in the thoughts of the anger. And I began to recognize that pattern. And so
when I noticed it, every time I noticed it, I would recognize, yep, there you are.
I see you. Well, you can take a walk with me, but I'm going to put my attention on
my feet. And so there was a redirecting. I didn't just go back to the general kind
of like, oh yeah, I'm just going to be walking and letting my mind go wherever
it wants to go. I let the attention go into my feet. And that actually ended up
being a very powerful practice for me. The kind of just the letting go of it,
turning to something else, that not now practice. That is a lot of how I worked
with the anger in daily life. It was a huge, a huge learning about how I don't
have to kind of direct my attention, kind of dive into it and figure it out.
Sometimes the pattern and habit will begin to weaken with that simple, I see
you and you can like be there, but I'm going to put my attention on something
else. So we don't have to dive into it. That was a real learning for me.
So I had this strong tendency to kind of aim and focus and want to
figure something out, get stuck to something, to pull it apart and figure it
out, you know, to get rid of it basically. I have that strong tendency and what I
found when I tried to do that with mindfulness with the anger was that the
mindfulness quickly got lost and the stickiness of the anger had the
ascendancy and I was not capable of maintaining the mindfulness in that
state. And so the not now, letting it go, turning my attention to something else.
And what I discovered with that process was that to my surprise actually, I, that
the pattern got weaker and weaker and weaker and it kind of like it began to
again have more space between the incidents of the anger arising. So this
might be something that happens with a strong habit or pattern that when you
start paying attention to it, it's like it's everywhere. You see it all the time
and in big ways and in small ways and at other time and then you might start to
recognize that it gets a little bit less frequent. And this is what happened with
the anger. It was happening really regularly, you know, every day, every
couple days and then maybe every week and then maybe every few weeks over the
course of a couple of years. This was, you know, this wasn't a, you know, a couple
month project. It was a couple years. But over the course of that time, I began
seeing, first of all, that there was more capacity to recognize it sooner in the
process. I didn't get into those rages anymore. So that the kind of, the
mindfulness began to attune to that experience. And so it caught it much
earlier in the process. It was much easier to set aside and get on with my
day. And then at some point, you know, kind of diminished and weakened gradually
over time. And at some point, my awareness kind of recognized, wow, that hasn't
happened in a long time. I became aware that it wasn't there. I became aware that
the anger wasn't there and that I hadn't seen it in a very long time. And in that
moment, you know, I kind of was thinking about the person I was really angry with
because I was aware that I hadn't been angry with that, had that experience in
a long time. I was aware of the person in my mind. And the mind did not pick up
thoughts about that person, about why I was angry. I could not even, like,
construct. There was no, there was nothing in me that even wanted to go there. It was
gone. It was just gone. That was amazing to me. You know, I had had, I'd had, you
know, several really kind of mind blowing insights around the anger over the
course of that couple years, one of which was a kind of a seeing it begin, you know,
seeing, and this all in daily life, you know, not in the sitting practice, but all
in daily life, you know, in my kitchen, cutting an apple, seeing a thought arise
about the person that I was mad at, seeing how the congealing of thoughts
around that thought was leading me in the direction of anger and the mind
recognizing, yeah, that's gonna hurt and letting it go. So in an instant feeling or
seeing the mind not go there. And then, you know, seeing that was, you know, that
was a really interesting understanding, but also seeing that that didn't, like,
make the anger vanish. There was another couple years of it make the anger go away
long term, I should say. There's another couple years of exploring and working
with and and meeting it. So this is a long process. I hope that's not discouraging,
because, you know, what I would say is in that process for me, you know, very
quickly within the first couple of months of this, even couple of weeks of
looking at this, picking this pattern and exploring it, I understood the benefits
of doing this. There was a great deal of ease and relief around the habit.
Just the simple, oh, now I can go back to work and set it aside. That was a huge
relief to not have to stay stuck in those thoughts. And so there was, there's
this saying that the Dharma is good in the beginning, in the middle, in the end. And
at the beginning, yes, it was good because it really helped me to not be so
stuck. And it kept coming. And in the middle, it was good because I could see
it much earlier in the process and and and have a way to navigate my life and
not be not be pulled into those thoughts. And then in the end, really good in
that it's like, wow, that's not here anymore. It's gone. That pattern of anger
with that person, that's gone. Really gone. So the the process of it, you know,
taking a long time for a pattern to really unwind, what I would say is that,
if you, if you commit to this, if you explore this, picking something that, you
know, you're interested in exploring and understanding and stick with it, you will
notice benefits. And that will add some energy and some confidence and some
engagement that keeps you get being interested in exploring that habit and
pattern. All of what I'm talking about here can happen in the midst of daily
life. But the key instructions about that are what I pointed to earlier. Just
recognize the pattern when it arises. Notice the basic sense of the experience.
How am I with it? And the capacity for that also develops in daily life as we
practice with it. The ability to recognize, oh yeah, this is what it's
like to feel that. And then recognizing, you know, do you have the capacity to be
with it or is it, is it time to kind of set it aside to kind of move to
something else, to put your attention on something else. And knowing when it's
time in daily life to recognize it, kind of honor it, say, yep, I see you. Yep,
there you are. And then get on with your day. So that you don't have to, like, think
somehow that it has to disappear or go away in order for you to get on with
your day. Just that simple recognition, yep, here it is. And take a
breath and I'll get on with my day.
With a less intense pattern from myself, I'll talk a little bit about how less
intense pattern unfolded impatience for me was a pretty strong habit of mind.
And I knew that I was impatient in big areas. You know, I think one of the first
times I really felt it with mindfulness was at the end of a three-month course.
At the, you know, the last couple weeks before the end of a three-month course,
there was such impatience for that three-month course to be done with. It was
so painful. It was so unpleasant. It was like, well, this is a big thing I've done.
I want to see what I'm like on the other side of it. I don't want to go
through this transition, you know. So there was this real kind of big
impatience. And I, it was familiar. I knew impatience a lot. I recognized that
even from childhood, you know, that kind of impatience of big things like the
start of school or the ending of school, you know, just like not wanting to be
here because I want to be on the other side of this. And it often for me had to
do with transitions, you know, something about a transition going from one place
to another, one thing finishing, one thing beginning. There was an impatience
around that. So I kind of knew that side of things. And so at a certain point in
my practice, fairly, you know, maybe five or eight years into my practice, I really
got curious about this pattern. So I had more skill with the mindfulness and
began to just, you know, begin to be curious about it. And what happened with
that pattern was that I noticed first the really obvious ways that I was
impatient, you know, things around bigger transitions. But then as I started to look,
it's like, oh my gosh, this is like shot through everything that I do. Little
flares of impatience. While I'm brushing my teeth, I'm impatient to have this
finish so that I can get on with the next thing that I'm doing. While I'm
showering, I'm impatient to finish it. Before I get in the shower, I'm impatient
to get in this. It's like everywhere. When I open a drawer and it sticks a
little bit, impatience flaring there. It was like everywhere. It was humbling, but
it was also fascinating to see how this pattern that I thought of is connected
with big things, big transitions, was also connected with a lot of little
transitions. You know, the transition about brushing my teeth, you know, there's
like, I have to do this now, but what I want to do is get on to the next thing,
you know, that kind of a sense of transition. And so I began to be really
curious about it. And I pointed to something I saw earlier, which was when
I got impatient, I noticed that my actions got kind of jagged. And so at one
point I was in the drugstore shopping and I noticed the impatience
arise there, looking for things and trying to find things and wanting to get
done with this. And I had better things to do than be at the store shopping. All
of those thoughts were there. So, you know, that's kind of how I
began to recognize the impatience partly through some of the thoughts
that were there. I pointed to that in the guided meditation too. It's like, I got
better things to do with it than this. Okay, well, I do have to get these things.
I mean, this is a part of my day. And so I noticed that what was going on
there was that I was like picking things up off the shelf and throwing them in
my basket. So it was expressing itself. The impatience was expressing
itself physically. So I noticed that with mindfulness. And there was a little bit
of capacity to continue with the action that I was doing, which was shopping. I
didn't have to like stop and stand in the middle of the store and close my eyes
and think, okay, impatience, what does this feel like? I was continuing to do my
shopping. And I was noticing how it was affecting. You know, how's this impatience
affecting me? I'm throwing things into my basket. So it was leaking out into my
behavior. And so I decided to explore the possibility of smoothing out my actions,
even as I knew the impatience. So not repressing the impatience, but kind of
seeing. And the way that I express this in a general instruction is, can you see
if an emotion or a feeling is leaking out into your behavior, either your
physical actions and expression on your face, something that you're saying, is it
leaking out into your behavior in some fashion? And can you not repress the
feeling, but not act on that feeling? So with the impatience, the way that kind of
played out is, I felt, wow, this feeling of, I want to get done with this, but I
slowed down my movements. I consciously would pick things up and place them in
the basket instead of throwing them in the basket. So that just slowed my body
down a little bit. It wasn't even a lot. And there was this interest in exploring
how can I be with this feeling without it leaking out into my behavior. And while
I did that, you know, it felt like magic in some way, but I
know it's mindfulness. I mean, mindfulness feels like magic sometimes.
Within about a minute of that exploration, of slowing down the body, but
being curious about the impatience, the impatience just let go. And I was just
still in the store doing my shopping, and there was just an ease of, oh, this is
what I'm doing. The impatience was extra. So this is another kind of way in
which to explore our emotions, habits, patterns when they arise, looking at how
they might be leaking out into our behavior. You know, brushing my teeth.
Am I like really scrubbing my teeth? It's like, you know, maybe I can just do this
gently. So how is it affecting you? How is that mind state affecting you? And
curiosity about that. And not having to hold on to the mindfulness. So those are
kind of broad suggestions with a few examples from my own practice of how
they worked. And I'm curious if there's any questions or comments or reflections
on what I've offered. Anthony. Andrea, I have a question between the first
stage, so to speak, and then the one you said that could take, you know, takes a
longer process to not let those thoughts of that person hinder you or kind of get
you caught in that whirlwind, so to speak. They both seem very kind of like a
powerful tool. It's that first stage. Kind of, I got a sense of that you're
aware of it, and it, by being aware of it, it diminishes, you know. Well, being
aware of it, and potentially, like that very beginning piece was, this is
happening. Wow, that's painful. So it was just that basic, like, yeah, this is
happening, and it hurts. So that acknowledgement. And then, turning my
attention to something else that I could attend to. So in my case, there was
enough capacity at that point to, like, the mindfulness had broken into the
pattern, that rage, and given me enough space that I could say, wow, I don't know
what to do with that, but what I can do is go back to work right now. And in the
moments before, I was not able to go back to work because I was just consumed, and
so the mindfulness gave me the space to do that. So it's not just that, it's not
just the mindfulness, there is a little bit of the, you know, kind of choosing to
turn the attention to something that you can stay with. That, that's at the, that's
at the beginning with those real whirlwind kind of patterns. Anything you
want to follow on about that? Yeah, well, the third one, so like you said, later
into the more of, like, once it's well developed, I think you mentioned that the
thought would cross your mind, and you wouldn't even, it wouldn't even bother you
so to speak. You wouldn't even put time, how do you, what I'm saying, kind of, you
wouldn't. Yeah, later, well, later on, I did notice, so that, like with the anger,
there's, so there's different ways it unfolds, so I'm trying to describe, you
know, whole variety of ways that this can happen. With something strong, like the
anger for me was very, very sticky, so if I tried to be mindful of it, then the
stickiness got overwhelming, in a way, and, and then I wasn't able to stay
mindful, so I quickly, I learned that at a particular time in my practice, for that
particular pattern, I could see, I'd notice, yep, there it is, and I'm just
going to turn my attention and take a walk. It was not at all hard to do that,
to disengage from it, because there had been enough capacity to, to turn the
attention to something simple, like putting my attention on my feet, so that
capacity had strengthened. The other place in the middle that can happen is
like what happened for me with impatience, where there was more capacity to
be with the experience while I was engaging, so while I was in the store
shopping, I didn't have to redirect my attention and say, I'm not going to pay
attention to that impatience, it's too sticky, I was able to, wow, there's that
impatience in that feeling of, wow, I just want to get out of here, and kind of
slow my, my, my movement down, so there's two different kind of places in the
middle that, depending on how sticky the pattern is, that you might be working,
you know, if you can be with it while you're engaging in what you're doing,
that's great, I mean, you know, it's, it's, there's a lot of learning that can
happen there, and sometimes if we try to do that, we just find ourselves lost in
the pattern, you know, lost in the anger again, and that's what I discovered over
and over again when I tried being mindful of the anger as I was doing things, was
that I would just get stuck in it again, and so I did this redirecting of the
attention, and it was, it got easier and easier, as I said, it got easier to say,
yep, there you are, you're my old friend, and I'll be back, you know, I'll pay
attention to you when my mindfulness is stronger, I kind of made a bargain with it
in a way, and I never had to, because it disappeared when I wasn't looking.
Impatience, you know, impatience maybe is like the deeper undercurrents of where
anger springs from, I don't know, you know, I think it's, it's kind of a similar
flavor or pattern of not liking what's here, in that form of impatience, I
definitely had the form of impatience, it's like, I want to get done with this
because I don't want to be doing this now, you know, that was my flavor of
impatience, some people have impatience of like, I want to, I want to get to that
thing, because that's going to be so great, you know, so that's the green
flavor of impatience, my flavor of impatience was more the aversion flavor
of impatience, and so, you know, at this, that the impatience quality is much
deeper, and is more kind of, you know, I don't get that kind of anger so much
anymore, it's been a long time since I felt anger like that, really long time,
but the subtler flavors of it, you know, they bubble, they kind of hang out, and
so there's a lot of capacity now to be with, with different flavors of that,
that kind of aversion, and you know, there's going to be a long process of
exploring these things, and I just find it interesting, and the other piece to
recognize too, is at a certain point when we recognize a pattern, like impatience
for instance, you know, when I notice a pattern these days, it's like, oh, there
it is, I don't have to be caught by it, you know, so there's some joy, there's
some delight there, that is with the pattern, you know, with the being with,
the with, with the awareness of it, and that really supports and nourishes the,
the process too, so it's not all about the suffering, you know, it's not all
about trying to get rid of the pattern, it's also kind of about cultivating that
quality of mindfulness, and the delight of understanding what's going on in our
minds. Thank you, Andrea. I understand now a lot better. Thank you, Anthony.
Thank you. Tom, you're muted still, Tom. Okay, hi Andrea. I follow you regularly on
audioderma, I normally can't be here. I was here this morning for the meditation,
and in the middle of the meditation, my wife came in and said that her best
friend had just received, has just gone into hospice, she's been, we've known
that she's had cancer for some time, and she's also a dear friend of mine, and so
it's said to apply grief to the, you know, anger and impatience, grief is another
issue that will come along, it will be very strong for her especially, and also
for me, and then over time it will presumably gradually soften, but it's a
different kind of feeling than anger and impatience, but I, I can apply it, I can
apply everything you've said, as well as your nirvana teaching of last
week, don't continue to throw logs on the fire. So, you know, we'll all face grief
one kind or another, and I thought maybe you could comment briefly on that. Thank
you. Yeah, grief is a powerful emotion, and you know, it's connected, it's deeply
connected to love often, right? I mean, it's, it's connected to how we care for
ourselves in each other's, and the situation we find ourselves in, the
vulnerable situation we find ourselves in, and so the, the, the curiosity around
grief, working with it in very similar ways to what I described with, I mean, the
basic tools that I've talked about, can you just know, how am I with grief? You
know, what is the feeling there, the broad feeling, the diffuse feeling? Grief is a
pretty diffuse feeling often, it comes with some constrictions and
contractions often, you know, a throat or, you know, wetness or tears in the eyes,
so there's some specific feelings, but there's, what grief really is, is that
broader feeling, and so, you know, connecting with that and the kind of
waviness of it, the, the, the shift the changing nature of it, and then often with
grief too, there's some resistance to that truth of vulnerability, you know, so
there's a piece of it that's like holding on, no, this is not right, we should
not be vulnerable, this should not be happening, so there's a piece of that
that's happening, that's where a lot of the pain with grief comes from, I think,
is the resistance to the, the nature of experience, the nature of life, and so
noticing that part, what I've seen around grief is that there's, there's kind of
that part that's resisting the truth, resisting that this is what's happening,
you know, it's our mind denying reality basically, it shouldn't be like this, and
so that's a piece of the grief, but the other piece of the grief is just the
feeling of connectedness and care and sadness and sorrow about somebody's
suffering, about the loss that we're going to experience, that's connected with
the meta-qualities of our heart, and so that, that experience in my, in my
exploration around grief, and I use the word sadness for those feelings, you know,
the feeling of loss, the feeling of care, of connection, of, you know, that just
that, that, that heart that understands the truth and the connection and that this
is the way it is, it doesn't feel like all joy and light there, it, it, there's,
the heart feels the pain, feels the, the ache of that, but it doesn't feel it in
a constricted way, it feels it, the way it feels to me is it's just pouring
through, it's not like sticking anywhere and tearing at the heart, it's just pouring
through, and that to me is more the, the wholesome side of that whole pattern, and
so, you know, the, the opening to the grief in the whole will begin to show you
the places where there's the stickiness, the tightness, the resistance that
shouldn't be like this, and where there's the heart that is, you know, touched by
that vulnerability and able to be soft with that vulnerability and how that
feels.
