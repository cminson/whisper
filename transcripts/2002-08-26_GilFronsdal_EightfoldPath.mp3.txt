 My first Zen teacher, simplistically somewhat, said that Buddhism is about sitting, sitting in meditation. And Gandhi's contribution to Buddhism is that it matters where you sit, and the implication being that for political action, for social justice, for all kinds of things, that it depends where you sit. You know, if you sit certain places, maybe it doesn't have any impact, but if you sit on the train tracks or if you sit in different locations, you know, like people did in Lawrence Livermore Labs, it has a very different impact. So where you sit is important. So the San Francisco Zen Center, where I practiced in my early years, was in the kind of the lower Haight area, Haight-Pilmore area in San Francisco. And it was a fairly dangerous neighborhood to live in. There were housing projects nearby, a lot of drug dealing and prostitution, a lot of shooting and stabbing and mugging and cars being broken into and fires. It was an exciting neighborhood to be in. And that's where we sat. We had this meditation hall that was on the corner of the building, and one corner of the building was the alley, where you didn't want to go and it was dark, and then Laguna Street on the other side. And it was quite something to sit in that zen door, because in some of the hot days, especially the windows were open, or even if the windows were closed, you could hear what was going on on the other side of the wall, on the alley. And you know, we'd hear people being mugged, or we'd hear car, glass, glass being broken, and we'd hear the fire trucks would come up, or the police would have their action. And in many of the situations, the practice was to sit in the middle of it. It was very important. The idea was you sat where, not where the action was, but you sat in the midst of the world. You didn't remove yourself off in some quiet, isolated place, if you're on private meditation, like your meditation practice existed in the middle of life as it really is, and there it was. We didn't just sit there peacefully when people were being mugged. Though if someone was, you know, what's the expression, if the prostitute was doing her trick inside of the wall, then we just sat. But the, so if someone was calling for help, it was obvious someone was in distress, then it was quite impressive to see all these Zen students sitting quietly in meditation, just the first instant that they were clear that someone needed help, they would leap off their cushions in Zen style and bash out the doors, and to see if they could help. And I remember once, I was a Zen priest there, a shaved head, and wore black robes, and there was one of these incidences, and everybody's running out, and there were, I don't know, 20, 30 people running down Page Street, because the woman had her purse stolen, and the mugger went that way. She was there kind of yelling for help, and so he went down there, so 20, 30 people went down, and for some reason I was kind of in the back of the crowd, and I figured, you know, there was too many people running, you know, it didn't really make sense for me to run also, so I stayed behind with one or two other people, and kind of started walking down the street slowly, and it kind of just happened, just kind of go up against this kind of area where the Zen hospice is, and this guy jumps out of the bushes, and he goes up against the wall and says something like, holding the purse, and said something like, you know, he was obviously very afraid of me, because I'm not, I don't think of myself as an intimidating person, but he, for all he could, you know, with shaved head and black robes, I looked like Kung Fu. So I had him cornered, and so he started walking kind of like this, kind of along the side of the garage, side of the building, and there was a small, and a small crowd of us, you know, had a half circle around him, until he came to the corner of the building, and then of course there was no half circle anymore, right, there was a part of the circle was missing, so he dashed off, leaving the purse behind. So anyway, so the ringing reminded me of all that, and in some ways I like this neighborhood a lot, because it's a neighborhood where there's a certain amount of action and activity, and you really feel like you're part of an urban environment, and the spiritual practice happens in the midst of it, and I would imagine some of you would think, well it would be better if we could be off someplace very quiet and serene, and in some places it was obviously meditative, as if some place serene was more meditative, but I like it, I think it's appropriate, I think it's healthy for us to kind of be in the midst of the city as it is, and those of you who have come here Thursday and Friday morning know that there's a, it's great, also very exciting here, it should come sometime if you haven't, if you don't mind being disturbed, Thursday and Friday mornings between about nine and eleven or so, there's anti-abortion protests on the street here, because of Planned Parenthood across the street, and I've been perplexed about how to respond to the anti-abortion protests, and I feel like I'm still kind of considering it, but I feel like one of the things we bring to this conflict between Planned Parenthood and the anti-abortion protesters is, and I don't know if they notice, but we kind of bring our presence, like we're here, this is where we are, I feel like we're in the middle of them, and we sit kind of in a meditative way, and in meditation in a way you don't take sides, what you do is you bring presence, with some trust that presence will make a big difference in the situation. When, again, when I was at San Francisco's Zen Center, there were all these, the Zen Center was very much involved in local neighborhood, helping people, and there were these landlords of apartment buildings that were taking advantage of their tenants, had very shoddy kind of dangerous buildings, and so Zen Center was helping these tenants in various ways, but Zen Center very clearly didn't want to do anything that was political, that was actually an opposition or alienated the landlords, because it felt as a Zen temple, as a meditation center, it should be a place where anybody felt welcome to come into the doors to meditate, and if they got involved in the politics, then the landlords wouldn't want to come, and they probably needed more than anybody in the neighborhood. So we sit here with our doors open and meditate. And then so, oh, somebody, this leads up to the announcement, my announcement from that is that September 11th we're going to have our meeting here, Wednesday evening, and that'll be 7.30 to 7.30, and it's a sitting and a reflection on September 11th. I'm not sure what we do, as I wasn't sure what we would do last year when we had our meetings right after September 11th. I still don't know what we'll do when we gather on September 11th, but it felt to me like for some of us it would be very important and poignant to at least sit together that evening and then have some way of reflecting on that event or ourselves in the midst of it all. So if you'd like to come, that's September 11th. So what's been on my mind to talk about for about a week or so is the Buddhist eighth fall path. Partly I was thinking about it because I finished this retreat, we could go Sunday, and during the retreat there were a lot of people who were relatively new to meditation, and some of them, for example, very interesting, they go into the retreat kind of very challenged and wondering why they're there, and somewhere near that halfway point in the retreat they started asking questions like, this is really great, but how can I apply it in my daily life? How can I make this relevant in my life? How can I bring presence, mindfulness, compassion, this level of kind of presence to the rest of my life where life is so busy and we get entangled so easily. So the end of the retreat, the three teachers teaching, and we gave a little teaching on the eighth fall path. Buddhism, as many of you probably know, a number of Asian cultures emphasize the importance of a path. In Japan you have the way, the thing called the Dao, a do, which is the way, like a ki do, or ju do, cha do, the way of tea, and a do is a, and it comes from the Chinese, a Dao, a path or a way that you enter into, and it's not just an ism, but it's a way of life, it's something you engage and put your whole body into. Excuse me if I go on and off on another tangent. There's also the way of archery, and Koben Chino, the local then teacher who died a few weeks ago, I had studied the way of archery, and he once went to Esalen to do a demonstration of this way, and he got himself dressed in the Zen archery robes and had his bow and arrow and was, you know, there was a big crowd of people watching and he was there in the big lawn in Esalen, if some of you have been there, you know, it's a big lawn kind of overlooking the cliffs of the Pacific, and he entered into kind of this meditative process of preparing his arrow and his bow and getting himself psyched and ready, it was a whole like ritual. I imagine people watching it kind of almost got concentrated just watching this process of this guy very meticulously and very centering himself and getting ready, and you know, it wasn't just a matter of putting the arrow in the bow and shooting it, it was like maybe a half an hour process or maybe more. And finally, you know, he put the arrow in the bow very meditative, very carefully and with great concentration, great stillness, got ready to, you know, to fire that bow and aim really carefully and just was there, just waited just for the right moment. I imagine people were breathless, you know, just, you know, they're present. And finally, to the right moment, he let go of the arrow and it went right directly into the bullseye that he was aiming at, which was the Pacific Ocean. So in India, they have the idea of a way Buddhism is the Pali word is Maga, Sanskrit is Marga. And in India, there was many ways when he any paths. And it's useful to think of that when you think of word because you think of the word Buddhism as being an ism, a belief system, philosophy, perhaps, and it's better, better think of it as a way of life. It's a way of living. It's a way that you enter into. It's a path. And many people will sit, you know, at the edge of the of the path, watching it, looking at looking down the roads and lots of leads, a great place. And and then they read another map and say, well, it really does meet through a great place. This is inspiring. And then they go by another map. And this is really great. This path goes a really beautiful place. And then they buy another map. And some people have, you know, lots and lots of these maps in the bookcases, but they never actually put their feet onto the path. And and I think of a path is something that we enter into with our ideally, if we follow it for the full way with our whole life. And it's something we walk along. So walking implies we bring our body along. There's a commitment involved. There's a there's a kind of, you know, nothing you kind of bring everything you have to the path, whatever the path is that you choose to follow. And you bring your heart, your heartfeltness and you bring your emotional life, you bring your certainly your intelligence and your mind, you bring your body, you bring your, in a sense, you bring your community in the sense that you include your relationship to other people as part of the path. And the path, the image I have of a path is a path is a clearing in a forest. And a forest is kind of maybe way overgrown. And if you had to go through a forest and there's no path, you'd have to spend a long time finding your way. And you've been a long time clearing the way you have to bring machete, perhaps and cutting away the branches and stuff. So you can make your way through. And but if there's a path there for you, then it's made a lot easier. And you can just you can follow that clearing and opening in the forest and make your way to your destination a lot easier. So the Buddha discovered a path. And it's one of these paths to the forest that with, you know, it makes it a lot easier to follow your way. Some people feel that they want to make their own way, their own path, which is a beautiful concept, I'm going to follow my own way. However, the danger of that or the shortcoming of that sometimes is that it's like reinventing the wheel, you have to kind of then find your own way through the forest. And it might take a long way, long time for you to do what could have been a lot faster if you went on an established path. So the Buddha offered the eighth full path, what kind of what it's called. And I think of it sometimes as the eighth full, the Buddha's eight step program. And the first thing that you have to admit when you're into the visit, yes, in fact, you're attached. And, and then you can be and and then you can begin. And in the Buddhist analysis of human mind or human human tendencies, we're all addicts. And so we all kind of need something like attachment anonymous, which is what we offer here. And so he offered these eight different steps or links or aspects of the path. And my understanding of it is it offers an integrated whole. So we don't think of it just something intellectual. We don't think of it just something of the mind. We don't think of it just something of ethics only or only about or we don't think it only about meditation. Some people choose meditation as being what they focus on only. Sometimes people ethics, where some people understanding. But all those three have to be there together. And that's what the description of the eight full path is a tie those include all those three aspects together as a whole. And so as you listen to these eight different steps, you might reflect on your life and what are the different elements of your life that you could that this speaks to that could be brought more fully into a path into your path of liberation of meditation practice and whatever you do here. The first part of the eighth full path is right view and view or is a little bit different than philosophy or belief view is like a perspective the right perspective for understanding the life the spiritual life that you want to live. So what's the first what is a useful perspective. There are many perspectives sometimes another word is a framework. What's a useful framework for understanding our life that makes things easier. And the framework that the Buddha offered was the eighth the four noble truths. And in fact the right view is knowing really well the four noble truths. A child can understand the four noble truths but it takes it says someone who's fully enlightened to really realize them fully to understand their full depth. The and so the eighth full path is actually embedded in the four four noble truths. So the four noble truths are the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering the truth of the cessation of suffering and the truth of the eighth full path truth here. I don't take to mean like a philosophical creed but again it's a it's a it's a helpful perspective for looking at our life. The analogy I've often used is if you go to a doctor and you have something really terrible that ails you you really worry about it and it seems like it's a pretty dire situation and you need help and the doctor you know asks you you know about your golf score and you don't play golf and you say well what sport do you play and you say well I go bowling and they say well oh you know what size bowling shoes do you wear and how heavy a ball do you do you use and what's your been your how's your latest game span and you know you only have 15 minutes there at Kaiser to get in and out because they have you know because that's what it's the rule is and so so you know it's you know she's asking doctors asking you and asking you asking about all these things and after a while you kind of butt in after 14 and a half seconds and say you know those questions don't interest me what interests me is the fact that I have something wrong with me and I want you to know what's wrong so you can help me so the the four noble truths are kind of that perspective on our lives you don't want to spend a lot of time looking at things which are not important and not useful you don't want to spend a lot of time looking at you know Buddhist philosophy and get a PhD in Buddhism for example the um but um you want you want to look you know you'll make it as simple and straightforward as possible and the Buddha suggestion is you start where the suffering is and you address it you are very honest about it not to be morbid or dire or heavy about about it but in fact to study it to learn from it and learn how to become lighter learn how to let go of the attachments the holding the fears the resistance they get in the way of the heart shining getting away of the heart being free so the so to to be sensitive to our suffering to be interested in it to not deny it or push it away or ignore it or or hide it but actually be willing to sit in the middle of it just like we sit in the middle of our neighborhood so we sit in the middle of our life as it actually is is the second noble truth is that there's a cause to our suffering and then there's an analysis of looking at what is that cause and looking at the cause um learning how we can release that cause let go of that cause and be free of it so use the medical analogy the first noble truth is the illness the second noble truth is the diagnosis the cause of the illness the third noble truth is the prognosis or the possibility of a cure and the fourth noble truth is the prescription so we become our own doctors in a sense the right view suggests we become our own doctors suffering the cause of suffering and our attachments happiness and the conditions for happiness to arise another way of saying the four noble truths so the first part of the eight full step is to study learn understand really well the four noble truths so becomes a readily available perspective for understanding what's happening in the present moment for us so we can get right to the heart of things and when i first got introduced to buddhism i i thought that the four noble truths were child's play remember an old girlfriend i went over to see her for dinner and she asked me you know what what is what does buddhism you're involved in what's what does it really teach and i explained to her well teaches about the eight the four noble truths and i left that dinner party you know this is a woman i wanted to impress and i left the dinner part of the dinner and uh oh how could i've been you know i've been involved with buddhism for some years now and how could i've said something so simplistic you know the four noble truths you know buddhism is great world religion has must have much greater things to say than this is a simple thing but um i've gotten to appreciate this more and more with time and what happens i went with place where it becomes particularly useful the four noble truths as a perspective as a framework of our experience is um when the meditation gets very subtle when meditation gets very very deep and very concentrated um and the mind actually gets filled with bliss and happiness and well-being and very still and great peace that that's sometimes actually one of the most important times to really to look at the experience through the perspective of the four noble truths it's a time when we often are blinded by the rapture that might be there for example of the great peace or the great equanimity and there might still be some very very subtle attachment playing itself out and if you've trained yourself to study your experience from the perspective of the four noble truths then you want to be you're always looking a little bit where is that little bit of straining or resistance or pushing or holding onto something a little bit of self-identity that is tied up with this experience so to continue to purify and refine that so the so the heart becomes freer and freer the second of the eighth full path is right usually translated as the right intention sometimes it's right thought i think of it as right alignment so the four noble truth involves perspective for studying our lives the right intention involves the motivation that we want to live our life by and motivation is very very important what is the underlying the fundamental intention that you want your life to be about when you get to the end of your life and your deathbed and what do you want to remember when you look back you want to remember the fact that i finally got my oil changed you want to i say that because i was struggling the last three weeks you know when am i going to get my oil changed and i finally got a change this last week is that what you want your life to be about and you know all kinds of things we can get caught up in in our daily life but is that really what we want our orientation of our life to be about and so to spend some time reflecting on our intention and if what we're doing is entering the buddhist path what is the intention that can align ourselves with that path and the buddha gave three primary definitions of this intention and embarrassingly enough i only remember tonight too but one of them is the intention to love attention to metta loving kindness the intention to love to bring kindness or friendliness to our world is one of the primary expressions of this right intention it's not easy to love and different people have different abilities to do it and different dispositions dispositions towards it but to cultivate love and to you know to develop it is one of the intentions the other intention is the intention to let go to simplify life and to let go of things to learn how to let go and it certainly can mean classically to let go of things but the things aren't the problem the problem is the way we relate to things and so the training and letting go is the training till the intentional that goes intention not to cling to things and hold on to things letting go of that clinging that holding so which can be hard to do at times i don't know if it makes sense to tell you a story from today but let go so so so i think of the second step of the eighth full path having to do with intention being to take seriously your intention your our intentions are some of the most beautiful parts of our lives and some of the most consequential aspects of our lives in many ways buddhism is a religion of intention intention is so important in buddhism that getting to know our intention and studying some that many people go through their lives never really looking seriously at their intentions or the deepest intention of their heart buddhism suggests you spend time serious time reflecting deep down into your heart and what is the intention that you want to live your life with so that's the first two the next three parts of the eighth full path all have to do with ethics and ethics have to do has a lot to do with how you live your life in relationship to other people and i love this because the spiritual life is not meant to be done in isolation it's not only something self-centered and self-serving but it's something we do in our in the field of our connectedness to other people so the first uh this is the third step of the eighth full path is um write uh speech being careful with our speech speech is very consequential um as it sometimes said you can spend years cultivating a really good friend and you can ruin that friendship in just one sentence that's how powerful speech is but more deeply for me our speech is a doorway into our intentions if you pay attention for a while to why you say certain things that you say you probably opened up to a whole world of what is it makes you tick what are your values you have what is your assumptions about your relationship to other people the things that you want out of life and expect out of life are often expressed through how we speak and so to cultivate mindfulness and follow the path is to turn the attention around to really study how we speak and to cultivate right speech cultivate speech which is helpful not only for others but also for yourself if you want to follow a path it turns out that being careful with your speech is one of the ways of making progress on that path it's that important and some people you know choose their clothes more carefully than they choose they're what they say so you know a lot of people we wouldn't do too much harm to pay a little bit more attention to their speech to speak kindly to speak in a way that speaks the truth to speak in a way that uh helps oh there's i read this last last week in a in a suta to speak in such a way that it's a is conducive to the concentration for others that's conducive to concentration that's conducive to meditative absorptions conducive to meditative uh you know entering into a meditative state it's beautiful the next part of the eighth full path is right action and right action is just the right behavior that's usually defined by the five precepts so it's to avoid things like killing stealing lying sexual misconduct and intoxicating the mind and as i say often the buddhist path is a path of developing sensitivity becoming more sensitive becoming letting ourselves become much more sensitive instrument that we can tune in to the world around us and to ourselves and what's really going on the best of our ability and to do unethical things is to do things in an insensitive manner the assumption being that uh in order to hurt someone intentionally there has to be some insensitivity to that person as a human being and so to develop sensitivity if you're trying to develop sensitivity and do insensitive things they just don't they don't work together one of the things that helps in developing the path then is cultivating right action action which defined is not breaking the precepts i found in my own life that uh my action also see speech and action are much more gross than the activity of the mind and meditation in a sense mindfulness works in a sense with the mind and it's kind of like the advanced practice and it's a lot easier to begin with a coarser activity and so speech and action are coarser than activities of the mind so learning to pay attention there and cultivate mindfulness and develop mindfulness in these areas creates a foundation helpful foundation for then developing mindfulness for the more subtle aspects of our life the next uh um part of the eighth full path is right livelihood so recap what we've done so far there's right view right intention right speech right action and now it's right livelihood and right livelihood is just how where you get your livelihood from what supports your life it doesn't necessarily necessarily mean what you do for work and make money but you know what where your livelihood the buddha you know i was a little bit surprised when i saw this when i was introduced to buddhism that's you know that had any bearing at all on the path but this is such an important element of our life we spent so many hours of our lives many hours of the day majority of our time for many of us engaged in livelihood and so is our livelihood conducive and supportive and harm in harmony with a spiritual path if it's not then you know it's not going to you know if it's not in harmony then it's going to be hard to make any progress along that path like if now almost mythical story that i've told i tell so often of the lawyer who came and said i'm you know i'm interested in i'm very interested in practicing meditation and been following the buddhist path and but in my law firm i'm expected to lie and now how can i do both and the way he asked it was he was really expecting us to tell him and we had to tell him you know the unfortunate news that you can't do both that the two just don't jive so the buddha then listed so i take this right livelihood to be another opportunity to look at our intentions and to look at how our actions affect the world around us is how you know we spend the majority of our working time is it a way that is in harmony with not causing harm in the world maybe creating benefit to the world around us then um we have sitting here in the hall today three of my son's preschool teachers who are my heroes and i feel like they're the um like it's like probably the greatest definition of right livelihood it's like one of the most greatest things around and and they had my son's graduation today and i just you know i didn't express it so well but i just kind of i was like really moved i mean it's just like these people you trust your two-year-old to write and they take take this two-year-old in and they make this two-year-old kind of person and and then today one of them joked that there was a money-back guarantee so we'll see but uh so right livelihood and then um so these first five then become the foundation for the last three and um and i think of it as a pyramid or a triangle with um the first five being the base of the pyramid and now we're getting up to the top of the pyramid and they create the strong stable foundation if you turn the pyramid upside down so it's standing on its head it's going to be quite wobbly turns out that the last uh pinnacle of the very top of the pin over the pyramid is meditation concentration and mindfulness and many people enter the buddhist path through meditation practice and sooner or later you'll learn that that's a very wobbly place to begin unless you kind of spread spread out the foundation and that's what the first five elements are about so um the last three are right right effort right mindfulness and right concentration right effort means very simply means being willing to make the effort be interested in making the effort not just being personally reads the menu in the restaurant but actually tastes the food not somebody just reads maps but actually sets themselves on the path but it also means the definition of right effort is to start uh the classic definition involves beginning to pay attention to the quality of your mind what's the quality of your mind like is a quality of the mind helpful wholesome skillful or is the quality of your mind and your actions unhelpful unhelpful un skillful so this is much more subtle now than simply paying attention to your right action or right speech but it's looking behind those things at the quality of the mind that does it the quality of the heart and being interested and then beginning to align that heart to that mind with those that quality of mind that aspect of the mind that direction of the mind that is skillful and helpful for a spiritual life so you know you can watch your thoughts you can watch your intentions you can watch your feelings that arise and you can look at them and say what is this really helpful or not and we don't want to deny or repress anything in an unhealthy ways which really a lot of us know about but often it can be very easy to let go of a certain train of thought a certain motivation a certain quality of mind that's not helpful and try to you know pick up one that's helpful or if you have one that's helpful to support it and nourish it and appreciate it sometimes it can be easy and sometimes it's very hard to do this and so then we have a meditation practice of mindfulness practice we have the eighth full path the whole package to help us along the way it's a gradual path and then you're not expected to do it automatically just fresh off you know your first step on the path but as you walk along the path slowly slowly you'll find your way one of the steps one of the things you'll start learning is how to pay attention to the quality of your mind then there's a right concentration and right mindfulness and this involves the meditation practice and this is you know the pinnacle of the pyramid and the most subtle aspect of buddha spirituality because we now we're looking at the subtlety of the movements of the heart the movements of the mind we're looking at we're cultivating the mind's ability to bring presence to our experience the mind's ability to to be present to see and notice and to not see and to be in a non-reactive way what's happening in the present moment the untrained mind is often very reactive having preferences likes and dislikes for and against things wanting not wanting and to cultivate the phenomenal jewel phenomenal treasure of unreactive awareness all of us have the ability to be present in this luminous way that is not for against anything which simply holds the experience as it is and that's a training in mindfulness the concentration practice is a training that supports the mindfulness so that luminous awareness can be held very very steady it's like a flame the flame is is um mindfulness is like the flame but there's a lot of wind the flame flame blows around it a lot and flickers and maybe blows out and the concentration is what helps make that flame um be unwavering so it doesn't blow out and doesn't flicker and those two together to have very capacity for great concentration and great mindfulness then helps the mind free and the heart free itself of the shackles free itself from what restricts it but gets in the way of the heart shining of the heart being free being loving being compassionate in a world that needs so much compassion but the goal is not to be loving the goal is not to be compassionate it's part of the path to do those things are very important but the goal is to cultivate this open-heartedness this equanimity and peace of the heart to its its ultimate capacity to do that and that's where the four noble truths of perspective becomes very important as i said earlier we want to keep looking keep refining keep keep ferreting out the subtlest attachments that the mind's still holding on to so eventually the consciousness can release itself and it's one of the miraculous things because it's as if it's almost as if consciousness itself is a kind of an attachment and and consciousness releases itself but when consciousness is released who's there to experience what's there it's kind of like you know if you try to touch your elbow the ultimate liberation in buddhism is this release of consciousness which what what it's kind of like it can't be talked about because it's not an object of consciousness because there's no consciousness there to experience it however buddhism doesn't want to say there's no consciousness it kind of wants to say there's consciousness without an object but what's that so very simply it's freedom or liberation the experience of the the sure heart's release the release of the heart it's the heart's greatest wish to be released of anything that holds it down so the eighth full path is that path that we can take that leads eventually to that release of the heart you know when buddhist when expressed their devotion and their deep intention to follow the path they take what's called refuge often colloquially in english we say taking refuge taking refuge in buddha dharmasanga but the literal poly is that it doesn't mean to take which seems like very american i'm going to take it but it's um it literally means um i go for refuge to the buddha i go actually the word is walk in poly i i walk for refuge so it's something you bring walking means you bring your whole being into that activity so the eighth full path the teaching eighth full path is a reminder of the possibility that potentially have of of bringing an integrated being or integrating our full being as part of the path and you might set up think about this next time you sit down to meditate these are some way just in that meditation session that you can integrate and include your whole being as something engaged in the practice of meditation not just something on the mind not just something of the heart but something of your body something of your heart something of your mind something of the unconditioned something of freedom bring everything you have into that practice if you do that you'll find yourself in the present moment you won't have to struggle to be in the present you'll find you find yourself there if you bring everything you you are into that moment of practice so thank you this is actually i think the first time i've
