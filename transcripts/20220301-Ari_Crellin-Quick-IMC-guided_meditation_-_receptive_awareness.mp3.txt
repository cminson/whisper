 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's allowing yourself to arrive, to settle here, and just taking in how you are right now, remembering that however you are right now is okay, and can be here. There's no right or wrong experience. Get to be here just as you are. Just bringing a kind and interested attention to how the mind and body and heart are in this moment. There's some ease, just recognizing, making room for ease. There's some tension or anxiety, just recognizing and allowing that. Checking in with the body. Is there tension in the body? If so, just very gently inviting, softening, or relaxing. Releasing of tension. And many of the patterns that give rise to tension in our minds and bodies are very deeply seated. There's no expectation that you should be able to relax completely. There's some tension will remain, and just be easy with that, just allow that to be there. Just to whatever degree is naturally and easily available. Just inviting some softening. The practice can be as simple as recognizing that experience is happening right now. You don't need to do anything with it or change it. Just this simple being with a simple awareness of what's naturally arising right now. Making room for all of what it is to be human. Just this simple moment to moment recognition of what experience is being known right now. One moment, the body sensation may be predominant. The next, it may be a sound. The next, a thought, an image, a mood, or some vague experience in the mind. No need to try to zero in on or focus on any one thing if it feels supportive to settle back with a more receptive awareness. Just receiving how it is to be human in this moment. So many of us have very deeply conditioned ideas and beliefs about how we should be, what experiences are okay. Just this kind of radical allowing and acceptance and receiving of however it is, however we are, can feel like such a loving and safe space to be held and met and received with kindness, with interest, with judgment. Just recognizing this is the human experience that's arising right now. Whether that's pleasant or easy or painful and difficult or neutral. None of those are better than any others. We have all seen so thoroughly, so clearly how chasing after the experiences that we think we should have or that we want, pushing away those that we don't want, this ties us up in knots of stress and tension, struggle. And that can be a tendency to identify with those aspects of our mind in our practice. And yet the encouragement is to also just include that in the field of what's being known. Of course, there's resistance happening. The mind has been conditioned to try to hold on to pleasant and push away unpleasant. Of course, there's struggle. Of course, there's judgment. Of course, there's some irritation. It's just the mind doing what it's been conditioned to do. It's just nature unfolding. And we're just going to start out with kindness, with interest. And recognizing what's arising right now. Hearing is being known. Thinking or thoughts are being known. These moods or mental qualities are being known. All of them with their own ever-changing, pleasant and unpleasant neutral valences. It's constantly shifting. It's nowhere we need to land or try to arrive at or anything we need to try to do. So just a simple moment to moment receiving and recognition of what's arising in experience is enough. It can be helpful from time to time to intentionally widen the lens, our perspective on our experience by asking what's the relationship to this experience right now? How am I with this? It may illuminate some relationship that was operating that wasn't being recognized. Often this can support the release of any tension or struggle, trying to hold on or push away that was happening. No need to try to stop any of that if that's happening. I want to include that as part of what we're observing, part of what we're just being with and receiving. Just remembering that all experience is nature. There's no good or bad experience. This quality of wisdom that we develop, cultivate in our practice has room for relating to all experience with balance, with kindness. Thank you. Just this simple receptivity, receiving the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, body sensations, activity of the mind. Recognizing how you are with that. Just in concluding how the mind is with that as an aspect of the mind. Identification is just something happening in the mind that we can be aware of. It's a mental activity that we can recognize and allow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
