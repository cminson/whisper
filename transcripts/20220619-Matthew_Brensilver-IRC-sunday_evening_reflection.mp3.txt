the physicist Niels Bohr said something like the opposite of a true statement is a false
statement, but the opposite of a profound statement is another profound statement.
And I think of that when I consider something Suzuki Roshi said, lineage of that kill trained in,
said something like Suzuki Roshi said, you're perfect as you are, and there's some room for
improvement. And those are two profound statements, perfect as you are and room for improvement. And so
often we go halfway acceptance and halfway change. We kind of accept ourselves and we kind of move
towards change. But the invitation is to totally accept ourselves and totally commit to growth.
Sometimes we try to change ourselves so that we might be acceptable to ourselves.
Sometimes we try to accept ourselves so that something happens, something changes. That's just
kind of spiritual bartering. We totally accept ourselves and totally commit to change growth.
And so we have no delusion, the self, the messiness of my condition, of my life, of my
personality, of all of it, very worthy of love, very worthy of deep kind of acceptance, that this
is what has come to be. In a way it's just accepting the past, what has come to be here. I am the
razor's edge of the past, and that's worthy of love. There's not a partial acceptance, there's
not an acceptance with conditions, this is a deep yes. And there's some room for improvement.
But when we accept, in a way, speaking, the aspiration for change isn't desperate, isn't a
project, isn't impatient, isn't another form of becoming. Just a clear appreciation.
That it's possible to suffer less.
It's good to practice with you. And a customary at the end of the first day, it's okay to feel
good about yourself that you made it. First day of retreat is often intense and kind of sweet to
go to bed knowing that you've been cultivating the good and relinquishing forces that compound
suffering, difficulty, and to enjoy that, actually viscerally enjoy that. It's a wholesome, wholesome
pleasant. So proceed as you see fit. Maybe that's some walking or tea or practice in one way or
another, maybe it's it's bed. And yeah, rest rest well. If it is that time, sweet dreams. But the
footnote on sweet dreams is sometimes on retreat, they're pretty weird dreams. And that's okay. It's
like the depths of the mind being stirred in one way or another and dreams get archetypal or
something. So just even if sleep is a little complicated, just just rest deeply, rest your
body, and we'll look forward to re-gathering tomorrow. Okay.
