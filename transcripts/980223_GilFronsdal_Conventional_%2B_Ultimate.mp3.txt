 So following up a little bit on the talk I gave last week, in Buddhism there's often pairs of teachings that are considered to kind of go together. And one of the classic important ones in Buddhist teachings is wisdom and compassion. And there are some wisdom and compassion are sometimes called the wings of Buddhism, and it's kind of the wings that let your practice soar and fly, take off, is wisdom and compassion. If you only have one wing you won't get off the ground. You need to have both, wisdom and compassion, wisdom and love perhaps. And another one which could be connected to this is the pair, the distinction between what's called conventional truth or reality and ultimate truth or ultimate reality. And I think Buddhist teachings becomes a lot clearer if we understand this particular distinction between conventional truth and ultimate truth, ultimate reality. And if we understand this better then it's easier to kind of discover the realms of wisdom and compassion, how they go together. So I wanted to talk a little bit today about conventional and ultimate reality and how it works. So one idea is that, and they're both called truths, conventional truth and ultimate truth. It's very clear that that's what in Buddhism they talk about. So it isn't that conventional truth is bad or lesser than ultimate truth. They're both equally true. But often we use the word ultimate. We think ultimate is like in 19, is it animal pharma? It ends up saying animal pharma. Yeah, where he says everyone's equal but some people are more equal than others. So all truths are equal but the ultimate truth is a little more equal than conventional truth. So there's these two truths. And the conventional truth is the one where we tend to get into the most trouble, where it tends to be the one that causes the most suffering. And so that's where there's a lot of investigation and a lot of understanding. A lot of the wisdom in Buddhism has to do with understanding the nature of conventional reality, conventional truth, not to get rid of it but so we can be free of it and not get stuck in it. But it's possible it gets stuck in ultimate truth too but that's less a common experience than conventional truth. Now conventional truth has to do with conventions, the conventions we choose for ourselves. And most of the reality we live in is built on conventions. And you know some things are really obvious and kind of very mundane. Our convention is to drive on the right side of the street. In places in the world where they do it wrong, they do it the left side of the street. The idea that you know left and right side of the street where you drive on, that's a convention, right? Just how they chose to do it in different places. There's nothing about the nature of the universe that says that this is ultimately has to be the way it is, you know, right, left side or whatever. And then to add on top of that a judgment that they're doing it wrong. I mean that's adding another kind of a convention, a judgment on top of what's a convention to begin with. It's kind of silly, right? It's just different people chose differently. And that's kind of, you know, maybe simplistic. You may point that kind of example out but our reality is made up of infinite number almost of these kind of conventional distinctions that exist only through the collective mind of all of us. The fact that a red light, a traffic light means to stop. You know, that's something we kind of have agreed together as a culture to do or that we drive on the right side of the street. That's our understanding. It's the collective understanding of all of us that holds that convention in place. It could easily change that convention. We could wake up tomorrow and decide, well, let's wake up, let's drive on the left side of the street. And those kinds of things don't, you know, we don't usually decide to change very quickly, but they're quite fluid and they could be changed. So, for example, there's a place I used to park in San Francisco for years. And probably since the street was put in, whenever it was put in, it's been unlimited parking except the two hours a week were street cleaning. And that's a convention. You can park there however long you want. About a year ago, they decided that it's only two hour parking there. So they changed the convention. However, I didn't notice because, you know, I was living in the old convention and the collective convention had changed. So, so I got a ticket. I was up there today and I assumed it was a two hour parking still. It was only a year ago, it was the day before. And so I parked, you know, many blocks away where it was still unlimited parking and walked where I had to go. And when I came out of the building, I looked in sign and now it says three hours. So I could have parked there. I could have parked closer. So it's just a convention, you know, that we kind of create for ourselves. Now, after my newborn son was born, I was somewhat proudly telling a friend of mine about the kind of child rearing theory I'm going to have. And I've learned a lot in the last six weeks about having, having ideals and how, you know, ideals are ideals. But one of them, you know, was something my father told me about how he raised me. And so I thought this was a great idea. And this is how I want to raise my son. And that was to offer as much support as he wanted, as he wants, and also as much independence as he wants. So he comes back for support, support him. But if he wants to take the steps and have independence, let him take those steps and go out into the world. So to be there to offer support, but also to encourage, not exactly encourage, but allow for the independence also. That seemed like a nice, reasonable thing, maybe. And then I reflected on it. And even though it maybe seems like a nice, reasonable thing, that itself is also, belongs to the world of conventions. That idea that we can be independent and we can cultivate independence as individuals. Even the idea of becoming individuals, individualistic, belongs to conventions of our culture. And there are other cultures in the world, and probably in Western culture two, three hundred years ago, the idea of people becoming independent is kind of the unheard of, understandable concept. You're going to raise someone's thinking of being independent. It just didn't make any sense, like talking to them in Greek, if you use that kind of language. Because people had different conventions two, three hundred years ago in the West about the nature of the self, the nature of how people are as individuals in relationship to others. And in some cultures like in Japan, the understanding of what a self is, it doesn't really, it's very different than ours. An idea of the individual becoming independent is kind of a foreign idea, as I discovered when I was in Japan. And people who try to take the independent route in Japan don't get much support for it. And here in the West we're horrified by that, but it belongs to the conventions. And it doesn't necessarily have an ultimate reality to it, but in our culture certain things work and certain things don't, but not, but it's just a convention. One example I think I mentioned here a few weeks ago was the Buddhist attitude towards marriage, for example. People suffer a lot about our Western concept of marriage. And when you're in the middle of a concept of such like marriage, it seems pretty absolute to you, you better not kind of mess with it. But it's just a convention that we've kind of constructed for ourselves, and it's probably being constructed as we speak in our culture. It's changing all the time what marriage means. But people kind of get locked in and think this is the way it has to be. But in other cultures, there's other radically different notions of what marriage should be or can be. And the Buddhist attitude is just accept what's in the culture, and not have some absolute stance about what is right. Buddhism is very flexible with conventions. It goes with conventions. If they don't hurt anybody, you go with the conventions. And so in countries where there is polygamy, and that's kind of common, cultures where they do that, Buddhism says, well, that's fine. And there's other cultures in Tibet, a few places in Tibet, where it's the opposite. What's the opposite? Polyanities. And that's the common, and the Buddhists came into that culture and said, fine, have all the husbands you want. And those are just conventions that we have, but it's very hard to see that all the arts are conventions. So already I'm kind of had the convention that I want to raise my son in. I saw ideas about it. And I could see that he comes off, he comes out, he's there, and he's not exactly like Slade, but he's pretty close to it. And he's kind of trying to construct the universe. He's looking and trying to make sense of it. And his parents are right there trying to help him make sense of it. And as we're helping him make sense of it, we're actually creating it for him. There was a study made of mothers, and apparently a very common phenomenon of mothers, I think all parents, is they started very early on interpreting the gestures and facial expressions of their children. Who knows if when, you know, sometimes it's kind of obvious he's distressed, but who knows sometimes, you know? I mean, I keep saying, look, he's smiling, and everybody says, everybody, including the doctors and the nurses and the hospitals, they all kind of say, it's gas. You know. But, you know, so who knows what all these facial expressions are and what his experience is, but we're already putting him into concepts, into labels. And it's, you know, he doesn't pick up much now, but soon he will. And soon he realizes that certain kinds of behavior, certain kinds of expressions fit into kind of our conventions of what should happen, and his parents respond. You know, right now maybe he's just crying when he's distressed, but soon he's going to cry, you know, he's learning how to train us. He's training us as much as anybody else. And so as we grow up, we incorporate from our family and our society all these conventions about how to interpret our experience, how to be, and a huge percentage of how we choose to live our life and our emotional expressions and our feelings and our ideas about each other and who we are, belongs to this realm called conventions. They're just a convention that we have in our culture here. And it's fascinating to read the history of the self. There's a natural history books, you know, written about how the self has changed over the last, you know, since however long they have records. And what we take to be so absolute, sociologists, anthropologists, historians can see that's really a very changeable phenomenon. It changes all the time. A lot of what we take as self, it comes out of comparative thinking. We're comparing ourselves to others. So for example, a young child who grows up and the parents say, oh, young boys don't cry. That's, you know, that's that young boy then is learning a concept of what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a man that belongs to a convention. That is just a convention of our culture. There's other cultures have very different conventions where it's good to cry and the men cry all the time. You go to Arab countries and men cry quite freely, apparently in Japan. There was an article in paper about Japan being the crying country. And they're all, they're all crying at the Olympics, left and right. The Japanese are crying. And they just cry. It's just what they do in blue horns. So, so we incorporate these things, but a lot of it is comparative thinking. So someone says, you're not good enough. You're not good enough. Good enough to what? So we learned we're unworthy or inadequate, an adequate compared to what? We're full of shame. We're full of guilt. We're full of feeling that we're feeling the opposite. We feel like really proud of ourselves. We're the best, best compared to what? A lot of the ideas of good, bad, right, wrong, worthy, unworthy have to do with comparative thinking without necessarily understanding what we're comparing it to, or even that we're comparing. And that's where it's so insidious. This idea of conventional truth is we construct these things together and we don't understand the underlying arbitrariness or the optionality of the concepts that we run our life by. And a lot of the important work of mindfulness practice is to investigate the nature of our concepts, nature, the ideas we base our life on, to understand the nature degree to which maybe they're just conventions and don't have an absolute value in and of themselves. They have value conventionally. If you drive on the left side of the street in America, that has consequences. It's still a convention. So we have conventions that we live by, but if you understand them as conventions, you can see them much more fluidly. So many cultures have gestures. And part of the function of gestures is usually people have very sharp insight into the conventions that we live by. And they can see the holes in them, or they can see the quicksand that they're built upon, and they can kind of point that out to us and make fun of it. Great spiritual teachers, or people who do meditation practice, often can kind of see through the holes of the insubstantial concepts we have. They're quite insubstantial because the only place they exist is in the collective mind of all of us. They don't exist kind of like only in here. They exist because we've created together in whatever, wherever the collective mind is. Good enough, bad enough. So what are the things that help us see through the conventions that we base our life on? Certainly I think meditation helps a lot. Sometimes something very jarring kind of wakes us up and we realize how we've been obsessing on certain things being really important. And it turns out that maybe in comparison to other things it's not so important. So a death is for a great teacher. If we get close to death or someone we know dies, and suddenly we kind of wake up and say, gee, I've been living in a dream. What I thought was really important is not important, you know, and we're kind of desperately trying to get this promotion and doing everything we can and forgetting our family and everything until someone or family is dying. I forget that. I couldn't care less about that promotion. What I really care about is being with my loved ones while they're still alive. So there are various things that kind of pop the bubble of some of the ways we get caught by our conventions. But we do get caught and getting caught creates a tremendous amount of suffering. Not being caught, to see the conventions for what they are creates freedom. Now the self, most of the ways in which we understand ourselves as a self, belongs to conventional thinking. It's a construct. However, we don't see it as being a construct. We don't see it as being a convention. We don't see the way that our parents kind of built up our conventional world. We don't see the step-by-step ways as children to kind of incorporate society's messages about what a self is. And so we just kind of see the done deal in a sense. And it feels like a unitary, unified event and solid and permanent and whatever. And we think this is the way the universe has to be. I'm an unworthy person, right? The universe made me that you know, the universe can't be wrong. This is what happened. It's just a convention of many of the ways in which we live. However, it isn't that this is bad and you should stop having a conventional sense of self. We have to have a conventional sense of self in order to live. And the conventional sense of self that we have has some truth to it. But it arises in convention the way we kind of are in discourse with each other, in relationship with each other. And so that's why I think a lot of people get very frightened or upset by the Buddhist teaching of no self. Because they say, wait a minute, if I don't have a self, how am I going to function properly? And then usually sometimes Buddhist teachers will kind of discount the fear. But I think the fear is very real because the conventional sense of who we think we are is dependent on the concepts and relationships we form and build with the society around us. And if you start taking away those relationships, our sense of self changes. Or if understanding those relationships change, or if understanding of our self changes, then relationships change in some degree also. So it can be very frightening. Unless we firmly understand that conventions are conventions. They're kind of fluid and they're kind of transparent and they're kind of optional. And it's not the place to hang our hat. It's not the place to put absolute trust in. It's not the place to rely on totally and completely as if concepts and conventions are completely reliable. At the least, if you completely depend, the concepts don't change. At the least you're going to get a parking ticket occasionally. At the worst, a lot more terrible things can happen to you if you're holding on to a particular conventional worldview and the world has changed. The concept of self- invalidate the 50 and 100 kyat notes. And there weren't really any notes higher than that. And the 50 kyat note was worth about a dollar in the black market. So most people had their money in these $1,500 notes. And so it's like most of us, and you don't trust the banks, so you keep the money under your mattress. So imagine you didn't trust the banks in America and you had all your money in $20 bills. And you woke up one morning and the US government said, sorry, the $20 bills are worthless. That would be, you know, in God we trust, it says on them. But money and dollar bills just belong to the conventional world and they don't have to stay the same as I learned in Burma. They can change overnight. So we put our trust if we rely and depend on conventional reality. If our sense of who we are is dependent on the concepts that construct the sense of self, you're likely to suffer. And if your sense of self is based on comparative thinking, even more so. What Buddhism, so then Buddhism says on the other side of conventional truth is ultimate truth. And the relief from resting or relying on conventional reality is to get a sense, a taste of resting or taking refuge or living or something in this realm that's called ultimate reality, to have a sense what that means. And to realize that that's much more our true nature, much more our one of the places we can live. One of the, it gives us a different perspective. If we really see the ultimate side, then it becomes a mirror to understand better how well, how much conventional truth is just convention. But if you live in conventions all the time, it's very hard to see that that's all it is. It's like they say in England, if you don't leave England, you don't know, you don't know England. If you don't leave the country you're in, you don't really get a good perspective of the country you're in, you're kind of insulated and you don't really see. If you don't have a chance to step outside of conventional reality, it's very hard to see what conventional reality is really like. And this is where especially meditation practice is very important, because it leads us eventually to a taste of what's called what's the more ultimate truth, what's more ultimately possible to experience directly unmediated by the concepts, unmediated by the conventions. There are other things going on in life besides our conventions. And so you can have a direct experience with that. And to begin seeing those things and connecting to them, to really to use to be in the world of our eyes and ears and nose and tastes and to be in our primary senses and experience the world directly in the moment, belongs much more to the ultimate reality. To be lost in abstraction and ideas and thinking about the future in the past is to be lost in conventions. Every thought you have about the future, every thought you have about the past is conventional thinking. It's a constructed thinking because you construct certain ideas, perhaps with a hope or the fear that they might turn out that way. But you have no idea it's going to turn out that way. If you're thinking about what's happening tomorrow, you might say, well, I know that's going to happen. I'm going to have a job interview tomorrow at eight o'clock in the morning, and that's going to happen. I'm worried about it. You know, you probably, chances are you will if you have it set up, but you might not either. Until it actually happens, it remains in the world of construct of conventions. Every thought you have about the future in the past belongs to conventional constructed thinking. So to be in our primary senses, to experience reality directly, begins to loosen up the hard hold of conventions have. And it can offer a tremendous relief to those of us who are oppressed by the concepts we have, oppressed by the ideas we have of who we are, oppressed by the ways in which we've been indoctrinated by our family and society and culture and our own experiences about how we think we need to be or who we shouldn't be or the shoulds and shouldn'ts about ourselves. To begin finding that it's possible to trust and rest more in the direct experience of the present moment cuts through a lot of this conventional kind of thinking. One aspect of conventional thinking, one aspect of ultimate truth, there's one aspect of ultimate truth, there's four aspects of it, but one aspect is the experience of nirvana. Nirvana or enlightenment is one of the things we can experience directly that has nothing to do with conventions. And in a sense, it's the experience of not clinging to anything, not desperately resisting anything, because the world of conventions is a place when we suffer in it, it's where a place where we tend to cling to things or we push things away. We cling and we push away. And as we learn to trust and rest in ultimate reality more, as we learn to trust and rest, if we learn it's possible, it's not necessary to cling to anything. Not clinging to anything doesn't mean we give up using conventional realities. Conventional truth is a truth. The ideas we have of ourself is a truth. They're useful. It's useful to drive in the right side of the street in America. But we don't have to cling to it. We don't have to kind of say democracy is God in America and we're going to kill and die for democracy. Democracy is ultimate value in America. It's like this ultimate thing, democracy, democracy, democracy. Let's export it to the whole world, democracy, democracy. Democracy is just a concept, a collective concept, and the American version of it isn't very democratic even. Other countries have more democratic forms of democracy and we kind of hold it up in this great abstraction. It's just a concept and Americans are willing to die for this abstraction. So we suffer. So the idea is to hold it lightly, not to let go of it, not to kind of throw things away, the concepts and conventions, but we hold it with a light touch and learning to hold conventions, hold reality with light touch is a lot of the art of learning to live a free life, a life that's free of suffering and full of love, to hold things lightly and not to grasp. So nirvana is the experience totally and completely without any remnants, the human possibility of a consciousness which has no movement towards grasping towards anything. That's completely open, open-handed in a sense and allows everything just to rest as it is. And that's a very important experience for in Buddhism, a very important sense is this idea of connecting with reality directly and then resting in the state of non-clinging and trusting that's okay, that if you don't cling to anything, if you don't resist anything, you can still take care of your life quite responsibly. It's kind of like if you're in rush hour traffic and you're stuck and there's no way to get through, you know, you don't need to get upset, right? Because you're going to get there just as soon if you get upset if you don't. Upsetting is extra. So much of life is like that. There's a lot of things we can take care of things just fine without having to get upset or without having to cling, without having to insist it has to be that way. So if we can kind of begin to get a sense through meditation, through mindfulness of how it is to connect in contact with reality directly unmediated by conventions or even better to rest in this experience of non-clinging, then we go back, we have a new perspective on conventions and there's different perspectives, different kind of emotions or senses that might arise when you look back at the conventions we live our life by. One is you might start laughing. It's just totally ridiculous some of the ways in which we live our lives and things we get caught up in and things we think are so important and they're just kind of invented out of the blue and we take them to be so absolute. It's, you know, ludicrous and funny and humorous to see what we do. And we laugh kind of a little bit as adults. We look back sometimes at teenagers and say, well, you know, it's kind of cute what they're, you know, caught up in or, but you know, you're a teenager, you don't feel that way. So sometimes you look back and we think it can be kind of humorous to look at it. Another perspective is it's sad and makes you want to cry. The amount of suffering, the amount of pain we inflict on each other and on ourselves because we're really firmly attached and gripped by concepts and conventions is really, you know, it makes me want to break my heart sometimes. It's so arbitrary, you know, why do we get caught up in these kinds of concerns? So we can laugh, we can cry, we can have equanimity and we can also have compassion. And I think the experience, when we begin to experience reality directly instead of being caught by the concepts, I think that a very loving heart is born and a very compassionate heart and one of the qualities of freedom is a quality of love or compassion. The notions of being separate, separation from others, that belongs to the world of concepts, of convention. The notion, the idea that we're all the same and all united is also a convention. It's also a concept. The experience of just being alive is neither this nor that. It's neither being separate nor is it being completely unified with everybody. But who said, you know, it's neither this nor that. It's a famous expression in Buddhism. You know, this nor that. But what is it? I don't know, but we can experience it and from that experience that neither separate nor united is born a wonderful kind of compassion and love, a wonderful appreciation and a wonderful caring for each other. And it's the kind of caring that maybe T.S. Eliot famous quote quote of a line that I like to quote a lot from the Four Quartets where he says, teach me to care and not to care. So it isn't that we don't care about concepts and our friends and everything, but don't care about it, you know, teach me to care and not to care, teach me to be concerned but not caught up in it. Or as a Diamond Sutra says, the famous the Buddhist Sutra, it says something like, I don't remember the quote too well, it says something like, you should go out and save all beings without any notion that there are living beings. Neither this nor that. So we're completely dedicated towards the welfare of all beings everywhere, but really there are no beings anywhere. Beings are just a conventional idea. So anyway, does all that make sense to you? And but part of the inspiration of this talk was to just simply to encourage you to investigate conventional reality. And this is really one part of mindfulness practice is not to take it for granted, but really to investigate and study what are the belief systems, what are the concepts, what are the notions and ideas I have about reality, about society, about friendship, about all kinds of things. Where do they come from and how absolute are they and you know, are they and then to begin to kind of maybe feel a little bit looser about it because it's just convention. Yeah. There's a conventional truth that has been caught and that is the usual manner of having children. So then when I think of cloning, I think of then I start to go into the future, you know, as you're saying, and I'm caught because I think of brave new world and all the satsalina and I have fears and concerns and it's hard for me to think lightly about it in an ultimate truth kind of way. Well, I think of the challenge, that's the challenge. And what some people, how some people might react is that they'll hear this kind of teaching and say, well, I'm not going to think about these kinds of issues because that's thinking about the future. It's thinking about concepts. I'm just going to be involved in that at all. Forget it, you know, and that's somewhat irresponsible. I think the idea is to take these things responsibly, think about it, be concerned about it and maybe give a lot of thought to it and a lot of research and whatever, but there's no need to be afraid. There's no need to cling. There's no need to have resistance. We're just engaged fully. So that's where in investigation then turns inward. It doesn't so much look at the concepts, maybe looks at our fear, looks at their reactions and our reactions and tries to understand them and tries to find some way to be responsibly involved without the motivation of fear, anger, those things. Yes. Ultimate reality? What can be experienced as ultimate reality are four things. It's what's called the primary sensations. It's usually four, the earth, water, fire and air. Sensations of hardness, coolness, movement, temperature, heat, things like that, kind of the primary sensations we have. That's the one. The other is consciousness itself. Awareness itself is considered to be something you can experience directly without any mediation of concepts. The third is what's called mental factors or states of mind. You can look at my son and he doesn't know any concepts as far as I can tell yet. He has mental factors galore. He has mental states like fury and delight. Today I think he had the first official smile and looked at me and he was really smiling. He had delight. He doesn't have any concept of what that is, but you can experience certain emotions directly unmediated by concepts. The fourth one is nirvana, the experience of awakening or freedom. Well, some of the some of the jhanic factors, the jhanic factors are mental factors. So the joy and the equanimity and the concentration of the jhanic factors can be experienced directly. But see, some of these things, except for nirvana, the other three ultimate truths, ultimate realities, are constructed realities. They arise and pass because of the conditions coming together to create them. So a mental state arises because different situations come together. And so the jhanic experiences are constructed and conditioned phenomena and are not the same thing as nirvana, which is unconditioned. Is it possible to think about the future in a present way so that... If you're thinking about the future, thinking about the future always occurs in the present. You cannot think about the future tomorrow. You can, but tomorrow you'll think, you know, you always think in the present when you're thinking about the future or the past. If you realize you're thinking about the future, then you're in the present. You can continue thinking about the future, but you're not fooled. So when we say be here now, which we might say sometimes, naively this person might take that to mean, you know, stop thinking about the past and the future. But more subtly what it means is just remain, be aware of what's going on in the present. And if you're thinking about the future, just be aware you're doing that in some simple way. One of the conventions we have is to stop at nine. It's just a convention. We don't have to. So look, study your conventions. You'll be surprised how many you find that you not only live under, but suffer under. Thank you.
