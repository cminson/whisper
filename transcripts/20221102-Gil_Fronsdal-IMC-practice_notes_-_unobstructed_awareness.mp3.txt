 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's receptively simple when teachers like myself give a lot of instruction. But it's kind of like, you know, unencumbered space, the awareness. That space awareness where in which there's no obstacle to anything, no resistance to anything. The space around us doesn't grab hold of anything. It just stays in space. And so the capacity to be aware and to know can have that kind of simplicity sometimes. We know, we're aware of what's happening. We feel it, we sense it, we perceive it in some ways. But that the perceiving, the sensing, the awareness of it, the knowing of it, has this very simple, clean, relaxed, open, unobstructed simplicity to it. And unless this idea makes it complicated for you compared to what you're already doing, you might, as you go through the day this morning practicing here, keep a reference point to simple simplicity. How simple can this be? What does it mean to have unobstructed awareness, unobstructed perceptions, knowing, with no resistance, no grabbing hold of anything, just allowing things to be in the awareness? So thank you all and enjoy your morning.
