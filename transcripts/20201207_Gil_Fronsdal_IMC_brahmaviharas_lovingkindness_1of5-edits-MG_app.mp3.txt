On this Monday, we start a new theme for the week. 
This theme will continue for a few weeks. It will be 
what's called in Pali, the Brahmavihāra s, sometimes 
known as the Divine Abodes. Sometimes a different 
word is used to describe them: the immeasurables – the 
immeasurable abodes or dwellings. These are four 
qualities of social attitudes, four different flavors of 
caring for the world and for ourselves.  
A background for these. In ancient India, the records we 
have – and we don't know what else was going on – the 
earliest surviving writings on the religions of ancient audiodharma.org  India begin with the idea that there are gods. The gods 
influence the events of the world. And we need to make 
sacrifices and offerings to the gods, so they'll treat us 
favorably. Crops will gro w, the cows will flourish, and 
whatever else is needed, whatever else we want, will 
happen.   
Over time, a couple of centuries before the Buddha, 
there arose the idea that the external world – the 
cosmos, the divine world, the world of the gods – was to 
be found inside oneself. There was an internalization. 
The very thing that's found outside is also found within. 
There was an internalization of religious practice, of 
looking inward. Maybe that's where meditation began. 
And the Buddha was part of this inter nalization 
movement of ancient India.  
One way we see it is that the divine, which in the earlier 
tradition was looked for within oneself, eventually 
coalesced in some areas of India around the idea of a 
divinity. There was a prime or main god named 
Brahma.  The Buddha, rather than focusing externally 
on the concept of a divinity or a god, pointed out that 
with this internalization, we can experience in ourselves 
these attitudes, qualities, abidings – the life of Brahma. 
We can dwell like Brahma. We can be li ke this great 
god if we dwell in the four brahmavihāra s. Vihāra  
means dwelling or abode – the four abodes of Brahma.  
The dwellings where Brahma lives are loving -kindness 
(goodwill), compassion, appreciative joy, and a certain audiodharma.org  kind of social attitude called equanimity. We'll talk about 
that. These are fairly well known in our vipassanā 
scene: mettā , karuṇā , muditā , upekkhā . 
It's quite a movement, the ancient Indian  idea of 
internalizing or finding within oneself, the qualities of the 
divine. Some people will translate brahmavihāra s as 
"the divine abodes," rather than as "the abidings of the 
god Brahma ." It's quite powerful in English to call 
something divine – and to discover  it inside oneself. 
That's where it can be found.  
In the lore and iconography of Buddhism, you'll find 
statues of Brahma. The statues have four faces, 
pointing in the four different directions. Each of these 
four faces represents one of the brahmavihāra s. The 
one in the front, looking out on the world,  is one of 
goodwill and kindness. To the right, I believe, is 
compassion. To the back is appreciative joy. And to the 
left is equanimity. The four faces of Brahma. In a way, 
this represents the four faces we can bring to the world 
– depending on the circum stances at the time. These 
are ways we can gaze upon the world.  
We might also think that there's more than the idea of 
the face in the way we look at the world. In the body  of 
Brahma , deep inside of Brahma , there is something 
deeper than loving kindness, c ompassion, appreciative 
joy, and equanimity. It's something that animates us into 
action  – and that is a word I talked about last spring: 
anukampā . I translate it as care – a basic caring for the audiodharma.org  world and for others. It's a kind of love – tender love, 
tender care that is the seed or the source for these four 
qualities.  
This happens when we drop deep inside and get really 
quiet, still, calm, and relaxed. There's a kind of 
sensitivity, vibration, warmth, a glow of tenderness, 
that's not quite compassion. It' s not quite loving 
kindness. It's not quite appreciative joy or equanimity. 
But it has qualities that are related to all of those. It's 
quieter and more tender. Maybe it's almost like it 
doesn't want a label or a word. It's not quite each of 
those, but it' s often seen as love because we have no 
other English word for it.  
It could also be experienced differently. It could even be 
a sense of coziness. It's a deeper sense of care. This is 
one of the things that happens as we meditate and get 
quieter and quiete r. We put things on the shelf, leave 
things at the door, and really allow ourselves to settle in 
this movement of internalization. We really get deeply 
quiet – not concerned with our thoughts anymore about 
what's happening during the day, our relationship to 
other people, about the future, the past, or getting lost 
in fantasy . When we  really get settled , it's as if there's a 
natural capacity there – our natural capacity to care.  
A wonderful image for this came up some weeks ago. I 
was hiking up in the hills  nearby at a nature preserve 
with wide grasslands and oak woodlands. There are 
many deer living there. The rules of the preserve are audiodharma.org  that everyone's supposed to walk only on the trails. The 
deer, of course, can walk anywhere. Over the decades 
in this prese rve, the deer have become quite used to 
people. They seem to understand well that people stay 
on the trails. So, they come relatively close to the trail. 
They're just grazing and living there, mostly feeling 
pretty comfortable and safe, I think.  
The last t ime I was there, I saw one deer grooming with 
its teeth, cleaning the neck of another deer. I realized 
that deer can lick themselves in different parts of their 
bodies, but they can't really clean their necks. They 
can't, like cats, rub the top of their he ads. If they want to 
clean their necks or the tops of their heads, they have 
to do it for each other.  
And the deer are fellow mammals. They a re herd 
animals that care for each other in different ways. The 
caring, cleaning, and tending is such a basic human – 
maybe even mammalian – activity that is like an instinct 
inside of us. I associate this very much with a parent 
taking care of a very youn g child, a little baby. There's 
tenderness, care, and gentleness in the dedication, 
devotion, and love when  caring for something so 
vulnerable and in need of our attention.  There's an 
innate capacity that sometimes is covered over. It may 
be a unique exper ience for each person – very different 
from that of other people. I like the word care. And care, 
depending on the circumstance, manifests as or audiodharma.org  morphs into goodwill, compassion, appreciative joy, or 
equanimity.  
Care is pretty fundamental. There's a lot th at can 
support it. We can be supported by inner stability, 
mindfulness and awareness. We can also be supported 
by the capacity to recognize what it is that takes us 
away from this. We recognize what we get caught up in 
and what disconnects us from a deeper  place of 
settledness, sensitivity, and openness. There's even a 
place of deep safety inside, which we discover in 
meditation. No matter what someone says or does to 
us, we can discover a place that's not harmed by 
anything. It's a place of deep, deep safe ty that is 
coterminous with – or very connected to – a deep place 
of warmth, care, and tenderness.  
Goodwill – mettā  – is the feeling of wanting people to be 
happy. It's how we meet the happiness of the world. 
Compassion is how we meet the unhappiness of th e 
world, the suffering of the world. We wish that suffering 
would go away. We empathize and sympathize with the 
suffering. Appreciative joy is celebrating the good 
fortune people have. Equanimity is the feeling of love 
when we can't really do anything. Som etimes people's 
fortunes are not so good; unfortunate things happen. 
And we can care for them  and love them. But there  is 
also a degree of not getting upset, agitated, or reactive 
to the misfortune of the world. We can have this audiodharma.org  beautiful love and care, su pported and protected by a 
certain kind of equanimity or balanced non -reactivity.  
That's going to be the topic over this next period of time. 
For the rest of this week, we'll talk more about loving 
kindness and mettā . I hope that, as we do this series, 
you'll think of these as topics pointing toward finding a 
home base, a supportive base for mindfulness practice 
itself – for meditation. Thank you.
