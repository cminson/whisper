 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.Adiodarma.org. He called himself that. Sometimes when people just didn't know he was a teacher, didn't treat them as a teacher, they called them by his family name. They would say, you know, Gotama. Sometimes it would be polite, but they would call him Gotama. But the way that he most commonly referred to himself, without using the word I or something, me, he called himself a Tatagata. And the word Tatagata was probably an ancient Indian title for certain kinds of spiritual teachers that he probably adopted from his time. But it literally means, we don't know what it literally means, but because it's a compound word, and how to parse the compoundness of it is not so clear. But the preferred way of understanding it, that it means the one who is thus gone, the person who's gone that way, whatever that means. But there's another way that's not so well understood, that my preferred way that's literal, it is the one who is thus. The one who is thus. So I imagine that the Buddha showed up here in Redwood City, and you go up and say, well, you look a little unusual for this time and place. And, you know, who are you? What are you? And the Buddha says, I'm like this. This, what? What else can you, I'm this. I'm this way. So in a sense, there's no definition, which means no limitation, which means no, nothing is excluded, everything's allowed to be included. I'm just this way, here. You get what you see, or this is what it is. And I find it kind of quite provocative and wonderful, this idea that you irritate a lot of people if you give that answer. Who are you or what are you? I'm just like this. I don't recommend it. But there's something very profound about answering that question for yourself that way. Who am I? And the gesture is one of opening up the hands and arms and chest open and say, just this. Everything is included, nothing excluded. My full humanity, everything part of who I am. And being very careful to not have a, to be limited, to narrow down or define who we are. And one of the ways of doing, of defining and limiting who we are is to use mindfulness in a way that limits us, that defines us, that this is what's important. There's a way of using mindfulness that does the opposite. That's not a technique that narrows us down, but rather a way, an approach to open up wide, to include everything. Everything included in our freedom. And I think that for freedom to be real, everything has to be included. If we leave something out, it's usually not so much because we don't know about it, but because there's something has been, something we're attached to, something we're resisting, something we've closed down to. And this idea of being willing to open up all the way. And there's just this. And it's so simple. To me, it's also kind of humble without being humble. Isn't that beautiful? To be humble without being humble. Where you just kind of get to be yourself. Just get to be yourself. In this practice. Whatever you are, imagine, so sit in meditation, for example, is the ideal place for this. Where you get to be yourself. And then to wake up as you are, to discover what it's like to be free as yourself. Even the parts of you that are not necessarily so wonderful, and you don't think you should be there, but just this, just this. And there's a way of just this, honestly and clearly and fully, is an expression of freedom that's different than believing in or going along with or participating in some of the odd things that maybe your mind does sometimes. There's a few of you, not all of you. But sometimes, some of us have odd things that happen in our mind or our hearts. Like this, this is who I am. Honestly, this is what you get. I'm this way. I have this, I have this quirk. I have this foibol. I have this particular challenge. And just like, the gesture is always just, oh, it's like this. And then one of the things that can happen in doing this is that something inside of us can begin to settle. And to settle deeply in meditation, it even gets very concentrated with that kind of openness that includes everything. Then the settling, the concentration, is integrated, is connected, is in some ways real. It's possible to practice meditation in such a way that we do get concentrated, but it's at the expense of not being inclusive. It's kind of like leaving things out, which as the result of it often can be that there's not much understanding. There's not much appreciation. There's kind of like, there's all these, I've known people who've done a deep practice sometimes who don't know themselves very well. And so there's this almost unconscious drives, unconscious patterns and emotions and feelings that are not understood because of the narrowness of how the mind has come. So when the Buddha says, you know, you're asked, who are you or what are you? And maybe he even opened his arms up like this and like, almost like, step forward and, I'm just this. This is what you get. This is who I am. I'm all of this. Maybe there's some way that you're willing to just be this, just be yourself and this just being yourself settle deeply, fully into the full potential of what awareness practice, mindfulness practice can bring. And I like to believe that when the Buddha sees each of us, the Buddha sees us the same way. Oh, this person is just like this. With the kind of reverence, the kind of care, kind of love that as you are, the Buddha sees you as you are, you're held in that compassionate gaze that hopefully we can do for ourselves as well. So thank you. And we now have some time for cleaning.
