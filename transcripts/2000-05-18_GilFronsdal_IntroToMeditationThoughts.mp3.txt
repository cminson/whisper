 Have you done the practice at home or the instructions last week? I'd like to take this beginning as a little bit more informal time for you guys to hear from you and your concerns. Yes? A comment first. I've been doing meditation for so many years of silva mind control, sitting yoga and on just so many different kinds of visualizations. I really enjoyed last week really getting it about allowing awareness. It's for a compulsive doer just allowing this delightful thing. My question has to do with duration of a meditation. For me to have some main meditation to say, well even if you do it for five minutes, that's good. Whatever you can do. Trying to do it right, pardon me, asks, well it takes me half an hour to start getting down into the layer of feelings that you're referring to. I would think 45 minutes is a minute. So this is the perspective on the duration is what I'm trying to ask. That's a good question. One of the ways of approaching mindfulness practice, see mindfulness is, one way of looking at it is it's kind of like a tool. There are many ways of using that tool. Many philosophies to apply to it, many attitudes towards it. The tool is relatively neutral. One of the pure ways, and that's a judgment I suppose to call it that way, of using a mindfulness practice is to see that, is not to be interested in change per se, but to be interested in simply the moment of mindfulness itself. We tend to be very focused on change and the object, what we can know in awareness and really want to somehow manipulate or change it or allow it or do something with it. One way of doing mindfulness is, what we're really doing is not so concerned, really concerned about the objects of awareness. It can be whatever. What we're concerned about is strengthening and developing the ability of the mind to know. The knowings allow awareness to become really powerful and radiant. Also in that kind of school of Vipassana, there's something very rewarding about any moment of mindfulness. If you're really confused and scattered, you can know it, you can be aware of confusion. In that moment, there's a little bit of light. From that point of view, it doesn't matter if you sit one minute or ten minutes or ten hours, because it's just the experience right now that you're having and your ability to be mindful of it. It's rewarding in and of itself. However, as we do that, there is change. Even if we don't want change, there's change. For one thing, that mindfulness practice pulls the rug from under all the momentum in our lives of non-acceptance, which is a lot. When that momentum begins to crumble away or fall away, relax, then things start changing because we've built this kind of great structure of self based originally on this idea of something we're not going to accept. One of the things that can happen is we get settled. We settle down to ourselves. We start settling below the normal street consciousness that we're constantly distracted in and by. Then we often, as a normal surface consciousness, as surface distraction has been quieting a little bit, then we get an increasing experience of intimacy and connectedness with oneself. It can be very satisfying to have that. Some people in the daily fast enough practice, they don't look at the reward of a moment of mindfulness. They see it as a moment of mindfulness as a tool to get to that deeper state. So it's your choice. What's the purpose that you're putting mindfulness to? If you want that depth of intimacy, maybe you need to sit for 45 minutes. If you're content with a moment of mindfulness, all you need is a moment. Does that make sense? Now, the traditional way that this practice is taught in Buddhism is usually coupled together with a very strong concentration. Because we want to be able to do, actually, there is this kind of allowing awareness as part of it, but it's coupled with concentration. And the concentration comes about a little bit from kind of doing. It's kind of like coupling, allowing, with doing and learning how to balance that. Because as we get more and more settled for the concentration, then we can see more carefully. And what we can see and be mindful of and not try to change, allowing awareness, is very different when the mind is very concentrated, then the mind is very coarse. When you're very coarse, mind, what you might be aware of is simply that you feel uncomfortable, perhaps. If the mind is really still, but you see underneath that discomfort, there's a tremendous amount of fear. And if you think it's still, you might see that fear is connected to ideas you have about what you need. So, really deep-seated ideas, what you need. If you look even deeper, you might see that those ideas, what you really need, are just ideas. They have no foundation, anything except the world of ideas. You can't get this idea that, you know, I need to adapt, or that I'm this kind of way. Many people in America have this idea that they're unworthy. And from that is a whole edifice. And then if you look more deeply, you start seeing deeper and deeper aspects of our experience. And when mindfulness practice is done in a Buddhist context, like a serious retreat, the subtleness and the concentration comes along with the allowing awareness. It's kind of like the allowing awareness becomes, if you give yourself enough time and space and silence and care to hold that allowing awareness, the samadhi kind of envelops it and couples with it. And then you can start seeing levels of what makes us run and what makes us tick and levels of what is really deep in our nature in ways that are not accessible in normal street consciousness through walking about. Is this helpful at all? Yes? What you just said about many people in America feel unworthy as if it's a cultural phenomenon here as compared to elsewhere. And I wish you'd expand on that. Well, I don't think I know a lot about this. I'm not a psychologist, but it's, in my meeting with students and counseling people, meditation and all that, it's epidemic. And my pick of people I meet, and so I don't know if I should extrapolate to all the rest of the people in America, but it's the people I meet, I attract them, I guess. There's a lot of feelings of inadequacy, feelings of something fundamentally wrong with us. Before having done anything, feeling unworthy and not being deserving of things is really common. Some people trace it to Western religious ideas like original sin and guilt that nothing to do with your act. See, in Buddhism, the only reason anybody would be, from the Buddhist point of view, because Miro was an American, the only reason why you'd ever be anxious about anything was if you had done something in the past that was, that harmed someone, if you'd done transgressed in some way, stolen from a bank or punched someone out, then you feel anxious. But if you haven't done anything to transgressions, there's no reason to feel anxious about who you are. But in America, all these people are basically living good lives, and they're convinced that there's something really flawed about them, themselves. You know, something's wrong with me, I can't show people who I am, or I don't deserve, or I can't do it, or I'm an adequate, or it's really prevalent. And there's a famous story, maybe it's been told too many times, of some psychologists, Western psychologists, talking to Dali Lama, and asking him about the concept of, you know, in Tibet, in Buddhism, how he worked with feelings of unworthiness, or self-hate. And he was all doing, being done through his translator, and suddenly, he was asked this question about self-hate, or something, and unworthiness, and the Dali Lama and the translator went back and forth in Tibetan for a long time. And it seemed like a Dali Lama just didn't understand what was being asked. And finally he understood, and he started crying. And he had no idea that there could be a culture, where so many people were concerned with self-hate, and self-loathing, and self-criticism, and self-feeling of inadequacy. It's not that way in India, or... There are other issues. And... So one of the interesting points about that then, is the degree to which it is a cultural phenomena. And many of us take it very personal, it's all about me, you know, and we're kind of in this little myopic world of me, and it must be really me that's wrong. And we realize, wait a minute, it's not so personal, it seems to come with the air we breathe in this culture, for some people. Yes, please. Last week I was just doing the practice of... The question started coming up about surrounding emotion and attachment and a sort of... I guess I was wondering if you had any comments on differences, say, between kind of passion and concern, and the Christian charity kind of idea versus the compassion kind of idea, good dimension. I was wondering if the emotion seems to lead naturally and essentially to attachment. That's the thing that Buddha says, it doesn't lead naturally to attachment, it just commonly does. And the whole point of Buddha's practice is say, it doesn't lead to attachment. And we have to be very careful that when Buddhists use the word attachment, they mean clinging tight. They don't mean attachment parenting or... Often we can use it very likely in the West, you know, some music, but I'm attached to my child and my child's attached to me, just basically means there's a lot of bonding which is healthy. So, it doesn't have to be attachment, and there doesn't have to be attachment or clinging in our emotional life and our compassion, in order for us to act with passion. You can act with tremendous enthusiasm, fueled by wisdom and compassion, and get things done. One of the things that's very challenging for some people to realize is that there can be forces of motivation within us which are not based on anger, hate, greed, or lust, you know. And there are some people who defend, for example, anger because I get a lot done when I get angry. And it's nice to get a lot done, but you can get just as much done with very powerful motivation of compassion, if you can get anger and probably with a lot more benefit to others than yourself. Does that address your concern? Okay, so let's sit. So begin by taking an alert but comfortable posture, in particular letting your spine be a little bit more upright, lightening the vertebrae by pulling them up a little bit, gently closing the eyes, and then taking a few deep breaths, and as you breathe out, relaxing around that alert spine. Letting your breath return to normal. And then taking a few moments to scan your body, to see if there's any obvious places of tension or holding that you can let go of. The forehead, the eyes, and jaws. Letting the shoulders be a little bit softer. Letting the shoulder blades be a little bit heavy and settling down the back. In particular, it's useful to let the stomach be soft. Let the stomach hang forward, perhaps, so that a broader stomach makes a better foundation for the rest of your torso. And then bring an allowing awareness to your experience of being in a body. In a very generous way, just to feel your embodied experience in whatever way it shows itself. Seeing if you can relax your mind a little bit, so the body is just left alone in the field of awareness. And then within your body, as part of your body, become aware of your body's experience of breathing, your experience of inhaling, of exhaling. And when we first sit down after a busy day, there may be many thoughts and concerns that continue from the day. For the rest of your ability, put them aside. But if you can't put them aside, just let them be in the background. And bring a devoted attention to the simplicity of breathing, letting yourself become simple as you breathe in and out mindfully. Whenever you notice, your mind wanders off in thinking. Be relaxed about that. But when you notice, your wanders off in thought, let the experience of breathing return to your awareness, beginning to center your awareness in the experience of breathing. When the mind wanders off in thought repeatedly, or with strong concerns, before you let go of them and come back to the breathing, see if you can relax those thoughts' concerns. Relax any tension in the body connected to that kind of thinking. Forehead, temples, jaws, shoulders.

you can let go of all of those any thought of judgment or evaluation about the practice you can let go of and return to the simplicity of mindfully breathing in and out some strong body sensation is compelling makes it difficult to be with the breathing bring and allowing awareness to that hold it sometimes it's useful to think of awareness as being a room a very, very large room and when you meet some strong sensation in the body you're giving it lots of room just to feel it and sense it not to push it away or want it to be different it's not to push it away or want it to be different it's not to push it away or want it to be different it's not to push it away or want it to be different it's not to push it away or want it to be different it's not to push it away or want it to be

is not important, but if and when you do happen to think. Notice if that voice is soft or loud in your head, harsh or gentle, hesitant or racing ahead, kind or mean, fast, slow, or even. Calm, agitated, as if you're listening to someone else speak and you're paying attention to the tone of their voice. What can you notice about the tone of your voice as you think? It's best not to strain at this exercise, but kind of... It's best not to strain at this exercise, but it's best not to strain at this exercise. It's best not to strain at this exercise, but it's best not to strain at this exercise. And then investigate and see when thoughts and thinking arises. Are there any emotions that seem connected to your thinking? And if there are, bring in allowing awareness directly on that emotion, not to push it away or make it different, but simply to hold it there in the great realm of awareness, to see it clearly. As the thoughts pass through your head, are there any body sensations connected to that? We think hard, we frown sometimes, or we tighten the eyes or the jaws. Certain kinds of thoughts manifest as pressure, agitation, energy. Can you notice any energetic or physical aspects to the process of thinking? And then in the next couple of minutes, return again to your breathing, feeling the breath, sensing it, resting the attention there. But every time your mind wanders off in a thought or a thought arises, simply name it, thinking. Clearly see it and name it for what it is, and then return to your breathing. How easy is it for you to clearly see a thinking when thinking is occurring? Does it camouflage itself? And then notice what happens to your thoughts, your thinking, when the sitting comes to an end. Our thinking, our thoughts, maybe it doesn't need to be said, are a very important, almost central aspect of many people's lives, maybe all of our lives. And being very central for many people, they sometimes are invisible. It's kind of like we don't see the air we breathe, or supposedly a fish doesn't see the water it swims in. It's kind of like the element that we swim in often is our thinking and our thoughts. And I meet people periodically who get introduced to this practice, and they don't, they say that they never notice that they're thinking. They don't know how to notice. They're not aware of it. Somehow we're so easily pulled into the world of thinking, that it's sometimes very easy to lose ourselves in that world of thoughts. And there's no self-reflection, awareness, this is what's going on. Many people have never occurred to them, you're supposed to be, you could be aware of your thinking. Your thinking is supposed to go along merrily, happily, and long forever, whatever way it wants. And we're supposed to, and then many people identify with their thoughts, more of the common places where people either consciously or somehow semi-consciously take to be themselves is their thinking. I am what I think. I am what I, you know, I think therefore I am is the great expression. And even though some people might say, well I know that I'm not my thoughts, they operate often as if that's the case. In the sense that we often, many people believe their thoughts. It's my thought after all. You know, I'm always right. It's my opinion. There's a way in which we identify so strongly their thinking, we often take them to be not only believable or true, but often we take them to be an accurate representation of what we're thinking about. One of the little cliches or little teachings that have come down in the last 30 years in the Vipassana circles comes from an Indian teacher who once said to, maybe it was Sharon Salzburg, said something he said, thoughts of your mother are not your mother. And that helped because we often relate to our thoughts about things, how we think about things. And what we think about things is not the thing. Many of us have been in situations where we've been categorized, someone has seen us in a particular way, they have some idea of who we are, and we feel very limited by that view. We've seen as someone's spouse or seen only for our profession or seen only as the person who made that mistake once. So you know more than that. It's very easy to see how other people limit themselves by their thoughts and ideas they have about themselves. And we see, wait, there's much more to you than that. But it's very hard for us to see how we do it to ourselves, how we have these ideas and thoughts, and how it's not actually an accurate representation or image, often of what we think about. But we think, you know, that this is the way things are. Thoughts of my mother are not my mother. I remember when I was in my early 20s doing a lot of Zen practice. For some reason, I had some occasion to talk to my Zen teacher about parent-child relationships. And he said, you know, when a child growing up only knows the parent as a parent, but the parent knows themselves before they were a parent. They have a much broader understanding of who they are than the child is. And sometimes when a child, you know, gets to be an adult, it can be a little bit confusing when the parent, you know, returns to some of the other ways that they are, much broader ways that they are than just always the parents. So the thought of my mother is not my mother. The thought of what I'm thinking about is not necessarily an object of what I'm thinking about. We tend to believe our thoughts. So our thoughts often express or give word to our desires, our animosities and aversions. I like, I don't like. That person is such a person. This person is that person. This is what my needs are. And these ideas that flow through our thinking can go be quite invisible, but they can be the underlying. The phenomenal revelation is that you can let go of a thought. That you have some freaking develops an ability not to be driven by them or not to be caught by them. The image is sometimes used is that you come to a train crossing and you stand there, wait for the train to go by, and all these lagons go by of the train. And you see one that's really interesting. So you jump on and you go off you go to, where the train goes. And that's kind of how it is with thoughts. What kind of thoughts happen? And then we see a really juicy one and we jump on and off we go and it takes us a minute, 10 minutes, 10 years to get off that particular train. You get involved in our thinking. And if we don't see the fact that we're thinking, it's very easy to get caught by that and off we go. And you might think, well, isn't that the way it's supposed to be? Not necessarily. It's possible to be free. It's possible to have to see as you're thinking and have some choice about what you're doing there. It's possible to not get involved. The allowing awareness of mindfulness is an awareness that allows thoughts, but doesn't get on the train. It passes through. We don't get hooked by it. So many people have the association that meditation involves developing a silent mind. A mind with no thoughts at all. And then they get frustrated because they're thinking. In mindfulness practice, it can happen occasionally that the mind quiets so much that person doesn't feel they're thinking or they think they're not thinking and they don't notice that was a thought. But it's not necessarily the point of mindfulness practice. The point is to develop this ability to know what's happening, to see what's happening, to have the allowing awareness. And the allowing awareness is kind of nondiscursive. And you can almost say it's like a silent awareness of what's going on. So, for example, you can think and you can know that you're thinking. You can think and not know you're thinking, which is mostly the case. So that little silent knowing, oh, thinking is happening. So in mindfulness practice, in that mindfulness practice is developing this allowing awareness. It's not hooked by anything. It doesn't get involved with anything. It just sees clearly this is what's happening now. We have no idea that we need to get rid of our thoughts or stop thinking. Our thoughts are just something else that we pay attention to, that we notice. If it's just kind of light chatter, then by all means kind of just relax and let go of it and come back to your breathing. But if it's more than just light chatter, then we bring our mindfulness and see it clearly for what it is. And it's actually possible to discover our freedom while we think, not instead of thinking. So I'll talk more about that, but I thought I'd stop now and ask you what your experience was when I gave you those exercises at the end of the sitting about paying attention to various aspects of your thinking, your tone of your voice, the emotional connection, perhaps the the energetics of feeling and the bodies connected to it. What happened when you named thinking as it occurred? I'd really like to offer some reports. Please. I sort of get the idea of the thinking. I mean, I saw the thoughts, but I was wondering if my awareness was the thought itself. Being was the thought of seeing something. That there's this place that you are aware thinking is just like blood going around your body and it's just that's what it's doing and and yet how does one make a decision that needs to come from a thought. We were allowed to think. I don't really quite know how to express. Yeah. Yes, for me, a lot of times I have trouble with my decision making and I see it come up and I see the decision and the thoughts and I can be this mindful of the candy at the top. But then what do I do? How do you make a decision? Yeah, I mean, it's a thought. The thought comes up on an ice cream parlor and there's there's strawberry ice cream and there's coffee ice cream. I like them both. How do I decide which one? And then I could just say I don't want to. That's the third choice. Yeah. The fourth choice to get both. There's lots of choices. So, so, so, so the choices is a big part of it. Someone pointed out recently that that modern, especially modern and many westerners Americans have to confront more choices and decisions than anyone has ever done in the history of humankind. It used to be that you were born into a village and you knew what you were going to do for your life and what was going to happen and you'd have to choose work. You'd have to choose where to live. You didn't choose what to do that day. You didn't choose a spouse and you just did your life. It was kind of set for you and we have all these choices, you know, let alone going into the supermarket. So the question of choices is very important for us. It's a good question. So how do you make a choice? I don't know if I'm addressing your concern, but one of the interesting places to look around if a person has trouble with that is to look at the feelings that are connected to that, the indecision or feelings, the emotions connected to this decision making. Is there fear? And then maybe a person needs to look at the fear very honestly and directly before they can really come to this, some kind of better understanding of the decision, decision making abilities. I kind of, I mean, I do think of that at the time and then there's not being sure whether just to face the fear or step back from it and it just depends on my mood, you know, which way to go. So how do you decide? There's always like either or in a sense. That's right. That's right. There is. It's a big, it's a really big issue and maybe we'll talk about some other time, but I think we should get back and just focus on thoughts rather than if you don't mind. Yes, go back corner. I was just to take off a little bit on what the fellow was just saying, but to keep her on the thoughts. I noticed a similar difficulty in sometimes, you know, making decisions, but it seems to be an issue of trusting my thoughts, you know, because there's a sort of thought, emotion, desire cycle that goes on. And so when I consult those emotions, desires, and thoughts, you know, they'll tell me one thing at one time and it'll seem true. And then another thing at another time, I guess in the process of meditation, I hope that when you talk about the sort of truer self that, you know, that will emerge somewhat and, you know, the clearer decision will be apparent, you know, sometimes that happens. I think what happens as people do mindfulness practice and get deeper and touch with themselves through mindfulness, they have sources of different reference points from making decisions and places of greater integrity, places of understanding that are the causal connections between things, a deeper understanding of what values and priorities we have, a deeper understanding of our motivations in life and what's important for us. And so that gives us a whole, you know, different criteria for decision making than maybe the surface consciousness with a surface chatter we have that's maybe kind of taken in a lot of the popular voices of our culture. But I like to hear about this meditation. This particular group seems to be a little bit shy about talking about, you know, the meditation experiences. Yeah. The comment, pay attention to the topic, the voice was wonderful. So nailed it. Great. It's good. Very good to see it. In Buddhism, we say it's better to know something, even though it's uncomfortable, than to not know it and let it continue happening in the unknowing. What I did catch when you said that it was probably too much layering on of words was like, pretend it's in another language, pretend you can't get the meaning and just listen to the sound. Yeah, good. Oh, I recognize that sound. Great. I saw. Yes. I was having a very peaceful, surprisingly peaceful meditation at the start. Up until the time this Rubik's Cube appeared on my screen. I mean, literally. Do you remember the Rubik's Cube? Well, I've never been able to solve that Rubik's Cube. And suddenly, I met these my dad go from there. And I saw my hands in the Rubik's Cube and I was twisting it and turning it and I was gone. I was lost. And the next, I don't know, that happened very early in the meditation. And then when you asked about the tone of my thoughts, my thoughts were very aggressive after all. They were very directed toward certain things. And I left that Rubik's Cube way far back and went on to bigger and better things. So it became very aggressive. And one of the things I love about meditation and one of the things I've learned is that when I have those aggressive thoughts, my options in life become very limited. I'm searching constantly to, I don't know, to bring them to life. And you also asked about thinking about thinking. There were times when I could sit back and just be like, oh, there you are trying to fix that Rubik's Cube. And at the time, that was right in there. What was the difference between just noting it versus being right in it? What was the difference? It was much more peaceful to sit back and almost comical than noted. You'd be like, oh, there's that Rubik's Cube. And as opposed to being in there, we're like, Rubik's Cube. Thank you very much. Yes. When you asked about the tone, at first I could say, oh, you know, it's calm and gentle and some of those terms. And then you said, well, what would someone, tell me what would someone else look at it and see? And oh, that changed it. Then it was meddlesome and gossip. And I think both of those were true, which is kind of... Yes, please. The comments that you made about listening to the tone of useful to me too, and also brought me back to things you said earlier. For me, it was noticed some sort of sense of urgency and anxiety about, did I do the right thing? Am I going to make the right choice? Or could I have known something differently? And that's a lot of counts of sense of where my thoughts were coming from. And to realize what you said about having so many choices is an interesting thing to think of in terms of not being so anxious about not being worthy and not somehow being lost. Because I think a lot of the choices you make, it really doesn't matter because this choice is right after all. There are choices, there are moral choices that we face that are really important. And these are very things to do sometimes in a long period of time. I think all the anxiety and the culture is a very trivial thing. And to recognize that. That you can't know what they are coming. So you have to make some way back. And it's not the right thing or a long way to go. Great. Thank you very much. Yes? I had a lot of thoughts. And they had a feeling of being asleep. I don't think I was really asleep. But I would have thoughts for when I would be like waking up and going, oh, I'm sitting in a medication hall. I'm supposed to be listening to my breath or other bills. And I can't even remember what all the thoughts were about. So it really is, in a way, it's like I was asleep. But I swear I was thinking. Well, camouflaged. I have a similar experience. My thoughts were very random. They weren't dreamlike. But when I noticed that they were there after a moment, I would say, how did that come from? It was like that, waking up. But not, how did you fall over? Thank you. I saw a hand over here. Over here? Yes? It's such a wonderful question. Just to ask what the tellies are so simple on you. I've never thought about it. And I'm excited for some surprise. I haven't read a lot of meditation books. But I've read a couple. I'm surprised that I've never seen it posed in a meditation book. I think it's a wonderful question. Because when you're talking about it's, you're thinking of sometimes like the air you breathe. And you don't, you take it for granted. And you don't step back and notice your thinking. What I find is, until you pose the question, I never really stop to think about what the tone of my thinking generally is. And I don't know if you would agree. But maybe I'm generalizing from my own experience onto others. But I sort of agree that I sort of think that most of us, with exceptions, of course, but most of us most of the time, have a prevailing tone to our thinking. Because most of us are our character types of one sort or another. So anyway, I thought it was a very interesting question to step back and think, and just think about what is, what is my thinking like? What's the tone of my thinking most of the time? If you really can answer that question, it can tell you an enormous amount about yourself. And certain kinds of thoughts are different tones, different voices. And you might also ask, whose voice is that? And occasionally you might find a certain kind of common theme maybe is a certain parent's voice or someone you've internalized. It's fine to have a tone to a voice. What's important to you is the opportunities to notice it. What about when I asked about the physical sensations or the energetics or the pressure attention connected to thinking? Was that something anyone could notice? Were you so calm by that time? Yes. Well, as I was noting my thinking, I realized that I was thinking about things that had caused a lot of anxiety during the day. So the thought was going back to the anxiety. And what I noticed was a very, very tight job. It's just almost painfully tight. And I said, Oh my God, I hadn't noticed that. Where did that come from? So, and it was directly tied to that thought. Great. Anybody else see a connection between some physical sensations and their thinking? Yes. I'm extremely in sharp pain between my shoulder blades. I thought, Oh, just sitting out here with a sharp pain. But then I just, I mean, I can't imagine sitting with singing for a long time because I just started getting more agitated. My stomach started clenching. I felt like running out of your screen. It's possible to have a lot of equanimity around pain. We tend to be very reactive to physical pain. We don't want it. We hate it. We have a lot of judgments about it. We have a lot of interpretations about it. Just plain old aversion to it. And all those reactions and responses aren't actually not, are actually optional. And a lot of the process of negotiation, mindfulness with pain, is to see how they're optional and begin separating ourselves from it or letting go of it or just not letting it be the, not let it by the show. And it's possible to see the tremendous amount of pain and be very peaceful. Agitation and pain are not necessarily wedded together. So, but your experience is quite common for someone who's new to this and has never really learned to work with their pain. That's almost the natural response is to get agitated and stuff. And if you find yourself getting agitated too, you know, a lot, then you might want to just break the posture. You know, you don't want to, you know, if you can tighten yourself up in knots, then, you know, you know, lean over or shift or something. Yes? When I meditate often and particularly tonight, I feel like my body temperature becomes higher and higher. But I just feel really overheated. And on the day that we did the meditation speech of the trademarks, there we did a longer meditation. I think it was longer. And I noticed that it went up. And then it changed at some point, started coming back down, which didn't happen tonight. Tonight, it was, it kept going up to the point that I'm starting to feel something inside. Oh, sure. I've had that. Yeah. And now that other people have that, it's not uncommon. Nothing to worry about. What's interesting is for you is just to be aware of it. Oh, temperature going up. Oh, thinking about temperature going up. Oh, getting anxious, it'll never come down. Anxious, anxious. Just being nervous. That's what's going on in the present moment. Oh, you know, that's all we need to do is just be aware of what's going on and try not to get, you know, on to get on those wagon trains, you know, just let it be. But that's going to happen for a number of different reasons. The temperature can go up. Sometimes the temperature goes down a lot and people get quite cold. It's just a function of the practice and nothing to worry about. Yes, please. Okay. I'll talk more about this thing is now. So. So what I was trying to get across, one of the things I was trying to get across here to you is that there's other things to pay attention to when you think besides the content of our thoughts. Usually we're kind of that's what attracts us to our thinking is the content. What we're thinking often is really important. What we're thinking and when we focus on most, usually if we can focus in our thoughts, most people start focusing on what we're thinking about. There's other things going on in the event of thinking. It's a whole process. It's a larger event than just the content. And so there's a tone of the voice. There's the energetics connected to it. There's a physical sensations and tightening connected to it. There's the emotions that might be connected to it. There's a larger event. And one of the ways to be mindful of thoughts without being caught by them and getting involved with them is start noticing the wider field of what actually makes up a moment of thinking. And if you can connect, for example, to the physicality of it, or to the tone of it, or to the emotion connected to it, then you're not connected to the story. And the story is what is so enchanting and seductive. And you know that story, you know, how I'm gonna, what I'm going to say to so and so and what I didn't say and you know, and analyzing what happened and what's going on, planning tomorrow. So we want to bring mindfulness to thoughts. So this is how it works in practice. In mindfulness practice, we're basically emphasizing the breath as a place to develop the mindfulness and develop some calm and settledness until something else becomes compelling, makes it kind of difficult to be with the breath. When you start feeling some tension, because something else is really wanting your attention, you don't have to live with that tension. Just forget about the breath and bring your meditative awareness to that other thing that feels compelling. If it's strong for sensations in your body, develop a meditative awareness on those sensations. And there's an underscore meditative awareness, not a reactive awareness, not a judgmental awareness, just an allowing awareness that sees it clearly and begins to differentiate between the actual experience in the body and all the reactions and thoughts and interpretations that might go on in the mind. If it's an emotion that arises, then we bring in allowing awareness to the emotions if they're quite compelling. See them clearly. Feel them in the body. Let the body be the container for the emotions. Give lots of room to the emotions to be there. In meditation, we talk about giving complete permission to have wherever emotion happens to come up. Just don't dredge anything up. And once they come up, allow it to be as opposed to getting involved with it. And probably if you're novice at this, you won't see the difference. You won't see how quickly we get involved. But as you start bringing more mindfulness and attention, you start seeing all the ways in which we get involved, get hooked by it, get onto that wagon train and off we go. Now, the same thing with thoughts. When thoughts arise, and if they're just kind of wandering thoughts, we find ourselves having drifted away, then usually just relax, let go, and begin again with your breathing. It doesn't matter how many times you have to come back to your breath. Just the point is to come back, to remember to come back. However, sometimes the thinking is more compelling than that. It's not just kind of a light wandering mind that wonders off, but there's some stronger concern. If you came in here today to meditate and your boss had just fired you, probably the intensity of your thinking is a little bit stronger than if you came in here after a nice holiday and relaxed and everything looked fine in your life, when you're calm. So there's different levels of intensity of our thinking, different levels of involvement, depending on the strength of it and our involvement with it. So if you notice that it has more power, and even in one way it has more power, we keep rethinking the same thing. We can let go of it easily enough, but then two seconds later it's the same thought, same kind of thinking. Then we need to take a more careful look to it, bring more kind of attention to it. If it's a very recurring thought, then you might want to look at what is the emotion that seems to be giving the fuel to the occurrence. People who plan a lot, which is a common enough occurrence, they sit down, they close their mind, they enter into a deep, phenomenal, deep, quiet, calm, stillness, for about a tenth of a second, and then they start planning the day. Then they return to this phenomenal depth of samadhi, for this time a twentieth of a second, and then they're off planning the day again. There's a lot of planning. Often for people, there's an underlying emotion of fear, apprehension, anxiety, which is actually prompting those thoughts. No matter how many times you notice, oh planning, planning, thinking, thinking, if you don't notice the underlying factory for them, the factory will keep producing. So if you have a very recurring theme in your meditation, drop down into your body and see what is the emotion that seems to be the source of this, or the fuel for it. And then bring your meditative, allowing awareness to that. If you feel that, then there's no reason for those, usually no reason for them to produce thoughts. It's kind of like thoughts are sometimes a symptom, like a flag saying, hey you dummy, there's something that needs attention here. It's not the thoughts, it's the feeling, the anxiety, the fear. If thoughts are difficult to let go of them, they're kind of very strong and just insistent, then you want to bring a very clear mindfulness to them. Just really kind of turn your attention to them and just note thinking, thinking. It's very obvious what kind of thoughts it is. You can note planning, planning, remembering, remembering. Just call it for what it is. And really look at it clearly. And sometimes when you look at thoughts clearly, we're no longer caught by them. And that's what we're looking for in meditation, is not to be caught by something. Not necessarily to get them to go away. But if we're not caught by thoughts, they usually don't have any more fuel, because they're fueled by our involvement with them. And they kind of naturally pass away often. I make a distinction between thought and thinking. Thought is just a function of the mind. It's what the mind does, it makes thoughts. Thinking is when we get involved with those thoughts. A juicy thought comes up and they start thinking about it, all those chain associated ideas. One is leaving at the world of thought. Thought comes up, we should let it be. So part of what we're learning to do is to kind of let things be as opposed to get involved and get hooked by things. So to take a, you know, just look clearly, oh I'm thinking right now, recognize it. And we're not really interested for the purposes of meditation, about the story you're thinking about, the ideas you're thinking about. And that's very hard for some people to uncouple themselves from. It can be very important to do that. And one of the way, you know, I should maybe back up a little bit and erase what I said. Actually, there are two ways of doing mindfulness of thoughts. One is to actually pay attention to the content. And for some people it's phenomenally powerful to do that, because they had no idea that those, what they were thinking. Well, they might know the surface of their thoughts, they might know what they want. But there's subtle thoughts which kind of support the surface thoughts. And if you start paying attention to the thoughts, you might see the cognitive patterns that motivate us, that drive us, the beliefs that we have, the assumptions we have. Unexamined assumptions and beliefs about ourselves but others. So one way of doing mindfulness is to just actually look at the content. And that often will set people free, because they often unexamined, gives us a chance to reevaluate. To use mindfulness in meditation. We don't actually, normally we don't engage ourselves at all with the story or the content we're thinking about. And it can be a great relief to know you have to be involved. All we want to do is to notice that we're thinking and see that clearly enough that we're no longer hooked by it and caught up by it. We're not trying to get rid of our thoughts, but we want to see it clearly. Now one of the ways not to get caught by the story is by noticing some of the other features of thinking besides the story. To notice the tone of the voice. As soon as you might notice a certain kind of tone, you say, wait a minute. You know, is that how I want to live my life? Always with that kind of tone. It's very energetic. It's very exhausting. No wonder I have a headache at the end of the day. And maybe it's possible to relax that tone, have a quieter tone. Maybe to notice the energetics. If it's very powerful, compelling thinking, you might probably feel some kind of tension or pressure somewhere, tightening somewhere. In the forehead or in the brow or the eyes and the temples, maybe a band around the head, maybe pressure inside the brain, in the shoulders, in the neck, in the jaw, sometimes in the hands, in the stomach. Sometimes if you're very still, you can see a certain thought arises and you can see that with that comes a tightening of the stomach. The more and more subtle your mind is in meditation, the more you see that there's always a connection, the physical connection with our thoughts. Thoughts are produced out of the body. There's a physical aspect of it. With subtle thoughts, you have to be very subtle in meditation to see the energetics of it. So then we're just connecting to the bodily expression of it, how it feels in the body to have that thought. That's a way of recognizing and being there for that event, without being tripped up by the story, the content, letting go of the story making. And then to clearly see it and then name it. Just thinking, thinking, planning, planning. Sometimes a very powerful way of kind of disengaging ourselves with it. It's like using a thought to create bigger room and not be caught by it. We name it, thinking, thinking. Now on the side of paying attention to the content of our thinking, it's interesting to note what the common theme is. Because it's been my impression that for most people, one of the very common themes, maybe the most common themes, are either desire for pleasure, comfort, planning for it, wanting it, making it happen, or they're self-referential. It's about me, myself and mine, how this relates to me, what I'm going to say, what happened to me, what I'm going to do, how other people are seeing me. It's quite amazing. And you'll see this, the power of self-referential interest in this little kind of way of talking about it. If someone went around, followed me around right next to me, all day, and talked to me as much as I talked to myself, and repeated the same concerns as often as I repeated with my mind, I would be begging them if I could keep my cool, begging them, asking them, please shut up. I'd pay them to shut up. I'd be desperate after the 500th time that I planned the weekend. Don't you have anything better to do? But what's really amazing is that each time we have that thinking, usually, it's just as compelling and interesting as the first time when it's brought us in our own mind. Why is that? I think probably the juice is because we're such creatures of self-identity, of how things refer to me, what it means for me. Now, one of the most fascinating things about, well, it has to do with more deep meditation rather than what you can notice here, is that the sense or the idea that I am, I am anything, just that I am at all, is a thought. Who are you when you don't have the thought, I am? Have you thought about that? Have you felt that, discovered that? It can be quite a revelation to realize that you exist without having to think that you do, or to say I am anything. So, I hope to convey with this discussion around thoughts is how to maintain, or how to try to develop the meditative awareness in the face of thinking and thoughts. Not to think of them as the enemies of meditation or the problems of meditation, but to see them as something else to bring into awareness. One of the principles of meditation or mindfulness practice is that there's no such thing as a distraction. And for practices that focus maybe on a particular technique or developing a certain kind of concentration practice, there can be distractions to that. But in mindfulness, whatever occurs is the food for further mindfulness practice, if you notice it. So you develop this great room inside of you, this great spaciousness, this great sense of allowing, that you can actually contain and allow anything at all. The most evil thought in the world can arise, and you're not caught by it, you don't start judging it, thinking that's terrible, how could I do that? You see it, you don't act on it, you don't do anything, it just floats up. You have the most saintly thought in the world, same thing. It's really transformative to begin leaving ourselves alone, to leave ourselves radically alone. Part of the way of describing mindfulness meditation is the radical practice of leaving ourselves alone. How often do you do that? Most of us don't do it hardly at all. If we do that, we set ourselves free, and also we get to know ourselves much better. So part of all this, becoming more aware of our emotional life, our cognitive life, our embodied life, provides us an opportunity to get to know ourselves at a much deeper level than we can if we're always ignoring ourselves, not paying attention, facing ahead. It allows us a chance to settle on ourselves and be much more relaxed than you can normally be often in life. One of the surprises I still feel kind of surprised by, I shouldn't after all these years, I'm more relaxed after my morning meditation than I am after I woke up from my night's sleep. You know, sleep doesn't provide the same level of relaxation as meditation can. So there's greater intimacy and self-understanding that comes, there's greater relaxation as possible and ease. As we begin allowing ourselves to be who we are and create lots of room for that, by developing the ability to see clearly, this is what's happening now, this is what's happening now. So as we do all this, and as you study, get to know your thoughts better and see them more clearly, and it might be important to remember their little, this little saying. It's a blessing to be able to laugh at yourself because then you'll never stop being humored. It's awesome, you know, it's just amazing what the mind does. You just allow yourself to be amazed and just allow yourself to be amazed as opposed to judge it. Wow, you see what my mind did. Wow, isn't that amazing? It's kind of like if NASA sent up a probe deep into the cosmos and there they saw, actually should see with the cameras they had with them in this probe, they actually could see a thought floating in cosmic space. No one had ever seen a thought before. Has anybody seen a thought? I haven't ever seen one, right? It's like the first time, it's like, wow, the thought. And physically you can see a thought there. It would be like one of the most amazing things that humankind had ever discovered and it would be an awe. Wow, it didn't matter if it was an evil thought or a good thought, you just, wow. And here we are sitting with our thinking, thinking whatever you do, thinking about pizza and Wednesday they'll stop talking or whatever we're thinking. And you know something? That particular thought involved is a pinnacle of five billion years of evolution. That moment is a pinnacle of five billion years of evolution. Five billion years of evolution comes down to this feeling of inadequacy, this feeling of self-pride. Shouldn't you just be astounded in awe? I saw the photograph in the paper today of the Tyrannosaurus Rex in Chicago. So did you see it? That was kind of an awe. When's the last time you went awe that the evolution has produced this thought about pizza? So enjoy. The whole point is to have more enjoyment, enjoy. So I talked a lot today, so we won't have our second meditation and maybe we'll make up for it next week. We have the last class. Yes? Last week was my first week here. You talked to Allison and these tapes are available, what you missed. So thank you. If you have any more questions, please stay behind and come and talk. Available.
