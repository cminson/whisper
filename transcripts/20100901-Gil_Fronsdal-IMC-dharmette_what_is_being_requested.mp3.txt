Dharmette: What is Being Requested?

An interesting perspective on our human life, is that 
what human beings a re always doing is responding. 
We’re a lways responding to something. Even if we don’t 
respond, we’re responding. If we don’t do anything, 
that’s a response. If we do something, that’s a 
response. The way we’re built is to always be in 
relationship to the world we live in . And the question is:  
“How are we relating at any given time? What’s the 
relationship we’re in right now? What’s the relationship 
we’re forming now? ”  
 
If something beautiful and wonderful happens , then 
perhaps we respond by  reaching out and taking it, 
wanting more of it, or en tering into it. Or if something 
unfortunate and uncomfortable happens, the response 
is to pull back. Or if you practice mindfulness , then 
maybe you’ve lea rned that one response would be  to 
neither go forward nor back , but just be present  – and 
that’s a res ponse. Perhaps i t looks like you’re not 
responding, but it’s a re sponse just to be there, acting – 
and you’re acting with presence.  
 
We’re responding to every situation we’re in . And part of what we do in Buddhist practice is to have some choice, 
to be conscious of the choices we make  in how we 
respond , so we’re not acting on automatic pilot. Many 
times people’s reactions or responses to the wo rld are 
from automatic , built-in habits, biases, o r prejudices. 
These habits  kick in , and we end up saying and doing 
things we regret later because we weren’t so conscious 
about it.  
 
A lot of our values come into play in how we relate and 
how we respond. For s ome people, their default is to 
always engage : they attack, get angry, or grab . Some 
people’s default response is to withdraw , get quiet, 
staying undemonstrative and  not reveal ing who they 
are. There are  many  different ways of responding .  As 
we become more mindful, we start to see  where we 
have a choice in the response.  
 
If you live a busy, frazzled life, and things are going very 
fast, your mind’s also going very fast . You can’t notice 
all the unconscious and subconscious choices you’re 
making . But if you slow down, or if the min dfulness get s 
stronger, then you see that there are  more choice s. And 
if there‘s  more choice , then there’s more freedom. 
Freedom and choice go close ly together. You’re not free 
if you can’t make choices. But if you can make choices , 
then you have more free dom. You might not act on 
those choices , but still you have more  possibilities for 
freedom .   
How do you respond to the different things that arise?  
 
Some of our responses  weigh us down. Some lighten 
us up. One way to be  weighed down is to respond to the 
past. The past is gone, b ut many people think about the 
past. They respond to  the past by think ing about it a lot, 
review ing it, repeat ing past conversations, coming  up 
with better rej oinders, better responses in that past, or 
they doubt themselves, or feel bad about themselves. 
Guilt is a classic response of being weighed down by 
the past. Something has happened , and the response is 
to stay dwelling on it,  caught in it, and weighed down by 
it. 
 
Other responses lighte n us up, rather  than weigh ing us 
down . Buddhism encourages us t o be forward -looking 
rather than backward -looking. So what’s the response 
looking  forward about how I can do better in the future? 
Rather than be ing weighed down by the guilt, by the 
despair, by what’s happen ed, we look back just enough 
to learn from the past , and then respond by looking 
forward into the future . How can I do better? That’s 
meant to be a bit more empowering. What can I do 
here? How can I improve myself? How can I improve 
the situation I’m in? H ow can I be more help ful? The  
idea here is of stepping forward into our life , as opposed 
to stepping back into the past.  
 How do we respond? Do we have a response that 
keeps us from going  forward into the future, o r a 
response that keeps us from acting?  Or do we have a 
response that allows us to act and to respond in the 
world?  
 
A very interesting issue is : What are you responding to? 
Or what’s prompting your response to any given 
situation you’re in? Are you responding based on selfish 
ideas, selfish concerns, what I want, what’s in it for me, 
myself or mine? Or are you responding to the situation 
out there  where  someone needs help , so that you ’ll step 
forward and help that person?  
 
With a ny situation we find ourselves in, part of the task 
is to understand the situation as best we can, breaking 
down the barriers betw een self and other – but not to do 
away with them. What I mean by breaking them down is 
to be able to pay atten tion equally to the situation 
around us  and to ourselves here – not one or the other. 
And then find out what’s the appropriate response? 
What’s needed in this situation? What’s needed of me? 
What’s this situation calling on me to do?  
 
Some people like the expression, “What’s the request? ” 
What am I being requested to do here? What’s  the 
request of the situation – rather  than what do I want  
from the situation, or w hat’s in it for me? What’s being 
requested in this situation? And how do I respond to that request?  
 
Some people live their life as if  they’re always tuning 
into the  request of the moment. They  find this very 
helpful because it breaks open the idea that it’s all about 
me. It’s not all about what I want and what I demand. It’s 
more : “What’s the request? What’s being asked of me in 
this situation? ” 
 
In Buddhism the metaphor for spiritual practice is that of 
walking on a path. The idea of walking on a path is that 
you have to do it , and it’s forward moving. You’re 
walking down the path. So the idea of responding and 
being forward -looking, engaging, stepping into acting , is 
a big part of Buddhist practice – even if what we’re 
doing looks like non -doing. That’s a response to o. 
That’s the request at the moment.  
 
What is the request of the moment? If the request is, 
“Don’t do anything,” j ust listen and get to know it better. 
What’s the request of the moment? What’s the 
response in this situation? Oh , it’s to go and offer my 
friend tea.  
 
I offer you these reflections with the suggestion that to 
carry  this question with you – “What ’s the app ropriate 
response? Or what’s being requested in this situation? ” 
– is a great question to have.  
 Go into any new situation and say, “What’s being 
requested here?”  “What’s the appropriate response 
here?”  To have that question  pauses the automatic 
momentum  of the mind wantin g, and doing , and being 
up to it s own devices . It gives the mind a chance to stop 
and notice, “ What’s going on here ?” – to open up the 
mindfulness. What is the situation I’m in? When we can 
be more attentive to the situation we are in, then 
perhaps  we can find the most appropriate response for 
that situation given  its time and place.  
 
I hope that makes sense , and if it didn’t make sense , 
then you get to respond accordingly. How do  you 
respond to that?
