Saddhā (5 of 5): Acceptance + Q&A  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 20, 2020  
 
 
I am going to continue with this series of short talks on 
the subject of faith, the Pali word saddhā . Today ’s talk is 
on the fifth aspect of faith : acceptance. Acceptance is 
not a practice for beginners , but rather for those whose  
practice is much more developed . There comes a  time 
when some deep level of acceptance characterizes our 
faith.  
 
This week there has been a progression i n the way I’ve 
been offering the se talks. The Buddha’s teachings often 
follow a progressive path of practice. It is organized by 
different depths of where we can go in practice. We 
don’t necessarily have to follow that  path linear ly. 
People can jump around, go backwards, in a spiral, and 
their practice still becomes  stronger and stronger.  
 
The journey this week begins with the initial idea of 
faith, which  inspires us to start the practice. Then 
confidence gives strength to the beginning of our 
practice , when  we believe in it, value it, and think it ’s 
possible. We believe in ourselves , and have confidence 
in what we are doing  – so we can put ourselves into it. 
Then a s we start practicing , getting feedback from the practice,  and feeling some benefit from it, comes a 
growing conviction that this really works  – that this is 
valuable and important . With this strong con viction , we 
can give ourselves more confidently to the practice . And 
at some point, we begin to experience something that 
we trust. It isn’t just our effort s happening here  – in 
Buddhist language, the Dharma  is happening . The 
practice is practicing us.  
 
As we put ourselves into  the practice , or into  the 
Dharma , forces are released and opened . Conditions 
come together that allow something to begin unfolding  – 
and this is no  longer  our doing. We don’t make it 
happen . We enable it to happen ; we are the condition 
for it. At some point,  trusting this deeper movement of 
the Dharma  working  through us becomes relevant. 
Then, as the practice develops and moves through us, 
we have a stronger and stronger sense that we don’t 
have to go back to the old patterns of attachment, 
greed, and conceit. There is a whole different way of 
living our life.  
 
Then comes a deep acceptance of the underlying truths 
of reality and of our life. In ordinary life , this may seem  
counterintuitive. For example, there is a dee p 
acceptance of not basing one’s life on me, myself, and 
mine  – not basing one’s life on the small ego, the small 
sense of identification with, and contraction around  me, 
myself, and mine.   
That we don’t base our life on this is not a denial of 
ourselves. It is actually the opposite. When we base our 
life too much on the conceit of me, myself, and mine , 
paradoxically it’s a way of denying ourselves, limiting 
our lives, and cutting ourselves of f from the wider field 
of who we are  and what moves through us . When we  
accept that there is much more than the usual 
understanding of self, to have an appreciation of what in 
Buddhism is called “not -self” – at some point there is a 
deep  acceptance: “ Oh, t his is true ; this is right .” We get 
out of our own way , so that th is acceptance can allow 
something to flow through us.  
 
There is deeper acceptance of the impermanence of 
phenomena  – the impermanence and inconstancy of 
life. And  sooner or later we change, grow old, and die. 
There is a  deep acceptance that it’s a completely 
natural part of life that we would participate in the 
chang ing, flowing nature of birth , death , and the passing 
of things . Rather than resisting it, or holding  on hard to 
life, or being afraid, there is deep acceptance  of and 
trust in this natural flow of the life going through us, and 
which we are part of.  
 
There is also a deep acceptance of what is sometimes 
called , “the patient acceptance of the emptiness of  all 
phenomena. ” Acceptance that all things are not really 
substantial in a particular way. They are not substantial as something we can  cling to. The Buddha said, 
“Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to.” To have a 
deep acceptance that , “Yes,  this is tru e!” is definitely 
counterintuitive for many of us.  
 
Clinging is so deeply ingrained in us . It is how we know 
to be safe, how we know how to get what we want. 
Sometimes clinging has worked. Sometimes people 
accommodate our clinging . We cling enough to some  
people , and they want to take care of us. Or we chase 
certain desires , and sometimes we get them. But there 
is a cost. And it’s certainly a cost that separates us from 
our innate potential for freedom  – from the deep peace 
and happiness of freedom  that come s from a profound  
trust in  and acceptance of  life as it is .  
 
I think  that the deepest form of acceptance, trust, and 
faith does not have an object. It is trust without an object 
of trust. That may be illogical , but just to be alive and 
free – to have trust and acceptance – is not about a 
thing  we are trusting. If it’s anyt hing, it’s trusting in not 
clinging.  It’s trusting in not holding on. The absence of 
clinging is not a thing.  
 
A beautiful way I understand this is that when trust and 
acceptance are deep, other people might think you are 
very accepting, or at peace. But if you look in side 
yourself, you don’t find that , because at some point, 
acceptance and trust are not  something we do, not something to see. It’s like two people who are in difficult 
circumstances. From the outside, both look very patient. 
The first person is really triggered, reactive , and upset 
about what is happening , but works hard to relax and 
not get caught in the reactivity , and is  able to be 
relatively calm in their demeanor. People see that 
person as calm and patient. The other person in the 
same trying situation is not triggered , has no reactivity , 
and doesn’t have to work at being patient. In fact, 
patience is not needed. It doe sn’t exist for that person , 
because there is no necessity for it. Patience in that 
situation is not something a person is doing, even 
though  that’s what others might interpret.  
 
In the same way, as our practice gets deeper, as our 
freedom becomes larger a nd larger, as our trust, faith, 
confidence, conviction, and our deep acceptance of life 
become fuller and fuller  – it stops being something we 
do. It stops being something we can identify  with.  
 
To accept this emptiness, this absence of what ha d 
been supporting us for such a long time , is a beautiful 
thing. It matures when there is no more need for faith  – 
when there is no need for confidence , conviction, trust, 
or acceptance – because we don’t cling to anything. We 
are at peace. We are at ease. There is no reactivity.  
 
People might see you and say, “Oh, that is a person of 
faith. That person has a lot of trust , conviction, or acceptance .” But if you look inside yourself, you won’t 
find those things. What you will find is your freedom.  
 
May faith  support you , and take you all the way to a 
place of freedom from all clinging , so that you can 
experience deep happiness and well -being  – not just for 
yourself , but as a gift to others.  
 
May all beings be happy. Thank you.  
 
 
Q&A  
 
Gil: I’d like to have some interaction with the YouTube 
audience , and see if there are questions  anyone might 
have.  
 
Participant 1 : It feels a bit off to wish for all beings to be 
happy when some people are in pain and in very difficult 
circumstances.  
 
Gil: Classically, when we do this mettā  aspiration or 
expression of good will, it can also be more specific. It 
can be : “May all peop le be safe. May people be free of 
affliction. May people have ease with whatever their 
circumstances  might be .”  
 
When I say , “May all beings be happy,” it is really an 
umbrella term for them to have a greater sense of well -being. It’s an expression of my good will, that I care. 
How exactly my wish will make a difference for the 
world, I don’t know. When I do these dedications of 
merit or mettā , I often like to reflect practically : “How I 
can actually do things that make the li ves of others 
somewhat better ?”  
 
If the people I am with are sick , in pain , or have some 
challenge, then when I think about it, I ask: “How in 
small or big ways I can make their life a little bit better ?” 
But in shorthand , that means helping them become 
happy.  
 
Participant 2 : How do  I deal with fear during these 
times  when people are afraid of getting the virus?  
 
Gil: There are a variety of ways to work with fear of the 
current illness that is spreading. For some people, one 
can be to do a little reading from reputable sources on 
what this virus is all about – how to care for ourselves, 
what to expect from it. Put it in  a context that doesn’t 
make it a big monster. It is certainly a challenge for all of 
us, something to take seriously, to protect ourselves 
from. But I think that sometimes the imagination gets 
triggered by the media, the news , or by our own ideas . 
So be r eflective and wise about what is actually going 
on, and how to take care of yoursel f.  
 
I find it meaningful to have confidence that I am doing the best I can , given the circumstances. Then, come 
what may ! If I get sick, then I’ll do the best I can with 
that. If I am going to die from this illness, I’ll do the best I 
can with that. I am supported so much by this practice – 
by what I have faith , confidence , and conviction  in – and 
the trust and acceptance  I have . It’s so powerfully 
connected to Dharma  practice. I trust mindfulness. I 
trust the path. I trust non -clinging probably more than 
anything else.  
 
Even if I were going to die, that is the time for practice. I 
hope I trust the practice then. I feel that my years of 
meditation have really taught me that even dying is an 
opportunity. Even dying is a time when I don’t have to 
succumb to my clinging , or lose touch with my 
confidence and my strength to keep practicing. Keep 
practicing.  
 
That said, fear is a very common phenomenon. It can 
be quite devastatin g and difficult to live with. I think that 
anyone who practices mindfulness for any length of time 
should expect that sooner or later , fear will take center 
stage in their practice. Part of what we want to do , in an 
appropriate, careful, gradual way , is to study  our fear  – 
get to understand it, know it , and learn how to work with 
it.  
 
One important way fo r me to work with fear is to feel it in 
my body. Where is the fear living in my body? One reason th is is so helpful is that wh en I get into trouble 
with fear , it has been with the stories I make in my 
imagination. They  can be quite vivid . And telling mysel f 
the same story over and over again reinforc es the fear.  
 
The physical experience of fear is not a story. It is just a 
physical manifestation of it. When I can feel it in my 
body, it’s easier to  just tap into it gently  and lovingly . I 
have the idea of holding my fear in the cupped hands of 
my awareness. As I hold the fear , and am present for it 
in my body – feeling the sensations , the butterflies , the 
tightness, the tension – I’m just holding it gently with the 
idea that I am here to help my fear feel s afe.  
 
Rather than having fear be a problem , the bogeyman,  or 
something unwanted to be pushed away, I imagine the 
fear almost like a person who wants me to be a safe, 
calm presence . They  will be there , sit with me, and 
listen. For a frightened person to be  accompanied , and 
have someone sit next to them and hear them , it can 
really help settle them. It can quiet them and soften the 
grip of fear. We can do that for ourselves by learning to 
identify where the fear is in the body, bring ing our 
attention to it, and holding it there. Then we can 
experiment with ways we can help our fear feel safe . Let 
it know it’s ok for it to be there right now. It’s okay for it 
to exist and be felt.  
 
That is the great mantra for fear: “It’s ok. ” Holding fear and letting it feel  safe is an alternative to being swept 
away in the fear, being pre occupied , and caught with it. 
It does require a certain degree of strength to find a way 
to be with it and hold it.  
 
As soon as it feels as if it is too much, then it’s important 
to step away, to go for a walk, go talk to a friend . Do 
something else  until you feel stable enough to come 
back and do this same thing over and over again.  
 
In the path of mindfulness, slowly over time, you learn to 
have tremendous capacity to be free while  being 
present for the fear.  I hope that is helpful.   
 
Participant 3 : I am confused about the difference 
between devotion to practice and clinging.  
 
Gil: That’s a nice question. Maybe sometimes they look 
the same, so it makes sense to be a little confused. If 
the clinging is just a little bit, maybe it’s ok to have some  
clinging . We can’t just expect to hear some Buddhist 
teachings , and then not ever cling again , or be able to 
turn it off right away. Even though Buddhism talks a lot 
about the value  of non-clinging, it’s not a crime to cling. 
If we cling, w e don’t have to feel we are a bad person , 
or we are doing it wrong. It’s just painful if we cling.  
 
And if we don’t want to have that pain, then we want to 
find another way. We want to be careful not to be too negative about clinging, even though the path is to  the 
freedom from clinging . If, within reason, you’re a little 
more relaxed , then if you are mindful, the path is self -
correcting. When the time comes to recognize that 
clinging is a limitati on, mindfulness will show you when 
that is.  
 
So, if there is some clinging with the devotion, sooner or 
later you will feel it and work through it. But you don’t 
have to be ahead of yourself. Wait until that time comes. 
If you have some inkling of clingin g, it might not be a 
good time to look at it  – maybe later.  
 
With a strong devotion to practice or to Buddhism, if you 
have a good friend whom you trust, you might ask them  
if your devotion is a problem for anyone. Does anyone 
think you are overdoing it, becoming a zealot or 
something? Sometimes feedback from someone else is 
good. If they tell you there’s no problem, then just 
continue , and don’t worry about the clinging  – until 
mindfulness flushes it out. If your friend says , “You are a 
little bit difficult these days , because all you ever talk 
about is what you’re devoted to, ” then maybe there is 
clinging , and maybe you should stop and take a good 
look.  
 
Clinging always in volves contraction, tightness, or 
discomfort. But d evotion, in its essence, is something 
that is open  and relaxing. It brings a sense of ease , peace , or well -being. It’s like the difference between 
feeling openhearted love and a “Yes” to what is going 
on, versus  having neediness , or wanting  to possess 
something.  
 
That is what occurs to me. If the question comes 
because you have devotion, then appreciate and value 
that. Attend carefully to the seedling of devotion , so that 
it can grow and develop to become a support for you.  
 
Thank you, everyone. I hope that these sittings are nice 
for you. It is certainly nice for me to come here, sit and 
share in this way. I hope that you have a quiet, 
reflective, and peaceful weekend.
