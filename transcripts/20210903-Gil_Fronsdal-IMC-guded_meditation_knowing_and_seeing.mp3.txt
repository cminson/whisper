 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So, we've come to the end of this week, this series on patience. And patience is often a wonderful gift that we give to ourselves and to the world. Because when the alternative to patience is not so healthy or beneficial for us or for others. And so for this morning meditation, I want to mention that in this ancient teachings of the Buddha, he puts an emphasis on knowledge and vision. And I'll try and say this is knowing and seeing. And I'll explain this for this meditation as the simple patient knowing of what's obvious in the experience. What's obvious with the breathing as we focus on the breathing. Just knowing. And then taking patient time to perceive that, to sense it, to let it register the experience that you've known. So in a sense you recognize it, you know what it's there, there's a simple, very simple recognition. It doesn't have to be with words. It could just be kind of a silent knowing. But when something is known, then take a brief time to let it register more fully, really experience what that is more deeply. And for something that's passing quickly like the inhale, it's just a fleeting moment maybe to really register something. If it lingers a little bit longer, it doesn't have to be more than a second or two. It's easy going, relaxed, and the patience is there with that seeing, with the registering, allowing it to be there. And it's not literally what I'm about to say, but it's the spirit of it. And that is as if you have all the time in the world. Not literally because you don't linger so long and you start thinking about it. But as long as there's kind of a deeper silent recognition, silent registering, seeing, perceiving, sensing, stay there, let it sink in if it's still there. And then know the next thing. So know the inhale and let that be registered and feel it. Then know the exhale, know the beginning of it, and then let feel and register that more fully, that experience of exhaling. If there's a pause after the exhale, know it and allow yourself to let that register or take it in or feel that experience in some way. So there's knowing and then there's Buddha's language, seeing. But seeing applies to all the inner ways of perception, of feeling, sensing that goes on. So assuming a meditation posture, one that allows you to have a certain alertness, but also one in which you're going to be patient. You're settling in for the long term just to be with what's here, whatever it might be. Not fighting it or resisting it or fixing anything, but a posture that allows you to be present with some alertness or clarity. And then gently close your eyes or gently lower your gaze. And taking a breath or two just to relax into your body, soften in the body. Relaxing into the body might give you access to more of your body to feel and sense as you now take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Almost as if you're getting a massage from the inside out. Feel the ribcages expand. Maybe the shoulders rise. Maybe the belly balloons out. Maybe as you breathe in, there's an increased pressure on the sitting bones. Or if you're laying down, increased pressure on the back ribcage. Or if you're sitting in a chair, you might feel the back ribcage too. And then letting the breathing return to normal. And then take three or four breaths to relax in your body on the exhale. And then to settle into your breathing. Feeling the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. Sensing or feeling the body's experience of breathing, the sensations in the body as you breathe, the movements. And as you inhale, know the inhale. Let the allow the inhale to be known. And then let that experience register more deeply, almost like a physical registering as you sense or feel what you now know. And as you exhale, know the energy of the body. And then as you exhale, know the exhale. And in a receptive mode, as if the body is receiving the sensations, let the experience of exhale be felt, sensed. The exhale is known and felt. Seeing if you can be infinitely patient with this process of knowing and then silently feeling and sensing what is known. And so there's a rhythm of knowing and sensing and a rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. A rhythm that you feel and sense, participate in with lots of patience, knowing and feeling, knowing and registering quietly, calmly. And if there's a lot of thinking, know that is happening and silently register how that feels in your body, your mind to be thinking. The sensations, not what you're thinking about, but what the process of thinking feels, senses, know it and sense it. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. It's quite valuable to learn the art of staying close to knowing and feeling, knowing and sensing, knowing and letting things register more deeply. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then begin again with your breathing. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, this practice of knowing and sensing, knowing and seeing, knowing and letting things be registered more fully, can be done outward into the world that we live in, to know the joys and the sorrows of this world, and to really know it and then take patient time to let it register, to let ourselves feel it, to be a witness to what's happening in the world so that we're touched by it. And to be touched by the world, be a witness to what's happening in the world, to witness it with our hearts, is an expression of this practice. It's supported by our patience. And it becomes a gift if we can then care for the world, each in our own individual way, to live a life of knowing and seeing, knowing and feeling, and then caring, knowing, feeling, caring. And this doesn't have to be dramatic. It could be an expression of our own unique agency and abilities and situation. It might be with the people around us. May this practice that we do support us to live for the welfare and happiness of the whole world, including ourselves. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free of suffering, challenges, oppression. And may we contribute to that possibility.
