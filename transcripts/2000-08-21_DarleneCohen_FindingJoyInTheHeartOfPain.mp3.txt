 So you can hear me now? Do I sound electrified, magnified? That's just a piece of cordial. Oh, okay. So I should speak loudly. Okay. Well, tonight I'd like to talk about mundane anguish. This is the suffering that we have every day. It's no big deal. We just have it day in and day out. It's nothing special or particular. We suffer with our bodies every day, and you don't have to have rheumatoid arthritis like I do, or have been in an auto accident to have this concern with your body, or to have pain. It's everybody. Everybody suffers when they have a human body. And it's not just having pain, which is relatively ephemeral, but it's we worry about our bodies. Especially as we get older, we worry about what's going to happen to them and to us as a result. It doesn't even take specific loss to experience mundane anguish. We human beings suffer just because things change all the time. Having once achieved some goals, we can't rest on our laurels at all. All of life's circumstances are dynamic, always evolving into something else. So we clutch its security in vain. As Smita mentioned, I have just had a book published which has my current thinking about pain and pleasure. The talk I'm going to give tonight is from various points and stories that are in the book. If you've actually read the book, I apologize for my relentlessness. You should feel free to just count your breasts as I talk. So I've had rheumatoid arthritis, which is a very painful and crippling disease for about 23 years. And it began in my seventh year of Zen practice when I was living at Green Gulch Farm, which is a part of the San Francisco Zen Center. And when I was first very ill, I was an invalid in bed for many months, maybe almost a year or so, and other Zen students took care of me. I didn't realize it then, but I was very lucky that other Zen students took care of me. That's very nice that they did that. Cleaned my room, washed my hair. But the downside of having lots of people take care of you is when you're in a situation like that, people give you lots of advice. And my doctor, with all of society's authority behind him, advised me to take toxic drugs. I was given rice bread to eat instead of wheat by my friends. I was wrapped in comfrey-soaked sheets several times a week, and I must have taken extract from every benevolent plant that grows in California and China. But I got worse despite all this loving care, and my mobility became so impaired that people at Zen Center began doing everything for me. Doing my laundry, washing my hair, taking care of my two-year-old son and my dog. And because of my pain and my extreme weakness, even just changing my posture was a very dramatic event. I needed to heed every little sensation in my knees and feet just to go from a sitting to a standing position. And getting out of my bed and going to the bathroom took the same kind of careful attention and focus that you would do if you were going on a safari. So, as it turned out, though, my Zen meditation training was a very great help to me at this time. Because I've been taught to study the objects of consciousness. Feelings, perceptions, sensations, thoughts, and in long periods of Zazen, like sashines, you know, five or seven days, I've even become still enough in a length of time like that to even watch my perceptions as they were being formed. So, this is, of course, the business of Zen meditation and all different kinds of meditation, is to observe all these things. You simply focus your attention on what's happening to you right now, your immediate experience of your body, your sensations, your thoughts, your sense impressions. The stream of your consciousness. You just focus on all that at once. And there's no goal involved. You just do this for its own sake. And there's only then the relentless, implacable present. Of course, the present moment is not usually where people in pain want to hang out. I work with people now who have degenerative diseases, arthritis, MS, and stroke. And many of them have constant unremitting pain along with their diseases. And they say to me, now, why would I want to be aware in the present moment with my pain? It hurts too much. I'd rather distract myself. So, maybe the bottom line answer to this kind of question is that if you develop a strategy to deal with pain that rests on merely distracting yourself, it doesn't work in the long run. Maybe you can deny or distract yourself for a short time, hours or days or even weeks. In fact, I highly recommend denial as a way to deal with pain short term. But long term, it carries a pretty high price. Now, short term, denial can get you through a crisis that you have a deadline to meet and you can't bother with what's happening to you now. So, you can go into denial then, get through that deadline, and also denial helps us accept over a long term some terrible situation, a diagnosis of cancer or the loss of a loved one, so that we can gradually face the situation over time. We look and go, eek, and look back, eek, then look back, eek, and enough time goes by, enough eking, enough looking, and we gradually can accept the situation and what it calls for. So, denial is very useful short term, but if you deny your pain and your suffering for a long time, you begin to exist on a bleak tundra of life. You have a very narrow band of consciousness. Because in order to maintain the denial, you can't accept information up from your gut and you can't accept information from the outside, friends who are concerned for just various feedback that you get, even from strangers on the street, can I help you with that? Oh no, no, it's nothing. Your friends, you've been looking a little pale lately, it's nothing. So, you can't open yourself to any information, so you begin to exist on a very narrow band of consciousness. In order to stay in denial, you have to turn away from all incoming information. So, your consciousness gets very narrow and you continue your life on one level. And usually what people choose to do to maintain that one level is to function, to do tasks. You know, they have to-do lists and they check them off and they feel like, okay, this is okay, but that's only one level of consciousness. If you live that way, there's no richness of feeling. There's not much feeling at all except that little momentary relief when you finish a task, but then there's the next one on the list. So, it's not a real life to live that way. And it's basically the same with distraction, which I think of as a kind of short-term or a more superficial variation on denial. Now, you can distract yourself from the pain of a toothache or from a disappointment, but if you're dealing with heavier stuff, with chronic pain or grief, deep grief, somewhere in your being, you're registering your suffering. And in order to distract yourself successfully, you have to turn away again and again from the part of you that registers the suffering. Again, you have to live on a very superficial level to maintain the ability to distract yourself with tasks or TV for hours on end. And this is not, by the way, an unreasonable decision to make. I don't blame people for turning away from pain, from turning away from a catastrophe. It's very difficult to settle in to suffering that deep. In fact, people say to me, what a gift my arthritis, my pain has been to me because it's taught me so much patience and compassion. But I actually resent being told that my pain has been a gift. I don't feel that it's been a gift in any way. In fact, what actually happened is that I was in terrible pain and despair from this disease. And so I just made good use of it. Since it was already there, I just plowed it under. I just made good use of it. That's all. Actually, given the choice, I'd rather be superficial. So it seems to me that one of life's most challenging aspects for all of us is how do we deal with the amount of pain and stress that we have in our lives. And what role does awareness have in these circumstances? Doesn't it only increase your immediate suffering? And of course it does. This is why developing the stability cultivated by a formal meditation practice is so important. You need to be very grounded to allow enormous amount of suffering to enter your body, to be perceived by you as suffering, and then to pass out, to let it pass out of you. If you block the suffering that you have or that the person in front of you has, if you're a health care worker, a social worker, a psychologist, any of the helping professions, if you block that suffering, then you're of no use to anyone. If you just keep it out here and not register it, then you're not any use to anybody. It's most helpful to feel suffering and let it pass through you, not sticking anywhere. And I think what meditation and mindfulness do for us is they make the weave of our bodies wider so that suffering can enter in and pass through without sticking anywhere. That is, awareness without judgment can just enter and pass through. It makes the openings in our bodies large enough to accommodate enormous amounts of suffering. Then the suffering can come in, be registered, and pass out, leaving no trace. The suffering is burned up completely the moment it's felt, felt deeply. And when I do this in my own body, when I'm able to do this with my own clients, in my own body, it feels like my tissues, there's so much space between my tissues that it seems like the fibers of my body must resemble those imperfect potholders that kindergartners make in class, you know, where the weave is all askew and great big gaps between my own body and my own. And that's what's happening between the different fibers. So one reason to stay in unbearable situations is that you can't allow the suffering to pass through unless you're paying lots of attention, unless you're vibrating with the suffering, pulsating with the suffering, with the waves of suffering that wash over you and come into you. You're aware of your own breathing, usually faster in situations like that, and you're grounded by the breathing. You're aware of your heartbeat. You're aware of the clutching, the tightening of your chest. I'm describing my physical sensations when faced with enormous amounts of suffering that I see or hear. So tightness in the chest, tightness in the diaphragm, it's registering all up and down the front of my body. And the sense impressions, you know, they start to fade a little because the visceral impressions are so strong, the emotions registering in my body. So when you are like this, you settle. If you do formal meditation practice and you practice this, you can settle into emotional breath. You can settle into emotional heartbeat, emotional body. And all of this physical settling into these sensations make it easier to settle into emotional mind, the mind that's reeling with fear and projection because of what you're witnessing. And when we suffer deeply and we have the stability to register our suffering, we know what suffering is costing us. Then we can cultivate some kind of comfort for ourselves as a way of allowing ourselves to be with suffering. Many people think, well, I should get strong enough to suffer, strong enough to suffer, and think that that is some kind of grit, some kind of... But the way I see it is you're so aware of your suffering and the emotional pain and loss that you understand that you need comfort. You're quite ready to comfort yourself, quite ready to provide pleasure and succor, nourishment for yourself because of the amount of pain that you know that you've been absorbing. And one way to comfort yourself is through other people. Other people's responses can often comfort us. Sometimes just at the simple level of interrupting our pain. You know, everybody knows how this works. You can have some problem, relatively superficial or deep, and you can just say even to a co-worker, not even to a close friend, they notice something wrong with your aura or your mood. Oh, is anything wrong? Oh, yes. You know, such and such happened. You know, giving them a very brief, you don't want to go into it. And they say, oh, oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You know, I've sometimes felt that way myself or whatever. And just that simple exchange can interrupt the kind of flow of your snit. You know, it just comes in there. You know how that works. Well, in the early days of my arthritis suffering, when I was just beginning to get out of bed, my pain level was at its worst in the morning when I woke up. And when I would get up out of bed and go down the long hall to the bathroom, it was excruciating to get up and put weight on my knees and hips and feet. And so my first trip down the hallway in the morning was an ordeal. I was in such pain, I moaned and complained the whole way. I would call on Mother Mary, whom I adored as a child, and my own dead mother, call on them for mercy, to comfort me, to how could they desert me, how could they betray me. And sometimes I just moaned to express my anguish. Well, finally my husband and young son complained to me about this. Well, you can imagine how long it took them to actually object to this. I mean, I think it's very hard to tell a suffering person that they're bothering you. But I also think if you live in a situation like that, you have to get into it. You have to get in the mix with the person. You can't cut them off and pretend it's not happening. Or say, oh, well, they deserve to moan, I'll just be over here. You have to interact if you live with someone like this. Anyway, my husband said it was a horrible start to his day to hear me do this. And my little boy, who was then about eight, he said, Mommy, I know you hurt so bad and I can't help you. And of course it broke my heart to hear him talk this way. But I couldn't just give up my moaning and complaining. I felt like it helped me to bear the bearable and the unbearable. I felt like I just wouldn't be able to stand it if I wasn't able to express my pain. So I said, I'm sorry, I just can't give it up. What will we do? My husband had a brilliant idea. He said, why don't we try answering you when you're moaning down the hall? That way at least we'll be included rather than just listening to you suffer like that and feeling helpless. So from then on, whenever I walked down the hall in the morning groaning and crying out, I would hear answers, sympathetic answers. Like I would go, ohhh ho ho ho ho ho. And then my husband would go, ohhh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. go, uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh. So we could actually have some kind of conversation, and then my little boy would just go, uh-huh-huh-huh. You know, just wanting to be included, just, you know, making some noise, and I would bellow back at him. So day after day, our entire household would erupt into shrieks and wails every morning. And by the time I got to the bathroom, often I was smiling. Often I was smiling. And my two men reported how much they enjoyed moaning with me. How their helplessness had disappeared. And not only then were they sympathetic with me, were we communicating and connecting, but they had the extreme privilege of bearing witness to someone's suffering. This is a great honor, by the way, to bear witness to someone. To just be able to settle into your place. No advice, no whatever. Just to bear witness to deep suffering that a person would allow you to do that. Would trust your stability so much. To me, our awareness of our own suffering and our connections to other people is a meditation that synchronizes body and mind. And this synchronization, the deep integrity of being all of the peace is a very deep healing. So I think that if you're in great pain much of the time, and I don't just mean physical pain, I mean the kind of anguish that we all have all the time, all the way from being in traffic all the time, the stress of that to catastrophic loss. I think if you're in great pain a lot of the time, it becomes absolutely necessary that you create a life for yourself that you love and enjoy. For people in pain, often the first step is simply noticing that they have any pleasure at all in the midst of terrible suffering. Then after that they learn to notice how pleasure is actually present in the experience of pain itself. So that if you cultivate the stability to turn toward your pain, then you notice that it gets wide and spacious enough so that the pleasure can start sending up little tendrils into the pain like grass grows up between sections of a sidewalk. And it's not that this kind of pleasure distracts us from the pain, and it's not that this kind of pleasure takes away the pain, but instead it interpenetrates the pain in the same way that light interpenetrates dark in the same way that death interpenetrates life. In fact, it's useful to think about the relationship between pleasure and pain. Pleasure and pain are interdependent. That's how we refer to them as as Buddhists. They're interdependent. That means they have relation only, they have meaning only in relation to each other. It's impossible to understand either pain or pleasure without the experience of the other for comparison. Our ability to perceive each of them is totally dependent on our experience of the other. And their existence is so commingled in our consciousness that if you decide to concentrate your attention on one of them, the other inevitably follows, which can be very disconcerting. In fact, much of our life is part of these little pairs, not only light and dark and death and life, but love and hate, success and failure, comfortable, uncomfortable, relaxed, uptight, and so on and so on. We always see ourselves existing between one continuum or another. Rich, poor, we try to work our way toward the positive end. And sickness and health are examples I use a lot because as I said, I work with people who are sick. When I began to recuperate from the worst ravages of my rheumatoid arthritis and I spent more and more time out of my bed, I climbed onto the ever turning wheel of the sickness health dichotomy. Every morning when I woke up, I'd think, well, am I better today or am I worse today? And I kind of feel out and move and make a judgment. And so I was either elated and happy or cast down and miserable because of the answer, starting off at the beginning of the day. And you don't have to be particularly ill to get caught up in this. You can just decide to improve your health. As many of us do, as we begin to get older, we notice our clothes don't fit as well. So we say, well, I'll go on a diet, I'll work out. You know, I'll take this in hand. Get back to my useful body. So you work very hard at improving yourself. You take vitamins and you watch your diet and you work out. You may start running. You get on the scale and compare your weight to the day before. You run further maybe each week than you did the week before and so on. And things go well for a time and you feel better. Your clothes fit better. You have more stamina and so on. You're very pleased with yourself. But then you start to notice when you don't feel so good, much more than you did before you started on this campaign to improve your health. You over trained a little yesterday. So today you have a lot of aches and pains or you went to a party one night and you said, oh, this one night all drink and eat. And the next morning you pick up a few pounds on the scale. You can't believe that one deviation from your good regime could make so much difference. And it starts to drive you crazy. That instead of now just feeling totally good all the time, you have ups and downs. You become very sensitive to when you feel bad. So it becomes worrisome because now you're noticing not only when you feel good but when you feel when you don't feel absolutely tip-top. You didn't realize that when you turned your attention, when you plucked feeling good out of the undifferentiated void, that feeling bad was going to come along with it. That's because you're focused on this thing. So it's not the original decision to change anything that is the problem. It's your attachment to the outcome. So the significant difference between pleasure and pain is the emotion that they each elicit. As humans, we're usually repelled by pain and attracted to pleasure. If you observe the circularity of these feelings often enough though, how disappointment and elation follow each other again and again and again, you begin to see their essential unity. They have the same source, the same root in the human psyche, grasping after pleasure and averting from pain. Neither one of them can stand alone. They only have meaning in relation to each other. It's the emotion you put on each of them that makes your life so dramatic. And if you do see your cycle of encouragement and discouragement and regard it with some humor, the fact that you're always chasing after something or running away from something, you're hardly ever standing still, you can begin to practice the disinterested pursuit of pleasure. And this is noticing, the disinterested pursuit of pleasure is noticing the pleasure that you already have, that's already in the situation, whatever the situation is. And then you can cultivate that pleasure that you notice, the pleasure that's already there. Once you notice it, you can begin giving it more and more focus and attention so that you're not frantically and compulsively grasping after some pleasure like addiction. You can cultivate pleasure in the same way that you eat sensibly or you put on a jacket when it's cold. This is just something you do for yours and other people's benefit. And why should you cultivate pleasure in this disinterested way? Because pleasure is very good for you. Over the years, I've noticed that among the most important healing experiences that people can have are experiences of deep pleasure. When your suffering is chronic or intense, you can't let your pleasures come randomly. You need to take the perception of pleasure very seriously and learn how to build the occurrence of such feelings into your life. In fact, I think that the experience of pleasure is a very important part of a spiritual life, a spiritual practice, because pleasure can help develop compassion and a generous feeling of activity. Because if you feel bountiful, if your needs are met and you feel bountiful, then you naturally spill on to other people with that bounty. Whereas if your practice has a kind of rigid or denying aspect to it, that's what other people come into contact with, is your kind of stinginess. So whenever new clients come to me with their chronic illnesses, I tell them if they're going to work with me, they have to devote the rest of their lives to the relentless pursuit of pleasure. And in my book, I devote a chapter to each of the most important aspects of pleasure, as far as I'm concerned. And the first one is, I call it engagement. I mean, there are a lot of things that you could call it engagement or connection or even control, although that's misleading. And what I mean by that, whenever you have a choice in circumstances between disengaging or engaging, let's say a co-worker is spreading a vicious rumor about you, say, and you just happen to hear it. So you have the short, and it's a ridiculous rumor. Most people wouldn't even believe it, right? So you could just let it go and be above the fray. Just let it go. Or you could go and say to the co-worker, I don't understand why are you doing this. Is there some problem in our relationship or whatever you want to say? So you could ignore it. You're a busy person. But the fact is, when you engage with this person, your energy level goes up. And it's very important to keep your energy level up if you're a depressed person. If you're a person in chronic pain, energy is foremost to keep your energy level up by interaction, by connection. So whenever you have the choice to do that. And secondly, relaxation is a second aspect of pleasure. And I define that relaxation as specifically giving in or better yet accommodating your body's yearnings for a certain amount of time on a regular basis, every day or every week or whatever. Whatever your body wants to do, you do it. Unfortunately for most of us in this culture, our bodies want to sleep when they have their way. But if you take a vacation and you get over that sleeping part, actually your body might want to play or it might want to eat or to actually just be at the service of your body. And then there's physical movement, which is different from that. Physical movement is to give pleasure to your muscle fiber and your nerve endings, your nerve fibers, because this is what muscles and nerves want to do, is move. And fortunately you live in the Bay Area where you can do anything from yoga to belly dancing to volleyball to soccer or if you can hardly move, you can lay down on the floor and do some kind of Feldenkrais movement or whatever. Any kind of movement that you want to do is available here. Then nurturing relationships, that goes without saying, actually that's a whole lecture by itself, but I'll just mention it. And then if you're in pain or under a lot of stress, a very important aspect of pleasure is being able to express rage skillfully. That's very important, and I'm not going into that either, that could be a whole lecture. But you have to find some way to express these feelings in a skillful way. And finally ecstasy. That's the fifth most important aspect of pleasure. Now there's a healer. Having the feeling of ecstasy from time to time is very important for your general health and well-being. And I define ecstasy specifically as that boundless, timeless feeling that you get when your critical mind or your discriminating mind is suspended for some reason. It's just suspended. Now I'm not putting critical mind down. You need it. You need it. You have to decide when to do this or what to do this. You don't want to walk in front of a car. I mean just on the very basic level, you need your critical mind, but you also need to be out from under it once in a while. So when you don't have your critical or judgmental mind, what is life like? Well, it's not rating one person higher than another or one experience higher than another or one environment higher than another. You completely, everything is equal in value. You just take in every wondrous detail of your surroundings, not saying this is better than that. Everything is just as fascinating and beautiful as everything else. That's ecstasy. And we all need from time to time the freedom of looking at things with fresh eyes, of eyes that haven't seen in this way for a long time. What a flush of relief and refreshment this is to be out from under critical judgmental mind. So it's very important to notice this experience when it happens spontaneously to us, and that's usually how we have this experience. It just happens for no reason. It happens spontaneously. But we could notice what causes it and begin to actively cultivate it. Like for many people, music. Listening to music is such an experience. They just kind of go out on the music. This note isn't better than that. It's just the whole thing is so beautiful. And I know someone who can just walk down the street and it suddenly strikes her like lightning and all the trash and the buildings and the people and everything, it's all just as it should be. It's all nothing has any value above another. Well, my favorite and most reliable form of ecstasy is white water rafting. And no matter how bound up I am in my arthritic pain or I'm a workaholic, it just completely removes that stressed out and compulsive mind that I have. So usually in January I just plan the trips for the year because if I would leave it up to myself, I would just say, oh, I'm too busy. I'm too busy. I'm just so January I just map out the year, send in my deposits and there it is. So the enjoyment of the rafting begins while I'm packing the car. You know, in San Francisco I usually go up to the American River, which is all about two and a half hours from San Francisco and, you know, get up and I pack the car, put in my life jacket. Now, the life jackets they hand out at these things are orange. So that's such a terrible color on me. So I bought... I bought my own blue and purple life jacket. I put that in the car and my plastic shorts and then my clothes to change into afterwards and all that kind of thing. And I'm already lighthearted when I get in the car and start the motor just at the prospect of what's going to happen when I travel the distance. And by the time I reach the mother lode put in place, you know, I'm very mellow indeed. Not quite non-judgmental, however, because they're all the rafting people, the people I'm going to go rafting with and they're arriving and I'm greeting everybody and I'm thinking I'm doing my social thing. I'm thinking, God, I hope I don't have to get in a raft with that person. Look at those shorts. Oh, my God. Not if they think they could wear those shorts. Oh, this person is so boring. Or admiring how someone looks in a wetsuit, you know, oh, I wish I looked like that in a wetsuit. And then on the other hand, the guides are meandering among us, checking our life jackets, getting us ready for the trip. And I'm doing the same thing with them. I'm chatting up the ones that I'd rather go with and, you know, kind of being cool to others because there's a lot of difference between rafting and rafting guides. Some are real hot dogs. They put you right in the middle of the rapid and it's so exciting and others it's just kind of dull, you know, they're very cautious and they skirt around the worst part of the rapid and you might as well be asleep. So I'm chatting up the people I want to go with, hoping, hoping, hoping that they choose me. So this is a very complex social dynamic going on here, you know, trying to avoid the people I don't want to be in the boat with, trying to get in the boat with. So finally the guides choose us for their boats and I'm either very happy or in a snip. And so I think, oh God, I have to look at that t-shirt all day. What a stupid t-shirt. So we start off down the river and then if I see a beer can in the water, I think, oh my God, what pig threw that beer can? People are so awful. This is a beautiful place. Beer can, yuck. And then we hit the first rapid and there's yelling and splashing and cold water and sun and wetness and scariness and thrills and then we drift again and it's gone. I'm free. I'm free. The critical mind is gone. Now there's only sensation. The person in the boat with me is the most delightful companion I could ever want. The guide just takes us down perfectly. The peanut butter sandwiches at lunch are just, they're so gummy. They're just so good. They just stick all over the mouth. It's so sensual. And these are the only moments that have ever existed, ever existed. And when I see a beer can in the water, oh how the sunshine glints off the metal. So I'm free. I'm completely released from my critical mind. And so days like this or weekends like this or weeks like this have put my rheumatoid arthritis in remission for as long as a year. As long as a year. So more than a refreshment to me, although that would be enough, ecstasy is an essential part of my healing and has always been an essential part of my healing. And you can take an ecstatic experience back into your regular life when the bars come down over your eyes again and you start judging everything. You go back to your usual discriminating mind. Just the fact that you have such an experience gives you a new perspective with which to look at your critical mind, your judgmental mind. Oh here you are. You sweet judgmental mind. Don't worry so much. Don't worry so much. Thank you for hanging out with me. But I've known something else as well. So even though you may sink low and get rigid and uptight again, you may never be trapped in just the same way that you were. If you regularly build these experiences into your life, you may never be trapped in just the same way that you were. So I think when we're able to sink beneath our ideas and opinions into the immediacy of our actual experience, there's nothing further to look for. No directions, no expectations, no reason. At the moment when we're exactly here, doing everything for its own sake, we give our heart and our whole being to every moment. Whether we're cooking a meal, doing a project at work, having a communication with another person, giving our activity, our whole heart, our whole being. This is our greatest challenge. You know how hard this is. But it's also the deepest satisfaction in our lives. Maybe the meaning of our lives is just to express our own sincerity. So we can live our life as an art form. Thank you very much. Once you've felt the pain. Oh, I see what you're saying. Oh, that's a very good question. No, I think there's something else. I think... Let it go through me. It just hurts me again and again. Any events in my past, what has gotten me, what has hooked me, is there some sort of muddiness there, some identification with the situation or some issue in myself that I can't get free from the other person? Or even as simple as I can't bear their suffering. I mean, I've had clients that I just couldn't bear their suffering. And you know, I can tell you that when that happens, I can't help them. I'm not the person anymore that can help them. Because it just gets too messy, too sticky. They can't express their suffering anymore. They see that it's too much of a burden for me. And when it's issues that are from your own past or your own physical pain, is it just something that you approach gradually in terms of it not sticking or not being muddy? Well, I do try to work it out with people. I mean, I have successfully been able over time to separate out what the problem is. But there are people that I never did. And I just said, you know, I don't think I'm helping you. And they agreed. So. How did you first notice that significant connection of the accident and how important that was? Well, it was when I was quite ill, actually. I, food and wine really bothered me during that period when I was in bed. Like a lot more than just, oh, I used to eat like a piece of toast a day. And more than that would make me hurt more. It was like it got stuck in my blood stream. And any kind of wine or sweets. I've always had a sweet tooth and I just, oh, I just didn't have wine or sweets because it was so painful, like needles sticking me. And so this is how I lived month after month. But then one day some friends said, this is terrible. You're in this room. We have to take you to Point Reyes. So they got a blanket. They carried me downstairs. They put me in the car. And they took me out to Point Reyes. They laid down a blanket, put me on the blanket and then they had brought all these pies and cookies and wine, tons of wine, nothing that I could eat. So I, at first I was just very happy, you know. Oh, so wonderful. The sunshine, the dogs playing, just the sea air from being in a shut in, in a room. And, you know, as the day went on, I thought, well, you know, they were all getting drunk. So I started drinking the wine and I had a piece of pie. Oh, it was so good. And then so on and so on. And I just ate cookies and pie and drank wine all day. And I just thought, I thought, well, I'll suffer, but it's worth it. So they took me home at night and carried me back up, put me in the bed and I waited to suffer. When I woke up the next morning, I felt better than I had in months. I said, what happened? What happened? And I had a couple of theories. One was that I had so much pleasure that it actually opened up parts of my body, like for starters, the glands, the secrete enzymes that digest food. Because that's all in here, all these places. So I thought, well, maybe that happened. I just opened up, you know, as a result of the sun and pleasure and everything. And I thought another thing might have happened is that I had all those, what are they, the pleasure endorphins, right? That I was just flooded with endorphins and that masked everything. I don't care what happened. That was a turning point. And I said, boy, more of this. I've got to make sure I get, you know, taken out. And then I started asking my friends, you know, take me here, take me there. And they were very happy to do this because they were standing around helpless. You know, they didn't know what to do. Thank you for the question. It was a real turning point. And I've seen it happen again and again and again with clients. They don't believe me when I tell them to pursue pleasure. But eventually they do. So, yes, another question. I'm assuming you're talking about a physical expression, you know, temper tantrums. Temper tantrums, very important. Well, I think it might be harder for men because they might feel they do more damage. But I think that it's very important. And now when I should skillfully express rage, you have to make sure you're protecting people. You can't just blow somebody away. Although, if it's a large space and there are lots of other people, you have to make sure you're protecting people to absorb it too, like in a bank. This has definitely been for me very important. And again, the first time I noticed that was I was trying to get the sham, oh, this was like ten years into rheumatoid arthritis. And I always felt guilty about any time I was really angry, even though I was angry many times a day. You know, because of the fight with the physical world. And I thought, oh, here I practice so long, so long. And anyway, one day I was trying to get the jam jar off my jam and the toast was already in the toaster. And it pops up and I run it under the hot water, took this thing for arthritic people to open. It never worked for me. It didn't work then. And I just tried everything I could and the toast is getting cold. And so finally I just hurled the jar against the wall. It smashed and the jam and the glass just started oozing down the wall. And I sat there eating my toast as happy as I could possibly be. And it just so happened the radio was on and it said that some psychotic person had shot their wife and was now on the lamb and the police were after them. And I thought, I know what happened to that person. They couldn't get the jam jar open. So then my son came home and he said, oh, mom. And I said, don't clean it up. I'll clean it up. And I left it there all day. And every time I came into the kitchen, I felt this swell of pride. And that started it. And then after a long time, I graduated to people. But I always, now this is very tricky, you know, you can't afford any inflation on this score. You can't congratulate yourself about blowing somebody away. You have to be very, I always with clerks and you know, bank clerks and doctors and things like that. I always say, you know, well, first of all, I have observed my anger now for years. And I always have a choice when I feel the temperature rise and that this is going to turn into a temper tantrum. I always think, well, should I go with this or should I just hold it in meditative equipoise? And I think what will happen? You know what? And then if I decide to, it will do too much damage, like if it's just one person, you know, I'll hold it. I'll just hold it and decide no. But if it looks like the perfect situation, I've asked to speak to the supervisor. And the supervisor is paid to put up with people like me. And there are other people around that can offer support to the supervisor. Then I just, I decide to go. And I just scream obscenities and everything how the person is frustrating me and I'm not usually a crazy person that they've driven me to it. And it feels very good. And the supervisor always feels very accomplished when they give me what I want. They say you can just see them thinking I've handled a crazy person. I'm really good at this stuff. Now, I would hate to have one of my students walk by and say, there's my Zen teacher. But you just have to take your chances. So we probably ought to stop. It's 9.15. And thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
