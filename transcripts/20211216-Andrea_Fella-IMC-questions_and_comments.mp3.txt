The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So I'm curious what kinds of questions you have.
I wanted to take questions. Questions about practice in meditation, practice in daily life,
or a topic that you're interested in. It could be pretty much anything.
I just wanted to hear from you and see what's of interest to you this evening.
You're welcome to, if you don't want to be recorded, you can type into the chat,
or you can put your hand up like this. There's, you know, there's only one page of people,
so I could see if you raise your hand like this, or you could use your zoom hand.
And if you're on the phone, there's one person on the phone here.
I'm not sure if you can raise a zoom hand there,
but if you'd like to ask a question, you could in a silent time in between questions,
potentially just break in and ask a question.
So any, any questions?
Sarah.
Oh wait, let me make it possible for you to unmute.
Okay.
My question is,
in doing the open awareness, like what, what is obvious right now or,
especially when I sort of like wake up back into being aware,
like after having been a little bit lost.
A lot of times, like what's the most strongly obvious in that moment is, is thinking,
and both the content of thoughts and just how it feels in the body.
And I guess I'm kind of wondering,
it doesn't necessarily seem like,
what I want to do in my meditation is just kind of like,
okay, thinking, thinking, thinking content of thoughts.
Like, so is there like enough, like another way in the open practice to kind of work with that?
Yeah, I think this, this is a great question.
How do we relate to thinking in our meditation practice,
basically is what you're, you're asking.
I mean, in this case, you're, you're asking about it in terms of coming back into awareness.
And there it is, you know, that's often what we notice actually when we come back into awareness
that we are thinking, you know, that's, that's kind of what we, what we notice.
And sometimes, depending on the habit of meditation,
I mean, sometimes we have a very strong habit in meditation of coming back to a particular object
with, when we wake up, when we come back into awareness.
And it's almost like we jump over whatever's there in the moment of awareness returning
to just kind of come back to the breath or something like that.
That can be a very strong meditation habit.
And the fact that you're, you're seeing, you know, that you're waking up into thinking
and that you're noticing thinking, it sounds like that,
that particular habit is not at play in, in your, in your practice.
But I just want to speak to that to start because that's a very strong tendency that we have.
We've learned, we've learned a meditation technique and it's almost hard to stop doing it.
And so, you know, it's, I think in that, in that case, what I'd encourage,
and this will get back to your question, Sarah,
what I'd encourage is to, in that moment where you've kind of jumped back to the breath or something,
is to, is to pause for a moment.
You know, if you notice that you've kind of quickly come back to the breath,
pause for a moment and, and check in and see what has been the effect of thinking.
You know, you have been lost.
There has been the mind that has gone out and wandered.
And that wandering, the, when the mind wanders into thought,
it has a very powerful effect on our experience.
Different kinds of thought will shape different experiences for us
if we've kind of wandered into a kind of an active thinking
about something we have to do or something we need to plan
or a conversation we had that created some energy to it.
You know, when we wander into those kinds of thoughts,
it creates a lot in our present moment experience.
And if we kind of just jump over that, if we notice, oh, thinking, planning,
we do the requisite note, you know, check.
I've noted it and I'm going to come back to the breath.
If we do that, then it's almost like we're not really taking in
or acknowledging what has happened.
That planning or that remembering or that judging or that fantasizing
or that arguing or whatever had happened has shaped our experience,
has probably put some emotions into our system
or it's created sensations in the body.
And if we jump over it, then what can happen
if we just come back to the breath, what can happen is that those emotions
can kind of come into our meditation underground.
It's like they'll just start infusing how we're paying attention to that experience.
So maybe if we've had some anxiety or some frustration around a planning,
we come back to the breath and that anxiety or that frustration
can kind of creep into the meditation without our being consciously aware of it
because we haven't consciously recognized it.
So this is some of the value of really taking in
when you return from thinking, you know, when the mindfulness returns
and you have been thinking, to really take in what is here.
So what has happened in that moment when mindfulness returns there
and you're noticing, okay, thinking is happening,
I would encourage kind of the question or the exploration,
not just to look at the content.
I mean, there's multiple pieces to thoughts.
There's the content which is the story or the narrative of the thought
and there's how that narrative has affected us.
So you don't have to push away the content,
but see if you can more broadly open to how that content affected your experience.
So there's the content and the body sensations and any emotions that may be present.
There can be quite a bit going on there.
And if you find one of the things that sometimes happens when we return from thinking,
the mind is kind of hooked into the content
and not so much noticing the effect of the content.
And so that's the piece really to explore.
How has that content affected you?
How has it affected the body?
What emotions are present so that you just kind of open up to that?
You don't have to stay with the content.
It might still be there, but that's not so much what is of interest.
We're more interested in the experience in the present moment
and the content is part of the experience in the present moment,
in terms of the bare experience.
There is a thought that's arising.
That's kind of the bare experience of thinking.
It's like, yes, there is thinking that's arising.
And there's body sensation.
There's feeling that's arising.
The content is not so interesting for us in our meditation.
Now, in daily life, the content, we do have to work with the content.
But in our meditation, when you wake up from the thinking,
look at how the content has affected you and maybe let go of the content.
We don't actually have to hold on to something in order to observe it.
That's another piece that can happen sometimes.
Like, oh, I've woken up into thinking.
I need to observe thinking.
And unwittingly, we're actually holding on to the thinking in order to look at it.
So if you can just be curious about the way that thinking has affected you,
that can sometimes take us out of the engagement with the content
to being more curious about what's happening in the present moment
as a result of that content.
In daily life, we might want to go back and forth a little bit.
Content, how does it affect me?
Content, how does it affect me?
But in the sitting meditation, we can kind of let go of the content,
recognize that we've been thinking,
and just touch into how we are as a result of that thinking.
If you find, and what may be happening too,
is that as you try to attend to how the thinking affected you,
it kind of pulls you back into the content.
So it's almost like it's reminding, you know,
that frustration or that emotion, whatever it is,
reminds you of the source of it, and then you go back to it.
So if that kind of is happening,
if you feel yourself getting pulled back to thinking,
being pulled, kind of being pulled back out of awareness,
then it may be time to actually let go of that,
and you've acknowledged how you are in connection with that content,
and may be open to something simple in the present moment,
like sensations of feet on the ground,
or hands wherever they're contacted,
just to take your attention away from that kind of magnetic pull
to the thoughts again.
So I would encourage to play with it for a little while in this way
to look at how has the thinking affected you,
and then if you find yourself getting pulled back to the content,
then to turn your attention to something else.
It's fine to use something else to kind of break that pull to the thinking.
Then the other piece I'll say about that moment of the mind returning
from being lost in thought.
In what I was describing, it was like some kind of thinking
that's active that created some kind of emotional response.
But there's a lot of thinking that happens in our meditation
that's not like that.
That's more of a drift out of the present moment.
It doesn't feel like it's got particularly a charge to it.
It's more like daydreaming, or like hypnagogic,
just like these dreamlike thoughts,
or just a drift without too much actual content at all.
And sometimes when we come back into awareness there,
we don't even really know necessarily what the thought was.
We just know that we had been lost.
And in that kind of drifting,
it's really valuable to wake up into the effect of that.
How has that kind of drifting affected you?
Because more often than I would have ever expected,
that kind of thinking actually relaxes the mind,
actually settles the system.
And so in waking up to, wow, the mind has been drifting,
if there's no judgment,
there's often a judgment when we wake up from having been lost.
And that will kind of shake up the calm that had happened,
if in fact the mind had kind of drifted out of the present moment like that.
That judgment can kind of shake that calm up.
But every now and then you might notice right as you return
that there's just been this drifty kind of dreamy, daydreamy quality in the mind.
And if you can notice that, oh, we're a drifty daydreaming.
And take in the effect, take in how you are having been in that state.
Very often there's more of feeling of spaciousness,
of more calm, of more ease than there was before the mind wandered.
And it's kind of amazing to see that.
And so when I began to notice that, when I began to see that,
that was a possibility in terms of what could be seen
when I woke up from being lost in thought.
It really helped to cut the judgment because at least a third, if not more,
and at this point it's often much more than that.
Many, many of my wanders out are this kind of drifty.
It's just like the energy gets a little low.
But it's not like it's reacting to anything.
It's just...
And if the mindfulness can wake up into that and just be aware,
it's like it brings the energy level of that state up to where we can know it.
It can be aware of the quality of the mind that is spacious or calm or relaxed.
And that energy will tend to remove also the thoughts, any kind of images.
Often it seems like, for me at least, it's often images in that kind of a place.
That it will remove those and they'll just be the sense of spaciousness or relaxation.
And it's often quite pleasant.
So that moment when we return from being lost,
it's such a beautiful moment to really be curious about how am I now.
So I'm really encouraging you to do exactly what you have been doing, Sarah,
maybe a little bit more checking into what's been the effect of the thinking rather than being aware of the thinking.
So that may be a slight difference to what you are doing.
And it can have this effect of really helping us to see also those calmer places when we return from a drifting kind of wandering.
Thank you, Sarah.
Hi, Andrea. Thank you.
I was going to ask something different with these days.
I don't have to do too much in my world, but I feel like I'm hurrying even though I don't have to get anywhere.
I don't have to do anything.
There is a habit of hurrying all the time to get to something.
And I think driven by anxiety and then but I'm also wondering the another level of the question is that I'm wondering if that this self that we're talking about is made up of all my habits.
And then, okay.
Well, I'll say a couple pieces about this.
I'll kind of respond to your first piece about the hurrying to start.
You know, so you're saying that you find that there's that energy of hurrying, even if you don't have anything to do.
And are you able to notice it?
Are you able to feel it?
Not at the moment.
I mean, it's just happened and I just do it and then.
So I mean, very maybe 5% I notice it 5% of the time.
Okay, so if you do notice it, if you do notice the the energy or notice that you are hurrying.
You know, last time I talked about like picking something you're interested in exploring.
And so this is a good one, you know, to pick the habit of hurrying to see if you can wake up for it.
And what do you notice?
And so that 5% of the time that you wake up into hurrying, you know, just what do you notice?
Sometimes you could potentially if you recognize, oh, hurrying is happening and I don't have anything particularly to hurry for.
Then perhaps you could slow down and see, you know, if there's a tension when you try to slow down.
You know, if there's often I think with these strong habits, you say this is a kind of strong habit in your life.
Often in these strong habits, sometimes the habit will come up just out of out of habitual energy.
And there isn't particularly, you know, there isn't particularly anxiety underneath it.
Now, it may be that the, you know, the anxiety has fueled hurrying in the past when there's something that you needed to do.
It's kind of like you get a little anxious and you hurry to get it done.
And so it can kind of get set into motion or the habit can come based out of something like anxiety.
But I would be curious, I mean, I would explore the possibility when you notice that you're hurrying
and there's no particular need for the hurrying.
When you slow down, is there any anxiety there? I mean, is it actually there or not?
How does one check for anxiety?
Well, I mean, it's like just be curious about what the experience is when you notice the hurrying.
And if you explore the possibility, oh, you know, I don't have anything to hurry for, can I slow down?
If there's anxiety there, there's going to be some resistance to slowing down.
Oh, I see. Yeah.
You know, if there's anxiety, there's going to be, no, no, I can't slow down.
So, you know, you could explore and see whether there is anxiety there or not.
And it may just be coming up out of the habit because with these very strong patterns, sometimes it's just the habit in play.
You know, that we're just so habitually engaged in that, you know, that we just do that.
And there's not particularly the emotion underneath it.
Sometimes when we find ourselves doing it, it's almost like that habit can then trigger the emotion, which is an interesting cycle too.
So, you know, I would just be curious a little bit about the experience of the hurrying.
And, you know, if it's happening way after the fact, like, you know, you notice once you finish something, wow, I was really hurrying with that.
You know, then you can see if that hurry energy is still there a little bit and just see if you can feel into it.
You know, what does it feel like to be hurrying?
And again, can you slow down? Is there a resistance to the slowing down at that point?
Yeah. Can I just make a quick example of that?
If there's time or no?
Well, there's only one minute left.
If you want me to, I'll respond to the other part of your question quickly.
What you said about the sense of self being all of those habits, you know, that's kind of what I came to.
You know, at some point, I feel like I got, I was investigating, what am I taking to be me?
You know, what is, what is this me?
What is this kind of sense of who I am?
And there, you know, almost always there was some kind of sense of a familiar set of contractions or habits that were going on when I felt like, yep, this is me.
And there was a whole bunch of different ones. So it's not like there's a one, a one self.
So there may be the hurrying self.
There may be the confused self.
There may be the frustrated self.
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, but, but I think what we call self is, is often connected to those habits of, of clinging, of reactivity.
That's certainly what seemed to me that whenever I kind of recognized, yeah, but it feels like I'm here right now.
It's like, this is just some familiar set of like contractions in the body.
That's, that's what I'm calling me.
That's what I'm calling self.
So be curious about it.
You know, that, that's, that's kind of where I landed around it.
So, you know, you be curious about it, you know, look at, look for yourself rather than taking this as the answer.
Look for yourself and see, is there some sense of self that's not connected to some habit?
The awareness that sees it is not connected.
That's right. That's right.
