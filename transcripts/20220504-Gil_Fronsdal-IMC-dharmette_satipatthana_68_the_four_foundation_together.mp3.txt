The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So we've gone through for these last four months the four foundations for awareness, for awakening awareness.
These four awarenesses, four areas of developing awareness can work together, cooperatively, support each other.
And they make a very interesting perspective, very useful perspective for us to bring to our lives.
So often when we pay attention, give attention, take in, perceive the world around us or the world inside of us,
it's all too easy to do it with preconceived ideas, preconceived agendas, being oriented to certain areas, certain things that we think are important.
And not to automatically dismiss those, even if it's a useful way to look at things the way you look at things.
Sometimes it can be useful to find a new way for a fresh perspective for our perspective, for our perception of the world ourselves.
And so these four foundations, four areas are kind of interesting to keep them in mind. Use these perspectives when looking at our life.
So if for example some people might be oriented towards, what's in it for me? What am I going to get out of this experience?
In Satipatana Sutta we wouldn't do that. Instead we would say, what is the physical experience here?
What's the feeling tone that's here? What's the mind state that's present?
And what's the dhammas? What are these processes of being caught or being free that are playing out as I practice here?
It could be that when we look at the world, we look at the world through what we don't like, what frightens us or what's unpleasant for us.
And we react to that from that point of view. But instead of that we can ask, how does it physically? How is it a feeling tone?
How is it mind states? How is it with the dhammas? There's a lot of self-orientation going on.
Instead of that we do the four foundations. So these are like going through the scales.
We can ask ourselves, given what's happening now, maybe let's look at them from these vantage points.
These are the four vantage points that the Buddha offers for the path to awakening, to freedom.
A path to everything that's wholesome or skillful, a heap of skillfulness, a heap of wholesomeness.
For the Buddha this is phenomenally healthy and beneficial to cultivate this kind of awareness.
And so in the vehicle he does this, or the medium, is not through orientations that are about me, myself and mine.
Of course it's about you in a certain way, but that's not the orientation with which we're looking and analyzing, understanding the situation.
Rather he's saying, for the purpose of cultivating this open awareness that's liberating, that's freeing, healthy and wonderful,
notice how it is in your body. Notice your body. Notice the feeling tones of how it's taken in and registered as pleasant, unpleasant or neither.
Notice the qualities of the mind, the state of the mind. Is it contracted? Is it expansive? Is it filled with intense desire or intense aversion?
Or is it not? Does the mind feel caught? Does the mind feel free?
And those categories have no self in them. It's not like saying, am I caught? Am I filled with greed? Am I aversive? Am I contracted?
None of the instructions in Satyapatana involve the perspective of me, myself and I.
It can be such a relief. It can be a challenge because of how common it is to have that perspective.
But to put it aside or evoke a different perspective, the advantage of that is the perspective of looking at things from the point of view of me, myself and mine,
what's in it for me and how am I being seen and what's good for me and how I am, is that that's a magnet for all kinds of unskillful, unhealthy attitude states of mind situations.
It tends to, one way or the other, it tends to close the space inside of us, around us.
It tends to reduce the open-handedness, the open-heartedness, the open-mindedness.
And so instead of going that direction, like, you know, what's happening to me? How am I doing? How are people treating me? What's going on here for me?
Am I improving? Am I getting better? Am I getting worse? I'm a meditation failure.
All these things you can say with the word I or me.
See if you can put them aside and bring into play a different perspective, the four foundations.
And so what you've learned about mindfulness of the body, you know, there's all these things we talked about.
You know, go back and read some of the exercises or listen to some of these talks about mindfulness of the body and cultivate this greater connection to the body.
It is you, but you don't have to think about it being you.
Of course, this is who you're paying attention to. You're paying attention to your body. You're paying attention to yourself.
But it's extra to put that idea, to operate, to analyze, to react to the situation from the study of me, myself, and mine, especially when we're meditating.
So just the body, the simplicity of it, the feeling tones, the mind states, the Dhammas.
And then the orientation also is not to get anything of it or understand or analyze situation, but to begin tuning in, waking up to the changing nature of experience.
The flow of present moment experience, the river of life that goes through and things are always changing, always moving.
And to do it from the perspective of these four foundations.
And so there's also a different perspective, the perspective of change, things coming and going.
And to do that with an open-hearted, open-minded way.
And this is a very helpful way to loosen the grip of attachments, to just rest or float or just keep opening to the flow of change, the flow of experience that's only available, or best available,
when we're centered in awareness, in these direct experience of body, feelings, mind states, and the Dhammas.
Let all this flow, teaching us how not to cling, not to grasp.
The five hindrances are forms of grasping, forms of clinging, that diminish the freedom, that diminish the clarity in which we can see things.
And for the Buddha, diminish our wisdom.
When you're caught in the five hindrances, bring forth the four foundations.
When you're caught in a hindrance, how is that in the body?
What's the feeling tone of it?
What are the mind states that are there?
And then just be really present for each hindrance in and of itself as it comes and goes, letting go of it.
And this referencing back then through the four foundations applies also to the way in which we practice, the way that we meditate.
And from time to time it's good to go through these steps, the scales, the four foundation scales, and to see in relationship to how you're practicing, how you're being mindful, how you're meditating.
How does it feel in your body?
How you're doing it?
Are you straining?
Is it tightening up?
Are you resisting?
Are you sluggish?
Are you collapsing?
Are you draining in your body because you're not really in it?
What's happening in your body?
What's happening with feeling tones?
What's the feeling tone of how you're practicing, of how you're doing mindful?
Is it pleasant or unpleasant?
Is it something that feels good to do or not?
What is the mind state with which you're doing mindfulness?
Is the mind state with greed or aversion or delusion?
Is the mind state expansive or is it liberating or is it settled?
What's the mind state?
And then in the way that you practice, the five areas of the fourth foundation are the hindrances that play, even subtly.
Are we entangled, knotted up in anything?
Are we caught in identity, me, myself, and mine, around the five aggregates?
Or are the seven factors of awakening kind of peeking their head up as we're practicing?
Are they kind of nearby or potentially nearby?
Are they creating the space where those wonderful factors can begin to grow?
And in the how we're paying attention, is it seeing in a way that allows us to see the Four Noble Truths,
which is another way of seeing the changing nature of things?
So to bring these together, these four foundations, and when we sit down to meditate,
different times we might choose one of the foundations more than another foundation,
because that seems to be the salient one.
It seems like the good one with which to develop awareness.
I find it's really useful to come back to breathing over and over again, the very first exercise.
Stay in the body, I find it really useful.
And then the other ones, as needed, as is helpful.
And sometimes I'll go through the four.
Just, okay, how's it this area, how's it here, in relationship to whatever is happening in the moment?
So this is a way of bringing the four foundations together and cooperating them,
and how they are mutually supportive of each other, and how this works as a whole.
The unified whole, there's a unified way of bringing together all these practices
for the purposes of open awareness, open-hearted, open-minded, open-handed attention to ourselves and the world.
So, thank you.
