The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So welcome, welcome everybody.
It's great to be here and to see you all.
And today I wanted to, in recognition that Earth Day, right, is coming up here.
And I wanted to kind of get us ready, get us in the mood or thinking that direction, you know, not having to wait until exactly Earth Day, which is on the 22nd.
But to share a poem that somebody else has written about Earth Day.
And maybe while we're, while you listen to it, you can consider like, what does this have to do with loving kindness practice?
What does this have to do with mindfulness practice?
And there might be a way in which the way that this, the author of this poem is pointing to something that is also maybe really relevant in our own lives,
not in the literal way that she's pointing, but we might even consider that maybe she's not, I don't know, maybe I'll just read this.
The poem is by Rosemary Traumer, and it's called On Earth Day.
So we're saying it a little bit early, but here we go.
Of course, the trees with their greening, their growing, their gift of eating light, how beautiful they are in these first days of spring.
They're feathery droops that gather those sun, the tender gold when the leaves first unfurl.
But today, I am awed by the vital soil that feeds them.
Awed by the multipedes and woodlice, fly larvae and springtails that fragment the once living world into mulch.
Awed by the nematodes, the mites, the parapods, awed by the rotifers, the algae, the bacteria, the single cell protozoans, all of these makers of earth.
There's elegance in the process, the breaking down, the separation of proteins, the release of nitrogen, the creation of rich, dark hummus.
How seldom I honor the beauty of tearing apart, the blessing of brokenness, the importance of those who undo, who help the world go to pieces.
The earth itself is an altar to break down, decay, collapse, demise. And from these infinite violences, we rise. Like trees, we rise.
I love this idea that kind of like honoring both, sometimes what we get, we don't honor, right? The earth, what's underneath, what's supporting, the foundation.
It's also providing the nutrients.
But also sometimes we might think that our life, our practice, our meditation practice, our spiritual practice is about getting and acquiring and adding things on top or something like this.
But so much of practice, in fact, I would say maybe the most of practice is about kind of breaking things into pieces.
It's about separating out or distinguishing what's helpful, what's not helpful.
What is just a belief that I've acquired and is just a belief?
Doesn't mean it's true, doesn't mean that it's not true, it's just an insistential belief.
We can blow them away with just a puff of the breath, these ideas, these beliefs about ourselves.
I'm one that I really can't meditate well, so I'm not even going to do it.
Everybody else here, they look like they're so settled and I'm the only one here that's having difficulties or I don't know, all these beliefs that we have or these ideas like I need more, I need more, I need more, I have to have more.
There's some fundamental inadequacy I have that requires me to have more.
But somehow this practice helps us both to see some of the soil, some of the environment in which we are rising out of the way we express ourselves, the way we show up in the world.
And it's helping us not only to see but maybe to break apart, to dismantle, deconstruct and the insubstantiality of it to become evident for us so that we don't have to hold on to them.
We don't have to feel imprisoned, we don't have to feel stuck with some of these ideas that we have about ourselves and about others.
And I'm not saying that ideas are bad, I'm not saying that we shouldn't have them, but is there a way in which we can hold them, we can use them, we can recognize them that supports greater and greater freedom.
And in order to do that requires that sometimes we let them go.
We are all this list of creatures that break them down, right, these nematodes, paropods, I have no idea what those are, rotifers, algae, bacteria, single cell protozoans.
All these little creatures that often we don't even see or recognize are, but that's such a necessary part of existence, the cycle, and is there a way in which we can allow that to happen for us?
Can we allow some of these things to be broken down and transformed and used as fuel for, used as nourishment or nutriment for whatever wants to grow next?
So I was thinking like, what will I title this, if I, you know, when I upload this onto Audioderma, I was thinking mulching.
I say this not being a gardener, so I don't know exactly what that means, but it sounds like, you know, sometimes it's dirty too, right?
Sometimes this practice is messy, I don't know, I kind of like this idea.
So, okay, so with that as an introduction, let's do some practice, let's do some mulching.
Or not, right?
Maybe today is not the day, which things need to be, maybe there's a day, and this is a day in which we need to be nourished and fed or something, right?
It's all okay, it's all okay.
So arriving, arriving in this moment.
I'm just feeling what there is to feel at this moment, bodily sensations, emotions.
What is it like at this moment? What are the experiences?
Is it if it were okay to have any experience?
Okay.
Tuning in to the sensations of breathing.
And getting converted to carbon dioxide in our bodies. It's breaking down and creating something new.
Okay.
Just feeling the belly and our chest move.
With the activity of breathing.
It's naturally happening.
Okay.
Just being with the breath as if there were nothing else to do, nowhere else to be.
We're just here now.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice.
The way that my practice that might break down some ideas, beliefs, notions we have about ourselves and others, as well as provide nourishment and support.
Maybe not so different than mulch or compost.
But starting where it's easy, bringing to mind a lovable being.
Kids, puppies, babies, good friends, coach, mentor, teacher, spiritual leader.
It brings a little bit of delight to the heart.
You think about them.
And you have an uncomplicated relationship.
Bringing this lovable being to mind.
Bringing to the connection.
We can say these phrases as a support.
We can say.
Be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
When the mind wanders, just very simply, gently begin again.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
When the mind wanders, just very simply, gently begin again.
Just opening the sphere or the circle of loving kindness to include ourselves.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
How seldom I honor the beauty of tearing apart the blessing of brokenness,
and go to pieces.
Sometimes practice is about undoing and breaking.
As a way of support, nourishment.
Not as injury.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
And then to extend our loving kindness to somebody we don't know.
Somebody maybe in this Zoom call, somebody you see in the neighborhood on occasion.
It is helpful if it can be an individual rather than just the generic people we don't know.
Just think how our lives, how the world would unfold if people just extended some warm heartedness to people they didn't know.
It can start with us.
So bringing to mind somebody you don't know might take just a little bit more energy,
but without straining.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
Remembering that we are a stranger, we are the person that somebody doesn't know for many people.
In the same way that we want others to consider us with the openness and kindness.
Can we consider those we don't know with openness and kindness.
Maybe there are some beliefs, some ideas that we can break down, dismantle, allow to atrophy.
We can support this warm heartedness towards others.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
So this idea of honoring that breaking down the separation, I've been pointing to thoughts or notions or beliefs.
Because that can be a very sometimes that we feel like we have to really hold on to our beliefs or our ideas, rather than allowing some of them to just naturally crumble or disintegrate or something.
And that could be an integral part of our practice in our life and kind of like honoring and recognizing that and allowing it to happen.
And I like this idea of it being soiled too, that it provides the support for something new to grow, to sprout, to bloom, to blossom.
Okay, so it can be helpful to talk about some of these ideas with others to share your experience, maybe share some interpretations or ideas.
So I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms where you can discuss how that meditation was and or how it was this kind of this theme of one way I'm approaching the Earth Day that's coming up is to be talking about the soil and what gets broken down, what gets
apart, the growing of these beautiful trees, which we often think about, I know I do when I think about Earth Day, I think about trees.
So I'm going to like to put you into groups of three or four.
And when you're in these groups, it can be really helpful to just say one thing, and then let it go to the next person and then they say one thing and it goes to the next person and then they say one thing, rather than one person.
Saying everything they know about the topic can be nice to just have everybody have an opportunity to have a chance to speak and to share, and not only to allow yourself to be touched by influence by moved by other people.
So we're creating the conditions in which others can express themselves but also we're allowing ourselves to connect in a certain kind of way, not that everybody has to believe the same thing not that everybody has to come to the same conclusion.
But rather than just being like, I'm here and let me tell you all the knowledge I have, but instead allowing other people to express what they have to share and as a way for us to bring this loving kindness into practice.
Rather than just exclusively a meditation practice to allow it to be a something that we do with others.
Okay, and if it's helpful you to this idea of going around the circle, you can go in the order of the last digit of your phone number.
Okay, here we go.
Hi, welcome back.
Somebody have a comment or question or something they'd like to say.
This idea.
So in my group, we talked about, you know, your interpretation of the poem or at least the one you presented is about, you know, tearing down things.
Someone pointed out that you could also, the poem was also about how to build things, you know, and, you know, it felt like, like, you know, first of all, like a lovely synergy, you know, that, you know, you know, neither one is like right or wrong right there.
You know, both are obviously there and just, you know, you know, just just the beauty of the poem that you know there are so many ways to interpret it, you know that are all.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know. I just liked it, I guess.
Thank you, Neil. Thank you, Neil.
Yeah, so I saw that there was a chat earlier about so the title of the poem is called on Earth Day or is it on Earth Day or for Earth Day I forgot what the preposition is here on Earth Day.
It's by Rosemary Traumer. She's the poet. And part of the reason why I wanted to emphasize the breaking down part is because so often we do emphasize the building the creating the something new, getting made, which kind of goes with this feeling like there has to be more.
And so I just as a counter I wanted to emphasize kind of the breaking down the deconstructing this because sometimes we tend to be dismissive of it and I think this is what the poet is pointing to you.
All these little creatures in this long list that she has are not things that we can see certainly like she has with single celled protozoans in here right we don't see those without microscopes.
Just to kind of like honor that it's both building and deconstructing. And this is how the world works.
Yes, Pat.
Can you unmute please.
Okay, you hear me. Yes.
I really like the natural metaphor.
I have my own background because I spent summers working with the Forest Service. Great. And I worked with the people who study leaf litter and duff.
So, you know, I had to deal with a lot of memories that came back that were delightful.
But I, when I connected with what it might mean for my own practice, it was quite profound as something I never thought about before.
It's an energetic property that I have to look at a little more closely, but I'm very, very grateful for it. Thank you so much for that.
You're welcome. Thank you for sharing.
Okay, so it's lovely seeing you all practicing together. What a beautiful thing it is that we do this all.
So if you'd like to unmute, we can say goodbye together. So bye bye and thank you.
Thank you, Diana. Thank you.
Thank you, Diana.
You're welcome.
Thank you, Diana.
Thanks, Marilyn. Thank you.
Bye bye.
Bye.
Thank you, Marilyn. Thank you.
