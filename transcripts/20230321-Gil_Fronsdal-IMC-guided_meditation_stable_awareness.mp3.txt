 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello, welcome. Welcome to our meditation together as a community. And hopefully you appreciate that there are so many people meditating at the same time with the same orientation as here towards IMC and teachings and meditation. So welcome. So as an analogy, if there are two people standing on a hilltop and one person is standing quite skillfully on one foot, maybe even they have strong, that one foot is quite strong and the person can even stand on their tippy toe and just stand for a long time. And the other person has both feet firmly rooted in the ground and strong stance, legs apart a little bit. Then if a strong wind comes on the hill, strong gusts, they'll both experience the wind, the intensity of the wind, the wind itself in the same way. They're just as sensitive to it, just as susceptible to it. But the one standing on their tippy toes, one tippy toe, is not going to have the stability to be able to withstand, stand upright in the wind, will be pushed over. The one who has both feet, kind of wide stance, strong stance, rooted stance, maybe even their knees bent, maybe even leaning against the wind, will experience the wind just as much as the person standing on one foot. But the person rooted on the hillside won't be pushed over. So in the same way, we can be sensitive to all kinds of things and we can be sensitive in such a way that our own experience, our emotions, our thoughts, our feelings, the world around us, what's happening to other people, two people can be experienced, be sensitive, equally sensitive to what's coming their way. But one of them is doing the equivalent of standing on one foot or standing on their tippy toes. And the other one is doing the equivalent of being rooted, firm, kind of ballast, has a grounding, is kind of very, very stable on their feet, on their metaphoric feet. And both of them will experience life events the same way, the sensitivity to it. But the impact, it will have to be very different. One people will feel like the life events, the inner life, is just too much, is overwhelming. And they might blame the event. The other person will find it maybe intense or challenging in some ways, but they're able to keep their balance. And they're able to stay stable. And so they're not thrown off balance by it. And they feel content and confident that they can have a stance that supports them. And it's less inclined to say the events are overwhelming because they have that stability to handle it. So awareness can be on tippy toes or awareness can be well grounded, rooted, stable. And someone can be equally sensitive, equally kind of a sense of awareness to what's happening, but have this very different stance, very different rootedness to the experience. So when we sit to meditate, we want to kind of tune into this as well. Do we feel stable? Do we feel grounded? And that can be partly physical, a posture, a stance, a way of feeling the weight of the body. So that we're rooted here. It could also be with the awareness, where the awareness doesn't, it's not like a, you know, cotton ball that just gets pushed around in the wind. Awareness has a kind of stability, a kind of rootedness, a kind of both an openness, but a kind of a presence of being rooted in here. Yes, I'm aware. And this is where I kind of have this image of the weight of awareness. Awareness has no weight, but the weight of presence, the weight of being present. The awareness is kind of settled into the torso, especially settled into the belly. Here, the place where things are unstable is when we're aware, but the awareness is rooted in our thoughts and ideas and our stories and imagination. Then we get tossed around. But if awareness is connected, identified with the body, it can be a lot easier. So to assume a stable posture for meditation, to close the eyes and to feel the weight of your body, especially feel where the weight of your body rests on a chair, on a cushion, on the floor, whatever is supporting that weight. And taking some long, slow, deep breaths. And on the exhale, letting go into that support. Let the weight of your body be received by what holds the body, the weight of the body. And taking a few more deep breaths, gentle, not too much, but doing so in a way that as you inhale, your belly goes out. Relax your belly. The diaphragm as you breathe in is pushed down, and that pushes everything in the belly down and out. So to relax the belly, if the belly gets pushed out, there's a broader base at the bottom of your torso, providing support for the upper torso. Then letting the breathing return to normal. And still allow the belly to expand, expand and relax as you breathe in. The belly doesn't have to do any work to move. It's being moved by the diaphragm. So letting the belly kind of be pushed and then pulled in. And then on the exhale, relax in your body, scan through your body. See where parts of your body can relax. And as you do so, relax and let the weight of your body settle a bit. Now hold the And then letting yourself settle into your breathing. Feeling the breathing, the body breathing, in a rooted way, as if the breathing in the torso, the movements of the body in the torso, is a ballast, is a kind of strength and stability. And to be centered more in your body, your torso, than in your thinking mind, here. And as you're mindful, as you're aware, whatever you're aware of, be aware while rooted in the body. Be aware so that the body provides a ballast for your awareness. So awareness doesn't get pulled into our thoughts or feelings, or it doesn't get pushed around by them. So awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing from a place of stability, unmoved by the winds of the world. So awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing from a place of stability. So awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing from a place of stability. So awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing from a place of stability. So awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing from a place of stability. So awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing from a place of stability. So awareness can do its work of just knowing and recognizing and recognizing from a place of stability, recognizing from a place of comfort, recognizing from a place of stability, Can you relax your belly, your torso? And let the weight of your body settle a bit in order to provide more stability for mindfulness in the present moment. I am out and breathing just one second and I can not observe myself it? And then as we come to the end of the sitting, to take a few moments to really let yourself be stable here in your body, in your heart, in your mind, as if there is strong ballast, heavy ballast that keeps you rooted, grounded. So you're not pushed around by the waves, by the wind, by circumstances in life, you're just here in the middle of this tall, firm, strong. Firm, strong. And from this stability, to gaze upon the world kindly, to gaze upon the suffering of the world, the people you know, people in your area, people far away, to gaze upon this world suffering from a place of stability, careful to watch. If you lose a stability by being swept up into the mind's alarm, the mind's distress, the mind's worries, in the stability of the body, gaze upon the world kindly, compassionately, as if that is a phenomenal gift to give the world, just that, gazing upon the world with compassion, the eyes of kindness, the eyes of compassion, wishing, may all beings be free of their suffering, may all beings be free of all forms of affliction, may all beings be free of war and oppression, may all beings be free of hostility, be free of hostility from others and to others, may all beings live in peace, profound peace, free from all that troubles the heart, may all beings be happy. Thank you. Thank you.
