So I'll come.
So the theme.
Thought and freedom.
Maybe you're getting the sense that we have to weave in and out of meaning making.
And we have a kind of reverence for wise thought and a reverence for silence.
And this tradition, the inside tradition, it really does honor Samadhi, the kind of gathering of the mind, the unification of attention.
And that's where there's very little proliferation of meaning.
There's very little associative anything.
Maybe it's just sensations of the breath or the bliss of silence itself, or sometimes even thinner, just a kind of blackness that is blacker than black.
Just space and very little meaning.
And it's healing, it's healing not to be besieged by meanings.
You know, sometimes there's this sense of like, well, we have to learn from practice, we have to do vipassana, we have to do mindfulness in order to have insight, and that's fair enough.
But even when we're not learning, healing can be happening, deepening can be happening, the relief of not being besieged by meanings.
And it feels like shelter from an itch, shelter from an itch.
Sometimes we step out of meaning, all the meanings that we come to practice drowning in, into stillness, in order to make better meanings.
We call that insight, insight retreat center.
We're not talking our way into insight.
We're observing with a very flexible but potent mind.
Sometimes we use thoughts to surmount thought.
Reminders and slogans and mantras that we use thoughts to surmount thought.
It made me think of a philosopher Wittgenstein, who early in his career, especially was really trying to pare down philosophy.
He viewed so much of it as nonsensical, wrote this kind of treatise, which concluded with this.
He said, my propositions serve as elucidations in the following way.
Anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical.
When they have used as steps to climb up beyond them, they must so to speak throw away the latter after they have climbed up it.
They must transcend these propositions and then they will see the world aright.
This is how certain meditation instructions function, like a ladder we toss away when we use the steps.
Using thought to surmount thought.
But much of the change we experience on this path is driven by stories, by emotionally charged Dharma stories.
Dharma stories that help us organize our lives and our own unfolding, healing, awakening.
And so last night I quoted Martha Nussbaum saying, you can't really change the heart without telling a story.
And indeed when you look around these Dharma scenes, we have our stories with story of the Buddha,
story of Mara, forces of suffering, the story of suffering and release and a path.
And you, you have your stories too. Story of how you got into practice, of what has changed, of what hasn't, of what you aspire towards.
The stories that attempt to integrate all the bits of experience across time.
And there's this tendency in us that we always, with those stories, we always want to go to press, you know.
We want to publish. But they're always just drafts, yeah.
All stories have their limits, something that lies on the other side of them.
And so we, we cherish our stories and we are circumspect to.
William James said, nothing includes everything or dominates over everything, the word and trails along after every sentence.
Sometimes it's tragedy that shatters our story. Sometimes it's insight that shatters our story.
We have to put it back together, but not exactly in the same way.
As we live and as we practice, we are, we're learning how to tell our stories, how thoughts are useful, what stories are useful.
This is what Inez was pointing to last night, the kind of skillful skillfulness of the thought world.
And as we practice, we, we cultivate and develop and tailor our stories for our hearts.
So I was at a conference some years ago.
My MC teachers, Andrea Castillo was, was one of the presenters at this conference at spirit rock and and she was describing her experiences of teaching Dharma in Spanish and
she's recounting one of her, her students, a bilingual student said who had practiced in the Dharma scene and heard the Dharma in English.
But the students said the kind of like described the blessing of hearing hearing the Dharma in her first language. Yeah.
And the student use the phrase to hear the Dharma in my mother tongue.
There's something about that that always touches me.
That phrase became a kind of like mantra throughout the conference that I repeated another person repeated to hear the Dharma in your mother tongue.
And we, we all need to hear the Dharma in our mother tongue. Yeah. Meaning, you know, the language of our own, our own heart.
Ajahn Sajito said,
Generally, people say the past starts with wise view. He said like, yeah, okay, fair enough.
But the path truly begins when the Buddha walks into your heart.
There's a very personal encounter, very idiosyncratic encounter.
And
sometimes when I, when I start practice discussions and, you know, I'll say,
in a group of whatever six people or eight people, I'll say, you know, in the main hall, we have to say one thing to 70 people.
And
and to say the same thing to 70 people is almost criminally negligent, you know,
like, because
how do we honor the idiosyncrasies of this path of how
our path unfolds.
The path is very, very personalized and our histories and personalities and emotional styles all matter. Yeah.
And so we have to, we have to hear the Dharma in our mother tongue.
We have to develop ways of speaking about our practice to ourselves that are empowering.
I was looking back at some old old notes and I saw notes from a talk I gave in the summer of 2008.
I must have just started teaching.
And
the talk was about how Dharma practice is a kind of series of pep talks that we develop for ourselves.
And
that we need to tailor our pep talks. They have to be in our mother tongue.
They can't be generic of
let go, be mindful, be nice, be whatever, like it really has to resonate with ourselves, you know,
when we have to develop like a sense of what we need to hear.
And sometimes the language is just subtle differences, but it really matters at how almost that puzzle piece locks into our heart.
This is from the 1800s. Patrul Rinpoche, this, this is a pep talk. Yeah.
It's a famous pep talk.
Advice from me to myself.
Listen up old bad karma, Patrul, you dweller in distraction.
For ages now you've been beguiled, entranced and fooled by appearances.
Are you aware of that? Are you?
Write this very instant when you're under the spell of mistaken perception.
You've got to watch out. Don't let yourself get carried away by this empty life.
Your mind is spinning around carrying spinning around about carrying out a lot of useless projects.
It is a waste. Give it up.
Thinking about the hundred plans you want to accomplish with never enough time to finish them just weighs down your mind.
You're completely distracted by all these projects, which never come to an end, but keep spreading out more like ripples in water.
Don't be a fool for once. Just sit tight.
And then the passage culminates with them. Let go of everything, everything.
So I wanted to share a few thoughts.
Thoughts that have become my pep talks.
Thoughts that I've picked up along the way.
From here to there that have become a little bit of a mantra in my heart and mind.
Quite early in practice. I don't even remember how.
But I hooked up with this lovely group of very senior practitioners in a Tibetan Buddhist lineage.
One of them, this woman, had done the three-year retreat. She was a lama, this other long-time practitioner, a fascinating Shakespearean actor, all these characters, and then me, you know, 23 or something.
And, yeah, it was just like, where am I? And they were students of Zeke-Kang-Tru Rinpoche, who we would hook up a speakerphone.
It was not the plush elegance of the IRO, Zoom situation. It was a speakerphone.
And we would call into Creston, Colorado.
And the line that stayed in my heart was, Kang-Tru Rinpoche said,
Are you trying to rearrange the furniture in your dream or wake up?
Sometimes you really need this kind of jarring possibility.
I've been trying to rearrange the furniture in my dream.
And it was this kind of like exhilaration, like, oh my goodness, maybe I'm kind of trying to do this whole life thing a little wrong.
And that didn't spark some kind of spasm of self-harshness.
It was just like insight, even if it's jarring or sad or whatever, insight tastes delicious.
That sense of just like unintimidated by truth.
And it may cut deep in one way, but it feels good in another.
It feels like relief.
And that line, that line, just the way that was articulated, just sort of startled me into deeper questions and deeper renunciation and this sort of like, wow, what have I walked into here?
This is not what I bargained for.
And the Dharma, you know, it deepens when the kind of frame expands, you know, when the Dharma frame expands.
Our aspirations, the way we start practice, the way we go about practice, we almost always start too small.
We're sort of like, and without really knowing it, for me, I was just like trying to wedge the Dharma into the infrastructure of my neurosis to rearrange the furniture.
And I did have the sense, like the kind of slightly haunting sense that the way I was living wasn't going to work out.
Even if I kept getting better at it, I had the sense of like, this isn't going to work out.
And so there was a certain kind of ecstasy in the possibility, like maybe there is a path.
And so I found myself kind of in the deep end of all of this, quite early in practice, that it wasn't about getting happier within the framework I had imagined for my life.
It was productive, you know, that I cut through the tendency to turn myself into a kind of self-improvement project.
And it was startling, but on this path, you don't get to decide what you wake up to.
You don't get to design your own healing or pick the fruits of practice as if in a candy store.
But I knew in that moment that I was fortunate to have encountered a kind of radical way of approaching the human condition.
The context of a small, very small bit of Zen practice I did received the instruction to sit, sit like a dying person.
And there are really, really two sides of that, at least the way I interpreted it.
But one is, of course, a reflection on mortality, tenderness and grief and loss, and the other is a kind of something about non-delusion, non-delusion.
And they're linked, they're linked.
You know, if we don't develop a conscious relationship with helplessness, we become rigid, defensive, aggressive, the sense of self congeals.
Some of what our practice is, is developing even just like one tiny bit of equanimity with helplessness.
And we are, as humans, maybe say we're desiring machines and every desire includes our existence in it.
And that makes death a very serious problem.
And I sometimes share like that as one of my memories as a kid was like, I would imagine things falling away, you know, almost like a kind of experiment, a little emotional experiment I would do with myself.
Like, I'd imagine things falling away.
I'd imagine first that, like, I did not exist, that I was not born, and then that my family didn't, and humans, the human species, and the world, and the solar system, and the universe, and history, and time itself,
and nothing, nothing existed, and all the kind of light and color of the world would like momentarily fade out.
And then I would totally freak out. And I don't know, maybe I was getting a kind of tiny glimpse into emptiness, like just the contingency of all things, that there was a sense of my life was guaranteed by something,
my life was ordained by something, the necessity of me in this world, the necessity of everything that I knew, and there was just a sense like it could have been otherwise, and nothing guarantees anything.
And without really knowing it, I think I got into practice deeply, because I realized the immensity of losing everything.
And I've been very, even though I did not directly face loss early in life, I've been very conscious, it's been very close to my heart since I was quite young.
And even when as a young person I would see older people, I would not feel separate, I would see sick people, I would not feel separate.
And Susan Sontag said, everyone who is born holds dual citizenship in the kingdom of the well and the kingdom of the sick, although we all prefer to use the good passport.
Sooner or later, each of us is obliged to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.
My paternal grandma, my dad's mom, died before I was born, died when my dad was 12, just before his bar mitzvah.
And sometimes I would think like, okay, here's my dad, here's this boy, 12 years old, mom is dead, his dad, my grandfather had a serious psychiatric illness, here's this, my dad, this boy.
And he and his brother, not accidental, studied medicine, trying maybe to master health and illness and death.
And so somehow transmitted through the kind of, through the generations, there's this sense, this sense in me, like I needed to do a lot of work on my heart to prepare my heart over a long period of time to actually open to the changingness of life.
And to the inevitability of loss.
And I needed a path that would hold death in a kind of reverential way.
And this is what motivated the Buddhist path, after all, at the truth of Anicha.
And it just seemed like this looming force in my own heart and mind. And there are, yeah, powerful ideas, ideas from social psychology research that as animals who are self aware that can conceive of our own death,
the fear, the resulting fear, often makes us defensive.
It doesn't have to, I don't think it has to, but typically the fear makes us, we build defensive stories.
We build meaning in a way to defend ourselves with literal or some kind of symbolic immortality.
The literal of, I will not die, or the symbolic of, well, I will die, but I'm an American, and that continues, or I'm a Buddhist, or I'm a whatever.
And then according to this set of ideas, terror management, even self-esteem has a defensive quality that I am an enduring, significant being rather than I am one out of a trillion animals.
So Anicha was onto this, of course.
Shortly after his enlightenment, he said, the world is held by being afflicted by being, yet delights in being.
What relishes brings fear, and what it fears is pain. This holy life is lived to abandon suffering.
Now I don't know how idealistic to get about all of this, and we're not living a monastic life, but I do feel like developing the heart, developing the heart in this realm, even a little bit, offers a lot of freedom.
This mortality met with our habit energies, met unconsciously, will tend to harden our heart rather than soften it, and will tend to harden to congeal sense of self.
In a way, it may be the self congeals, kind of, we hallucinate the sense of self to orchestrate our own survival.
That a very sense of self is a kind of effect of a certain kind of fear, the need to manage to control samsara.
And so from this point of view, the very experience of self has a kind of defensive, fearful quality.
And so when I hear this, when I say this, to sit, sit like a dying person, some of it is acclimatizing to the truth of a Nietzsche, and some of it is cutting through some of the delusion and the pettiness and the clinging and the selfing that arise out of
the mortality awareness.
Camus said, come to terms with death, thereafter, anything is possible. And this exploration offers the opportunity to consider what this moment might be like if it were futureless.
That's one of the aspects of this invitation to consider this moment if it were futureless.
How open it might feel.
How little sense clinging would make.
How deeply we might let go.
And maybe you can even sense into that openness right now.
Just how differently the moment would be if we were unentangled by becoming.
So just sketching like ways in which the self may be a kind of effect of fear, but it's also what makes death so terrifying.
The perishing of the Matthew within Matthew.
And I don't think it's a complete consolation. I don't think it absolves us of the work of grieving and the tenderness and the beauty of that.
But when we do know there's no Matthew within Matthew, the way we imagine.
No Matthew within Matthew that it will be destroyed by death.
It's not complete consolation, but it becomes less of a drama.
Rumi says if you bake bread with the wheat that grows on my grave, you'll become drunk with joy, and even the oven will recite ecstatic poems.
If you come to pay your respects, even my gravestone will invite you to dance, so don't come without your drum.
Last one, quickly. Charlotte Chocobac.
With unfailing kindness life shows us exactly what we need to learn.
It just pops up.
Now first, this doesn't mean this is a just world, and it doesn't mean that harm happens for a good reason.
It doesn't mean that harm is deserved in any way.
This is not that. This is an empowering framework for welcoming the truth of the past, all of life into our heart.
This is a view, a way of approaching life. Ajahn Shastra, everything is teaching us.
And so Chocobac here is inviting us to shift into a mode of living where it's not about getting, but about learning. The mode of our life is about learning rather than getting.
And then it's not that we don't try to get what we want, but what does pop up we take as an opportunity for the cultivation of wisdom and love?
And we know there's nowhere to go other than the heart.
If I thought there were an escape, if I thought there were viable alternatives to love and awareness, I would take them, I would.
But as I said, the only way forward is through.
And when we take that teaching into our heart, the prospects of the future are somehow less intimidating.
We kind of already know there's no escape.
And so it's like, okay, come what may, I will learn.
My practice will be there for me.
That too is a consolation.
Not always the medicine to surrender, but that helps me to surrender when surrender is the medicine.
It helps me sense that the difficulty of this life will not be wasted.
I will not squander it.
I will not let it be meaningless.
I will use it.
Maybe so.
That's it for a minute.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you.
Yeah, so it's now your job to decide what to pick up from that and what to leave behind. Yeah, it's your path, your pep talks.
Pick up my weirdness, you know, you just find your way.
Okay.
