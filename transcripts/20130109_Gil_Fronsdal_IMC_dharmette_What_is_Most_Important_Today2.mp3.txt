 
 Dharmette: What is Most 
Important Today  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by 
Gil Fronsdal on January 9, 2013  
 
 
Perhaps because it is my first Wednesday 
morning talk of the new year , I would like to say 
that the motivation to do meditation practice, t o 
do mindfulness practice, to be involved in  
Buddhist practice can arise out of giving a 
tremendous amount of value to your heart, a 
tremendous amount of value to your inner 
capacity for peace, for freedom, for love, for 
compassion.  
 
I think it is easy enough in Buddhist circles to 
think that Buddhism can dismiss those things as 
being valuable . Just let go ; don’t be attached  to 
things;  everything is ok. This can lend itself 
almost to a di smissal of these things as being 
important. But I think that the reason we let go of 
attachments and clinging is because there is 
really something important on the other side of 
letting go. What we do with our lives, what we 
experience in our lives, is act ually quite an  
 important thing to be involved in. Questioning 
what is valuable is a very important part of 
Buddhist practice, because some of the things 
that we may consider valuable are not so 
valuable after all.  
 
The question of what is valuable, of what we 
invest in, can be  explored through the 
perspective of so meone watching how you use  
your time – and they couldn’t ask you – what 
conclusion wo uld they get from watching you? 
What would be the thing  that you spend most of 
your time doing? What would they see?  
 
When you come home in the evening, what do 
you do? If someone came down from Mars and 
saw you, what would they see? Evening time in 
the United States is an important time with 
certain patterns  for people . People sit in front of 
screens, almost like sacred altars. People spend 
more time in front of screens than in church. If 
you look at the values behind that, would that 
give you a different perspective on your life than 
if you just ask yourself directly what is most 
important for you?  
 
To ask t he question , “What is most important for 
you – what  are the most important intentions  
 and values  are that  you want to live by ?” is one 
of the great precious questions to carry. Again, 
Buddhist teachings can seem to negate the 
importance of these kinds of q uestions : just be 
in the present moment , and everything will take 
care of itself. Even sometimes when people ask 
the question of the meaning of life, a teacher 
may say that isn’t important  – just be present 
fully. But to actually spend time considering wha t 
is important for you, what your deepest values 
and intentions are, I think , is a tremendously 
important  part of practice. If you are in touch 
with what is important for you, then that can be a 
fuel, an inspiration to act on, to live by.  
 
If you don’t spend time reflecting that way, it can 
be easy to live by other people’s values. Our 
society is filled with people who want to tell you 
the values that you should live by. For those 
people who sit in front of screens, there are a lot 
of people  who have paid a lot in the advertising 
business to convince you how to spend your 
time and money. It travels through our culture : 
values of consumerism  that p eople then elevate 
as being really important.  
 
But what is really important? Part of the value o f 
doing a morning of meditation like today or going  
 on retreat is not just the peace you might 
experience , or the spiri tual experience you might 
have. But in the quiet and stillness of the letting 
go in this kind of practice, you can give yourself 
time and  space to reflect more deeply from 
some deep place inside  on what’s important for 
you, and then make a decision that you are 
going to change your life, and do things 
differently.  
 
The deeper a person’s spiritual experience in 
Buddhism, the greater the opp ortunity there is to 
make a decision to align one’s life by the vision 
one has from that experience. To go along with 
some idea that everything is go ing ok : to be 
present for things as they are, that to have deep 
spiritual experiences is fine, to have shal low 
experiences is fine, it’s all fine. There is 
something really wise about that approach. But it 
can also do you a disservice when you  don’t 
take the lessons  of the value and importance of 
the things that happen to us , and use them to 
understand or be in spired to live a life that 
comes from what is most important to us, that 
feeds and expresses what is most important for 
us.  
 
Often as a culture we use the beginning of the  
 new year as a chance to step back and reflect 
on what our deepest values, our deepest 
intentions  are. I find that that reflection is good to 
do every day, not just at the beginning of the 
new year. I spend a lot of my practice life with 
this kind of daily basic ordinary reflection: What 
is my deepest intention ? For a year , I asked 
myself the question every morning, “If I knew I 
would die tonight, how would I live this day ?” It 
was a way of asking myself from a different 
perspective, what is most important for me, what 
is my deepest intention ? And what was 
fascinating over the course of the year was to 
see how things shifted and changed for me. 
That consistent ly asking the question of what is 
my deepest intention begins working the edges 
of that, begins exploring  it. You begin finding 
that there are different levels of answers. If you 
only ask yourself the question once and get one 
answer , you might not be dropping deeper and 
deeper into the levels, the  layers  of what might  
be revealed through that kind of  question ing.  
 
My wish for all of you who are interested in 
meditation practice, in mindfulness practice , is 
that the practice supports your deepest 
intentions, what is most important for you, the 
deepest values of your heart  that you know and  
 can be in touch with – that somehow 
mindfulness helps you be in touch with that , and 
supports you to live by it.  
 
It’s a great thing to do.
