The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So warm greetings for everyone.
Happy to have you all here.
Before the pandemic, we used to broadcast these Sunday morning talks on YouTube,
but I never thought about the people on YouTube.
But now I do. So now, clearly, they're right there.
Where the camera is.
So thank you for those of you logging in today.
So the topic that I want to talk about today is time.
It's been on my mind lately.
And I want to tell you a story from my time at the monastery, Tosahara.
I was the kitchen manager, I guess.
So I was like the person most responsible for the production of the food and the meals.
There's a crew of anywhere from maybe four to sometimes 10, depending on the time of the year,
that I supervised.
And now, but during the retreat time, we had three months of retreats.
And at that time, in Zen, things are highly choreographed.
The schedule is really clear and set.
And it's kind of like time is one of the teachers in Zen monastery,
because you have to kind of do things on time.
And also you have to stop on time.
One of the great challenges was we'd have this 15-minute cleaning period,
raking the grounds or sweeping or doing something.
And when the bell rang to end it, you couldn't just keep doing it to finish the job.
When the time to end happened, you were supposed to stop.
And then it took a training people to learn it's okay to stop.
Next day, you could do it some more.
So everything's choreographed on time.
And so one of the things that was that was meals.
And meals basically had to be served up in the meditation hall
at the minute that they were supposed to be there,
because they saw this ritual beforehand.
And so the ritual, people were chanting and bowing and doing all this stuff,
and then sitting there and sitting in the meditation hall,
just for the meal to come.
And in order for it all to go smoothly, the meal had to be there right on time.
So I don't remember exactly when lunch was,
but maybe the food had to be ready at the door of the meditation hall,
at something like 12.15 or 12.20.
And then we had this, and it was kind of hectic to get everything ready.
But then one of the rules, one of the practices of the monastery,
when you worked in the kitchen at noon, exactly at 12 o'clock,
everyone had to, all the cooks had to stop what they were doing,
go in front of the kitchen altar and chant the heart sutra, chant this text.
And I would regularly, since I was supervising, be aghast.
No, we're never going to get done.
And we have all the stuff to do in just 15 minutes before suppose we served up.
No.
But you had to do it.
So we would chant the heart sutra.
And always when we finished chanting, there was more time to get it done without fail.
Meal was always ready.
But somehow the sense of time for me was very much tied up in how busy my mind was,
how much my mind was concerned with all the things and the desires and the complications.
And my mind was crowded.
And somehow that crowded impulse of the mind, the pressure of the mind,
had a very different feeling about time than after chanting, my mind got calm and settled.
And then there was more space in my mind, more calm in my mind.
And they just seemed like, oh yeah, we have time. And somehow, I don't know if we worked naturally faster
or just it was all an illusion in my mind.
But we always had time.
So in the years since then, there have been times when I feel like I'm running out of time.
I'm too hectic, too much to do. What am I going to do?
I don't know which foot to stand on because there's so much to do.
And I learned that if that happens, I just do one more thing.
And that seems impossible, right? Which is sit down to meditate.
And I'll meditate for 10 minutes.
And then when I come up, suddenly, oh, there's time. I'll do this now.
And I'm still here. I've survived.
And so it always works out. It's remarkable to do this.
But I had no one waiting for me. So it wasn't like, you know,
it took the 10 minutes when people were early up in the car ready for me to come.
That wouldn't make sense.
But so time, the sense of time, our relationship time,
is a fascinating topic, an important topic,
because a lot of suffering that people have is directly or indirectly connected to the topic of time.
And if we consider a little bit the nature of time
and how we live in time and often in subconscious ways, unconscious ways,
it starts seeing our life in a different way.
Some people are time poor, impoverished in time
because time is constantly slipping away. They're running out of time.
They didn't have enough time, so they ran out of time for whatever they had to do.
Their time has deadlines and things, you know,
have to finish before a certain time.
And people are struggling with these notions about time.
And part of it is the nature of, you know, industrial society
when things became, started getting regimented and organized
that people started to have to show up at these factories at a particular time
and had to have teams of people, had to kind of be organized shifts and all kinds of things.
And then with the industrial kind of idea of schedule time,
there arose the idea of school time.
And my understanding is that school time was kind of modeled on what happened in factories.
So then school time became very regimented.
I guess people didn't go, a lot of people didn't go to school before that
or education happened in a different way. There was not so time-centric, you know.
And I remember when in high school the bell rang and we'd leave the classroom
and it was just like this sea of humanity in the hallway, you know,
jostling for their way to the next classroom.
But if you left the classrooms to go somewhere during class,
it was really peaceful in the hallways. But, you know, this rhythm of temporal rhythm
that we were living in then, that was...
And I don't know, you know, nowadays Zen monasteries in Japan and America
that are very time-centric. I don't know if that was always the case.
I don't know when that started.
In the ancient times in Zen, they knew when to end the morning meditation
when the person who could see the bell could look at their palm and see the lines in their palm.
So that's a kind of different kind of time than waiting for the clock to, you know,
clock hands to be in a certain position.
So, you know, so we've kind of lived in time.
And the other day I was reading about, you know, it was parts of our society now
are running on nanoseconds, you know, partial nanoseconds.
So the GPS devices many of us use, right?
Because many of us kind of depend on GPS devices.
GPS devices with these satellites, they're 12,000 miles above the Earth.
But every day there's a time correction because these nanosecond difference
between those satellites, the time on the satellites and the time that we live in
is all, it needs to be, in order for their measurements all work,
has to be exactly the same time.
And so these, you know, nanoseconds, partial, you know, 0.10 nanoseconds
is something of time difference has to be corrected for 100 nanoseconds.
It's come down to that.
I don't think in the time of the Buddha he thought much about nanoseconds.
He had to worry about it.
So it's kind of remarkable, but it's also remarkable that I think that just in my lifetime
how much time has become more and more of a pressing thing and issue and an event
that we live by.
And so it's easy to imagine that we become time poor.
We don't have enough time.
We wish we had more time.
And some of it is that there's so much available to us
and there's a kind of hunger for it and expectation we should be able to get to
everything that's made available to us.
I still remember fondly all kinds of, you know, times in my life when I was young
of looking back at it now,
there was no internet.
There was no cell phones.
What did I do?
You know, you know, I'd go the whole day
without checking for a message on my phone.
Is that legal?
Or possible?
But I remember I have happy memories now.
I didn't think about it then.
But now, these many years later, I actually have a visceral memory
of walking around San Francisco with lots of time.
And the streets being, compared to other traffic now,
they were spacious.
The whole feeling of the city has changed.
And that was one of the great values of the monastery.
All of her monasteries and retreat centers I've been at
is how the relationship to time changes so radically
so that there's no time pressure, very little time pressure,
even though there's cooks have to be had things on time.
There was also lots of space, lots of time.
And there wasn't so much to do.
You weren't supposed to, you didn't have to check the internet and news.
And my kids watch TV programs on their computer.
And I'm just amazed how many there seems to be.
I mean, it's like you could spend your life watching new TV programs
and not get to them all.
That would be a sad life, wouldn't it?
If you didn't get to them all.
So the point being that there's so much to do that can do
and were available to us in a way that hasn't been available
for people for until recent times.
It's a phenomenal thing to live in this world.
So I take some care to learn and navigate the world of time
and learn to navigate the world of all these possibilities that exist for us.
And today's topic is time.
How to be time rich.
If you want to be rich, be rich in time.
Spacious time.
Live in spacious time.
Not tight time.
Contracted time.
Live in a kind of boundless time
as opposed to a bounded time that's bounded by all the concerns and needs
and duties and responsibilities.
And so one of the things I learned in the monastery was to live in time
like this schedule of things that have to be done at a certain time
but do it within spacious time.
So the two don't have to be separate from each other.
There's a way to be relaxed, calm, and fully engaged.
Working in the monastery sometimes was very active, engaged work.
And there was a spacious time for it.
Sometimes time would kind of disappear
because of the full engagement in what we're doing.
So meditation.
Meditation is a wonderful reference point
for discovering our relationship to time.
And in many ways meditation is a time to do something very different
than what we usually do in our lives.
And then in that difference have the difference highlighted.
So if we're always running around being busy
and it's become second nature to do that
and then what's the problem?
That's what everyone else is doing too.
And then you sit down to meditate
and you feel the cost of that running around.
You feel the impact it has of a distracted mind, a tense body.
And then in meditation because of the contrast
then we can see the busyness in a way we couldn't do it when we were living in it.
Because he is in a different way.
So meditation is a reference point to understand ourselves.
And that's a different purpose than thinking meditation is about becoming calm.
It's fine for it to help you become calmer.
But if that's all about, you're not going to become wise
about how you operate when you're not calm.
And if you use meditation a little bit start seeing the contrast,
use it as a look, a standard kind of
to see, really get to know yourself better what's going on.
So when we first sit and meditate,
let me not first, sooner or later,
most people will notice that their mind is distracted.
And they bring the mind back to their breath.
Then they get distracted again.
Come back to the breath.
They get distracted.
So to be distracted, chances are you're living in time.
You're caught up in time in some way.
So to ask yourself the question,
when you're distracted from the present moment,
are you thinking about the past,
kind of living in the past, thinking in the past,
are you thinking about the future?
Are you somehow actively, distractingly,
thinking about the present?
Maybe the present that's not here, but someplace else.
Or are you thinking in kind of a mythic, fictional time?
Fantasies don't exist in time exactly.
They can just be a fantasy.
Or you might be solving some wonderful problem
or task or something,
writing the great American novel in your head.
So that's kind of like outside of time.
So it's kind of, I call it mythic time or fictional time.
Which is your tendency?
Which is your default?
Where do you attend to go in time when you get distracted?
Do you attend when you get distracted?
Is it more often in the past?
Is it more often in the future?
Is it more often about things happening in the present,
but not here and now?
Is it more often do you get distracted
by what's actually happening here and now?
And like you can sit here and meditate
with a room full of people and just have your eyes closed.
There are a lot of different kinds of masks
that people are wearing right now.
I can't remember because my eyes are closed.
Let me see if I remember their color and their shape.
I wonder if someone had the ideal mask.
I'll try to remember what that person had that kind of shape.
That's distracted thinking, right?
But it's about the present moment.
So where does your mind go?
What does it do?
And if there's a pattern for you,
what does it tell you?
What does it say about you?
If you're mostly thinking about the past,
what are the values?
What are the priorities?
What are the desires?
What are the concerns you have
that keep bringing you back into the past?
If it's mostly about the future,
what are the concerns?
What are the values?
What is the energy?
What is it about the future
that keeps pulling you into the future?
And so forth for the other ones.
So to try to understand oneself deeper,
what's going on here?
For the purpose of meditation,
knowing what it is,
not just knowing that you're thinking about
that past, future, and so forth,
but to know, you know,
oh, this is my pattern.
And this is kind of what's driving the pattern.
It helps you then
to bring your mindfulness to something deeper
than the distracted thought.
If you're thinking about the past,
because you still feel hurt
about what happened years ago,
and you're trying to navigate and negotiate
and figure out the hurt,
and who did what, and who was to blame,
who was responsible, what you could have done,
and just reviewing it
and reliving what happened a long time ago,
maybe that hurt still festers.
And that hurt might need our attention.
The hurt is always in the present moment.
And if we want to heal the hurt,
it's probably not going to be healed
by making a better past,
thinking about it,
but rather to really meet the pain
and learn how to sit with that
in the present moment.
If we're thinking about the future,
some people, they think about the future
because they're planning,
and they're, you know, anxious about the future,
the anxiety is what needs our attention.
Or maybe it's delightful anticipation.
I know people who just seem to have a joy
in anticipating things.
And one of my sons was that way.
He would just lay in bed,
and he'd be anticipating planning,
and it seemed like that was like,
and sometimes he loved,
like when he was a little kid,
he loved building a stage for play.
But the play would never happen.
And that was besides the point.
It was just the building, anticipating,
and there was so much fun.
And then he'd build it,
and then he'd go on to do something else.
And so there's, you know,
sometimes it's joy that brings us into past
and future and being distracted.
So that's nice.
But if you bring your present moment attention
into the joy and follow that back
to the source,
follow that back inside to what's going on,
that's a very different movement
to arrive in the present moment
than continually kind of batting away
distracted thoughts and letting go
and coming back, letting go and coming back.
Because you're getting to the underlying source
from which these distracted thoughts
are bubbling up from.
Probably something that's close, more intimate
and more important and closer to something value,
you know, really important about yourself.
So that's one way meditation
can be a reference point
and seeing, understanding
what's going on with our distracted thinking.
Another thing about distracted thinking
is that there's probably desires
involved in them
that are time-sensitive, time concerns.
And so how does time
operate in the concern itself?
And so, for example,
being anxious and planning in the future,
it's because something is, again, time-bounded
and I have to get it done in a certain time.
And so let me think about ahead of time
so I can do it fast enough or efficient enough.
So time comes into play.
But as we settle down more in meditation,
then, and we're no longer so distracted
but here and present,
time can still be an operating concern.
It could be that, yeah, I'm present,
but they better ring the bell.
You know, when is this meditation going to be over?
Yes, I've been present,
but I've been present long enough.
And so there's maybe restlessness coming up
and wanting something to come to an end.
Or it could be that we're trying to get concentrated
or calm or something.
And so there's an attainment focus
about attaining something in the future,
hopefully in the next minute or something.
But still, it's like leaning into the future
and operating on the assumption that you have time
in the future time
and that you can kind of navigate
and try to attain something in the future.
And so time is operating, again.
We're kind of being...
I don't know if it's too strong a language,
but we're being led around by time
or we're caught up in time.
What happens if we don't have a future in meditation?
What happens if it's just about the present moment?
So we would then no longer be attaining anything
because attaining is always in the future.
And so it's a little bit of a fantasy.
And sometimes we do attain things.
We do get calmer.
So sometimes we can practice in such a way
that good things happen to us.
So it's not like it's illegal to do it
and impossible to do it,
but it is operating in time.
And as the mind gets quieter,
sooner or later,
you'll notice that any concern about the future
is a bit of a drag for the mind.
Any concern for the future
means the mind is activated
with a certain activity of thinking
that's time involved.
And what's fascinating about this
is we start discovering how much we are...
the time belongs to a conceptual world that we create.
At least the time that we experience.
The time that we live in
is born in our minds,
in how our minds operate.
And it's not like...
time is not like the time that we live in,
the time that we're operating under,
is not cost-free.
It's not like, you know,
the air that's just always here for us
and we can just breathe and not have to think about it.
There's sometimes an idea that time just exists.
There's a big debate in philosophy.
Does time exist? Does it not exist?
How does it exist? What is time?
Independent of those kinds of concerns,
meditators can learn,
as their mind gets quiet,
that the very conceiving of things
dependent on time
takes mental energy,
takes a kind of mental work.
And if the mind is quiet enough,
you'll see that work as being agitating.
If you're super-agitated to begin with,
the level of agitation about the future
is so subtle that it's inconsequential.
It doesn't mean anything. You can't give me a break.
But when the mind is really quiet,
we start seeing that the activity
of even being concerned about a future
takes work.
It's agitating. It's ripples.
You know, on the surface of the mind's lake.
Thinking about the past, same thing.
So then, if you want to settle more,
we let go of past and future.
And the way we do it in mindfulness practice,
you can just let go of it, of course,
but one way is, again, always turning towards
what's going on.
Where's that work? Where's that pressure?
Yes, it feels like there's agitation,
very subtle pressure,
a little piece of stress having to do with
this past and future.
Where is it?
Now, can I hold it? Can I bring my attention to it?
So not let go of it as the first chance you have,
but keep coming back and feeling it and sensing it.
And one of the advantages of doing that,
it's kind of like starting to bring you,
moving you back to the source,
to use a kind of Buddhist language.
And you're kind of following the stream back to the source.
And what is that source?
You're following it back, back.
And then, as the mind gets quieter,
it's fascinating that even
concern for any kind of subtle, subtle concern
is where, like if you're following your breath,
in-breath, any idea that there's an end to the out-breath
is extra.
Any idea that the beginning of the out-breath just happened
is extra.
What happens when you're just with experience or breathing
without the past and the future?
It can be very peaceful.
It can be very settled.
No past, no future, just this moment of the breathing,
as if kind of like it's forever.
Of course it isn't forever,
but it becomes something else, it becomes something else.
But every new thing is just itself,
just that moment, just the experience.
And some people will say that the moment of experience
and time have become no different from each other,
but just this time, just this.
And so you can see that, for example,
they start seeing it and eating a meal.
If you're eating quietly, not talking on your device,
but just eating, lifting a fork up to your mouth.
It's kind of goal-oriented, right?
You're trying to get it up into the mouth
in a timely way.
But what if you're living just without a past and a future?
There's like an infinite time for bringing that fork up to your mouth.
It's qualitatively a different way of experiencing eating
than if a very subtle part of the mind
is concerned about the results of the action,
of getting it up there to the mouth.
You can put it in the mouth and put another mouthful of food on the fork quickly.
And it starts being sensitive, walking down the steps.
Each stepping is without a past and a future.
As that becomes available, that sense of that,
I don't know if you can ever do it 100% perfectly,
but that's not the point, is to do it perfectly.
The point is to see, use that as a reference point.
You get a sense, oh, just too close to the present, just this.
And then we see, oh, there's still a little bit of greed or desire operating
for something to be different in the next moment.
Or a little bit of pressure to get to the bottom of the steps,
as opposed to just walking down the steps, just walking.
When eating, just eating.
But I have so many things to do.
I can't just walk down the steps.
I have all this stuff that has to be done,
and I have to get there quickly,
and if I don't, the sky will fall down,
and just walking, just this.
But I have to be ready, and just walking.
And it's possible you'll discover that if you're walking someplace,
and you just walk without future in the past,
this activity is the thing of the moment.
When you come to the next activity, you're actually in a better space.
To meet it, take care of it, be present for it.
Then if you were hurried and came out of breath,
and you have all these things to do,
and now I'm here, and I have to do this quickly,
so I can move on to the next thing.
There have been times when I've started one thing,
and as soon as I start that thing,
which I've been thinking about for a while to get to,
I'm already thinking about the next thing I have to do,
or the next two things, or three things I have to do.
And this momentum of the mind,
this habit formation of the mind to live in time,
to live concerned about doing, and getting, and getting to the next.
What's in the future? What's in the future?
It's rather unfortunate how strong it can operate in some people's minds.
So as we meditate, we get to see all this.
And hopefully one of the opportunities in meditation
is to really see your mind clearly,
and how it's living in time, its relationship to time,
and how much you can put down time,
and quiet the conceptualization, the conceiving of time that we do.
And one of the fascinating feelings you can get from all this
is the feeling that time always begins in the present.
That's where time begins.
The past begins in the present,
because we conceive of the past.
In a few minutes we'll leave here,
and this talk will only exist for you
in how you conceive of it, how you remember it,
how your mind reconstructs it, being here, what it's like.
So when you leave out the door,
the talk only exists in some kind of way in your memory.
When this talk becomes the past,
that past was born here.
The past is born in the present.
That's a very different idea
of a linear movement into the future.
It looks like it's aligned.
The past is behind us, and the future is ahead of us.
Some cultures have the future coming towards us.
But anyway,
what happens if we understand that time, future, time past,
begins in the present?
If that's the case, the present is the source
for all time, past and future, in a certain kind of way.
And if that's the case,
how are we going to be responsible?
How are we going to be intimate?
How are we going to care for ourselves
at that important juncture, this present moment
where time begins?
Are we creating time as a gift?
Are we creating time as something that's useful
and healthy for us and for others?
We are the creators of time,
at least for our own minds.
We are the creators of the past,
the creators of the future in a certain kind of way.
So it gives us a phenomenal vantage point,
a phenomenal potential
to live in the world a very different way around time.
And so if you feel harried by time,
if you feel in a hurry in the world of time,
you've constructed that time.
That's been born in your mind.
Is that what you want to have produced in your mind
for the world?
Is that your gift to the world?
A hurried mind, a harried mind?
What happens if you construct a different time?
Is there a timeless time?
Is there a spacious time?
Is there a way of holding the events of your life,
past, future and present,
in a wide open time?
And that I think is one of the gifts of meditation
is that to the degree to which we can get calm in meditation,
it slows down the insistent kind of rush of thoughts, ideas,
constructions, conceivings that the mind does.
And one of those conceivings is the conceivings around time.
And so you get a sense, you get a feeling
that time is now opened up, is more spacious.
And that is a valuable place to take care.
It's a valuable place to value, to see it as important,
to see it as a teacher,
to see it as reflecting on what is important
and your role in staying close to it
and your role in losing it.
And if you find yourself in a hurry,
you become attached to something.
You become hurrying without attachment.
But there can be doing things fast without hurrying.
There can be doing things fast without attachment.
But you can't hurry without there being attachment.
So as we slow down in this becoming more spacious time,
we have then the opportunity to discover what these attachments are.
And why do we live with these attachments?
Why do we give them so much authority?
Why do we think that they're required and so unnecessary
and so important?
Follow that idea back to the source.
Where does that come from?
Where does that arise from in you?
What are the beliefs?
What are the deeper feelings and emotions
that give rise to the attachment that causes hurry?
So there is time poverty,
which I think has been growing for our modern society.
More and more people are impoverished in time.
And then there's being rich in time, abundance of time,
that is only a moment away.
Or we have to be faster these days.
It's only a nanosecond away.
The abundance of time that's always here.
So I hope that this gives you something a little different than usual
to be curious about and consider and talk to your friends about
and study your mind with.
May time become your friend,
but you becoming friend's time.
Thank you.
