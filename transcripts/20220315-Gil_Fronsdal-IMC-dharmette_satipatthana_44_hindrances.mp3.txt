The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So today's topic is ill-will as a hindrance. And the opposite of ill-will is
love of all the different kinds. The closely related, because it looks a
little bit like ill-will, is our healthy capacity to say no, to avert
ourselves from activities which are harm-producing or unhealthy for us. And
so, whereas love and ill-will can be seen as quite distinct, this healthy
averting can be confused with the aversion that comes with ill-will. And
so we have to be very careful here. And so it can be part of our strength, our
capacity to say no thank you to things. So mostly here in meditation we're
talking about internal things. So certain trains of thought arise and we've
been down those, been on those trains a lot. We see that they usually end up in
train crashes. And so we say no thank you. And we say no, where we we turn ourselves
away from the involvement with those. It's not being aversive or ill-will
towards them, but just knowing that this is not a good place to go. And so we have
to kind of, it helps to see those two as distinct because in relationship to ill-
will there's a healthy way of saying no to it. We're not supposed to only accept
it and hold it in awareness. We're also, there's times when we say no thank you,
enough. Not this, we let go. And so the hindrances are fascinating. They are one
of a primary areas of study, an investigation for people who do insight
meditation. There's, because these are the primary forces that are said to
interfere with insight, to fear with concentration, to fear with our ability to
really have clear attention to the moment. And the way to, one of the healthy
ways of working with hindrances they don't predominate is to understand them
well. And so rather than being upset if the point of the hindrances arises for
you, take it as an opportunity to understand it more deeply. And this is
where turning around and looking at it deeply is part of what we learn. And what
we do, and some of the things we learn, can learn for some of us, is that
sometimes the hindrances are strategies for us to avoid things that are
uncomfortable for us, things that are painful, difficult. And so some people
run off to desire, to food and pleasures and things that take them away. Some
people get involved with the version, anger and blame, and that's how they kind
of are not really stopping to really be with the discomfort, they're pushing it
away or directing, you know, the attention outward towards the object of
ill-will. And so forth for the other hindrances, they can be ways in which the
mind is trying to avoid stopping and really looking carefully what's
happening here really, learning the skill of being present for what's
uncomfortable rather than reacting to it. And so in ordinary mindfulness, everyday
mindfulness, when the mind is not settled and concentrated, there's some
wonderful ways of practicing mindfulness with the hindrances. One is to
appreciate that often they are, they have an object or kind of an object, some
of the concern that we have. It's especially true for desire and ill-will.
And when we're caught in desire and ill-will, we're often preoccupied with
the object of the desire, the object of the ill-will. And so it's kind of like
the attention is directed, it's objectifying, objective attention. And
so what we try to do then is to turn the attention around 380 degrees to feel
what it's like to have desire, what it's like to have ill-will. We let go of our
concern with the object the best we can to really be present for the experience
of desire, the experience of ill-will. And that's what we're trying to discover
or investigate, to understand deeply. And that begins to break the trance, the
allure of desire and ill-will when we're no longer committed to the object, but
rather we're committed to our own well-being. And then we start feeling
that this ill-will or the desire is a kind of alienation. It's a way of
being not connected to ourselves because we're so involved in the object. And
even if the object is inside of us, there's a narrowing and alienating kind
of way in which we're only present for ourselves partially. And so there's
turning the attention around 180 degrees away from the object to what the
experience is like, how it feels within us is an effective way of working with
the hindrances. As we do this, then also you want to start feeling, what are the
different emotions that come into play? So with ill-will, for sometimes anger or
ill-will, hostility, is people recoiling from their own sadness. Underneath
ill-will, there could be sadness sometimes. Sometimes there's hurt, sometimes
there's a loneliness. Sometimes there's some kind of inner pain. That's the kind
of the catalyst for this objectifying kind of ill-will and hostility. So as we
turn the attention around, we can kind of see the underlying emotion that might
be the fuel for it. And chances are that's what needs our love. That's what
needs a caring, careful attention, more so than the hindrance itself.
Sometimes in daily life, what we can learn to do with the hindrances is not,
maybe it's hard to kind of pay attention to it carefully and turn around and look
at it deeply. It's so strong and life is so busy and we know we have a
hindrance but we're kind of in the midst of all the activities of life and it's
difficult to stop. Sometimes the significant thing to do is
restrain. Radical restraint, just no, I'm not going to do this. I'm not going
along with this. I'm not going to speak from my ill-will. I'm not going to act
on my ill-will. You know, just simply know it's not pretty, it's not deep and
insightful, but sometimes that's better than the alternative when we give into
it. And there's a kind of wonderful muscle that gets developed, the muscle of
restraint, that will serve a meditator tremendously through a lifetime of
meditation. When meditation is deep, a deeper, clearer, and this is I think the
premise for the fourth foundation of mindfulness, is that a person has kind of
followed the journey of practice and it got quieter, stiller, more present. Then
we have the opportunity to see the hindrance in a new way and that is to
see it as an inconstant experience, to see that it comes and it goes, to feel
what it's like when it's not there, get to know it when it's not there. And in
meditation sometimes the quality of the absence of desire or aversion can be
quite high. There's a real sense of peace perhaps, or something that feels
really nice that's really finally we're free of these hindrances that maybe is
part of and parcel of our ordinary life. And so to take time to now feel that,
turn around and really feel the well-being, the peace, the quiet, the
stillness that might be there, let it register deeply. The registering it
sometimes allows it to grow and become fuller. But also to see the
inconstancy of it, and this is where the insight meditation and the Satya
Bhattana really comes to its maturity, is when we start seeing things arising and
passing. In the terms of the hindrances it's a little bit different because
there the text seems to imply that we should use our agency to let go of it.
So if we can be really present to see it be ill-will orversion, hostility, arise
and we're right there to see it come into being. This is an opportunity time, an
unparalleled time perhaps to let go. So almost the body and mind has
almost a memory of what it was like just before when it wasn't there. And it's
seen as a provisional state. It's seen as not having the absoluteness of really
strong fiery anger or hostility. It's just something that's appearing. The Buddha
called it a visitor. A visitor is that cover over or hide the luminosity of the
mind. And so be quiet enough, and it's kind of a delightful, even amusing thing
to be quiet and still enough, and watch a movement towards ill-will arise, and then
say no. Let go. And not going there. And sometimes just letting go is just more
like letting be, because we're not picking it up. We're just letting it
be, letting it go by. And this is one of the deeper ways of practicing with the
hindrances. And the reason it's deeper is that it's now beginning to align the
practice with the emphasis in the refrain of the Sattva Bhattana Sutta to see the
arising and passing of phenomena, and to really be there at the place where we
can see how inconstant, how changeable our experiences, our perceptions are. And
this is where, and so this clarity we're trying to develop by not having the
hindrances obscure the mind, becomes this clarity of sitting quietly in the
changing flow of experience in the present moment, the inconstant arising
and passing, coming and going, appearing and disappearing, the flow of change that
is the present moment. If we're in the present moment, things are always
changing, and that's a deep, liberating place to sit and be. The hindrances are
not liberating, but we're moving, we're developing attention to the hindrances so
that that attention can become liberating for us. And the hindrances are
just as good as objects as almost anything else. So see today if you have
ill-will, anger, hostility, aversion that feels painful to have, and stop and stop
for it, stop a lot, really take your time with it. Do that, the practice of
turning attention 180 degrees around to really feel it, get to know it. And if
you have it, then when it's no longer there, feel what that absence like. And if
you are tracking this through the day, perhaps you'll catch and see the
arising of ill-will. Maybe it's driving your car and someone cuts you off and
you see it arise right there. And what opportunity, how's that
different to have ill-will? You see it arise than it is already in place. So I
hope you can, in this way, maybe not enjoy your hindrances and enjoy ill-will,
but maybe enjoy and maybe even be amused in being mindful of it, seeing it
clearly for what it is, and find a very different relationship to ill-will than
many people have when they are pushed around by it. So thank you. And I
appreciate our time together and we'll continue with these hindrances tomorrow.
