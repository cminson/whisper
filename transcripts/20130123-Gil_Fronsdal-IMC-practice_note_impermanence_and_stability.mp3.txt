Practice Note : Impermanence and 
Stability  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by

There is a significant interplay in practice 
between impermanence and stability. The 
tradition puts a lot of emphasizes on the insight 
into impermanence, yet at the same time, this 
insight is supported by an inner sense of 
stability. Without some stability , it is actually 
impossible to really see deeply into the instability 
of this world. There are a variety of ways in 
which stability comes into the practice. One of 
them is through our confidence  – a certain kind 
of healthy inner stillness within which  we allow 
things to happen.  
 
I am reminded of the analogy of a train . 
Although the train might be hurtli ng through the 
countryside at tremendous speed, you might be 
sitting quietly , and not even realize  that the train 
is moving , because you might be in 
conversation , or reading a book. Or you could 
be sitting in the train at the station , and you look out the window and think that your train is 
moving; but, in fact, the train across the p latform 
was the one moving. The reference point was 
the moving train, not the still platform. 
Sometimes when you are on the train, you don’t 
realize what is going on. But if you stand on the 
platform , or in the countryside watching, not only 
do you see the  speed of the train, and see what 
is moving, but you might also discover h ow long 
the train is . But w hen you are in your particular 
compartment, you might not really realize how 
long the train  is.  
 
This practice provides us a platform from which 
we can  see the movements of our mind, and of 
our life , which are harder to see when we are in 
the middle of them. We misunderstand what 
goes on sometimes  when we are in our own 
train. Sometimes w e may not realize we are in a 
train because of the drama within the train. It is 
important to understand that in the practice , we 
are trying to find a way to not be involv ed in the 
personal dramas of our life. They’ re important , 
and are to be respected. But we are trying to 
provide a different vantage point from which to 
see them – a vantage point that has some 
stability or stillness.  
 As you practice today, you might consider if 
there is some way you could step off your train. 
Rather see that the thoughts , feelings , and 
concerns you may have  as you practice are just 
trains that y ou are on , and you can’t see very 
accurately if yo u are involved in your concerns – 
thinking  about them,  trying to solve them, 
fantasizing  about them. But rather if you come 
back to your breath, back to your body , back to 
your steps  as you do the walking, it’s like taking 
a step out on the platform , or off the train , so 
that you are not so caught in it. It’s helpful to s ee 
what is going on  – your feelings, or the 
movements of the mind – from a place of 
stillness or stability.  
 
If this makes some sense for you, maybe you 
can make it a reference point or challenge for 
the day.
