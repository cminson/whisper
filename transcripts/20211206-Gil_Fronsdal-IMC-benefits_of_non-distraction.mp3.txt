The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Good evening everyone and welcome. So yesterday I finished teaching our second
in-person seven-day re-meditation retreat and it was kind of special to
be meditating with people for living with people for seven days and I usually
find it pretty special to be on these meditation retreats but I want to tell
you a little bit of one of the things that I find quite wonderful about it
that it's also true for an everyday meditation but it kind of expands
outwards or more intensified or fuller in on a meditation retreat and that is
that it starts with this principle and that is that the ways that we live and
the ways that we are that harm other people the ways we live that are kind
of not wise ways of living unwholesome we say in Buddhism that they are born
from a distracted mind when we sit to un-meditate we're trying to not be
distracted so we constantly meeting ourselves in meditation we're discovering
how we wonder off in thought how we get preoccupied and not that we're always
distracted in meditation but we certainly that's one of the lessons we
learned about how often it is that we get swept up in thought and we come back
and start again and we went into all kinds of challenges especially on
retreat people said their knees hurt their backs hurt all kinds of memories
come back that have not been processed well enough before so they're still
being processed maybe they happen a conflict you're in the week before the
retreat or maybe something 20 years ago that still festers maybe there's
someone in their retreat that irritates you because they're making too much
noise for you and so in all these situations the mind can get distracted
caught up in those things and distracted from the work of being in the present
moment really being here the practice is to keep showing up here in the present
moment and overcoming the distraction but if the unwholesome ways of behaving
and thinking are born from distraction then when we come out of distraction we
we're stepping away from that this part of the source of unhealthy unhealsome
kind of ways of being and even if it's something that is happening in the
present moment that maybe there's good reason to be challenged by it and not
no fault of your own because we keep trying to show up and be present the
rumination the lingering in the festering the picking at the scabs the
reactivity the justifications the imagined conversations we're going to
have we keep stepping out of it to be in the present moment and so the the
influence of all those kinds of ways of thinking kind of begin to lessen and
disappear so what happens in the process of that is what people are left with is
what's best in them is their goodness and what you see on retreat especially
where it's so concentrated the best in people come to the foreground and even
if people think that they don't recognize it for themselves as a teacher I
can see how much people are trying to be honest how much people are trying to
show up how much sincerity there is sincerity there is to try to work with
the preoccupied mind the distracted mind the reactive mind anger angry mind
the fearful mind all these forces of distraction and it's and and so the
tendency to get swept away in in anger or rage or fear or greed or desire less
and dramatically as we kind of are learning to let go of the distractions
and if we're not distracted then the seedbed for unwholesome behavior has
lessened dramatically and you start seeing how beautiful people are you start
seeing the goodness that's there and this is a remarkable thing it's this
principle that that if it's true that large part of our unhealthy way of
thinking and acting in the world is born from distraction certain kind of
distraction certain kind of way of being separated from ourselves being
disconnected from ourselves being fragmented by the distractions returning
to mindfulness returning to the present moment returning to kind of sense of a
wholeness in the present moment of being present then the unhealthy tendencies
become weaker and what replaces them it would be nice to say that that just you
know just all the healthy motivations all the goodness that we have and it's
generous and that's kind of true but it's what are you left with when you're no
longer distracted what are you left with when you're no longer partial so
there's a number of things one thing we're left with is we get to see much
more clearly the cost of some of our mental behavior and also some of our
you know conduct in the world as well and we start seeing that when we get
distracted by greed or we get distracted by anger or resentment or distracted by
anxiety that the cost of that is not very comfortable it's not very pleasant
and that begins putting a good that puts a question mark kind of behind the
authority of these distracted tendencies so we see oh is that is it really worth
it who am I trying to benefit here by simmering in my resentment the person
I'm resenting is nowhere to be seen they don't know I'm resenting them which is a
grilled pity isn't it I mean what good is resentment if the person you resent
doesn't know it you know you want to you know really you know and so the cost is
your causing suffering to yourself and so we start seeing this you know if you
use a kind of unfortunate analogy analogy for meditation maybe the
cost-benefit analysis of some of our behavior so it goes on in our mind when
we're no longer distracted from ourselves we get to see that the cost
benefit and analysis is not in our favor to be fragmented to be distracted to be
involved in these unhealthy reminiscence and thoughts of the mind that doesn't
mean that it's easy to stop doing it but it's a powerful lesson to have oh this
is not worth it I don't think I believe in this anymore because before doing
some kind of introspective work like meditation people unconsciously believe
the value of rumination and thinking and distraction and trying to solve the
fix their lives through that way but if you don't believe in it anymore and
you're still doing it things begin to shift and change we're not a hundred
percent behind it we're not committed to it and so something else begins to
happening we start pausing we start not acting on some of not saying some of
things we want to say not acting on some of things we want to do and things
begin to take a different turn for us when we're not distracted and we're
here in the present moment we also start becoming more aware of the what the
goodness or the benefits of the opposite of being distracted we start
feeling that oh you know actually it feels better to be present in a relaxed
way than it is to go back up into those ruminating thoughts those distracted
thoughts now it might seem boring to not be in distracting thoughts it's kind of
fascinating interesting to be presenting someone or being fantasizing
about desires and all that but then it turns out that if you pay careful
attention boredom itself it's kind of a distraction it but it's actually a subtle
form of rumination of thinking that is also kind of distracting and we start
seeing these subtle ways that we fragment ourselves or pull away from
ourselves or or cut ourselves off and so then if we stop begin letting go into
the present moment more and more and have a kind of intimacy in the present
moment that's not possible when we're distracted not possible when we're
ruminating we start slowly not only feeling we start feeling how good it
feels not to be tense not to be stressed not to be to have lost a kind of
inner freedom because you know fear is taken over anger is taken over greed is
taken over and he starts feeling there's a kind of goodness a kind of a
peacefulness a kind of healthy feeling that begins feeling here and people
start feeling more settled more at home in themselves more available more
attentive and aware of the people around them less inclined to ignore people
because when we're distracted we're also not only ignoring ourselves in some way
we're also not really we're kind of ignoring others we're ignoring their
full the wholeness of the other people we might have desires for other people or
and the most is for other people but these are all partial ways of taking
people in we don't take the whole person in and so as we stop being so
distracted we take more of ourselves in more other people in and more of the
situation that we're in and that feeling of connection of camaraderie ship of
mutual care for humanity is a beautiful thing so slowly in meditation it tends
to diminish the unhealthy ways in which our mind operates and it starts slowly
bringing out the healthy parts and that slow process is faster on retreat
because a meditation retreat that we do people are meditating you know good
part of the day there's a there's something like about nine ten periods of
meditation a day so there's a lot and then there's walking but that's sitting
meditation and there's walking meditation in between sometimes and so
there's a lot of this dedication so much the day is to either being
undistracted or attempting to become undistracted and if that doesn't work a
good part of the day is discovering how much you are distracted wow I'm really
caught up here and in a way that we don't do in daily life often when we
are working and taking care of our everyday life and so what I see because I
get to meet with the teacher I get to meet people I get so you said how
beautiful to watch the the the arc of a seven-day retreat and you see that more
and more the beauty of people comes to the foreground the goodness in people
and and people sometimes tell me Gil you just see the best in people as if
that's a mistake and that's a problem I think it's pretty special it's pretty
inspiring to know that there's so much goodness in people so much
wonderfulness and that people are capable of so much kindness and warmth and
care and and sincerity so so I find that it's kind of a very inspiring for our
for my appreciation of people and humanity and what's possible so what if
we can do that more and maybe it what's that's what we're trying to do here is
not only in ourselves but in others is to bring out the best in us to bring out
the best and support the conditions that allow every the best in everyone to
come forth and some of that is that as we begin recognizing in ourselves we
might be better able to recognize it in other people as well and if we appreciate
in others it tends to support others to be that way as well anyway so that was
my inspiration coming out of this retreat and so the principle is that all
the unhealthy ways and that we relate to ourselves and to other people probably
has some source in a distracted mind and what happens if you're no longer
distracted it's the question so we have some time now and I'm delighted to have
you here and if you have anything you want to ask or any questions about
meditation practice or anything that's related to what we do or to what I've
said today or if you had a testimonial about what I said you know this is
lovely to hear from you as well yes and and if you would say your name at the
when you start that would be nice I'm Charles and thank you so much for the
talk I'm in the sitting my question is what does an undistracted mind look
like what is an undistracted mind look like I can give you an unsatisfying
answer first and the unsatisfying answer is that's your task to discover and I'll
try to give you a more satisfying answer I think an undistracted mind
begin is a mind that begins appreciating how not to be not how the mind
doesn't live in conflict with itself the mind discovers how to be at peace how
does that sound you want to ask more here's it with that great thank you
before he asked the question my name is Jay didn't the Buddha also say something
about I remember his mother talks in terms of the undistracted mind he had
given analogies of like a leg you know I forgot the bit my hearing aids in so if
you can talk just a little bit louder and a little slower for me I think even my
mask was sort of muffling it in some other topic we were talking about in
terms of the following of undistracted mind I thought the Buddha gives him
analogy also of like a lake or something is there something like that or yes oh
there's a lot of analogies metaphors are using water for the mind and at
different stages of meditation the mind and our body also begins to feel a
little bit like how a lake might feel if a lake can feel something so at one
point the surface of the lake can be very very peaceful no waves at all it
just feels like completely still and clear sometimes there's a very embodied
feeling of being very settled but there's a flow of energy inside that feels
really good and pleasant some people describe it as kind of joy or bliss but
but it is energetic and has a kind of a flow and that's likened to a a underwater
spring that's bringing fresh water into the lake and just kind of imagine an
underwater fountain that's kind of bringing is refreshing a lake and then
as the meditation gets stiller and quieter there are all the movement that
of that the wonderful kind of sense of vitality movement that can might happen
there quiet's down and then it's then it's a very still quiet lake that the
analogy is that it's a lake full of lotus blossoms that are some are most of
them are underwater and some are above water but the ones underwater no part of
the of the blossoms are the lotus plants are not lovingly touched by the water it
is still refreshing supportive water and so I don't know if those those kinds of
metaphors or analogies work for you but that is one that's used sometimes for
deep meditation actually a question on walking meditation yeah so I've done
some going good retreats as well where there's no walking at all it just sits
it's it and definitely in the spirit rock tradition are here that is walking
and in my head I get a general sense that walking is almost treated like a
step child or it's not as high as sitting is there any truth to it and also
curious like in Buddha's time was it treated as equal as sitting or is it
like you do it only when you can't do sitting or something like that yeah yeah
we do know that the Buddha did walking meditation and that was taught and we
knew the Buddha when he was teaching meditation he was teaching it in four
postures that it was but the most common one seems to have been sitting
meditation but then walking meditation standing meditation and lying down
meditation they all work well they all have their benefits and they all have
their little more challenges what we do on retreat is we alternate between
primarily sitting and walking but some people do lying some people would do
standing meditation and it's very very powerful to alternate you get some of
the benefits of both and different things different psychophysical process in
inside tend to get stronger in one more than the other and they tend to balance
themselves out so for example if you sat all the time many people would find it
they might get kind of dull and it's hard to keep the energy up but if you
walk it tends to be energizing but if you walked all the time you wouldn't be
able to get this calm and so but they by going back and forth you get the best of
calm and energy and keeping those in good balance that allows the meditation go
further and there's other things that come into balance as well and so we're
we're big on going back and forth and it's a long tradition in Buddhism to do
through the walking meditation and if you go to some of the monasteries especially
the forest monasteries you'll see in the woods they'll have these paths that are
really well-worn paths because of the people walking on them for maybe
centuries but they're only about 30 or 40 feet long and it's their their
meditation pass where you go to walk back and forth back and forth and it's kind
of touching to see them. One of the advantages of walking meditation is
that it's a little bit more like daily life people do many people do a lot of
walking in daily life so if you get the hang of meditating while you walk it's
easier for some people to bring the the meditative mind the mindful mind into
their daily life because they can bring it into their walking. Hi thank you my
name is Umbridge I'm going off the walking meditation how would you advise
doing walking meditation? How do I advise? Advise like how to do a walking
meditation. How do you walk? Great so the the classic way for us is to find a walk
way someplace you can walk where there's not a lot of visual stimuli like
probably don't do it downtown the middle of you know people going to work so at
some place it's pretty calm and find and it's about 30 or 40 20 or 30 paces long
and then simply walk back and forth and whereas in seated meditation our
primary focus would be in our tradition here is to focus on the breathing and
there's something about the rhythm or breathing anything that's rhythmic in the
body tends to make a nice focus of attention because it keeps the mind
relaxed and focused if it's if it's something that doesn't move you focus
on the mind tends to get tight but because it's it's kind of has a nice
kind of rhythm and the mind kind of follows it and it's kind of like if
you're looking at a river going by just sitting on the man because the river
you it's kind of very relaxing to watch the flow in the movement so we're
watching the flow in the movement of the breathing in walking meditation the
rhythm that we're tuning into is the rhythm of the feet and legs alternating
as they walk and it's usually if you're walking fast and they feel that the
sensation is mostly just feeling the soles of the feet against the ground as
they hit the ground but if you're walking slower then you're paying
attention to the sense the the flow of sensations that come into place as you
lift and move your foot forward and some people say that's pretty pedestrian
it's pretty boring to just simply put your attention there but it is it's not
that the the sensations are necessarily so fascinating what's fascinating is the
clarity of attention that builds up when we're able to keep the attention in a
relaxed way right there so one way one little image I tend to teach that to
help support that is imagine that your feet are sponges and like a sponge we
put it put sponge in water it soaks up the water so if if the feet are sponges
for sensations so you just kind of feel that they're just receiving the
sensations that come as you walk and just receiving and taking them in and
that becomes the primary object of attention the mind gets distracted you
go back to that that's a you know a brief instruction thank you and then we
walk back and forth and and if you walk slow enough it's nicely when you come
to the end to stop turn around stop and then start and what the stopping does is
that you're much more likely to notice that you've gotten caught up in thought
and then you start over again and now this is starting over again is really a
big part of any kind of meditation and learning how to start over so that the
starting over doesn't agitate to your mind because some people like oh no I got
distracted again oh I'm a terrible meditator and oh I gotta try again it's
I don't know if I can it's so hard by the time you go all through all that the
mind is so agitated stirred it up right so learning how to start over again oh
look we'd be more like oh my mind is distracted okay I'll start over again
I'll just start like I'll just begin again okay here we are and so the
difference between those two way mindsets one supports more meditation one
does it um my name is Padma so I think I'm trying to figure out so I noticed the
distractions you know and then I try to come back to the breathing but how and
then you just explain the walking meditation which I had the question about
thank you for that but if the distractions hold it like the color
like this like there because so if the distractions are more like resentment
you know the silly thoughts of course I noticed them and it's like okay silly
right but how do you go about with more like life trauma related distractions
trauma oh so probably with trauma it's a big question and so it be very careful
about how we work with it it's a lot of trauma you should work with a trauma
counselor but if the I think it's best not to treat trauma as a distraction I
think if you treat trauma as a distraction it kind of accentuates the
the wound but some people that they turn towards the trauma and feel it also
makes the trauma the wound bigger so the art of it is how do we not how do we
open up to the trauma without being hurt more by it and that takes a lot of care
and so one of the ways the number of ways to do this but one of the ways is to
is to open to the trauma be present for it in very short for a very short time
just almost like imagine your mindfulness is like a soft cotton gauze
like soft cotton balls and you go feel the physical experience of trauma that
resides in your body and you just kind of gently touch the trauma maybe three
times with awareness so I know you're there there you are and then you pull
the back and and then maybe you do a little bit of meta loving kindness to
kind of stabilize or maybe go back to your breathing and just stabilize and
then it feels like it's useful again and go with this soft cotton gauze it's
okay trauma I know you're there and the idea is to show the trauma that you can
be present for it in a safe way that you're not afraid of it and you're also
not reacting to it you're not attacking it you're just there in a friendly way
and then you come back to your breathing you do that and you don't have to do it
don't have a big agenda don't try to work too hard at it so that's one thing
you can do with trauma that makes some sense yeah I think it does I think it
requires more me practicing that right so I'm hoping so I'll be coming to the
retreat the next one so hoping they'll help great
well if there are no more questions or something then let's sit for five minutes
and then we'll call it an evening
you
you
a distracted mind has very little the very little room in it because it's
kind of become claustrophobic with its preoccupation or
narrowed or crowded access better word crowded with its preoccupation and
undrestructed mind has more room more space in it and one of the things it
has room for is love
and what does it feel like when there's a room for love
thank you very much look forward to a chance of being together with you again
