The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So welcome to happy hour. I'm happy to be with all of you this evening and it's
been a lovely day to step back and reflect on what we do during these
evenings. These four Brahma Viharas which are sometimes translated as four
divine abidings. That sounds really nice. Being able to spend time, hang out in
something that feels elevating and divine. But stepping back with a bit of a
broader perspective to reflect on what these meditations, what these qualities
actually bring to the heart and mind. They offer something valuable in how we
can develop as mindfulness practitioners as we go along the path to
freedom from suffering. So there's something about our development, the
unfolding of the path that these have to offer. And they also offer qualities
that just in daily life cultivate and support positive relationships with
other people. And with ourselves as well. If you think about it, we are highly
social mammals. From birth onward, we need one another to survive. And our
entire culture and society is based on interdependence or what Tick-Not Han
called interbeing. We collaborate on a really huge scale to provide for
ourselves and each other with dwellings, heat, light, food, education, employment,
transportation, medical care, and all fields of human engagement, all fields of
study and activity. Because we're so interdependent, so interlocked with one
another, we could say we have some very, we have very much in common in terms of
fundamental needs. But we also have a lot of differences in terms of our desires,
what we like, what we want, what we think we need. We have differences in terms of
what we are aversive towards, what we dislike, don't want, the stuff we try to
avoid. And we differ in terms of how our lives condition us in these factors, as
well as how our lives may condition areas where we're unaware or confused. So
these differences and the way we handle them result in interactions that either
add to our sense of connection with each other or create difficulty between us.
So we can consider what these four brahmaviharas, these four divine abidings
of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, what these do, actually,
to help us deepen our connection with others and with ourselves. What they do
to help us heal from the adverse effects or the unwanted effects of our desires,
aversions, and delusions, the things that separate us from each other. So this
evening, as we meditate, the invitation will be to notice whatever is present in
the heart and mind as we go through the evening. There may be conditions you're
bringing in from your day, your week, your month, or there may be just newly
arising things that happen this evening. The invitation will be to notice
whatever comes up, whatever persists, whatever passes, and to bring each or one
of these divine abidings to whatever is present and then notice what happens. So
with that, let's meditate together.
I'm giving yourself plenty of time to acknowledge what's present right now.
There may be states of body, states of heart, states of mind that are following
you from your day, still present somewhat, or there may be new things that are
coming up in any moment of meditation this evening. Perhaps it's sometimes
useful to take a few longer, slower, or deeper breaths, and to voluntarily release
or bring softening or ease to any tension, any preoccupations that are present.
Wherever it's possible to soften what's extra, we can use the outbreath to help
us without releasing. And of course, allowing, settling into awareness of
whatever is here in the body, feelings, and mind, whatever is most obvious and
awareness is perfectly fine as it is. We want to notice what's present. We want
to allow everything without exception. There's no need to go out and try to find
any experience or to have a specific type of experience here. Whatever comes up in
the moment, that's what we want to be aware of. There's no right or wrong
experience. Whatever's coming up, it could be pleasant, it could be unpleasant, it
could be neither, it could be sort of a neutral. Just receiving and allowing into
the awareness what's here right now.
And allowing it at whatever pace it presents itself. That might be rapid or
slower any pace, and the pace could vary over the course of the evening.
Letting mindfulness match what's coming into awareness, what's passing out of
awareness, meet it, be present with it, allow it some breathing room.
If there's a prominent mood or flavor to what is arising, acknowledging that.
Allowing that experience, allowing that flavor to be known.
It'd be anything. There could be a sense of a welcoming experience or very slowly
noticing what it is, resisting it, being distracted from it, having it be quite
clear. It could be a calm with which we are present with it or agitation. Our goal
here is not to have a particular kind of experience, but just to notice what's
arising, what's here.
And perhaps reflecting for a moment, whether it might be supportive, to
extend some kindness to what is arising in awareness right now, quietly
whispering in the mind, kind wishes for what's arising and passing for our
experience this evening. May you be well, may you be safe and free from harm.
May you be happy.
May you be at ease.
Allowing your experiences and and these wishes of kindness to fill the heart,
fill the mind, fill the body. Taking your time, allowing, not demanding, but just
inclining the mind towards wishes for well-being. Wishing these experiences
safety, freedom from harm.
Climbing wishes for contentment and happiness.
Sending wishes for ease, living with ease, living in peace.
Perhaps even creating kindness phrases of your own for whatever is coming to
awareness.
Allowing awareness to naturally flow towards whatever is most obvious as
you continue to meditate, receiving experience, recognizing it, allowing it
in space.
Experiencing what is being known as it persists or hangs around or even if it's
just a fleeting awareness of something, a tiniest sense of something that appears.
Creating each experience with acceptance, some sense of, yes, you're here, I'm
knowing this. And if what is arising has a sense of dissatisfaction or stress or
suffering, perhaps it might be just supportive to quietly incline the mind
towards compassion for this experience.
Allowing yourself to feel, care, or any distress.
Perhaps a tender wish or thought lightly in the mind, I care about the
suffering and the toll that it's taking.
Allowing that compassion to fill the heart and mind, may this suffering come to
an end without the demand that it do so. Just the quiet caring may suffering come
to an end. If a particular person appears associated with this, sending the
caring and compassion towards their suffering as well, may your suffering
come to an end.
May all suffering come to an end. Not as an agenda, but rather a simple
recognition of the resonance in the mind and heart of suffering, just as we
don't wish to suffer. Others don't wish to suffer. May this suffering come to an
end, whether it's large or very subtle.
Continuing to allow awareness to show you whatever is most obvious as it arises
as the meditation continues, no need to hold the mind in one place. Allowing it
to flow. Allowing experience to be received. Perhaps what's arising, what's
most obvious, are wholesome states that feel helpful. Could be simply
experiencing the stillness, some sense of settling in the meditation. A little
contentment or ease. It can be supportive and cultivate more wholesome
qualities by greeting these states with appreciative joy, sympathetic joy. May
this happiness continue and grow.
May these wholesome qualities continue to be cultivated.
I'm happy for this contentment, this ease. May it continue, or I feel ease or
happiness or contentment in some relationship about some person in my
life. May their happiness continue. And as the meditation continues,
allowing experience to be received, however it arrives, no need to hang on to
anything at all. Perhaps noticing inequalities of stability or equanimity
that are present. Could be any kind of stillness that's here or a settledness
in the mind, in the body. May this stability continue.
Perhaps allowing it to grow, to flourish.
Feeling as stable as a mountain sitting here. Or if you're noticing that
awareness is bringing experiences that are coming and going more as ups and
downs. Perhaps it's supportive to cultivate equanimity by inclining the
mind towards it with these wishes. Conditions change. Experiences arise and pass.
May I simply receive what is arising and passing with some stability. May I allow
experience to flow through with some equanimity about it. Yes, life has ups
and downs. Things come and go based on causes and conditions, not upon my
wishes for them. May I simply bring clear awareness to that flow of what it is to
be human. And as we continue the meditation in silence, allowing any of
these qualities of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy or equanimity to greet
the flow of experience as it's received in awareness.
It's really worth it to realize that these qualities that we're cultivating
deliberately during these evenings are also things that tend to grow naturally
during our progress in meditation, in mindfulness. You know, as we see how ill
will operates in the world or operates in ourselves or our own lives, gradually the
awareness starts to arise how much better it feels to be kind, to be kind to
ourselves when others are kind to us, and to stop fighting with experience. The
same way as we recognize how much harm is done in the world, and how much
harm perhaps we've been through in our own lives, this quality of compassion
comes up, and it comes up even just in sitting, being compassionate towards
pain that comes up in the body or difficulty that arises in the mind,
feelings that are not pleasant that come up. Over time we start to feel more
compassionate towards that. We also start to recognize that it's really valuable
to fully appreciate and allow when positive qualities come up, when wholesome
helpful things arise, to actually spend time feeling that, appreciating it, and
knowing it helps to cultivate more. It actually reinforces those qualities in
us in daily life as well as in sitting practice. And then the more we we stay
with this over time, stay with a regular meditation practice, stay with
mindfulness in daily life, the more we become equanimous. We start to find that
we can respond to things as they arise, even tough things, instead of just
reacting or getting really torn up, you know, yanked around by experience. So I'm
just an invitation to appreciate as you go through your daily life and as you
reflect on your experiences in meditation and in mindfulness to see these
qualities as they come up. So I as always think it's a wonderful opportunity to be
inspired by other people in this group. The structure of these evenings is
particularly wonderful for that. So we're going to have about 10 minutes in small
breakout groups of about three people each. And the invitation for these
breakout groups is to offer one thing at a time and then allow each other person
to have their turn without cross-talk, without offering advice, without
interruption, just wholeheartedly offer what you have to say and then listen with
care to what somebody else is sharing next and watch what comes up in your
own heart. Then finally to share whatever feels comfortable for you and you can
share a lot or meaning deeply or you can share something that feels safe. But
then when we come back to the large group, please keep what was said
confidential and you can share your own response or inspirations or questions.
And thank you Terrence for your note about my bell being awfully soft. I
appreciate knowing that. So with this we'll go into the breakout rooms. If you
find yourself alone, don't worry. I'll find you and I'll put you in another one.
So see you in 10 minutes.
