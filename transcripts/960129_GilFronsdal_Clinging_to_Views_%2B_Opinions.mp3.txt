 The piece that I read from is from a text called the Sutra Nipata, which is considered by scholars to be probably the oldest of Buddhist literature. And you find in this text repeated concern with views, holding views or opinions or theories about the world and about spirituality. And it seems that primarily the text warns against clinging to views. It can be argued it doesn't offer too many views of its own, but it warns us against the dangers of clinging to views. And last week here, I talked about non-clinging, clinging and non-clinging. And the book of Buddhist tradition gives three different main areas where human beings tend to cling. And the first is that we tend to cling towards the world of desire, especially sensual desire. The second is the world of views, to opinions. And the third is to ideas of self. And if ideas of self are kind of like a view, then there's really two major clings, desire and to views. One may be more intellectual or cognitive, and the other perhaps can be understood as being more emotional. And I wanted to talk a little bit about views, since it's been on my mind a little bit, and because I think that it can be argued that views are some of the most tenacious places we tend to get stuck and hold on to. And even some of our emotional life rises out of our attachments to our views and beliefs. I read a study recently about a neurologist, neuropsychologist I guess, who was studying a 15-year-old boy who was epileptic. And because it was very strong seizures, epileptic seizures, they had cut the connection between the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere of his brain. So there's no direct connection. And so it was very interesting for neurologists to study it, because you can kind of isolate the different hemispheres. Apparently this boy normally appeared quite normal. There was nothing strange about him. He was able to cope quite nicely. But the neuropsychologist had this machine where he could flash words on his screen or something so that only the right hemisphere of the brain of this boy would register. Like only the right visual field I guess would register. So he would flash on the word smile, and the boy would smile. But the left hemisphere didn't know it was smiling. And he would flash him like, tap your finger, tap, and so he would tap his finger. But he didn't know he was doing it exactly. So then he typed on the screen, walk, at which point the boy got up and started walking out the door. And so the psychologist asked him why he was walking out the door. And the boy's answer was, oh, I want to go get a coke. And there was nothing about getting a coke and the instruction to go walk. And what the neuropsychologist kind of concluded from that is that it was an example of how the way the mind works, it tends to want to create meaning for the activities that we find ourselves in, situation we find ourselves in. And so he created a very reasonable meaning for what he was doing. He had to get up and walk, so maybe he was thirsty. So he created kind of a meaning for it. And the human mind is a tremendously powerful, meaning-creating apparatus machine. And it tends to make connections and find meaning in situations, infinitely creative numbers of ways. Many times finding connections and meanings and explanations and theories for what's going on that maybe have very little to do with actually what's happening. Or maybe sometimes it's a little bit to do with what's happening. So one example is that maybe many of you had similar situation. But when I was in Thailand, I was asleep one night and I was dreaming that I was walking up kind of a null little hillside. And as I stepped over, I was kind of walking barefoot, and as I stepped over the top of the little null, there was a kind of a nail or something sticking out of the ground. And I stepped on it with my toe. And it was extremely painful. I remember how painful it was and then I woke up. And it took me a moment to realize what was happening was I was being bitten by these terrific, horrific ants they had in Thailand on my little toe. So it was a real event going on, and this wonderful creative mind of mine in the context of my dreams created a story to fit the experience. And I think that's often, you know, I mean how often does the mind make up stories that fits the situation outside of our dreams? And so often the mind creates views, theories, and we tend to find ourselves having opinions about everything. Many people have many, many opinions. And there's some problems with having opinions or theories of views. And one of the problems is if they're inaccurate. But also one way that can be accurate is in generalizations, and generalizing about situation. And I've probably all of us, I certainly found myself in big trouble by generalizing situations where there was no, wasn't warranted to generalize even. And you know, one of the things I sat on retreat recently, an example in retreat was there was a couple of hours of sitting, a couple of hours during the retreat where I kept trying my best to become concentrated, trying my best to be present. And my mind kept wandering away, kept wandering away completely lost and scattered. And I started getting discouraged because I thought I was trying to get concentrated, I had kind of an agenda in mind, and I wasn't able to do it. And I started getting discouraged. And in my discouragement I kind of concluded that I'm really a lousy meditator. And this is really a problem because here I'm supposed to be a meditation teacher. And what do I think I'm doing here? And this is really serious now. I don't know, do I go confess to someone? Do I resign as a meditation teacher? I just, you know, this is going to be like this forever. And it took me a while to kind of wake up to the fact that I'd made this big story about the fact that for a couple hours my mind was a little more energetic than it usually was, and it was preoccupied with certain concerns. And that's what I needed to accept, not trying to get concentrated. But you know, my mind made this story. It took a while for me to see I was generalizing and not, you know, that it wasn't just the way it was, you know, it wasn't true. But it would have been very easy, I think, I mean, for some minutes or some time there. I believed that was an accurate description of the universe. That this universe I found myself in was a universe where I was a really lousy meditator. And that's the way it was. It was always going to be that way. And that wasn't a true view or opinion, but I had made that generalizations. And I think I came across recently one of the probably greatest generalizations that are found in, maybe in religion, but a little just stick to Buddhism. In ancient India they believed in many gods. And even though Buddhism is sometimes considered an atheistic religion because gods don't have an important place in them, Indian Buddhists believe in the gods of the Indian pantheon. But for the most part the Buddhists kind of feel sorry for the gods. They don't have a really high opinion of them. But there's one god, the pantheon of deities has a hierarchy and there's a top of the hierarchy, which is Brahma, kind of the ruler of the gods. And sometimes Brahma is taken to be kind of the creator of the universe, creator of the world. And the Buddha wanted to explain how this notion was kind of a false generalization and how this kind of notion could arise. So he started by explaining about Buddhism, the belief is in Indian, ancient Indian religions in general, they believed the universe lived, continued through time through periods of expansion and contraction. And in periods of complete contraction of the universe, all physical matter disappeared. And the only place that beings, sentient beings or consciousness survived was these disembodied luminous spirits or human beings, or human beings, or human beings. Luminous states of consciousness that floated about being quite happy and blissful, some ethereal realms. But then as the universe began to expand again, then these ethereal realms would start to solidify and you start having the world again and people again and all this stuff. But as it begins to solidify, the first thing that's created, the first solid thing that's created is the palace of this god Brahma. It's just an empty palace. And then at some point these luminous mind-made disembodied kind of things hovering ethereally, they have certain lifetimes, they only live a certain length of time. And so at some point they die. And when you die from these higher states, you get reborn in the lower one. And the only lower place they're very born at this point was Brahma's empty palace. So one of these beings got reborn in Brahma's empty palace. And he was kind of living there for a while, hanging out. After a while it got kind of lonely, being all alone there. So he thought, wouldn't it be nice if there were other beings here to keep me company? Now coincidentally, at the same time, some other beings in this ethereal mind-made kind of luminous bodies exhausted their lifespan up in the ethereal places and died up there. And were reborn where it's more solid, which was in Brahma's palace. So Brahma thought, oh, I had this thought, and they appeared, so I must have created them. So I'm the great creator. And so he included, he had these wonderful titles, the all-powerful, the all-knowing, the creator of everything, the master of the universe, and he thought he was pretty hot. And now these beings that were born in Brahma's palace, they also have only lived for a certain length of time. It's a really long time, maybe, you know, hundreds of thousands of years, but it's limited. But some of them who were born there after Brahma had a shorter lifetime than Brahma. So they died from there and were born as human beings, leaving Brahma to be the ruler of his palace. And some of these beings, born human beings, became monks and ascetics, nuns, and practiced meditation. And it's said that in some states of meditation you can review your past lives. So one of these monks had kind of limited psychic powers, and he could only review one past lifetime, which was his lifetime that he lived in Brahma's palace. And he remembered that there was this being who was there before he got there, and was there after he got there, and seemed to think that he was the creator of the universe. And it must be the case. So therefore he concluded that there is such an all-powerful creator of the universe as Kaid Brahma, and so they created a theistic religion. But the Buddha said that this was a generalization, because indeed psychic powers are possible, psychic perception of, or exocentric perception is possible. But to make this conclusion, that just because there was a being there before you got to the palace, and he's there after you left, conclude then that this person's all-powerful and the creator of the universe, that's kind of going a little bit beyond the evidence. And so this is the way the Buddha kind of wanted to kind of maybe loosen people's attachments to the idea of creator deities. It was an example of of a generalization. Another kind of generalization we have is what's called in anthropology, a magical thinking. And this is when people make connections of causality between one event and another. And I read in Dear Abbey this last week an example of this. Maybe some of you read it too. It was a list of 10 things which you shouldn't say to couples who are trying to have children. And one of the items was this idea that, oh, if you used to adopt, then you could have children. Then you can get pregnant, you can conceive. Because sometimes apparently people adopt and they conceive. It's kind of like, wow, you know, we tried all these years and then we gave up, we had children, we adopted, and then, poof, we conceived. And so there's an idea that that's, you know, all you have to do is get adopted and so you relax, you then, you see whatever, it's pressures often. And that idea circulates around enough that Dear Abbey felt you had to address it. And what she says, and I've read this elsewhere too, is that five percent of all couples who adopt children conceive after the adoption. And five percent of those who don't adopt also conceive. And this is kind of how I think, I believe a little bit how things like rain dancing perhaps works. I don't know if rain dancing is the right example, I just pulled it out of my mind right now. If you do certain rituals that are supposed to have some effect on the universe, on the rain or something, it might work one percent of the time because once every 100 days it's going to rain. But we only remember the times it really worked. And maybe sometimes it's a real coincidence that it works. And so it really stands out as being, that's what's remembered, the great coincidence once it worked. And the 99 times it didn't work, people long since forget. And this is the kind of generalizations that people make a lot, especially I think in some spiritual circles or new age circles. And there's a wonderful book I recommend. I forget the author, but the book is called Inumeracy. People who are kind of opposite, I guess the corollary of being illiterate, people who don't... Paula? Paula? Paula? Paula's Inumeracy. It's kind of for people who don't understand how numbers work or how statistics works. And it's kind of an attempt to show or overcome the kind of faulty thinking that can come when we don't understand the statistical possibilities that things are supposed to happen. Coincidence are supposed to happen. He says in the book that it'd be really weird if coincidences didn't happen. That would be really weird because certain amount of time, like if you roll the dice, certain amount of time, you're going to end up with all the different possibilities. There'll be enough times when if you roll two dice, occasionally both sixes come up. And that's just... If both sixes never came up, that'd be really weird. Now some coincidences are one in a million. That's a pretty rare thing, one in a million. But when you think that there's how many million Americans? 300 million? Is that what we have now? That means that one in a million chances needs to... supposed to happen 300 times a year. So you expect it to happen. But then you don't want to make this big kind of metaphysics about causality and it should have happened and God meant it to happen or it was in the stars or whatever. Generalizations. Mark Twain wrote, when I was 13, I thought my dad was the stupidest fool that I ever came across. By the time I was 20, I was surprised by how much he had learned in seven years. In this text of Suta Nipata, it's very critical of people who are attached to views and opinions and theories. But it says very carefully that it's not through views and opinions that a person becomes peaceful, but it's also through not having views that we become peaceful. And the point is not to avoid all views, but the point I believe in this text is how we hold views, how we relate to them and what their function is in our lives. And part of what we do in mindfulness practice is to understand how we are clinging and understand how we hold our views and hold our opinions. And as I kind of made this plea last week, one of the things we want to be very sensitive to in mindfulness practice is to our suffering. Whenever we feel some kind of big anxiety or fear or unworthiness or inadequacy or embarrassment or whatever, is to spend some time and see what's going on here, what is the clinging that has caused us to have this suffering. And what we'll often find is that some of this clinging arises out of views and opinions that we have and the way we hold those views and those opinions. So it could be that I'm the worst meditator in the world as I thought those two hours. I mean maybe that's true, I don't know, but let's say it's true. So what? But I got all flustered and upset and made all these conclusions and decided to go into a different profession. And I made all these conclusions because I was upset about it. So there was suffering because I reacted to that opinion, I reacted to those thoughts in a certain way. I was clinging to a certain view that I had to be a certain way. So can we notice if we pay attention to when we're suffering, when we're anxious, then can we start to notice? One of the things we can notice is not just simply the clinging, but what are we clinging to? What are the views and opinions that have to be in place to hold it? And the way many of us, I think in our culture, hold opinions, hold views, it isn't simply as we're trying to state the truth. We kind of have an impartial observation of the truth and it just seems like it's a nice thing to kind of put the truth out on the table and let everybody else kind of see it also. But there's a lot else going on when we kind of hold an opinion or hold a view. And to understand what that is, I think, is very interesting. I think many times having an opinion is kind of a flag saying, here I am, pay attention to me. And the truth is not so important as making some kind of statement about the self, of being someone, of standing in contrast to someone, or being in comparison to other people around, to have them notice you, have them notice you in good ways. So when you go to eat at a restaurant and you go home to a friend and you say, I ate at the best restaurant, the very best restaurant, that was really fantastic. And we kind of go into these kind of adjectives that are really kind of exaggerated. That's a view for sure. Why are we doing that? Why do we exaggerate some of us about our activity? That was really the best vacation I ever had, you know. And maybe it wasn't even true, but I think I see, I hear a lot of people who exaggerate. Some people have a kind of, this natural way of talking. Everything's the best. And what are they saying, really? What are they getting across in their communication? And I think they're, sometimes I think they're making statements about themselves. Look what a good person I am. Look how wonderful I am, that I was able to do this wonderful thing. Or maybe it's a kind of, I don't know what's going on. Maybe some people fear that if they don't have an opinion that they're boring. So they start collecting opinions. And we're ready to use the famous writer, Adler Suxley. Isn't that the story is that before he went to cocktail parties in LA in the sixties, he used to memorize an entry from the encyclopedia. So he can come to the party kind of with this kind of little, you know, paragraph, a fact or something to pontificate about. And the problem with clinging to views is that even if something is true, we can cling to it to our detriment. Even the clinging is the problem. So even if something which is really true, can be a source of anxiety and fear and suffering. And one of the wonderful lists that the mindfulness tradition has is listed a 10 spiritual clingings that are peculiar to mindfulness students. So you probably want to hear about those. Or would you rather live in ignorant bliss? Uh, the first, there's 10 of them. And the first one is a light experiences of great light, which happens sometimes in meditation. The second is knowledge. The third is happiness. The fourth is tranquility. The fifth is joy. The sixth is resolve. Seventh is effort. The eighth is guess. Mindfulness itself. The ninth is equanimity. And the tenth is views. Now that seems like a strange list, huh? Many of the things that people are most wanting to get out of the meditation is that which is sometimes the greatest trap for people to do mindfulness practice. Because we form a view around it usually, we get attached to it. And attachment sometimes arises because it's very pleasant. It's a very pleasant thing. But more tenaciously there can be attachment because it supports a sense of self that we feel we need to have in order to feel secure in the world or important in the world or adequate in the world or worthy in the world. So if we can have a lot of knowledge or if we can be clever or if we can be the person who has the greatest amount of, you know, if we have really blissed out in meditation then it really proves it really attains something, we've gotten somewhere and you can wear that as a little badge. And as we pay, as you pay attention to the way we hold views and theories, when we form, when the judging mind, when the attached mind, when the clinging mind holds onto views, you can feel what that's like sometimes in the mind and the body as a kind of contractiveness, kind of a hardness, kind of restrictedness, kind of a narrowness of both one's vision but also of one's mind and one's body. And it actually can feel painful to be attached to an opinion or a view about how things should be. And views and opinions, you know, can be a full gamut of phenomena. But for people who meditate there are such views as, I'm a good meditator, I'm doing it right or I'm doing it wrong or am I making progress or this is the kind, I'm not making progress or this is the progress I'm making. There's all these ideas that we have about our meditation practice which are views and opinions about it, which, you know, a view and opinion is just a condition of the mind that arises but then we believe it, we buy into it and then off we go spinning, you know, a story about how maybe we should do tai chi instead. In the early Buddhist literature the word views is diti and views is a good translation for the word diti because diti has the same connotations of seeing as view has in English. But when the word view appears by itself in an unqualified form, it almost always means wrong view because views are such, the Buddhist sense be so suspicious of views and the whole interviews. There are good views, there are right views that they offer in Buddhism but what my view is lately is that for the most part Buddhism or early Buddhism, the Buddha, spent a fair amount of time kind of debunking or in a kind of socratic method technique, he would ask people questions about the views they held. So in asking them questions about their views they would realize themselves that these views were empty and were kind of didn't really hold up and he spent a lot of time doing that. But the Buddha very seldom offered views of his own, opinions of his own and I think my understanding is the Buddha wasn't that interested in offering explanations of how the world worked exactly, kind of great cosmic metaphysical stories about creation or many things, but rather what the Buddha was interested in was our suffering, was our clinging and the possibility of living peacefully as an alternative to a life that's full of suffering and stress. And in order to live a life that's peaceful you don't necessarily need to understand the world, you don't necessarily have to even understand yourself in all the different ways you can understand a human being. You have to understand very simply the way that we cling, the way we hold on and get attached including the ways we are aversive. And one of the things that we learn, one of the great lessons from a spiritual life or from meditation is to learn a place, learn about a way of being that is at peace with oneself and with the world around one. And to see that one's peace is not dependent on holding on to a view or an opinion or a theory or some kind of particular way things have to be, but it's possible to have a level of peace that's not conditioned by any of those things and you find that and it's relatively, you know, relatively, maybe not easy enough, but it's relatively easy to experience that in meditation. It's also nice to go and retreat because in a longer retreat, retreats are kind of, maybe you'll excuse the pun, but it's kind of like a retreat from having to have a lot of views. Life on a retreat is very, very simple and the normal ways in which we feel we have to present ourselves and construct our universe is no longer operating so much and so you can drop it and at least for those days and you find a way that you find a kind of peacefulness, a way to be at ease that then it becomes a familiar place and it's an alternative then to living a life that's stressful or holding on or really tight or narrow-minded. So, you know, those two hours where I was discouraged and wondering whether, you know, I must, you know, I'm in the wrong business and being meditation teacher is not, you know, right for me and all these kinds of thought, I could see how I had a sense of self that would have been, was tied up with being a meditation teacher and being a good meditator and all these kinds of things and when I saw it all I was able relatively quickly kind of to drop it and let go of it and realized that in order for me to be at peace and be kind of at ease, I had to kind of forget completely about being a meditation teacher, at least in terms of my identity and my ego, my sense of self and that to live in the world without holding on to certain concepts of who I should be is to enter a world which is unknown in a sense and but if you're not willing to enter a world which is unknown and kind of be unknown to yourself even I think it's very hard to be at peace so they say in Buddhism that the point of mindfulness practice is to see things as they are and one of the implications of that is to see things as we directly perceive them without overlaying generalizations and opinions about what's going on or if we do overlay opinions and views sometimes we need to do then to take the time to check it out with others to kind of get a reality check and see it's what is the way you're interpreting the situation the way other people are interpreting it so questions comments anything that you'd like to yes fall directly into error what do you know is the determination of why i mean but what determine the order of those ten preoccupations oh i have no idea it seemed like a very strange order i don't know some of the some of the some some of these things appear in other lists in in orders in order in orders that make more sense but i don't know which one i wouldn't have thought it would be an order of commonality i have no idea it could be that the person who drew it up that was the order of the experience i don't know yes it's like trust is really important when i think about going into the unknown the first thing to let go and to trust it but i want to impose order of something and letting go and trusting it's helpful yeah and uh one definition of enlightenment is when one's trust has become all pervasive so you can be at ease in the universe in the world your trust is very important so what brings trust for you feeling love feeling love well one of the things i was thinking about today about views is that part of the problem with views and opinions is sometimes they they function to separate us from others if we hold on very tightly or dogmatically to a certain view that the stronger the holding is the stronger we tend to separate ourselves from others and and one way to hold views one way to be involved with views or be involved in the world is to notice a difference between what separates us ourselves from others and what brings us in some place some sense more connected to others allows us to love others more and i think true love doesn't arise out of use if anything views tend to obscure the possibility of love so i talked about peace earlier and the possibility of finding peace but i think it's also there's also possibility of finding love and when the barriers that we set up dissolve yeah the hardest area is for one that's good you know i realize it's um difficult for me i find myself sometimes around views being just around the people who agree with me i've said to myself sometimes not i will not have a for a close friend i cannot have someone with this particular view and it's a difficult contest inside me to measure between views and passion because passion is permissible in my vocabulary and but it creates it is a sticky wicket when you take a stand or when you are an activist or you know of any kind regardless of your views and yet in action or um passivity which is not what i think you're encouraging there's a temptation for people to blend and it's a what you what you're asking uh in terms of people who are really interested in developing your lives very hard thing i think so and as a society encourages us to have views and our friends and everything but um we have to have we have to have views and opinions if we may participate in a responsible way in our society but how do we hold them and we hold them as dogmatists holding this absolutely is absolutely the right way or do we have understand perhaps more pragmatically that in certain contexts this might be true or in this particular time but things change and then how can you change with the changing times and there are times when it's appropriate to to vote yes and other times might be appropriate to vote no for the same same situation depending so um so understand to understand the views kind of hold them lightly we're quite willing to change them is one of the things that's required and what you see a lot is people who stick to a view because you know they're going to be they're going to be a democrat because their father and their grandfather was democrat because they're going to be a democrat because their father and their grandfather was democrat or republican or whatever they they kind of that's the way things are they're going to hold that identity or that view and not be able to be flexible but i was very surprised when i was about 20 i was you know kind of born again hippie or whatever you know kind of way out there on the left and and i remember i took a chemistry class in college where my lab partner was a conservative republic republic and born again christian and and at first i thought uh-oh but i learned very quickly to really like her a lot i think she was really a great woman i kind of had kind of really delighted in her um and i was so surprised that i could really feel some friendship and warmth and delight in someone who was you know such a different such different a different end of the whole spectrum of of political and religious and everything beliefs and i realized that uh that friendliness and open hardness and kindness weren't dependent on the beliefs that the person held and so that loosened me up quite a bit to be open and receptive to people around me so i don't know if that's response to you and what you said i think was really true that i think it's hard to response but it takes when i say rather likely very likely yeah i think it's a difficult one maybe i haven't thought about it as deeply as you have and the floor is open for other people to respond also to dick or to something else yeah you mentioned causality and i think i heard you saying that the idea that we're not that it's not helpful to have really strong ideas about what causes what and but it seems like several times when i've read pieces of buddhist literature there have been these these phrases about causality and how important causality and everything is related and everything causes everything well causality is very important but uh but um cause seeing causality is one thing but uh generalizing about causality is another so for example um um i mean what's neat what's what's a good example i mean if um and and when blanks come on it's kind of blank about the good example but i mean you can cut but you can cut you can kind of you can kind of uh i mean sometimes you can obviously see that if you do um um i mean an example would be that if i went up and put on my shoes and felt like i was in a hurry to get home and i stepped on someone else's foot as i was walking out the door well i can see the causality to that in part is that i was in a hurry and anxious and trying to kind of you know kind of trying to get somewhere but if i decide that uh that from that one event that i'm a harried person and inconsiderate and not a nice person because once i haven't stepped on someone's foot that's a different realm of of uh understanding causality because the cause the cause of connection was i was in a hurry that particular time and i happened because of that perhaps i stepped on someone's foot but to make a leap then uh a speculative leap and say well because of that i'm a lousy person that's not in the realm of causality anymore and but the reason why buddhist want to understand causality very important to understand causality is that we want to take some responsibility for our actions and live in a way that doesn't create more suffering for ourselves and the world around us and but sometimes buddhist description of causality and karma especially when we talk about karma tends to lend itself more in the kind of superstitious of the magical realm and or in the realm of belief and metaphysics you have to kind of take it on faith certain statements that buddhist makes make about karma but i think that the notion of causality is extremely important it's um it helps us if understanding causality helps us make useful pragmatic decisions about how to live our life you know if you see that x causes you know x cause x tends to cause y then you can decide whether you can do x or not so if you notice that um you know if you you yell at your spouse every day when you get home that the rest of the evening is kind of lousy you've seen a causal connection and maybe you want to kind of be careful with you you know how you come home um resolve or determination is um uh it's possible to have a very kind of steady very strong resolve kind of actively determine this is what you're going to do and that resolve having that kind of steady very strong resolve can be a great source of energy and power to actually motivate one in the spiritual life however a person can get attached to that resolve the resolve itself becomes kind of the be all and end all and so one is attached to the resolve to that power of determination um without um realize and that becomes a hindrance because you're holding on to that rather than uh learning to let go oh i think there's a more determination in that sense last last question and then we'll stop talking about society and opinion um one of the things that came to my mind as you started to do that is uh i'd like to send something like you know that statement to rush wood valve and then i started to think about that and one of the things that troubled me personally about society i don't listen to that type of thing but every once in a while i'll turn on the radio just to see what are they doing and what makes me feel very sad and sometimes we're in this bond that when i hear what's going on there is my symbolistic definition of good is bringing oneness things that bring oneness and evil things that bring separation and what i fear is this constant preaching of separation your true opinion through you know you don't think this way you're not one of us you're one of them and um it i have to say that it it scares me and that that so much of our society is built upon that and sometimes i find it difficult to you know know that trying to become part of the solution rather than problems but i think it's an important issue when it centers kind of around the tenions of how we use it things yeah try to you know help such a big thing in our society that creates so much separation one of the um one of the kind of meta meta issues that are it's very important for american culture is the whole notion the whole idea of uh what are beliefs how do we hold beliefs and the great opposition is between those who are absolutists who believe they're absolute values absolute uh kind of bible given kind of truths and you have to live by those regardless on the other hand those who believe that beliefs are relative or conditioned between these two points of view and it's very hard then to reconcile these views of views about how to hold views and so i think thinking about it is very important and how we respond to other people's views and what kind of views we hold is i think an important issue to to address one of the things i thought about in while you're talking about this is that and perhaps it begins to address stick with more character more directly is um uh in buddhism we're very very interested in in intention so regardless of what a person's view is what is the intention behind that view and if the intention is to create discord or create hate uh then i think a buddhist would be very strongly against that but two people can have the same the same view with different intention and so some somewhat person can actually have have this have the intention behind is actually to create a safer more secure place for their community and then he's misguided who knows another person's view is to um is uh is just out of spite and they're angry and they want to really um uh create a segregated society and so they so but it's the same view they're holding the same view and if you understand that the intention is behind it i think we'd have a different reaction to to the different people and also i think it's very hard to have a serious conversation with someone unless you understand the deeper intention behind them because often views the reason why some people hold views is not always so logical so if you try to meet them directly at a logical place um you you don't always um you kind of miss each other unless you understand sometimes the emotional or the intentional level that's below it that's holding it in place but regardless of how you hold views or what you think about views i hope you all have a chance to discover what it's like to be alive uh without at least for a little bit without holding on to any of them good luck thank you
