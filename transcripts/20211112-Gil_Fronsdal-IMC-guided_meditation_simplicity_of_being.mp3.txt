 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, good day, everyone. One of the directions that this practice goes in is to a simplicity of being, where anything that is extra, anything that's really not needed to be happy, peaceful, has kind of fallen away, kind of taken a vacation, so that we give ourself permission, we are given permission, where just to be alive is enough. Breathing, sensing, feeling, knowing, thinking, whatever is happening, and a kind of simplicity of being that highlights what we're doing that's extra, how we get involved and pick up thoughts, pick up concerns, react, push away, want, fixate on certain thoughts and ideas, that the simplicity of being kind of shows us that this is extra. There's something really good happening here, something really nice in this simplicity. Just being alive is enough, nothing to prove, nothing to defend, nothing to, for a few minutes, a radical vacation, a radical pause in the incessant movement of doing and wanting and thinking. And we have permission to do this. Just to be alive is enough for these minutes while meditating. And trust the process. Keep coming back to being simple with what is happening. Simple meaning not getting involved, not fixing, not pushing away, just being, just allowing what's there. And as the mind knows what's happening, let that be simple, just to know. There's a wonderful expression, the cognitive functioning of emptiness, the knowing functioning of radical simplicity, where knowing has no weight, awareness has no weight, no shape, no color, no boundaries, no walls, awareness, our capacity to know, is porous, transparent, just is. And one of the things that falls away with the simplicity of being is all forms of self-preoccupation, self-concern. Not because we're not important and we want to care for ourselves, we do want to care for ourselves. But one of the greatest ways to care for ourselves is to trust, just being alive is enough, just allowing the simplicity of being where there is no self-concern, because in this simplicity it's not needed. So assuming a meditation posture, and to begin a process of simplification, simplify your eyesight, you're looking, maybe let your eyes gaze, look down at the floor, relax your focus so you're not really looking at anything in particular. And as you exhale, closing your eyes, and then feeling your body globally, so you're not landing and standing on any one place in the body, but a global open awareness that maybe roams around the body, but it doesn't take a stand anywhere, it just doesn't get focused on any particular thing for now, just a global feeling of being in a body. As you exhale, relaxing the belly, softening the lower path of the body, including the legs and the thighs and the feet, relaxing in the solar plexus area, the chest, releasing, releasing the shoulders, always going in the direction of being simpler, less work, less activity, less tension, just being here, softening the muscles of the face, if the lips are pressed or the teeth are pressed together, release the pressure, if the jaws are clenched, release the holding, maybe by dropping the jaws open a little bit, softening around the eyes and the forehead, and on the exhale, softening in the mind, letting your thinking, turning whatever thinking you have to gently and quietly think about being here in this body at this time, let your concerns simplify to just what's happening here in your body. And feel your body breathing, the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out, becoming simpler with the breathing, as simple as it's easy to do, not trying to do anything with your breathing, not trying to get concentrated or anything, simple being, simple just breathing, allowing for a self-forgetting as you enter into the world of the body breathing.. simpler as you exhale gently, softly, let go of everything or let go of anything that appears, anything that's more complicated than simply the body breathing. And just maybe at the end of the out breath. You can even let go of yourself, self-concern, self-referencing. The end of the out breath before the in breath, the simplicity of no weight, no color, no shape, no body, no feelings, no thoughts, no mind, no self. None of that needs to be a concern. You're allowed the simplicity of being, just to be alive is enough. You're allowed the simplicity of being, you're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being, you're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. You're allowed the simplicity of being. Let go as you exhale. Let go as you exhale. For these minutes, trust letting go. Let go of anything and everything the mind is involved in until the last thing to let go of is letting go itself. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. Let go of everything the mind is involved in. As we come to the end of this sitting, whatever way you can appreciate your simplicity of being, just being alive is enough. Nothing to prove, nothing to defend. It's enough just sitting here breathing peacefully because all other demands and needs and ways of being have receded for now. Just enough to be alive. In that way, it might be possible to have a particular respect even if you have a particular respect even reverence for others. They too, they too you can allow to be just as they are, the simplicity of being. You can see them as someone with whom you don't need to add desires and needs and demands, just as you see yourself that way for these few moments. So you can also see them that way, free of your needs, your judgments, your desires, your fears, freeing them from projections and demands. And it gives birth to a kind of respect, a kind of reverence for others. Seeing past whatever behavior they have, good or bad, past whatever history they have, to just allowing them to be who they are for a few moments and having a reverence for the life that's there. Another human being is as wondrous as looking out across the ocean at the beach or the vista from a mountain top or the beauty of a flower. The beauty of a flower. Not to deny all the things that we should notice, but not be limited by it. Deep respect, deep reverence for every life. And with that respect, to care for their welfare and happiness. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may we contribute that by freeing others from all the projections and needs and demands that we carry, allowing each person, each being, to be itself. Thank you.
