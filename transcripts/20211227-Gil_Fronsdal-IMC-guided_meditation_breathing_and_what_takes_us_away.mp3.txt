Good morning everyone, good day, hello everywhere. I offer you my warm welcome
and I feel very warm sitting here with you again after being away for a week
and happy to be back. So one of the interesting variations for doing mindfulness
practice is to keep a focus on the breathing. But whatever clearly takes
your attention away from the breathing or clearly makes it difficult to be with
the breathing, then turn towards it and acknowledge it briefly. Maybe all it can
be and needs to be is okay I see you or okay there it is or maybe it's a
particular name, you know, thinking, aching, sound, whatever it might be. But
do a moment or two of acknowledgement and don't rush off after that
acknowledgement. Kind of like the acknowledgement is like dropping a
pebble in a pond and just be there for a moment to watch the ripple out. Just be
there for a moment and allow yourself to register the experience more fully and
then begin again on the breathing. And it doesn't matter how often
you acknowledge something different in the breathing, it only matters that you
do it and then you begin again with your breathing. Just always begin again, don't
linger with anything. In this exercise you might go back to it again and again
the same thing, but don't linger, don't like study it, investigate it, just
acknowledge it, give it its time for a few moments and then begin again on the
breathing. Begin again in the breathing, always on the breathing. But without
denying or pushing away or ignoring what's making it difficult to be with
the breath or what takes you away from breathing, acknowledge it and come back.
And one of the interesting things about this exercise is you start getting a
sense of what it is that takes you away from the breathing. Where does your mind
go? What are the concerns and preoccupations? You don't have to think
about it or do anything about it in meditation, but it's just interesting to
see that and come back. And maybe it doesn't need any more attention than
that. It's enough just to come back to your breathing over and over again. So
assuming a upright posture, either literally or metaphorically, a posture
in which it may feel a bit easier for you to attend to your breathing, accompany
your breathing, the body breathing. Sometimes it's a posture which is a
little more open in the chest. There's more space in the chest to breathe or
a little bit more relaxed in the belly. So there's a room in the belly to relax,
hang forward, and then lowering your gaze about 45 degrees to the floor, not
looking at anything in particular. And when you're ready, you can close your
eyes. And then taking a few long, slow, deep breaths.
Breathing in and breathing out.
Re-familiarizing yourself with the experience of breathing. Deep, deep
breath. Long exhale here, now.
And then letting your breathing return to normal. And on the exhale, relax more.
On the exhale, relax the muscles of the face. Release the shoulders and soften
the belly. On the inhale, feel your body broadly, globally. And on the exhale,
release your body globally, widely. Let go. Soften in your body.
And then settling in to the body's experience of breathing. Maybe like an
airplane coming into land. Everything gets very still and focused and quiet.
Coming into land in your breathing, feeling the rhythm of breathing in and
breathing out.
And letting breathing be the center of your world. But if anything takes you
away from that center, take a few moments to relaxedly, clearly acknowledge it.
It could be as simple as an imaginary nod in the head. Or I see you or okay. And
then begin again with your breathing. No need to linger with anything that takes
you away from the breathing. Just acknowledge it. Register it. And begin
again with your breathing, relaxing into your breathing.
Whatever takes you away from your breathing, you can acknowledge it.
Kindly. Acknowledge it peacefully. Even if it's a surprising new thing, receive it
peacefully.
Learning the art of turning the attention to what is happening so that it's a
peaceful meeting between our awareness and what's happening in this way of
meeting the world allows for what's good in the world to show itself more
clearly. And may it be that this meditation practice supports us to see what
is good in the world, what is good in others. And may we value it and appreciate
it. And this seeing the good in the world and appreciating it is one of the
ways of living for the welfare and happiness of others. When what is good
is appreciated, it has a chance to grow. It's not ignored. May this community of
ours that meditate together these weekday mornings. May the benefit of our
collective practice be for the welfare and happiness of the world. May it
spread out from us with our ability to see and appreciate what is good in others
even when they can't see it. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free.
