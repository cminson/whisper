 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. www.r So warm hello for this Monday morning. And I greet both you, all who are attending here now on this live YouTube broadcast. In our YouTube, in the middle of our YouTube Sangha community. And also welcome those who you might be listening to this later. And realize there are people who, for different reasons, all kinds of reasons listen to this later. And you're just as much part of my heartfelt Sangha, YouTube Sangha, as those of you who are alive. So, so people who meditate sooner or later will contend with the mind's tendency to think. Some people think more in words, some people think more in images, some people do a combination of both. And there's a lot of variation in the whole thinking process. For how people, some people are very somatic in their thinking, some people are more mental in their thinking. It's just a wide range. And thinking has a big impact on our lives. It can direct our lives, transform our lives, and it can challenge our lives in big ways. So, coming to terms with thinking. What I'd like to suggest for this morning is that if and when you notice that your mind is thinking a lot, wondering off in thought rather than settling down to meditate with the breathing, that you don't simply let go of your thoughts and begin again with your breathing, but that you take a moment to just recognize how strongly or how much you're thinking and kind of the attitude of the thinking. Just briefly touch into it that way. And then, rather than letting go of the thoughts and coming back to your breathing, think about something, have thoughts that are kind of like the balancing thoughts for the thoughts you're having. Balancing in their pace, their speed, balancing in their emotional qualities, maybe, in a way that's beneficial for you. So, if you're thinking a lot about, I don't know, if you're thinking a lot about, you know, concerns about what's happening the rest of the day, perhaps when you recognize that's what's happening, take just a few sentences or so to quietly have thoughts about how you might be content sitting here now, here and now. Content that, you know, at this moment you don't have to do something, or content now that you're comfortable enough in your body, or something, just have little thoughts, a little bit of a counter thoughts, antidote thoughts. And it'd be very helpful if these thoughts were really aimed at meditation. So, oh, it's hard to meditate with a busy mind, but it's okay, I'll do my best. Or, now I think it's a time to bring my attention carefully to my breathing, and then you bring it to the breathing. And so, take a few moments to consciously think something, in the wake of having found yourself thinking, and maybe those thoughts you do point you back to the meditation in a nice way. Maybe they're thoughts that are kind for yourself, maybe there's even kind thoughts directed towards yourself. So that's the instruction for today, and if you really don't like it, you don't have to do it, of course. So, assuming an upright posture, and gently closing the eyes, and as you breathe, perhaps you can gentle your body, the gentling within, or a softening. And then to leisurely take a few long, slow, deep breaths, three quarters full, and leisurely relax as you exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And direct your attention to the area around your forehead, your eyes, and as you exhale, relax. Maybe as you relax these parts of the body, you can have a very light thought of well-wishing, or goodwill, or appreciation for this part of your body. Relaxing around the eyes and the forehead, maybe softening the jaws. Exhaling and relaxing the shoulders. And the exhale, softening the belly. On the exhale, softening the whole body, whatever way you might be braced against life. Let it soften. And then settling in with your breathing. And as a kind of beginning of meditation on breathing, tell yourself some supportive thoughts for what you're going to do now. Give yourself a little, a few thoughts, thoughts that carry a nice attitude and have nice words for yourself. Have encouragement and appreciation for this practice, your practice of mindfulness. It's appreciating your practice of mindfulness of breathing. And then settling in to the body breathing, settling in to the body's experience of breathing. And when you find yourself drifting off in thought, take a moment to recognize something about that thinking. And replace it with thoughts that are supportive of your meditation, that are supportive of you as a meditator. Thoughts of encouragement. And then give yourself over to the meditation. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. If you find yourself thinking, the counter thought might be as simple as, here with the breathing is the place to be. Let me center myself on the breathing again. Maybe even adding a very quiet but delightful yes, affirming that that's what you'll do. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. If you find yourself drifting off in thought, have quiet thoughts that return you, point you back to here now. That somehow are an alternative to the momentum of the previous thoughts. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. And as we come to the end of this sitting, to say a few generous thoughts of goodwill and how you say it is as important as what you say to offer goodwill to the people that you'll encounter today or those that you'll run into in the streets and the roads, neighbors, people that you'll somehow encounter through email or messages or through the news. In an important way, we are connected to everyone. Our lives are deeply interconnected in ways that we can't even see. And to the degree to which they are part of your life, you're part of their life. You don't know each other. And to come out of meditation and to wish well to this world and to have this well-wishing be the bridge between a kind of inner meditation and the world around you. May it be that this meditation supports each of us to make this a happier world for everyone. May this practice of mindfulness support us in making this a safer world for everyone. May it be that our practice is expressed in making this world a more peaceful place for everyone. And may it be that this practice allows us or shows us how to offer freedom to everyone, the freedom from our needs and attachments and clings, freedom from our fears. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. May all beings be free.
