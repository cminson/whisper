 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. So, entering into your body with your awareness and assuming a meditation posture, a posture for being alert and present, a posture that affirms that you are here now. And to gently close your eyes. And again, affirming that you are here, present. Taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. Maybe on a long inhale, the feeling of fullness that comes in the torso as you breathe in. Take it as an affirmation that you are here, nowhere else. And in the long exhale, releasing into here, just here, now. Letting your breathing return to normal. And as you exhale, relaxing your body. Each relaxation embodied affirmation that you are here. Here in this body, at this time, on the exhale, softening in the face. Relaxing any intentness, forward looking that's carried in the face. The eyes settle back in their sockets. On the exhale, softening in the shoulders. To the degree to which the shoulders can relax, it's an affirmation of their trusting, relaxed ability to trust the moment, not tense against it. On the exhale, softening in the heart, relaxing and trusting, a settleness, a relaxation in the heart, and softening in the belly. And relaxing anywhere else where you might be holding tight or stiff, the arms and the fingers. In your hip joint and down your legs. Perhaps relaxing, softening in the spine. Then settling in to the body's experience of breathing. Maybe letting the inhale be a kind of gentle affirmation of being here. And the exhale to be relaxed, letting go into here. Just here. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Blossoming of open, relaxed awareness supported by breathing in and breathing out. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. And here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. Here is where awareness can be established and can blossom. So, with your whole body affirming that you are here, feeling the weight of your body, maybe against your seat, the substantiality of your body, clearly recognize and affirming you are here nowhere else. And within this here, this affirmed presence, breathing, as the primary physical activity that's occurring as you sit quietly. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, whatever is happening for you, that's present moment happening is a thing to accept indirect experience. And in accepting it to affirm that you are simply here, here, simply, aware, but maybe not troubled, just aware, breathing with what is, breathing, and as we come to the end of the sitting, perhaps to recognize that when we are at odds with what is in our direct experience, if we're tensing against it, judging it, we have less affirmed presence, less fullness of being to offer the world, to affirm oneself being here in the present moment as if you have a right to be here, means that more of you here, to be friendly, to have goodwill, to be generous, or to simply listen better to others, to offer your presence, may it be that as we practice mindfulness, it gives us the ability to be more present for others, more caring for this world. May it be that this practice that we do, this large community at the 7 a.m. sitting, that we collectively aspire to contribute to the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful, and may all beings be free. The The The The
