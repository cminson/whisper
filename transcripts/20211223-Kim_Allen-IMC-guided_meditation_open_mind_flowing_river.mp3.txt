The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

All right, so it is the top of the hour.
So we will go ahead and get started with today's meditation.
It's nice to see all of you.
So just allowing yourself to settle in,
bringing the attention inward.
If you're comfortable doing so, you can close your eyes.
Maybe just being aware of our wonderful global sangha
that we're all sitting together.
And just using that as a way of stabilizing your mind, your body,
the awareness of all of us.
And maybe sensing into the spot where you're sitting.
Your seat against the chair, the cushion, the bench.
Or maybe you're even standing.
And just softening into that support.
And then just inviting ease throughout the body.
So softening the face, the muscles of the forehead, around the eyes, around the mouth.
The eyes and the eye sockets.
Down through the neck, shoulders.
Feeling down into the chest area, the rib cage, front, back, sides.
Releasing the diaphragm.
Down into the belly area.
Just letting that be soft, useful.
And then the arms and the legs, letting go of freezing, tightness, all the way into the hands and the feet.
And then we'll also invite the mind into our invitation to ease.
So opening to any thoughts or emotions that are present.
Anything is welcome, of course, just inclining the mind, the heart towards softening, toward ease.
Maybe imagining our mindfulness, our awareness to be very large, like the sky or the ocean.
And just letting any of the body sensations, emotions, thoughts be like clouds or ripples in this larger fabric of awareness.
Giving ourselves some breathing room.
And if there are places in the body that feel sore or tight, that's fine.
We can just make mindfulness larger than that, let it hold those places.
And the same in the mind, if it's some part of it is busy or worried.
If there's a sort of an overcast to the mind that too can just be held in our awareness.
The sky is not troubled by any clouds that are present.
The ocean is not troubled by any waves or kelp that is present.
So inclining the mind today toward an open awareness.
The mind or heart that can hold it all.
And we'll likely find that there's a tendency for the mind
to contract a bit.
Something will grab onto it and the mind will get pulled into a thought trail or concern about some feeling in the body.
And we will notice at some point that the mind is not open, is not playing the role of just holding what's going on.
So as soon as we see that we can just invite a broader mind, invite openness again, release what the mind has gotten caught up in.
In another way we're releasing the mind, doing something with the mind, but in another way we're freeing that object or that sensation.
Letting our experience be free from our influence.
Letting our mind generously liberate experience as it happens.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Time to time we can check into the body, just scanning through to see if places of tension have crept in.
It's normal that we'll discover maybe something in the shoulder or the belly, the neck, and then we can just again invite ease and relaxation.
We can also check into the mind that has drifted into doing some other task.
Or if it's only partially mindful.
Checking from time to time.

I'm gently checking in with the mind and the body.
As any tension or risen anywhere that could be eased by noticing it and inviting ease as the mind drifted into some kind of wanting or not wanting
or a state of low or high energy and just inviting a rebalancing of the mind.
