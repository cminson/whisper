 And the next introductory course, I think, starts sometime maybe the end of April. And these first few meetings after the introductory course, I continue as if the introductory course never ends. I just continue with a few topics to kind of build on the course. And hopefully interesting for everyone. And the first topic that I'd like to talk about for this evening would then be what's known as the Five Hindrances. This is a very important topic for people who do this kind of meditation. Or it's an important topic for anyone who wants to live a life that is to some degree awake, some degree present, mindful of what's going on in their lives as they live their lives. And the reason why it's important to become aware of these Five Hindrances is that, according to the way the Buddha categorizes things, these are the five forces of the mind which make it most difficult for us to be present. And maybe I suspect that many of you, all of you were visited by the Hindrances during this last half an hour. Unless you were able to be pristinely present for every single moment of the whole half an hour, chances are your mind wandered off into one of these. So they're called Hindrances because they're those which hinder our ability to be present. And there's many things you can point to that hinder our ability to be present. Fear, inhibition, desire. And this is a particular list, the Buddha thought was a particularly powerful forces. The five hindering qualities of the mind. And these are desire, the first one. Second one is ill will, sometimes called aversion. The third is restlessness and anxiety. The fourth is this wonderful term sloth and torpor. I never use the word sloth except when I give this talk. And the last one is doubt. So these can be very powerful forces not only in meditation practice, and in life of trying to be mindful, but they're actually powerful forces in the rest of our life also. And just a little bit of reflection would show that these things operate in our society, really prevalent forces. And before I go into them, one of the things I want to emphasize is that one of the tenets of Buddhism, very important teachings of Buddhism, and that is rather than pursuing the ideal, Buddhism emphasizes understanding the actual. If there's a gap between the ideal and the actual, pay attention to the actual. And it works this way, that if you pursue the ideal without noticing what's actually happening with you, without being really truthful about where you're actually at, it can be an artificial construction of the ideal. You can kind of put a veneer over yourself, you're trying to be compassionate, trying to be present. And it's kind of a veneer of compassion, of kindness, of whatever, rather than something that's really deeply heartfelt. But if you go in and really address what's actually happening with you, even though it might be undesirable and unpleasant, that's really getting back into the root of what's really going on with you at the moment. And you can trace that back into your heart, in a sense, into your core of who you are, to find your core motivation, your core intention that you want to live from, and help probably live in a more honest and truthful way. This is one of the reasons why in Buddhism we tend to be a little bit mistrustful, not that it's always a bad idea, but a little bit mistrustful of the whole movement of positive thinking, or affirmations. Because affirmations have a tendency of kind of putting a veneer over what's actually happening. I'm depressed, so I'm going to say to myself over and over again, I'm happy. And you might have a semblance of happiness over that, and maybe to some degree you are a little bit happier. But a person really hasn't understood the roots of depression, and really understood them in order to be free of them, and not to resolve it and clarify it. And the function of mindfulness practice is really to get down to the root of our psyche, and really understand the depths of it, rather than just to kind of overlay some ideal on top of it. So mindfulness practice becomes kind of a truth-telling practice. We want to be really truthful about what we're actually at. The actual is a doorway to the ideal. So we want to really be honest where we're at. We don't want to sit down and say, well, I don't like who I am today, so I think I'll pretend I'm someone else and then try to wake up. We want to be present for who we are. And so these five hindering qualities, rather than thinking of them as being bad, or the enemies of your spiritual life, think of them as being the doorway into getting deeper into your life, greater intimacy, greater depth of spirituality, depth of presence in your life. But really learning how to be honest with these, seeing them honestly when they arise, and learning how to recognize them when they come even from a distance. Really recognize them when they just begin to happen. Not simply to notice that you're in the throes of desire 10, 20 minutes, 24 hours later. You don't end up suddenly married to a millionaire in Las Vegas. And said, oh, I wasn't thinking very clearly. You know, the hindrance of desire somehow got the upper hand here. So to recognize these things will just begin is very important. And so one of the tasks of mindfulness is to learn to recognize these things, to become a connoisseur of them, to not think of them as a problem, but think of them as really, oh, this is a chance for me to develop my ability to be mindful by really noticing what it is that tends to take away my mindfulness. So in other words, the five hindrances are kind of the place, the things which make it difficult for us to be mindful. It's really beautiful because it means that we pay attention to that which makes it difficult for us to be present. Isn't that great? Rather than kind of think, oh, it's terrible, I hate that part of myself, or kind of slash and learn kind of approach to parts of our psyche. And it's like we're really interested in that part of us which makes difficulty present. And that does two things. It makes us present for something, for that, even though it might be unpleasant. But also it teaches us to become real connoisseurs, real experts at recognizing these forces when they appear so that we have the upper hand, so that mindfulness is stronger than these powerful forces. The analogy I like to use is that of a black hole. The five hindrances are like these five black holes in the mind. When they're operating strongly, awareness gets sucked in just like light gets sucked into a black hole. Light doesn't come out. So when awareness gets sucked in by desire or ill will, it doesn't come out and you hardly even know what you're doing because you're so lost in that world, it can be. So the first one is desire and the second one is aversion. And these two kind of are partners, they're kind of like opposites. Desire is wanting and aversion is wanting to go away, pushing it away. What's interesting about these first two is that they almost always involve an object. There's something that we want, something we want to push away. We don't like. And so when we live in the first of these two hindering qualities, the mind is involved in objectifying reality. It's living in the world of objects. We have this thing being sex objects. Someone treated me like I was an object. It felt really terrible. To treat the world as objects is a little bit heretical from the point of view of Buddhism because in a sense there is nothing outside of us, from the psychological understanding of the Buddha or from this understanding of awakening. Of course there's things outside of us. We're not denying that. But in the empirical world or let's say the phenomenological world of our direct experience, we only experience things as being separate from us. We have to construct an idea that is separate from us. The seeing happens not out there. It happens when light contacts our retina and then whatever happens in the brain as a result. You hear someone speaking. It isn't that that voice is happening outside of you. You're hearing that voice because of what's happening and resonating, what's the waves inside of your own ears. When you touch something, that touching is intimate. It's not separate from outside of you. There are sensations within you that are feeling that. So if that makes sense to you, from that point of view, Buddhism says nothing is outside of you, but to relate to something as an object outside of you is a kind of a problem. And what we're trying to do is to feel life much more intimately than that out there. So it's most problematic in these first of these two hindering qualities. I want that thing. I don't want that thing. As opposed to simply experiencing it in the holistic field of awareness. It doesn't have to be considered as an object inside or outside of oneself. One of the great interesting discoveries that some people have on retreats, they come to retreats expecting these ten-day vipassana retreats to be silent retreats. So they're expecting pristine silence. You can just hear a pin drop or whatever. And you come down. This is your chance to get fully, perfectly enlightened. And this is you really happy. This is your chance. And you finally got there in retreat. And the person next to you snorts, sniffles, coughs, has this down Parker on that dimension. They move a lot, kind of crackles. And they seem to be always crackling their knuckles. And like, what's this person doing? This is a silent retreat. And they're disturbing my retreat. They're disturbing my serenity, my peace. And we treat it as an object which is disturbing us. And inevitably someone will come on these retreats and say, this person near me is just bugging the hell out of me. Can't you kind of get rid of them? Or what can I do? And they're living in this world as if there's an outside and inside. And what happens after some days, they'll come back and say, you know, there is no outside and inside. It isn't like a sound outside of there that's disturbing me inside of here. It's just like the birds singing, you know, just like this stuff that's going through. What was happening before was I had this wall of self, this wall of my desires, my needs, my retreat, my enlightenment that I was protecting and holding on to. And that sound was colliding with that wall of self, this wall that I was creating. But when I dropped the wall, it wasn't a problem anymore. And there was no sense, even though those sounds was outside of me, it was no longer an object outside, it was just what was happening. Does that make some sense to you? And then they say, well, it wasn't a problem, it wasn't a hindrance. Actually, my meditation developed quite nicely with this person making all their noise. There's no distractions in mindfulness practice unless you put up a wall, unless you put up some idea or value or clinging that the so-called distractions is encountering some interpretation and idea. So my teacher in Burma, when he first started meditating in the monastery, he had a roommate. Now, my teacher was just, he was kind of like a warrior approach to spirituality. He was full of dignity and very powerful man. And when he did things, he just kind of threw himself in with great diligence and seriousness. Kind of a perfectionist kind of type. And his roommate was this no-good, lousy, lazy bum. So my teacher, he would stay up late at night to meditate and get up early in the morning meditating in his bed. And this guy, his roommate, just would stay the first chance he got, and didn't meditate much. And on top of that, he snored. So the first two nights, my teacher was sitting there meditating, and, same thing, this guy is disturbing my meditation. What a distraction. I can't meditate with this kind of distraction. And after a couple of days of this, he changed his head. He said, well, I won't resist it anymore, but I'll take the snoring as the subject of my meditation, the focus of my meditation. And he would take a deep breath. I'd just do listening meditation on the snoring. And he just listened. And he'd let go of all his ideas and all his judgments and everything else, and just listen to sounds. And he got very concentrated. He became his entryway into a deep world of insight meditation. So rather than thinking of things as being problems, we take them to be something to pay attention to. And it's really an interesting way to shift your life. Stop looking at life as having problems, but rather looking at life as offering you things that want your attention, that need your attention, that you bring your attention to, to study and get to know better. So the desire and aversion have to do with objectifying the world, something I don't want, something I don't want. Desire is... It camouflages itself very well, because when we're lost in desire, it's often pleasant. It can be very pleasant, unless we're frustrated in a desire. But the fantasy of desire, sitting here meditating, we have some wonderful fantasy of desire that the mind goes off into. They're usually somewhat infatuating, you're thinking about how wonderful it would be to be in Tahiti right now, rather than meditating here in wet California. And so we have wonderful thoughts and ideas about Tahiti and how great they would be and who you'd be there with. And all these things. And it's very pleasant, it's very luring and enchanting to be caught up in that. So it's sometimes very difficult to see when the awareness gets hindered by getting infatuated by desire. Aversion, sometimes people are infatuated with also. Some people get a lot of sense of vitality and energy from getting filled with rage and anger, and they like that feeling of vitality, because it's the only way they get it in their life. Or a sense of being self justified or self righteous by being able to criticize someone else. But usually the hindrance of aversion tends to be more unpleasant than the one of desire. And so people are often much more motivated to try to overcome being lost in their aversion. And some people actually will take being lost in their desires as being a vacation. So they don't really want to try to wake up. But the important thing is to recognize these things when they occur. See them very clearly, oh this is a desire, my mind is caught up in desire and wanting. It can want anything at all. It can be sitting here meditating, and simply the chair you're sitting in isn't just quite as comfortable as you could think it could be, it's a little bit uncomfortable. And so you start desiring a better chair. Maybe the chair, some of these chairs have armrests, you know. How would we like to have an armrest? My arms are a little bit tired, you know, it would be great. And you fantasize about what it would be like to have an armrest, and how to get an armrest, you'd probably get enlightened with no time. And so the mind kind of goes down the track of desire. And it could be much more gross. It can be thinking about desiring what's going to happen tomorrow at work, or planning your career for your whole life. There's always things we want, and we get swept up in it so easily. Or it can be aversion. You're sitting here with a little bit uncomfortable, we're not desiring a better seat, but rather we're thinking about all the ways we can destroy the seats we're in. And criticizing, how could these Buddhists have chosen this particular place to have their meditation classes, where they have such bad seats? All these churches in Palo Alto, and certainly they could have chosen a place that had better seats. Who are these Buddhists anyway, choosing some bad seats? And by the way, why are they having these classes on Thursday anyway? You know, it could do it on Wednesday and be better. And so the mind is very easily sometimes getting cut up in aversion, wanting things different, kind of attacking things. This is the problem, seeing the problem of things. You want to get rid of it, push it away, and be critical. And in either case, whether it's desire or aversion, if we're swept up in it, we're preoccupied in it, we're not awake, we're not present, we're not mindful of what's going on. It isn't that we need to stop being desirous or stop being aversive. It isn't that the awakening is the enemy of our spiritual life, but rather what we're learning to do is not to have them get in our way, not to have them be black holes, to let our mindfulness be our awareness, let our mind be strong enough, so that we have the upper hand, so we're really present and aware, knowing they're happening. If we know that we're involved with aversion or desire, if you know it clearly enough, you're not caught by it. And that's all we're asking. This is not a war zone, trying to get rid of parts of who we are. We don't consider any part of ourselves as being bad or wrong. All we're trying to do is to wake up to it, so that our mindfulness becomes stronger than it. And if we do that, then we can choose to live much more responsibly and wiser in our lives. One of the rules I have for myself is when I notice that I'm in the midst of a hindrance attack, lost in hindrance, so basically hardly coming out of it at all, that I try not to make decisions, you know, filled with desire, filled with aversion or anger, but rather wait until I'm not caught by it, not preoccupied by it, and then I'll make the decision that has to be made. Because I've learned that if I make the decision wrong in the middle of my hindrance, then I often make unwise decisions. Now these hindrances, the Buddhist word for them is not actually hindrance, maybe a poor English translation. The Pali word is kavirana, which translates more literally as coverings. So that which covers our awareness, covers our deeper integrity, covers our ability to be deeply in touch with ourselves, covers perhaps our deepest intentions. And so one of the interesting things to ask yourself, or to explore, when you find when these hindering qualities come up, what is it covering? What's it covering up? For example, desire is often a cover for something deeper going on inside of us. If we feel uncomfortable in some way, we feel maybe some lack of self-worth, or some lack of not feeling kind of insufficient or inadequate or lonely or guilty or filled with shame or all kinds of feelings we might have about ourselves which are uncomfortable. One of the functions of desire sometimes is to hide that from us or to cover it up, to make things better for ourselves, to kind of hide from it by kind of losing ourselves in something very pleasant. And we do it regularly, many of us, we turn on the television, we go to the refrigerator, we go to the movies, and we do things which kind of are pleasant as a way of getting away from, escaping from ourselves. And the mind is very tricky in this way. And sometimes when you find yourself lost in strong desire, it's very hard to wake up from it. Ask yourself, is there something that is covering up? There's some deeper thing that's actually going on in here for me. Same thing with aversion. What's it covering? It might also cover some feeling of something's kind of being on or off. Maybe the same ones as a desire might cover. It's just a different strategy of how to try to deal with it. If you're feeling kind of inadequate or kind of lonely or kind of bad about myself, I don't want to look at that. So I think I'll find someone to criticize, that person's wrong, that person's bad. And it's a lot more pleasant, perhaps, to find something, everything wrong with someone else as a way of avoiding how we're really feeling ourselves. So we have to kind of go in to wake up and be really honest, to wake up and really learn how to be present. We have to learn how to be present for that which about ourselves, which we're not comfortable with. If you think that spiritual life is only about going from greater and greater beauty, greater and greater pleasure, you're in trouble. It's by becoming increasingly honest about who we are. And that means being willing to be present for parts of ourselves that we don't find comfortable. Without that willingness, you can't wake up and become free. So desire and aversion arise, and we try to see it clearly. We try to notice it, maybe sometimes naming it desire when it arises. Desire, desire, aversion, aversion is very helpful to free us from it. But it can be very hard to kind of free the awareness enough to see it really clearly and not get sucked back in again. And so one of the ways to help us with that is to feel what it feels like in our body to have the desire and the aversion. Not to get caught up in just noticing the thoughts about desire and aversion, but noticing the felt sense in the body, what it's like to be desirous or aversive. It's fascinating with these things to feel how the center of gravity switches, shifts sometimes. And when there's desire, sometimes we move forward a little bit. And if there's aversion, we kind of move back a little bit. They're kind of reaching forward in desire. You can watch this sometimes. If you're walking to lunch some day, notice where your center of gravity is. Notice how you're ahead of yourself. Notice they're reaching. You're going to meet someone you really don't want to see. Maybe your boss has called you in for an important meeting. Oh! Notice how maybe there's kind of a tight thing, a kind of resistance in your body out of that aversion. But start noticing what's going on in your body, where it gets tight, where it constricted, where it gets lean forward. How desire and aversion manifest itself in your body is a very effective way to learn how not to be caught by desire and aversion. It's a way of learning how to be present for it without being tricked by the stories connected with it. So one of the ways to wake up and be present is to feel it in your body. The next two hindrances also are peers. Restlessness and anxiety on one hand, kind of agitated states, and sloth and torpor on the other side, kind of fatigued or down kind of states. Energized states and de-energized states. And now restlessness can be a real challenge to sit with when we're meditating because restless doesn't want to sit still and we're trying to sit still. And it can be quite dramatic. Sometimes it can feel like you're riding a rodeo. You're committed for half an hour to sit still and just be mindful. And in order to do that, you have to break out into sweat because your legs are about to bolt from the door. And then your mind is very clever to justify and comes up with all kinds of reasons why you shouldn't sit there with all this restlessness, why you should give in to it. No one's ever died of restlessness. And it's very powerful and very effective, very freeing to commit yourself to sitting still in a gentle way, doesn't have to be kind of tight, and not giving in to the restlessness and just let it course through your body. And to feel it in your body. Restlessness is particularly useful to feel in your body. What's happening in your body as you feel restless? Your legs, your arms, your chest, your hands, your face. And sometimes it can feel like these huge ping pong balls are kind of flying about inside. And just make your body as big a container as you need to be in order to hold all that energy. Just hold it and let it kind of do what it wants within you. And probably what you'll find is that it settles down pretty quickly. You're going to have to expect that sooner or later, if you're meditating regularly, you're going to encounter restlessness. And so rather than, now you've been told to expect it, it's not a problem, it's just one of the hindrances. It's not getting in the way of your meditation, it becomes how you develop your meditation by learning how to be present with the restlessness, how to develop some strength to it. Maybe investigate what is that covering? Is restlessness covering something? Maybe it's something you really don't want to look at. And so it's better to be restless. And so if you're restless, you're kind of trying to get away. It's kind of a form of escape sometimes. And then sloth and torpor are not just physical fatigue, but they arise as a form of resistance to being present. Because it's not always so easy to be present, sometimes we become kind of... It's like a whiny kid. Or like I like to call it my seer's mind. Because when I was 10 years old, my mother would take me to Sears to go shopping for clothes. And I hated it. And as soon as we walked into Sears, I would get really tired. Phenomenally tired. And as soon as we left Sears, my mother offered, you know, you'd like to have some ice cream. There was nothing wrong with my energy level. I was quite energetic. The fatigue was a kind of resistance. You know, I'd kind of give up. I'd kind of drain my energy. So to look at fatigue, if it's just physical tiredness, maybe you're better off just going to sleep. We're asleep to a type of culture. If Buddhism is going to help us live more healthy lives, it encourages us to get more sleep. But if it's not just simply physical fatigue, but something deeper, then you can look and see, what's it covering up? What am I not paying attention to? Is there resistance here? Sloth and torpor. You can have a physical aspect, you can have a mental. If you're more physical and torpor is mental, the mind becomes like quicksand or like thick, gooey stuff. How this kind of dull doesn't seem to want to work. One of the things that can be very effective with sloth and torpor is rather than giving into it or giving up, or rather than kind of believing it, or rather than resisting it, or rather than kind of pulling back. It's to actually turn the awareness directly at it and look exactly pinpoint within your body, pinpoint within your psychophysical being, where the sensations of sloth and torpor reside. Where are they actually in you? Can you feel the heaviness in your face and the eyelids and your shoulders? Can you feel where exactly in your brain, in the mind, does that dull experience, that kind of clouded feeling seem to be? There's a kind of way in which we look very carefully, very mindfully, bring some energy of mindfulness to look at the very place where we're tired, that itself tends to wake things up and clarify things. In any case, that's what the practice is, is to look very carefully at the heart of what's going on. And if you're sleepy or slothful, you will look at the heart of that, what's actually happening for you, rather than staying one or two steps removed, thinking about it. If we stay a couple of steps removed, thinking about any of the hindrances, then we're more likely, we're kind of caught by them. Still, kind of preoccupied, easily pulled into them, but it is to bring the mindfulness into them very closely and see them clearly, being very honest and see them for what they are. The last hindrance is doubt. And doubt is said to be the most dangerous hindrance, because doubt is the hindrance which will most likely get you to give up the practice. I doubt my ability to do this, I can't do this, I'm not the right person for this, this is not the right day for it, it's not the right hour for it, this is not the right practice for me, it must be better practice than this, this is not the right group to be meditating with, this is not the right teacher. We have all this doubt, I don't know what to do here, should I pay attention to my breath, should I pay attention to the person snoring next to me, I don't know what I should do, I'm not good enough for this. Mine can be filled with these thoughts of doubt. And it's dangerous because we can believe them all too easily. If we believe them then we can forget this, I think I'll go into the movies instead. It's very important to recognize that we don't have to believe our thoughts. And for some people that's a really radical idea, because some people think of their thoughts as who they are. So any thought we have must be really true and worth having it. We don't have to believe our thoughts, you become a life that's a lot easier, more easeful if you don't believe every thought you have. But just let them go, just oh, that's an interesting thought. But in particular with doubts, you don't have to believe them, but rather what we're asked to do is to recognize it when it occurs, oh, this is doubt. I heard about this, and it's happening. This is doubt. I'm having a full-blown attack of doubt. Isn't this interesting? Here's a human being who's full of doubt. I was told in my class, oh yeah, when doubt occurs, you can expect it. I'm supposed to just notice it, as opposed to give in to give in to it or believe it or get sucked up in it. Oh, it's a rather unpleasant doubt. It's all about doubt about me. Wow! Imagine, I'm sure I'm not the first person to doubt myself. I'm not going to be the last person to doubt myself. Every meditator doubts themselves sooner or later, now it's my turn. Wow, let's notice this. What does it feel like to have doubt? What's it about? You know, what does it feel like in my body? Maybe there's kind of feeling of resistance in the body, or hesitation in the body. Doubt often has, with an equality of hesitation, will hold ourselves back from throwing ourselves into doing the practice or doing anything that we're trying to do. Doubt also can be a covering. It's interesting to explore under the surface of doubt. Maybe doubt is arising out of an interpretation that our spiritual life is supposed to unfold in a particular way, and my life is not unfolding in a way it's supposed to unfold. Therefore, maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I can't do this. Maybe I'm not the right person for it. We have all these doubts. If we have this idea that what's supposed to happen is supposed to get calm or blissful or serene in a direct linear way, just, you know, and then you don't do that, then there can be doubt. So there might be an interpretation that's the hook for your doubt that's feeding the doubt. I read a letter, kind of a letter some years ago, of an American priest who went with a church group to Mount Athos in Greece, which is a place of great Greek Orthodox Christianity monastic center, all these monastic temples there. And they were going there on tour, and they met this old monk who'd been there for maybe some 45 years. And the monk said to them, monk was kind of bitter and sour. And they asked him, you know, why, you know, what's going on with you? And he said, I've been here for 45 years, and I still haven't learned pure prayer. And the person who's recounting this in the letter said, well, what was really sad was not that he'd been there for 45 years and still hadn't attained pure prayer. What was sad was that after 45 years of being in the monastery, he still expected to attain it. It's not about attaining some great purity, some great beauty, but rather it's really learning how to be ruthlessly honest about who we actually are, not who we're supposed to become. In that ruthless honesty of being present for ourselves as we are, there's the opportunity of becoming free of these forces that drive us, that compel us. And it's a freedom from all compulsion which will make you peaceful, not the freedom from any particular state or thought or ideas. Make sense? So now you've been warned by the hindrances. Don't expect, you know, you can expect them. They're part of our human nature. And you can just, you don't have to be welcoming of them exactly, but don't be discouraged when they appear. One of the things this means is that when you're trying to do a mindfulness meditation that involves trying to learn to become mindful in the present moment, stay in the present moment mindful of what's happening, the very things which are distracting you from the present moment, you have to learn to pay attention to those carefully. So rather than always pushing away the distractions, you want to turn towards the distractions and learn to wake up in the middle of them. And then once they've been taken care of, then you can come back to your breath and continue that way. So I hope that makes some sense tonight. So now is your turn if you have any questions that you want for clarification or whatever. Isn't that clear? Or we are all having a sloth and torpor attack. Do any of these states sound familiar? I just want to say something kind of funny. When you think of the hindrances at first, I thought the last one was death. Death? And then, really? Because I wasn't... I said, yeah, I said, woo! Yeah, not death. Because I was like, wait, you gotta say that's death. Anyway, I thought that was first. So I guess I wasn't pronouncing my words very well. Yes? During meditation I kind of knew I was supposed to look at what was going on in my mind. Does that make any sense that I know something's going on at all? I knew I was distracted in my life. In what? If you know you're distracted in that moment, you're mindful. If you know what's going on, you're present. But if you get lost in it, if you know it for a moment and then you get lost in it again, then you've lost your presence. But by knowing it, does it mean that you make it go away? No, which means you're mindful of it. Once you're mindful of it, you can bring more attention to it. And the stronger the attention, the stronger the light of awareness is. It really recognizes what's going on. That animal idea? No, just really seeing it. It's like... Unless it was too personal, what were you being distracted by? One of the things was just a conversation I had. What am I doing? This is not what I want to do. So I don't know about it. I thought, am I supposed to figure out why I'm thinking about this conversation? Or just let it go? Think about later? Thinking about later might be okay. But in meditation we're not trying to analyze anything. There's no need to think about it and figure anything out. But rather you want to see it clearly as an event in the present moment, not something to figure out. We use the non-discursive ability to have non-discursive awareness to just see it. Oh, there's a conversation happening. And if it continues, you might just name it. Talking, talking, talking. Just to name it, name it. If it's very compelling, if it's very compulsive, that kind of conversation, then you might want to look a little bit under the surface of it what's covering. And probably where it's some emotion. And then if you don't connect to the emotion, the emotion will keep wanting to have that kind of conversation. But if you can really honestly connect to the emotion, then it tends to quiet itself. But that's not analysis, it's just kind of looking in a silent awareness to see what's going on more carefully. So you allow yourself that moment to be aware of that and then go back to the prior? You can do it that way. If a person is new to meditation, then we mostly just teach them to go back to the breathing. And that's really helpful. But if a person knows about mindfulness practice and received the full instructions, then the basic idea is that we pay attention to whatever is most predominant in our experience. So if there's some strong sensation in the body, some strong emotion, or some strong thought that's going on, then we bring our silent, non-discursive, calm meditative awareness to pay attention to that event as long as it's there. Being very careful not to get caught up in our thoughts about it, but to stay there in that kind of spacious, non-discursive awareness of it. Yes? I just wanted to add something. And then over time, as you do that, what gets integrated in life is that when those events happen that might have an emotional component, you anchor again in the faulty sensations and have the distance that you've attained in meditation. That's what you've taught us, huh? But I thought that that's also an answer to what's next in a way, in addition to just, again, looking. Right. If something persists through time, sometimes it's the whole art to learning how to pay attention to mindfulness. It's not something you can... It's very simple to teach it, this kind of whole art to know how it works in our daily life and how it's useful to use it. But if something persists, like a strong feeling or strong thought persists, one of the most useful places to be aware of it is in the physical embodied experience of it. Most of us live in our world of our thoughts, and we kind of think that a world of our thoughts are really significant. And actually, the world of our thoughts actually keeps us fragmented and keeps us not completely whole. And so for most people, to balance who we are, it's useful to kind of go back into the felt sense of what's happening. What's the felt sense of being lost in a conversation? What's the felt sense of being filled with desire? What's the felt sense of being filled with doubt? And the felt sense is a bodily experience, as the woman nicely talked about, anchoring ourselves in the body. And that for some people creates a very important balance. And the body is not a story. The physical part is not a story. So in that you can feel the physical component part of any experience, then you're less likely to get swept up in the story part of what you're experiencing. And the story part has no bearing or importance for your meditation, for the point of view of your meditation practice. The story actually just gets in the way. So it's kind of a relief to know here in this particular sitting and meditating, you don't have to be involved in any story making. Isn't that great? I hope it's great. Unless you love your story so much. Yes? And going back to what you all were talking about there, if you actually have an aversion or anxiety or something, and you look at it and you realize, oh, this is an emotion, this is fear. Oftentimes when I'm sitting and I have a, I can name a feeling, a lot of times I want to feel it, to give it out. Rather than, not necessarily even having a story about it, but it's like, oh, there's fear. Oh, there's lots of fear there. And then it's like naming it is great, because then it's like I know what it is. But then I want to like fully allow it to surface so it comes up and then it's out. Otherwise I feel like I just sort of walk around with this idea of, oh, there's a lot of fear there, fear, fear, fear, fear there. And it just stays with me unless I discharge it. Oh, you mean, if, it has something useful to discharge or have catharsis at times, but in the practice of mindfulness, actively acting on these things in terms of giving them, but never trying to open to them and give them all the space to let them open and unfold as much as they want. So when you feel a little bit of fear begin to arise, the practice of mindfulness is to not have any resistance to that, but simply to see it clearly for what it is and kind of get out of the way. And then the fear, if it wants, has a chance to kind of walk them. Be petrified. You know, this is the same thing with anger. So it's a beautiful practice because you're allowed to really feel and give space to let the feelings really process themselves, really come up and really surface and be there fully. But we don't act on them. And the difference is that if when we act on stuff, if we act on anger, it's like beating. That is habit formations in the mind. So it becomes easier to be afraid or easy to become angry in the future. But if you can sit still with it and use your mindfulness and awareness to feel it and let it move through you and sit still with it and discover that ability to be still in the midst of that freedom of the emotion to be there, then you're more likely to get to the roots of it and it exhausts itself. It's a lot better to have your fear exhaust itself than it is to have it discharged for a while until the next charge comes up. Make some sense? So then let's end with a few minutes of sitting. So with some strength of resolve, some firmness of resolve, really try to stay present for the next five breaths. Don't let your mind waver at all from the next five breaths. And then continue being mindful of your breathing. Let yourself become calm and peaceful on the breath. But when your mind gets pulled off into something else, some distraction or some other preoccupation, notice if it's one of the hindrances.
