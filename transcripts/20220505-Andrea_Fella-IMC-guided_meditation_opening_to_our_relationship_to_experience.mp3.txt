 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. And arriving with yourself here in this moment. Standing perhaps in a simple way just recognizing that you're sitting in the room that you're in. One of Joseph's teachers, Monindra, said, sit and know that you're sitting and all of the Dharma will be revealed. That does mean sit and know you're sitting moment after moment after moment after moment after moment, but still it can be quite simple. Just arriving with yourself and perhaps checking in, seeing if there could be some relaxation, relaxation of body, maybe scanning through the body and seeing if there are places where there could be tension released. Maybe particularly relaxing the head, the face, around the eyes and the jaw, the neck and shoulders. Maybe the chest and upper back can soften and relax the arms, the hands. Maybe there can be some relaxation across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back, the hips, the legs, the feet. This exploration of relaxing the body is so helpful to support our ability to connect, to be with experience in the present moment. As we relax the body, it helps our mind to be able to also soften, relax a little bit. It helps our mind to let go a little bit of thoughts, worries, concerns. It supports the mind to relax a little bit. Maybe there can be a relaxation of mind. And beginning to connect with whatever relaxation is available here in this moment. Beginning to be curious about what is here, what is obvious in this moment. What are you able to know about your experience? Maybe it is simply sitting and knowing you're sitting. Or perhaps there's the recognition of the breathing happening. Or maybe a sense of the body, the whole body here, pressure, contact of your hips against the chair or cushion. Maybe other contact points of hands or feet. Often the body is one of the most obvious experiences available. We settle back, allow there to be some relaxation and just open to what's here, what's available, what does the mind know about this present moment. Sometimes it's something about the physical body, the sensations of experience. Sometimes it might be recognizing hearing. Or it could be a mood or an emotion, a thought. It feels natural, easeful, as easeful as possible to be aware of in this moment. Or feeling. with our experience in the present moment. Sometimes the attention naturally gravitates towards some particular aspect of experience and rests there, such as with the breathing. Or sometimes it feels more easeful and natural just to simply recognize what's most obvious in each moment where that may change from moment to moment. Maybe noticing body sensation for a little while and then sound and then a breath. An emotion and then another body sensation. That's also fine. With mindfulness, we're cultivating our capacity to meet our experience in this moment. And so what are you noticing? What's here? What's obvious for you? As we connect with experience and know what's happening in the present moment, every now and then it can be useful to check in about how you are in relationship to what is happening. And so there's what's happening, what you're aware of, the body, emotions, or breath or thought. And then there may be something else happening, maybe a little behind the scenes that isn't quite so clearly recognized. A relationship to experience. Maybe wanting something to happen or wanting something to stop happening. Those are two really common flavors that happen. It can also be that the mind feels pretty at ease. The relationship could be one of ease, calm, or okay, okayness. If you notice a kind of a leaning to or pulling away from experience, it's really useful to recognize that that's also happening. There's what's happening and I don't like it. Or there's what's happening and feels really good. I like this. Just to know that, to allow that also to be recognized as something that's happening right now. You don't have to look too hard. If you don't notice anything, that's okay. Just continue noticing whatever is obvious. Just noticing what is happening in your experience. Yeah, yeah. Relaxing the body and receiving experience. Just this moment. Thank you. Thank you.
