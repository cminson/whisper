Since this next few weeks, we'll be exploring some of the details in the Satipatanasuta. 
At least today, I'm not sure if every time I'll do this, but at least today I'm going to offer a little bit of a guided piece around the body because that's what we're going to be exploring today, mindfulness of the body. 
Becoming aware of bodily experience is an important part of our mindfulness practice. 
The experience of the body is one of the more obvious sets of sensations that's available for us to be aware of, and perhaps the Buddha started with this and has four foundations of mindfulness because it is so obvious. 
That's a place for us to begin to connect with our present moment experience. 
And yeah, it's not always easy to just sit down and say, okay, I'm going to connect with the body. 
It does seem to be helpful to find a way in, and this can be different for different people. 
What I often offer and does seem to be generally supportive is to begin with using an awareness of the body and an awareness of relaxing in the body as a place to start to connect with mindfulness. 
And so we'll do this to begin just for a few moments, connecting with whatever sensations are available, obviously available in your head and face. 
If there is tension as a part of that that's kind of available and known, you could explore a conscious relaxation of the head and face, a softening of those muscles. 
Sometimes it may not even feel much like there's tension, but there can be a softening of the body just through kind of connecting with can the face and head soften, almost like asking the body, is there a softening that's available? Is there a relaxing that's available? Seeing if there can be a softening of the neck and shoulders, connecting to the experience of the arms and hands and seeing if that can soften those muscles, that experience can be relaxed. 
Becoming aware of sensations in the torso, whatever is obvious in that area, in the area of the torso, the chest, the upper back around the rib cage, maybe that area can soften and relax. 
Being in to the lower torso across the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back, what sensations are there? And can there be a softening, a relaxing of that area? And connecting to the sensations in the hips, sometimes even it might be available to kind of experience or know what's happening inside the hip socket. 
And can there be a relaxation in the hips and in the hip socket? And bringing awareness to the legs and feet? And just noticing what's there? And can there be a relaxation of the muscles of the legs and the feet? And then perhaps a tuning more deeply inside the body, this area too, sometimes even more directly connected to the mind in a way, the visceral area, the internal experience, letting your attention just take in the inside of the throat and maybe the inside of the throat can relax. 
Connecting to the area of the heart, what sensations are there? Maybe there can be a softening around the heart. 
Even the stomach and the intestines, maybe that can soften and relax. 
And the stomach relax, the intestines relax. 
This isn't something we can consciously do, but it's more of a kind of an invitation and allowing that may show a way to soften and relax this kind of inner landscape of our physical experience. 
Satipa Tanasuta talks about several ways to connect with the physical experience of the body. 
One is just the general sensation level in the body. 
Maybe just taking in broadly this body sitting here in a way it's expressed as knowing there is a body, maybe the broadest experience of the body. 
There is a body. 
And then what sensations kind of speak? Let us know the body is here. 
This communication between body and mind, this permeable kind of flow our body receives experience and lets our mind know about it. 
Sometimes that might be one of the obvious experiences of contact points, the hips against the chair, the cushion against the couch, the pressure there. 
Maybe the contact points of hands or experience of hands and feet. 
Again, perhaps pressure or maybe a subtler experience particularly in the hands of tingling or vibration or pulsing. 
Maybe a broad sensation of warmth or coolness. 
What is this body sitting here in a way kind of like there is a body, how does this body let you know it's here? Don't think about it. 
More of a receptive curiosity. 
This direct sensation level of experience is kind of a foundation for us of awareness of our bodily experience. 
The heat, the coolness, vibration, tingling, hardness, softness, moisture even a very elemental level. 
These are the building blocks of sensation. 
You could say the kind of language of the body, the language of how the body communicates with the awareness. 
And then a little closer in perhaps, a little more focused might be attending to the experience of breathing in the body. 
Another pointing in the Satipatana Sutta. 
Starting with a kind of exploration. 
Mindfully breathing in and out. 
Aware. 
Breathing in. 
Knowing that you're breathing in. 
Breathing out. 
Knowing that you're breathing out. 
This awareness of breathing in and breathing out can be extremely simple. 
Just that knowing. 
Yes, I know I'm breathing in. 
Know that I'm breathing out. 
Can be helpful again to have a relaxed and kind of curious receptive stance around the breath. 
Not like trying to focus on it, but more in and in breath. 
What? What is showing up? What is being received? What's obvious about breathing in? The knowing of it. 
This curiosity to let the body and mind show you how a breath happens. 
You don't have to focus or find particular sensations. 
Just aware and in breath. 
Now breath. 
For some of you, that experience may be fairly broad in the sense of a more general experience. 
The body is breathing. 
For some of you, it may be a little more close in the sensations at the nostrils or the movement of the rib cage. 
The rising and falling of the rib cage. 
What's the most easy and relaxed way to be aware of the breathing? Perhaps exploring. 
Can it be comfortable to breathe? If it's not comfortable to breathe, that's okay. 
Just aware this breath as it is. 
What's the most relaxing way to be aware of the breathing? At some point, the mind will wonder, you'll notice that the mindfulness is returning. 
In that moment, there's no need to yank the mind back or jump back to what you were paying attention to before the mind wandered. 
Instead, it can be useful to open up to this moment in the body. 
How is the body now? Perhaps if it seems useful, connecting to relaxing the body, maybe even briefly. 
And then again, receiving, attuning to the field of bodily sensations and receiving what's obvious. 
That may be general body sensation. 
And for some of you, it may naturally gravitate towards awareness of the breath. 
Continuing. 
To be present with the body. 
Being with this body that accompanies us everywhere at every moment. 
Honoring the body with our attention and curiosity.
