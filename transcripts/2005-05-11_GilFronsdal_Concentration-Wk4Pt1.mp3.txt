 Fourth, right? The concentration class. I'd like us to begin with a short sitting. We sit together for ten minutes and I'm not going to give any guided meditation, just sit in silence and use the silent ten minutes as a time to prepare yourself, to get yourself here intentionally with a sense of purpose, a sense of being conscientious and being mindful. You can use those ten minutes to arrive and really be here, this place, this time. Take care of whatever distractions you might have or whatever else might be going on. And use the ten minutes to work, massage yourself, find yourself settled here in this place the best you can. Get yourself settled and concentrated. Welcome back to our fourth day, concentration class. A very important aspect of concentration is having a non-distracted mind. A non-distracted mind is one that then can be focused. Most people, most of the time, will find that their mind is distracted, distractible, in a distracted state. Pretty much anybody who sits down to meditate will discover that. There's all these kind of centrifugal forces in the mind that scatter outwards, restless, agitated. The business of the day continues the business of the mind. The mind is tired or sleepy. There's all these forces in the mind that keep the mind from being settled or being focused, keeps it kind of easily to get distracted. When a person wants to develop samadhi or concentration, they have to work with that distractibility of the mind. And there are two primary ways of doing that. One is to let go of the distractibility of the mind. Let go of, certainly all the thoughts you have, let go of them. But more deeply, letting go of the structure underneath it, let go of the impulses underneath the thoughts, the impulse to think or the impulse to be distracted. Let go. For some people that works really well. They can let go really well. And as you let go, the mind gets less and less distractible and more and more stable. The other way is to use our intentionality, to use our capacity to be directed in the mind, direct the mind, focus the mind intentionally on something like the breath, some object, and really kind of stay there. And then there's a tension in the mind between the force that wants to kind of spin you out into thoughts and that force which you're applying to keep you steady. And so there's a tug and war between the two of them. And as you develop your strength of concentration, then with time, the ability to be focused, intentional, intentionally focused becomes greater than the force of distractibility. And there's a play back and forth. So that sometimes, if the mind is in a very distractible state, it might be that no matter how intentional and how strong your concentration is, you can't overcome the strength of distractibility. Other times, distractibility of the mind is really, really low. And so you don't need a lot of concentration, a lot of effort, a lot of intentionality to get yourself focused. So two general ways. One is to let go and one is to kind of hold the mind steady on something. So be very intentional. With time, as the concentration gets stronger, becomes more natural or becomes more second nature or gets established, the intentional aspect of concentration falls away. And so we don't have to direct our effort anymore to stay there. But as the mind becomes less and less distractible, it becomes more and more naturally easy to stay present and just be there. And eventually, the intentionality disappears entirely. The directness directing the mind, we stop directing the mind, they're just there. But until that point arrives, these two qualities are important, letting go and being intentional. I think when you first sit down to develop concentration practice, it's very important to sit down in a very intentional way. Be very clear, maybe by talking to yourself and saying it to yourself, here I am, this is what I'm doing. I'm here to get concentrated, I'm here to sit, I'm not here to think about what happened at work or what's happening on television or something, I'm sitting here. This is where I'm going to be. And to have that intentional quality of sitting, maybe in your posture, have a feel it in your body, here I am, this is where I am, but I feel a solidity of your body here, the weight of it, just feel it, here I am. And then whatever else you can do to kind of intentionally gather yourself together, to gather yourself, gather your being here in this place, in this time is useful. Some people will find it useful to do some kind of preliminary work before sitting to meditate. I've talked about this, maybe sitting and just taking it easy, having a cup of tea for 10 minutes, and that gets you in the mood, so it can help you really be here. Or maybe going for a run, you're taking a shower. As I said, maybe the first day, one of the supports for developing concentration is having a clean environment and having clean clothes. So you can be that intentional, you can actually go and take a shower, put on clean clothes, new clothes, it's kind of expensive for new clothes every day. But you don't put on new clean clothes. And if your room is a mess, tidy it up a little bit before you sit, and then do your sitting. So there's order and stability around you and cleanliness and kind of gives you a good feeling about being here. And also it creates a sense of intentionality, this is what I'm doing. And then there's a number of other things you can do. And one of the things, for example, is chanting, or reciting, or saying it over in your mind, if you have something like the metasuta, if you memorized it. And that somehow exercises the mind, gets it kind of moving in a directed way, a focused way. And it gets the mind kind of geared up into being focused, so that once you end the chant you're doing or the reciting you're doing, your mind is more likely to be present. And some of the distractions have kind of faded away or lost their interest in them. Some people find it very helpful to connect to something that's inspiring about their spiritual life before they sit down to meditate. So in order to kind of sort of mind, the psyche can kind of get a little bit straightened out in terms of its priorities. So if you sit, you know, maybe read a Dharma book, for example, some book by a Dharma teacher, and it can just be reading a paragraph or a page, you say, oh yeah, that's what it's about. That's, this is really important. All that concern I had about how my stocks are doing, that's incidental. That's, you know, that's not really that important. What's important is the spiritual life of mind. That's what I can take with me when the stock market crashes. So let's kind of work on what I can, you know, and so somehow or other, I don't know how it is for each of you, but somehow inspire the mind with faith, with confidence, with a sense of, you know, this is really a wonderful, important thing to do. And it's more important than thinking about what I'm going to have for dinner or, you know, all kinds of other things that the mind might want to do. So all this is kind of getting yourself in the mood, getting yourself kind of ready, prepared, and doing it intentionally. Just sit down, just kind of walk off the street, you know, and come home and slam the door and sit down and, okay, I'm gonna get concentrated. Maybe you can, and I'm sure it's helpful, I'm sure it's a nice thing to do, I'm not gonna tell you not to do that. But it's probably better off if you have kind of a sense of intentionality and respect and care and what you're doing, and you set yourself up to do it in a nice way. Some of you might be interested in doing it much more elaborate and involved. Some of you might, you know, might be too much and you don't like all that kind of stuff. Some people do it very ritualistically, kind of almost like a ritual every day. And the repetition of a ritual also is very helpful to getting the mind geared up and ready to do something. There are some times when the mind is distracted, and there's nothing you can do to get concentrated. You might have some major argument with a good friend, and maybe you're able to get a good concentration for, you know, for some time. And then after this big argument, you find it might take weeks and weeks before you can get yourself concentrated again, because somehow that's reverberating in your mind before you get settled and processed. So there are things that can happen as you go along that might make it difficult. And you have to kind of work with patience without and with grace without as it happens. I heard an interesting thing this week. In my son's school, there's a young girl who has dyslexia. How do you pronounce it? I must be happy with myself, because I always confuse the words of that word, dyslexia. And so she's having a really hard time learning how to read. So she was sent, she went, my mother took her for a week at a special week long workshop for children with dyslexia to help teach them to read. And the person who's figured out this workshop figured out that people with dyslexia tend to their minds works differently than people who don't have it. And they tend to be much more visually oriented, and spatially oriented than people who, you know, can read much more with greater ease, kind of linearly. And so they do things like create sculptures of all the letters. So they have a visual image, three dimensional image of the letter. And they have, and there's some words like 281 words in English language apparently, which don't have easy images associated with them. So the kids make these sculptures of those words, so they have an image associated with it. So when you see that word, they see an image so that it helps them to read. But the most interesting thing in terms of the concentration was the teacher, if I have it explained to the kids something like this, imagine that you're looking at a slice of pizza. And then move around and look at the pizza from the backside and the crust side. And then move your mind around, it's all in the mind, imagine yourself looking at this one side, and then imagine you're looking at it from the point side, looking at the point, and move around and look at it. And apparently kids with dyslexia have a pretty good ability to use their visual mind like that and kind of move around in the mental space, they're kind of looking at different angles at what's going on. And then the teacher said, okay, so then imagine that you go behind the pizza crust, you look at that by the wide side of the wedge, and it's behind your head, and you're kind of there behind your head. And the point of the pizza is going straight ahead. And imagine that you're there and you're kind of following that point and looking straight ahead into what you're focusing on. And the mother who was with the daughter the whole time said it was really amazing to watch my daughter learn this skill. I couldn't make any sense of it myself, but my daughter, you could see her now, she kind of gets into this little mode and she gets kind of focused in a way she'd never seen her focus before. This image and this idea of kind of being behind her head a little bit and looking down at something would help her to be concentrated. So I say that because everyone, each of us has our own particular unique mind, how it works, and sometimes having some sense of how to work our mind can be helpful. Some people I know have used visualizations to get them self concentrated. So because of kind of a visualization image is kind of really captivating for the mind, it's really interesting for some people. I know one person who used the image of herself as a soaring eagle, and she's imagining herself kind of soaring. And somehow that image of her soaring kind of helped her kind of really be present in the moment and get concentrated. There's a variety of things you might use as an image. I know one person, another person who had the idea, also a bird image, where she imagined she was a hawk, high, high, high up in the sky. And the hawks had this great vision. So she imagined they had this great vision, she's kind of just see what's right was there. I like the imagery sometimes of the ocean waves washing back and forth across the beach. And so imagine the breath is like the ocean washing across the beach, you know, the in breath and the out breath. Somehow that image kind of gets me connected to the breath. And generally, when people do mindfulness practice, it's not a good idea to do visualization like that. It's a very different process. But for developing concentration, visualization can be quite helpful. And so if there's a simple thing that you can do, then you can do the visualization as a way of getting started. And once you feel yourself getting started in your present and calm down, then maybe you can let go of the visualization and then focus on the breath, whatever the object is. So, you know, it's a part of this, when I say play with the mind, experiment. Experiment with the mind in different ways and see if there's ways in which you can begin working the mind in different ways in the normal mind is used. And maybe that's helpful to get concentrated. It's almost like, you know, from a kind of physiological point of view, concentration practice is kind of working our brainwaves in a biochemistry in different ways, and readjusting and changing it, settling it. And so, you know, we're kind of learning how all the different kind of buttons in the mind work and the brain work. We're learning, you know, the different factors and how to play them. And the mind and the brain is three dimensional. And I would suggest, I don't know if it's true, but I said most people work kind of like on a two dimensional model of their mind. And so to begin kind of getting a three dimensional quality of the mind, and begin kind of playing, oh, how would we like to focus on the breath from that part of the mind, or from that part of the body, or from this angle, or like this, you know, kind of find out what it takes, what works for you to get concentrated. So there's this intentional quality that's necessary. And some people need to develop strength and intentionality to be able to hang in their resolve. And if you resolved and you had developed a capacity to resolve this is what I'm doing. I'm doing this and following my breath. When I was in Burma, it was observed that when the Burmese teacher told the Burmese to follow the breath, they did. You know, it's a patriarchal culture. And if the patriarch of the family tells you what to do, you do it. And so he's the model of the Buddhist teacher in Burma is that the Buddhist teacher is the is the kind of the father figure, the father tells you what you do, follow your breath, you do it. Westerners, Americans, when they came to Burma, and had this father figure tell them to follow your breath. Well, there was a lot of confusion about that. And, you know, all these issues about their father and their mother, and, you know, and, you know, and autonomy and, you know, independent. And, you know, it was not so easy, because, you know, just to follow the breath. But, you know, often it was, you know, it seemed very easy for the many of the Burmese to follow their breath compared to the Westerners who struggled for months sometimes. So this capacity to kind of just settle down, be resolved, and here I am, this is what I'm doing, is very important. So it'll be very nice this evening, if someone would recite the metasuta. You're supposed to have memorized it, memorizing it. Anybody would like to do it. Thank you. Do you mind doing it with the mic? It's workable for you. To reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good should be capable and upright. Straightforward and easy to speak to, gentle and not proud, contented and easily supported, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calmed, not arrogant and without greed for supporters and should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize. One should reflect, may all be happy and secure, may all beings be happy at heart, all living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, born or to be born, may they all be happy, let no one despise another or despise anyone anywhere, let no one through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer as a mother would risk her own life to protect her child, her only child. So toward all beings should we cultivate a boundless heart with loving kindness for the whole world should we cultivate a boundless heart, above, below and all around, without obstruction, without hate and without ill will, standing or walking, sitting or lying down, whenever we are awake may we stay with this recollection. This is called a sublime abiding here and now, one who is virtuous, endowed with vision, not taken by views and having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure will not be reborn again. Thank you very much. So what I'd like us to do now is in a moment is for everyone to recite it together the best you can and then we'll do another sitting. But if you'd like to stretch a little bit, just for 30 seconds or so, you're welcome to stand and do that. So let's all do it together. To reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good should be capable and upright, straightforward and easy to speak to, gentle and not proud, contented and supported, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calm, not arrogant. All living needs, whether the reach of a stone, to the palm of a brush to the inner, or short, hiding or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, or on or to be born, may they all be happy. I'd like no one to see another, or to apologize if anyone would be there, but I can no one to my hand or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. I'd like no one to see another, or to my heart. You just look it off. Then be gentle, at ease, with yourself. intentional posture for meditation. The intentional side of meditation does not need to be forced or hard. Be at ease with yourself. But then carefully, conscientiously, gather yourself together in your body and mind here. We want our body and mind to be together in the same place at the same time. If you're thinking about yesterday or tomorrow, then your mind is in a different time and place than your body, which is here. So bringing your mind here, you might even start thinking about here, thinking about your body, feeling it, exploring it, letting your mind suffuse your body with awareness. It helps you arrive here and be settled. It can be helpful to think about the preciousness of human life, of the lived life of being alive now. Right now, your lived experience is important, is precious. The image which I use sometimes is the image of love. Lowering myself into a refreshing pool of water. Lowering the body into it. In the same way, can you imagine your awareness, your self, your being, lowering itself into the body? So you become more embodied more here, like you're lowering yourself into a refreshing pool of water. Letting the awareness settle through the body. If you feel any tension anywhere, as you exhale, maybe you can imagine it dissolving, as you let go or soften with it. Dissolving in the water. Take a few moments to see if you can find a good feeling in your body, in your being. Something that feels nice or comfortable. Feeling contentment or ease, pleasure. Or if it's easy, you can evoke a sense of contentment or ease. Maybe even delight, peaceful delight for being here in this body this time. And then in tuning into the breath and making a choice, an intentional choice now to direct the attention on the breath, you might begin by taking a few deeper breaths than usual so that there's an intentional quality to breathing that helps the intentionality of your awareness. Connecting the breath with the awareness. Feeling the breath more fully. More sensations of the breath by breathing more deeply. Feeling the breath more deeply so the mind more easily begins to turn itself to focus on the breath, to be familiar with it. And then slowly let the breath return to normal. Feeling the breath. And then notice if you can adjust your breathing within the normal range of breath, the natural range. So the breath is more comfortable, more enjoyable, more contentment as you breathe. Relaxing as you breathe out perhaps. So you breathe out more fully. Breathing in a teeny bit more fully. Maybe it's breathing into the rib cage or letting the diaphragm be more relaxed to the belly softer. Or maybe it's enjoying that very brief pause between breathing out and breathing in. And it's not always possible, but when possible, see if you can tune into something which is pleasant or enjoyable about the breathing, the sensations of breathing. Whether it's the whole breath body expanding and contracting or a particular spot, a particular phase in the cycle. And then make a resolve, be resolved, even stay with the breath, one breath after the other. Letting go of whatever interferes with that. Applying a little bit of strength to hang in there with each breath. And if it helps you can count. Stay there with the breath. So the breath becomes the center of your universe. The most important thing going on right now is just breathing, breathing in an enjoyable way. There's no need to judge how well you're doing. Whatever energy or effort you have in judging what's going on, use that energy instead for staying with the breath or focusing. Letting yourself sink into the breath. And it's sometimes instructed to make a very small little smile in the corner of your mouth. And as you smile, if it arises or happens to be feelings of pleasure or well-being, it arises because of that. See if there's some way that pleasure or good feeling comes from smiling, can encourage you to stay with the breath. And that in turn staying with the breath kind of helps that good feeling to grow or spread. Sometimes having a sense of stillness around you or the stillness around the breathing can help you, help a person stay. And with the breath more easily, it will help the mind become stiller in its focus. If there's any tendency to think about how poorly it's going, don't bother with that. And if instead it might be more useful to focus on how it is working. Focus on the softness, stillness, breathing in, breathing out. Perhaps you can imagine that the awareness is like a hand that's placed on the sensations of breathing. And you're not going to let the hand pull away to the kind of... So throughout the whole cycle of breathing, breathing in and out, in between, beginning of the in-breath, the end of the out-breath, the awareness just rests there, stays there, in touch with the breathing. And then in the last minute of the sitting, let go of the breath. And then review the sitting, take a minute or so to review what it was like for you. Review the quality of your effort, what happened. Now that you review it, could you imagine that you could have been a little bit more resolved or intentional? Could you let go of things faster or more willingly? Okay. Okay. So the more stress we have, the more tension we carry with us, the more likely it is for the mind to spin out in thoughts, to be preoccupied with thoughts and concerns. The more calm we are, the more settled and relaxed we are, the more likely it is to be able to actually stay present because there's not going to be so much fuel for having the mind wander off and spin around. So an important part of getting concentrated is to get calm. You can get too calm, so you have to be watched for that, so you keep a good effort and energy going at the same time. The process of getting concentrated is described sometimes as a process of unification, bringing all the different aspects of the body, mind and harmony working together. As that begins to happen, and as the hindrances that we talked about last week, no longer are grabbing us, different thoughts don't grab us, we're not compelled or seduced into going off into different thoughts and concerns. And we can just stay there, and mind can stay there on the breath without being distracted. Then it's said that we've arrived at a stage called access concentration, or sometimes called neighborhood concentration, which is the access point or the threshold for going into a whole other realm of consciousness, a whole other dimension of meditation. And as a person gets into this access concentration, and there's very little tendency to be distracted anymore, the hindrances are put to rest, you're not so easy to pull the side. Then the practice continues is to be focused, focus oneself one pointedly as best you can on whatever the object of attention is, be one pointed on the breath, for example. And this point generally tends to be good to choose a very small area of the breath, it's a really precise focus at this point. It doesn't have to be, but I think that's often the best with the breath. And then, just stay there, and some teachers will encourage meditators to spend a lot of time in access concentration, don't be in a hurry to go deeper. There are these deeper states. But there's one approach to developing meditation is to develop deeper states of meditation slowly. So you get familiar with each of the different levels you can go in, and so you get stabilized in it, and you get integrated in it, and you get to develop it to a fuller capacity. It's possible to go quickly through different stages of meditation, it's rewarding to go deeper, but it's not so stable each time you go. And a lot of the benefits and integration of our psychophysical being that can happen, doesn't really happen if we go through deeper and deeper very fast. So some teachers will say it's really good when you get to access concentration, we won't give you any more instructions on how to go further. Let's just kind of get you to go and stay there longer. That was great, you were able to stay there for five minutes or one minute, that was great. Now let's see if we can do ten minutes or fifteen minutes. Can you really kind of stretch how long you stay there? And can you begin exploring a little bit of terrain and what's going on in access concentration? What are some of the different factors, the different physical, mental factors that come into play? In particular, teachers are like to kind of keep a person in access concentration for some time. There is some investigation that can happen there. And sometimes the person is encouraged to investigate or notice the presence of five different mental factors. There's a lot of different mental factors that can come into play, but there's five which are really helpful for the process of going deeper. And the first one is the initial, what's called, in maybe an awkward way, the initial application of mind. The initial kind of bringing the mind to focus on the breath, the focus, the beginning, the first intention and placing the mind there. The second is what's called the sustained application of mind, or the direction of mind. That's where you sustain the attention on the object. We talked a little bit about that last week. The polishing the bowl, you put the cloth on the bowl, that's the initial effort. And then the sustained effort is to then rub the bowl. So you should be noticing a little bit that ability of the mind to do that. It's not always easy to do that. I've had some trouble with this particular one, but even though I'm doing it, I know I'm doing it, it seems obvious I'm doing it, but a little bit, it's kind of strange in that access state, actually for me to kind of identify it. Other people have an easy time. Sometimes it's easier to, well, that's the whole story. So there's two factors, the initial and the sustained application of attention. The next one is to notice joy. And joy can be very subtle, and it can be really powerful. But you start noticing the presence of joy or delight, or sometimes they call it rapture. I like the word joy. That's the third one. And then the fourth one is to notice the presence of happiness. And the difference between joy and happiness is that joy is a little more energetic than happiness. Happiness tends to be much more settled and peaceful feeling than joy. The image that's given is, if someone is in the desert really thirsty and they see a pond of drinking water in the distance,
