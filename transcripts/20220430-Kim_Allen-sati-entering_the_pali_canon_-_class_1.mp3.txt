Okay. Good afternoon. Hello. It's wonderful to see you. I recognize some of you and some of
you are new. So warm welcome. Really warm welcome. First, I'll say that I'm Diana Clark. You can
tell by my little name here in my little square box. And what a pleasure it is to be teaching
with my good friends, David, Kim and Ying. Before we opened it up to you guys, we were talking like,
wow, how great it is that we get to teach together. We've, I don't know, we've taught quite a few
courses and classes together. So what a pleasure it is to be teaching with my good friends.
And maybe I'll pass it on to, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to pass it on to David or Ying now,
I don't remember for them to say good morning. Maybe. Oh, there we go, Ying.
Well, I just extend my warm welcome. It's just, it's such a delightful thing to
kind of explore Polly Cannon together. I'm still amazed that when I began this journey,
I felt like a lot of this all by myself. And just today, and seeing all of you and just having
so much joy in my heart that we get to explore this together. And the four of us have been having
so much fun with it and keep discovering new things together. So, yeah, so let this unfold in
this next two classes. Yeah, and I would just add, you know, an additional warm welcome and echo.
I think this already you can sort of hopefully sense this sense of
camaraderie or companionship in the practice. We, the four of us have found exploration of
texts from the Polly Cannon to be a really wonderful part of the practice and the sharing of it
is just, I think, makes it additionally wonderful. And in the spirit of that,
I would just want to make sure we extend a warm welcome to people for whom this is the first time
to participate in one of these classes. Sometimes we see familiar faces, but I really appreciate
just that people come to join, join in this conversation with us. And sometimes that takes,
you know, a leap of faith or some time on a Saturday morning or just kind of a
leaning into it. And that's that's a wonderful thing to just celebrate that, you know,
leaning into something that's different, that's new, that may seem a little bit daunting, you
know, ancient texts from this mysterious Polly Cannon. So yeah, welcome, welcome.
Okay, well, I can only echo what all of my friends have said and just offer my welcome also.
And then I always get the fun task or often get the fun task of doing an overview, a little bit of
the registration forms that came in, we do actually read all those things that you say. And so
I wanted to mention that we have people here from four different countries and 21 US states.
So at least that was the registration. So there's a broad mix of people. And then as far as what
people wrote in their interests for taking the course, we had an also a wide range. Some people
want to get closer to the teachings of the historical Buddha. And, you know, there's a sense of wanting
to go to the source. And there could be various reasons for that. Some people are intellectually
interested, some are emotionally attracted. Some see it as a support for their spiritual path.
All of those are welcome and respected. And then some people expressed a wish to be able to navigate
the texts on their own. You know, we hear teachers all the time quoting from the Pali canon, or we
read modern dharma books that have things about it. And we think, I'd like to read that for myself
and really see. And of course, we're reading in English, not the original Pali, but, you know,
we have really excellent translations available. And it is totally accessible now for us to go to
the source ourselves. One person said specifically that going to the suttas themselves would be
preferable to picking up this and that teaching from various teachers. So I think as teachers,
we can all relate to how we sometimes sound like this and that teaching is what we offer in our
dharma talks. So yes, please do, please do check out what we're saying. And some people, as David
mentioned, said that they thought the Pali canon was a little daunting, because it's a bunch of
big books. I remember someone asked me once, can you help me understand these big books? And the
way they said it was clear that the bigness was a little challenging. So yeah, it's nice just to
have a there is a structure and an organization to them. And we'll go through that to make it a
little bit clearer. And then some people saw a textual study as part of their path, which we very
much encourage seeing them that way. There are a lot of different ways to read the text, you can
read them screen and only a scholarly sense or looking for historical clues about how culture
was at the time, many different ways. But one of the ways and the one that we emphasize is that
you can read these texts as part of the spiritual path. How can we engage these ancient teachings
on our modern for our modern spiritual development? How can that be done? So we'll talk about that
a bit also. And then for I've saved for last some of my favorite ones, which are people would just
write love of Dharma on there. So it's like, if it's involved with the Dharma, I want to be there.
That's great. So it's a nice mix. Our hope is to touch into the Pali canon from a variety of angles.
There will be some straight intellectual information that's helpful, and we hope there will be some
emotional or devotional components. We're going to play a chance later today. For example,
that's often how these texts have been carried through the centuries. There's going to be some
pragmatic instructions for how to find these these teachings within the Pali canon, how to find a
particular Suta. And there will be a chance for you to discuss with each other your own views and
how they're how you think this relates to your particular practice. So I hope that for everyone,
there will be maybe something familiar and something novel. And maybe we can each try to
find something like that for each of us. And so maybe you'll try out several of these different
ways that we're going to talk about the Pali canon and we'll find something new that works well.
All right, so I'll pass it on to you to give a bit more of an overview of the course.
Yeah, thank you, Kim. And thank you, Diana and David for opening us up. And what I want to do maybe
is to say a few words about the aims of those two classes that we'll be having over the two
weekends, two Saturday mornings. And I first just want to say we called this class Entering the World
of Pali Canon. It is really a world and a world of its own. So I invite maybe having an orientation
as if you're entering into a whole new world. Some of you might have already been there for a while,
but maybe bring some freshness in terms of engaging in this world. The world has a different language.
And even after this gets translated into English, we know there are different translations.
And the world has its own culture. I think one of the things as we enter into this world
will discover through reading and listening to the text, we also get a sense of how people lived
2000s of the centuries ago and how they are receiving the teachings. And the teachings
that passed on came from our oral tradition. And this may have evoked a certain ways of orientation
relating to the teachings that may be quite different from how we are reading it today.
I'm kind of reading books. And so kind of there are all those different dimensions that come along.
And for me, I often relate to this from my own limited experience. I remember realizing
I'm not a native speaker, an English speaker. At some point, I'll notice often how little
emotional association I have with some of the words that are being said in English.
And they all feel pretty flat. And then I look at the people around me, they seem to have just a
huge emotional sense with it. But over time, I began to develop a certain kind of emotional
cognizance with the language. And this may be true with the Pali Canon, even with the translations.
They may feel flat, awkward, and kind of strange. But as we open ourselves up to it,
over time, we may begin to really feel and sense how these teachings are alive in people's lives.
And so it's inviting you to really kind of go into this world as you're a new explorer into a new
culture, a new place altogether. And so then there's the two classes. We are going to cover
some of the major aspects of this, the structure of the Pali Canon text, and the origin, origination,
and the history of this collection. So you realize the Pali Canon is evolving over time.
And we'll also share some, in the second class, we'll share some practical tools for navigating
this text. This is really good news because I remember when we started some decades ago,
there weren't no tools. So it's quite fascinating that we have so many tools available nowadays.
And so we'll share some of this and to help us navigating the text. We'll also offer some
introductory words about the Pali language. And the language is a big part of the culture.
And let's see what else I want to say here. And
oh, the last but not the least is to encourage, through this course, encourage
exploration of how we relate to this text. I think that as I was looking at the notes that we had,
what we might say, we said that we are the Dharma teachers presenting this as a relevant
practicing path, practicing the path. And there is a role for studying and learning and getting to
know certain knowledges. It's presented in the text. And yet it's more important for us to find
ways through learning and studying the text that enrich our practice and that allows our heart and
mind to become more and more free. And so that's our wish through this is studying and practicing
series, including this exploration that will unfold in the next two classes. So with that,
I'm going to pass it down to David. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Nice, nice brief orientation
to the class. So we'd like to begin or continue with a breakout group. And just because we,
I think we want to emphasize a little bit the beauty, not the importance or the utility so much
of doing this, doing this practice together in community, but just the loveliness of it
as we found it. And we thought it would be good to connect people sort of at the beginning.
And so we're just going to give sort of two kind of overarching questions for breakout room discussion
about maybe 10 or 12 minutes in kind of conversation. And those questions are what is your inspiration
for taking the class just sharing sort of what what brings you to a class on this rather obscure
topic on a Saturday morning. And whether you have any sort of burning question, you know,
something that really some some specific interest that motivates, you know, your interest in the
class. And I think everybody here is probably pretty familiar with breakout room discussion.
We would just emphasize sort of again, the sort of what can be learned from one another. So
making it this an excerpt and exercise in listening and wise, wise speech,
and and learning from one another about what motivations and tensions the things that bring
us to to practice and to this particular class. And we will suggest maybe going around in a
circle and just dropping in one thing at a time, no reason to say everything on, you know, on these
two questions with each response, but just kind of dropping things in as you go around a circle
about three or four people in each group. And maybe, maybe sometimes things start slowly,
we can suggest just beginning with the first, you know, alphabetical order, the traditional
alphabetical order of that comes up in with the first name of people or the first identifying
letter of people's screen names. So with that, enjoy one another's company. And yeah,
what is your inspiration for coming here today and sort of any any burning questions, anything
that's really a something you want to know at the end of the class. Okay, we'll check back in with
you in 10 to 12 minutes. I like it when people come back with smiles, just because
causes me to smile too. Nice to see. So why don't we just debrief briefly. We would love it's very
useful for us to get a sense of what what interests, what motivations bring you to this class that
helps us sort of meet them to the extent we can. And so yeah, what what came up in your groups that
would be, you know, would be wonderful to share. Franziska. Hi. Hey, I'm here for the second time
to get deeper on the understanding of the structure and the places and the different,
especially the different translations available. And the meaning that is different because this
word was used here, but the other translator is the other word and how that can benefit us
from reading more than one instead of only one. So that that was the the last part of our group
where we discussed that most. Thank you for mentioning that, Franziska. That's not so
at so important, actually, that one of the things that this kind of study and bringing this kind
of study into practice allows us to do is craft our own vocabulary of practice, kind of develop a
language of practice that supports our practice. And, you know, some of that can be the poly some
of that can be different English or other, you know, language renderings of the poly. So yeah,
thanks for that for bringing that in. I think that's that's going to be something we'll continue
to explore together. Other other reflections from the group, other things that come up that
people would like to share anything else bring people to the class. That would be good to know.
Hi, Stuart and Mariela. Hi. Hello. Good to see you. One of my main motivations was to be to feel
part of the Sanger, which, you know, sit with Gil every weekday. And it's great, the connection
with people. But being here live with a different group of people, and then the breakout room
meeting someone that I feel I've known for years for the first time. And the whole thing was really,
really nice. You get a real appreciation of Sanger. Yeah, great. Thanks. Thank you for saying that.
It is a wonderful community practice. Your mention of Gil is useful too, because many
people here have some, maybe quite a lot of, you know, knowledge of Gil and his teachings. And
Gil does this. He draws on these texts. He makes reference to these languages, and he makes reference
as Francisca pointed out, is so important to, you know, varying translations and ways to render them.
Gil as a translator has translated many of these things differently over his career as a translator,
over his, you know, translating history. So anyway, I think that's a nice note. We all, many of us,
anyway, have shared that, you know, some inspiration that comes from Gil's approach to these very same
texts. So, Aaron. Yes, something that came up, that actually came up from myself,
is the, how do I know what the Buddha said in the Pali Canon, because, you know, after he passed away,
then, you know, somebody else took over. And of course, we didn't, nothing was written down
to, what, 400 years later in Sri Lanka? So we've got a lot of things out there that, you know,
maybe from his disciples. But I'd kind of like to know if there's a way to know more, maybe it's
not possible, about how I can recognize actually what the Buddha was teaching. Yeah. Thanks for
introducing that. I wouldn't be surprised if many people have that question. We didn't actually kind
of say that as one of the, you know, things that comes in. But I think we all share this question,
you know, how much of what we read, can we, can we really attribute to the Buddha? And Diana's
going to answer that question in the very last minutes of next Saturday. So stay tuned. No,
I'm kidding. There is no, there's no answer to that question that we can know for sure. And you'll
notice that careful scholars and practitioners and teachers, Gil and ourselves among them will
frequently say things when we're being careful, like the Buddha is quoted in this text as saying,
and this is a way of acknowledging that, you know, we don't know if this is ever made a quote
from the Buddha and that that can't be known. But we'll continue to explore that. But I'm glad
you brought that in, because I think that, you know, that'll be something that we'll continue
to address as we go forward. Maybe I could just add something to that. Yeah, yeah. Go for it.
In that the great thing about these Buddhist texts is they continually point us toward
verification in our own experience. So in a sense, we don't know that the Buddha exactly that person
said these things, but the texts are pointing toward a result of less suffering. And so we can
always check for ourselves, you know, does putting this into practice have that impact on my mind.
And in a sense, that might be good enough. Yeah, thanks, Kim. And, you know, I don't know why I
was answering all the questions or coming up with things. Diana Ying, you have things to offer for
any of these comments so far? My apologies. Did you shake your heads? And now I don't know whether
not it or shaking. Okay, jump in if you want to, please. Yeah, thanks, Kim. And one further thing
is just is the text point to such human exchange. You know, maybe we don't know if these are the
voices of the people named, but that this is this is a human recognizable human exchange that,
you know, feels can feel very immediate and real. Debbie.
Thank you, all. I think this is my fourth class I've got to explore with the dream team. I call
you. I'm a new practitioner. Well, since Gil started his morning, it's so wonderful to see
friends that I just see names every morning. And Gil would always mention the Pali and I
I shared this with my group, but I bought this book two years ago. So I could, and I couldn't do it
on my own. So I, I just really am grateful for the exploration in a group. And Gary, who is in my
group, I've met through many classes, we're teachers, we're I was a teacher for decades. And
to learn things together is the best I find that has meaningful impact. So thank you. And I'm looking
forward to seeing all this. So I'm so delighted to be back. Thank you. Great. Good to have you.
And just for everyone, Debbie held up a book that's called in the Buddha's words,
which is brings together many texts from the Pali Canon, the Sutta text of the Pali Canon.
And maybe, maybe Debbie could, could drop the citation in the chat for us all.
Some of you may recognize it, but yeah, I think we have time maybe for one more thing.
Then maybe David, can I, before us, I just want to, I want to concur with Debbie just said,
because Kim, Yang, David and I, we kind of became friends by studying the Canon together and other
literature together. We just noticed, recognizing each other that we shared this kind of wish to
understand better. And then we became friends from this. So just recognizing what you're
pointing to, Debbie, kind of learning together helps create community. So just want to throw
that in there. And now we'll go to Susan. Yeah, that was beautiful. And we wanted to say that.
So Diana, I'm glad you found the spot. That's good. Yeah, Susan.
Hi. I just want to start off and say, I appreciate, I am seeing Sati Center so much.
Young Kuei actually messaged me and said, did you move to California?
I'm in Massachusetts. But yeah, I actually just got off a retreat at IMS with the Kunis,
and we were reading the Terry Katah discussing the, you know, the reimagining book and that whole
stuff. And it was really, when I took away from that, just the importance of preserving the original
text. And it's great to come off that and now kind of go deeper in this way.
Great. Yeah. No, that's inspiring. Good. We'll talk about texts that come in,
that find a place in the, including the text that Susan just mentioned,
want to kind of demystify as we go. And these are, you know, people have made mentions of
things. If they're not familiar, don't worry, we're going to kind of give a sense of how they
fit in. And to kind of move in that direction, I'm going to turn it over to Diana.
Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so now I'd like to jump in a little bit, talking about the organization
of the Polycanon. And I'll do that by first. I'm going to be sharing my screen. So I'll be
sharing some slides with you. For some of you, some of this will be old hat. You'll know this.
But I'm hoping to sprinkle in some things that maybe are new. And for some of you, maybe it's
new. So I'm going to build on the handouts that were sent to you before. If you looked at them,
great. If you didn't look at them, that's perfectly fine. We're just going to work with that.
So I'm going to share my screen. This gets a little complicated to do both
to do both have PowerPoint open and to be sharing. But hopefully you can see there's just this
passage. I'm going to read this. In one whose body is tranquil and who feels pleasure,
the mind becomes concentrated. On whatever occasion, the mind becomes concentrated in a
biku whose body is tranquil and who feels pleasure. On that occasion, the concentration
enlightenment factor is aroused in one and one develop it develops it. And by development,
it comes to fulfillment. You might go, wait, what? Seems like there's good words in here.
Tranquility, pleasure, mind, concentration, enlightenment, fulfillment, like all kinds
of good stuff in here. The English is a little clunky. And you might want to, if you hear this
or a teacher is pointing to it, you might want to look this up for yourself. Like what is the
context? How can I understand what's really being pointed to if somehow you just come
across this passage? So I'd like to unpack the polycanon a little bit so that we can look at this,
but recognizing that there are all kinds of interesting passages, beautiful passages, right,
that scholars and Dharma teachers use in reference. So I just put this one up as one that's
something that we may want to explore. So introduction to the organization of the polycanon,
where I kind of think, I like, okay, I'm going to put on my nerd glasses and off we go. This kind
of thing. Okay. So many of you know this, right, that the polycanon as a whole has these three
baskets, tea, pittaka, the little ti is for three. It's one of the rare poly words that has a kind
of a cognate in English. There's the vinaya, which is the rules for the monastics, the nakaya,
which are the teachings, the sutas, the discourses, and the vast majority of the things we talk about,
maybe 98% come from this basket. And then the abhidama. So the vinaya was transmitted by
upali, who was the barber at the time of the Buddha. So and Kim will talk a little bit more
about this, but when they were reciting the polycanon, the upali. So in my imagination,
all the monks, right, they have shaved heads. So they shave each other's heads. And upali is like
the head barber. And they're practicing the rules because I have to recite them regularly. So
upali is there when everybody's shaving their head. This is a story that I made up. But maybe
this is true. Maybe it actually happened. And then the nakayas were transmitted by Ananda,
the Buddha's assistant. This is what the tradition holds. And the abhidama, it's not so clear.
And abhidama sometimes gets translated into English as like the higher teachings, abhidama.
But abhidama can also mean something that means concerning or about. So it could mean
about the teachings. But if any of you have looked at it, it's highly systematized. Essentially,
it's a bunch of lists. It's a list of lists of lists. So I'm going to unpack a little bit
this middle one, the nakayas. So there are five nakayas, the Diga nakayam, Majama Samyuta and
Rudra and Krutika. In English, we would call these the long discourses, middle length connected,
numerical and minor. So the long discourses, not surprisingly are long. There's a lot of them.
In this whole book, there's only 34 sutas. Middle length, there's 152. They're a little bit shorter.
Book is like this. Many, perhaps many of you have seen this. And then there's a collection of
shorter. They have long middle and then a bunch of short ones. And then the short ones are kind
of divided between the Samyuta, which are the connected or linked. So what that means is that
they have a particular topic that then they go into a little bit deeper. So for example, in the
Samyuta, there'll be like dependent origination and there'll be a whole sutas, all about dependent
origination, or the five aggregates, a whole bunch of sutas, just about the five aggregates,
six sense bases, anapanasati, mindfulness and breathing, for example. And Rudra are the numerical
discourses. And so these are things that are, some of it a repeat of what's in other places,
but also like these interesting lists. And they're like a list of fives in the chapter of five,
the fourth chapter, have things that have four lists in them. And for example, on Gudarat five,
161, that means the 161st suta in the chapter on the five, are the five ways of removing resentment,
right? So it's, there are the four kinds of people who do this, or three of this, eight of that.
We don't see some of the most common teachings are not in that in Gudarat, but it's off, some of
them are, but not all of them. And there's a, instead of just an emphasis on numerical this,
and then the kudaka was called the minor discourses. And it's, I'll talk about a little bit more about
that in a moment, but it's a list of smaller, I don't know if minors does it justice, I would say
maybe smaller. So Bhikkhu Bodhi has an idea about why they are organized this way. The longer
discourses are, were about the propagating Buddhism. These long discourses have really
big narrative arcs. They're sometimes really interesting, compelling stories. So it's a way
to draw people in. And it's also about distinguishing Buddhism from the other traditions at that time.
So the Jiga has a particular flavor. The Majamanakaya is the one of the purposes is for new monastics.
So it has some of the basic teachings, how to practice, what are some of the doctrinal points.
And that's often why Dharma teachers quote from the Majamanakaya the most, is because these
teachings for the monastics also can be the teachings for us, some of the basic things.
The Samyuta has deeper, once you have the basics of the teachings, the Samyuta maybe goes more in depth.
And the Angudara can add some of the extra teachings, but also might be a way to support
those who are teaching the suttas. Like, oh yeah, okay, there's four things that they need to know
about this. What were those for? And you can go look it up in that form. So this is just a
theory about why they are organized this particular way is because they have different purposes.
And one thing I'll say is for those of us who have, you know, been poking around in the Pali
canon a lot, you could give us a sutta and we could probably tell you which book it's in from
because they each have their own flavor and length and topic. So it wants you to become
familiar with a kind of guess from which book it's from. So I want to unpack a little bit about
this last one, the Kudaka Nakaya. There are many books in the Kudaka Nakaya. And what I remember
the most is John Peacock coming to IMC maybe 15 years ago, 10 years ago, I don't remember.
And I was brand new to studying the Pali canon. And he said, this has odds and sods.
I don't know what that is, but it sounded kind of funny. So that's how I remember it.
But there are many books in the Kudaka Nakaya. And interestingly, not all
Theravada traditions agree on which books are in there. For example, like in the Burmese
Theravada version, they include a book that the Thai don't include. So some versions of the Kudaka
Nakaya are a little bit different. So the ones that I have here, Dhammapada, Bhudana, Itta
Bhutaka, Sutana Pata, Terigata, Terigata. These are generally considered to be the oldest, that
is to be considered closest to the time of the Buddha. And then I just put here others. There's
so many the Parisamidamaga, the Nadesa, Pettavatu, Bhuda Vamsa, Apadana. Some of these you've probably
never heard of, Apadana just got translated into English just a few years ago. They are definitely
older. And you don't even have to understand Pali. If you were to read these in English,
there is such a different feeling about them. But also part of the way that scholars look at this
is just in the exact same way when we hear English and we hear like Victorian English,
we recognize, oh, this is old English. We probably know what it means, but we recognize just the
use of the words and the grammar is a little bit different. In the same way scholars do that with
Pali. They can say, oh, this is a little bit older than the newer, both by the grammar and the words
that are being used. So, oh, and then I just put here some of the things that we are familiar with
come from the Kutaka Nakaia, the Mehta Sutta, the book of eights that Gil translated is hearing
the Sutta in the Pata and the Bahia Sutta comes out of the Udana. So that quote that I read at
the beginning is from the Anakana Sati and oh, oops, sorry. And it's in the Majama. I was trying to move
the zoom picture out of the way so I can see the slide here. But right, so the Majama is one of the
Nakaias. And then there's Majama 118. And then that one in particular is the 35th section in the
Anapana Sati. This is pretty straightforward. You just want 118 is after 117 before 119. It's not too
hard to find. But that's not the way that it is in Pali. The way the way the original organization was
is that first the Nakaia is separated into groups of 50. Then each group of 50 is grouped into five
chapters of 10. And then each chapter has 10 Suttas. So in the Pali, the Anapana Sati Sutta,
is the eighth Sutta in the second chapter of the final 50. So they didn't go one, two, three for all
the way up to 152. This is a modern nomenclature. And this next week, we'll unpack this, what the
implications are that they're organized this way. So if you're just going to do things in English,
you don't really need to worry about this, except when you, this will become more clear maybe next
Saturday when we talk about this. So then I just also want to mention, I've been talking about Majama
Nakaia 118.35. But there's also the numbering of the Pali. And so maybe I'll go down to this
bullet here. So Majama 118.35, that's the English. But sometimes we see it in the Pali. And we'll see
something like this. M, then a Roman numeral, and then a number. And this means page 86 of the third
volume of the Majama Nakaia. That's in the Pali Roman script. And this will make more sense in a
moment when Kim talks later about how we got from palm leaves to paper, and to different
scripts into Roman script. But just often you'll see sutas that have two different numbers, or one
or the other. If it's a Roman numeral, they're talking to the Pali. If it's just a regular number,
they're talking about English. So that's the way you can tell the difference. And sometimes it can
be frustrating to find this. And next week, we'll talk a little bit about how you can go back and
forth. And then I'll just point out another little interesting thing or something that can kind of
trip us up about the numbering. Some of the things in the Krutika Nakaia are by verse number, or
suta number. Earlier, somebody talked about the Teri Gatta verses. And sometimes Paduchara,
for example, for those of you who have been hanging around IMC, you know that we have the
statue of Paduchara, and there's been a number of Dharma talks, we talk about Paduchara. So
her verses are in the Teri Gatta, just in the Krutika Nakaia. But there's two different ways
you could talk about her verses. You could say it's the 10th suta on the book of fives,
Teri Gatta 510, or the verses number 112 through 116. And different translators do different
ways of the nomenclature here. So sometimes it's tricky. I know myself that I've been trying to
look something up and I have one and I need the other and trying to figure that out. But
just to heads up about this, but all these verses that are in the Krutika Nakaia, there's often
two different ways in which that the numbering is. And then I'm just going to end with this last
little tidbit, pronunciation hints, that they don't, that Pali doesn't have th as in the word
the, instead it's like the word Thomas. And ph is like, it's not like f, but instead it's like the
word upholstery. The long a is like father, and then the short a is in the cut. So there's, you
know, we's going to grade us on our pronunciation. But just in case you're kind of worried that,
or thinking about this, there's the Thomas upholstery, father cut. Okay, that's my, that's
my end. And now I'll pass it on to you.
Wow, thank you. Thank you, Diana, for that. I don't know, just feeling so happy
seeing this and cutting little pieces of new things that I didn't realize. I found
of this Abhidharma translated as a hire or about just a few of the difference, right? And that's
interesting. So we have a little time for us to ask any questions about what's being offered so
far or anything at this point. So yeah, Francisca. There's a book that I understand is very widely
read. And also deal for some translated it. And it's named the Dhammapada. Is that part of the
party cannon? Isn't it? Where is it? If it is, that's something I've never found out. Thank you.
So I wonder if Diana want to show that slide again. And I can, it's actually in the first one in the
the minor collection. If Diana can pull that slide out. Diana, would you like to say?
I have to unmute myself here. I think that it is here. Nope. Here we go. Here's the Dhammapada.
So it's in the Kudaka Nakaya. The Kudaka Nakaya. Or maybe Francisca, I can see that you're looking
at. Does this make sense? So the Dhammapada is here. It's in the Kudaka. And then the Kudaka is,
you know, over here, siblings with these other books. So that's where the Dhammapada is. And
maybe I'll say the Dhammapada is the most translated text of all of early Buddhism. There's a lot of
those. So many, many translations. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Will.
Yeah, I find it interesting, you know, in the wisdom series of the translations,
you have one translation for the Majama, one for the Anagudra, but the Kudaka,
it's like a bunch of different books, not all one volume. That's right. Yes. Yes.
They're actually, I think if the Kudaka Nakaya were to be together, it would be so big. Probably
the biggest because it's a collection of so many. And like I said, some of them haven't even been,
they were just translated like two years ago, like the Apadana. And yeah, if you were to look at it,
you would understand like, oh, these teachings, there aren't doctrinal teachings in them, there
aren't as much interest for translators. The translators are more interested in what's related
to practice or the teachings. Yeah. Yeah. In that collection, Jesus Utanipika is huge.
So if you look at the books, then you'll see, wow, that's in there too. Okay. Susan.
This is all very new to me. It's the first time I've had an overall picture and I'm
fascinated and it's all going by quickly. I wonder if you would be willing to share those
slides with us. Yes. They will be sent out after the class. So you will have them and we will have
them too. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. Neha. Hi. Thank you. So I was wondering, Dan, you spoke of how
each of the discourses, right, the Majima or the Diga, or each of them sort of have a purpose,
or you know, the middle-end discourses are more for people who are maybe the new monastics.
What did you say about the last two? I missed that, which is the Alhutara and the Tudaka.
Yeah. I'm happy to answer, but I'm also happy, Kim, I know that. Do you want to say anything
here or David or David? Well, my understanding is that the Samyuta is also for monastics, but
maybe for those who are not so beginner and who are kind of directing themselves toward awakening
and they really need the deeper structural material and the teachings that point straight
that direction. And then the Angutara could be for teachers to give Dharma talks.
That one I have a little question about. There may be other reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'll just say
that as you read or listen to this text, open to how you receive them. Because when I first,
I started reading Samyuta Nikaya first, there is such timelessness with reading that. But when
you began to open to Diga and Majma, there's all of that in a totally different flavor. It's like
you're living in a whole new world, reading them. And so that was a different collections that may
have, may evoke a different sense in you. And so it's all for us to explore as well. Yeah. Amy.
Hey, hello. I was wondering why the Dhammapada would be the most translated of all of these books?
Okay. Any of my co-teachers who would like to answer this?
Maybe I'll jump in. It's all in verse and some of it is pithy. So really short little teachings
that people can remember and like to do. I'll say that. Then maybe I'll say something also
about translating first and from Pali to English. Just the exact same way we do in English, sometimes
with poetry, we use words that are not so common. We use sentence structure that is not so common to
make it sound poetic. In the same way, Pali does not chew. But in addition, the Pali is done with
a particular meter. Like I don't know exactly what the meat, but the third syllable has to be long
and the second syllable has to be shorter, you know, something like this. So the Pali in verse
is different than the Pali in prose. The Pali in verse really takes, is not in the usual way.
It's not often the usual form or common words. So if you're a translator, this is inter-fantastic
because you get to interpret it however you think is the best or it's really frustrating
if you're trying to get it precise. So a lot of translators like to do verse because it's all
that was a little bit more interpretation. Not all translators. I know some translators really
don't like to do verse at all because it's so difficult. But that's my interpretation. Maybe
some of my colleagues have some other ideas. You know, I would just add two things. One,
oh, it's really beautiful. That was the first thing that came to mind. But the other thing is
that certain texts become popular and, you know, our practice is influenced by a small number of
texts. One of the beauties of this class, I think, is to open the door to, you know, this huge variety
of things that are available from the verses of monastics as they experienced awakening
to the Dhammapada, to rare jewels, you know, and as Kim mentioned in the Samyuta, these detailed
things, or even the Abhidharma, which gets a bad name, you know, each of these has something to
offer for our practice. And we shouldn't be, I think, too influenced by those that have become
popular over time and that everybody reads, you know, those are great. But there's so much more.
Okay, the last one, Erin.
Yes, I've just been reading a bit about the Dhammapada. And my understanding is it derives
from the Dhammapada commentary. Do you have any words to that effect? And that the Dhammapada
itself has just taken little bits of that Dhammapada commentary and made them into these
wise, wise reflections, I guess I could call them.
I'm curious. Any of my co-teachers want to say?
Yeah, I would say, I would disagree with that. I don't know how to say this nicely.
But in terms of, and Kim will talk about this in a little bit later, the commentaries are much
later. They're, I don't know, 800 years later or so. And they provide the backstory for each one
of the verses. So, but there is, I mean, in the canon, the Dhammapada is very succinct. It's very
clear what is the actual verses. So it is different than the commentary. And then maybe I'll say the
commentaries can be fun to read for the Dhammapada, because the backstories have these incredible,
like, fantastical, like, well, this was said on the occasion of this person had, I don't know,
some dramatic thing. And that, and whether that's true or not, of course, we don't know. But I would
say there's very clear distinction between the Dhammapada and the commentary in the canon. The
canon only contains the Dhammapada. And Kim will talk about this, the commentaries later. I don't
know, is that helpful, Erin? Yes, it is. There's a specific book I'm referring to as Buddhist
legends. I can't remember the guy's name. He's, he lived back and I think he was in like 1920.
He wrote this whole thing about, I think it was about the Dhammapada and the commentary. So I
started reading his book. And it is, yeah, it's a lot of stories, a lot of stories, which actually
originated back in those times, like stories about an elephant or a tiger, you know, all kinds of
stories that seem to give kind of a, I don't know, flavor, I guess, a flavor for the time.
And I find them somewhat interesting from that perspective.
Yeah, Diane, I go ahead. Yeah, maybe I'll just say, so within the Theravada tradition,
there are some schools within Theravada who are, who are definitely, I don't know,
read the commentaries are influenced by the commentaries, definitely hold the
commentaries as kind of like really important. There are other traditions in Theravada,
which don't hold the commentaries with the same authority as what's in the canon.
And I am from my kind of inherited, where I make a distinction between what's in the canon and
what's in the commentaries. But not all Theravada practitioners, not all Theravada lineages do
that. And so, and I think that's, I love some of the stories, I think they're inspiring and
beautiful and fun. Some of them are fun too. But the, but in my, what I've inherited,
make a distinction between them. But I want to honor and respect that that's not all traditions
do that. And I don't know, does any of my colleagues want to say anything about this?
Yeah, I'll just say, maybe for things like a Dhammapata, it's really nice to read it
with the different frames. So, and you know, sometimes it's very fun to read the stories
and the back stories of it. And, and other times, just dropping a verse in meditation or dropping
a verse for a day to start a day. And the recently I've been reading the verses on happiness.
Oh, just bring that in. It gives enriches how we relate to Dharma in different ways. And especially
a Dhammapata, they're really just, you know, very small verses and bring that in in our lives.
I'm unconscious. We are at the break. So we'll offer a five minutes, maybe a bio break,
and then we'll come back together in 945. Thank you.
And next, we would like to sit in meditation together briefly.
And so I'm looking around and seeing people coming back. So, yeah, as you come back,
maybe you can sort of start to settle into meditation by taking advantage of the motion
that's underway, coming back to sitting, and sort of settling into a feeling of arriving, coming here,
being here now, as we like to say, sense of coming back to center.
And because they were offered to us earlier, I'll just guide a little meditation
that incorporates the passage that Diana shared. The passages we find in the suttas, in the canon,
can in various ways guide our practice. And one way that many of them do is by suggesting
ways to drop instructions or descriptions of meditative practice into the meditation itself.
So we can read about it, but we can also do it. We can also use the passages that are offered
to us as a way to structure our meditation, give our meditation light, inspire our practice. So
I see before me a group of experienced meditators. I'm going to then also join you closing my eyes,
invite you to close your eyes. And as with the closing of the eyes, like returning to
your seat in front of the Zoom screen, maybe rebalancing attention inward, bringing our attention
inward, downward, bringing attention to the inner world, our inner life, bringing our attention into
the body, bringing attention first, maybe to the posture and the balance of the body,
the balance of the torso over the waist, the balance of the head over the shoulders,
and just settling into a meditative posture that balances us, reflects the balance that we
adopt for the meditation between alertness, presence, curiosity, and ease,
a posture of both mind and body, of mind, body, heart, that reflect an alert relaxation or a
relaxed alertness. And then we can bring our attention to the breathing happening,
connecting with the breath in the body, feeling the breath moving the abdomen,
feeling the sensations of breathing at the chest, the solar plexus, lifting the shoulders slightly,
the shoulders softening with each out breath,
maybe connecting with the breath in the nose, just noticing the breath coming in cool and quick,
and coming out with each exhalation a little warmer, a little softer, a little slower,
or after contact with the body. Maybe we can touch in with
that although we sit alone in our practice today, we're joined by 36 other practitioners,
and that in this community of practice, there's great goodwill,
there's support for one another's practice, maybe we can feel the support of others for
our own practice, and then we can open the heart slightly to provide support for others that are
here. We share a little bit of the benefit of our meditation with our fellows.
And then we can bring the passage that Diana offered earlier into this meditative
space, these meditative surroundings, this meditative home,
touching in with any tranquility that's there in our experience,
the body at ease maybe, even if there's discomfort or
unpleasant, maybe there's some tranquility that's just an aspect of the meditation,
and we can just appreciate that, notice that,
we can touch in with any pleasure that's available in the meditation.
The practice invites us to recognize
pleasures of mind and body in the meditation that come from the seclusion, from our surroundings that
are related to the connection to the here and now of our experience,
and the passage invites us to notice this, that when we bring attention to this tranquility,
or to the pleasures of meditation, that the mind too can find itself more collected,
more still, sometimes more open, brighter, more at ease,
and in this soft touch of attention that we bring to these aspects of our experience,
we are cultivating peace with the touch of mindful attention to our
own experience, showing up for it as it is, noticing wholesome experience in it.
Thus the path is cultivated, thus the path is walked.
you
you
you
you
you
Thank you, David, that was lovely.
So just bringing ourselves back into the world of the computer, and
I'd like to speak a little bit now.
The theme for today is kind of the big picture, and Diana gave a wonderful
overview of the structure of the Pali Canon as we have it now.
And as you might suspect, these texts have a history, and they also have a relationship
to other Buddhist texts. There's more to Buddhist scripture than the Pali Canon.
So we definitely can't go over all of that, but I would like to offer now some
comments on the history and the preservation and the transmission of the Pali texts,
and the purpose is to give us some context for this with the Pali Canon.
So the historical Buddha lived during the fifth century before the common era,
and he died around 400 BCE, and the teachings were not written down at that point,
but that actually isn't strange. In India at that time, there was a strong tradition of oral
transmission of religious teachings. It was already being done by the Brahmins, the historical
religious class of the time, and so it was normal that teachings were memorized and recited and
spoken, and that was how they were communicated. But soon after the Buddha's death, his party
Nibbana, there was what's called a council, the first council, and it was a meeting of the
Arahant disciples of the Buddha to recite the suttas and the vinaya and to generally agree
on what these teachings were. So as Diana mentioned, Upali was the reciter of the vinaya,
the parvur, and Ananda was the reciter of the suttas, and the Abhidhamma came a little later.
And there were a series of these councils over the years, especially they would happen when
there were disputes arising over doctrinal or vinaya issues. As you can imagine, there wasn't
always agreement about what it was that the Buddha said. We've already had questions about that,
and sometimes there were actually splits into different schools. We don't have just a single
transmission line of the teachings. But what is now called the Theravada school, where we,
what shall we say, the Asian antecedent of what we're doing here in the West, the Theravada school,
does trace its roots all the way back to this original period just after the Buddha.
And so I'll show a diagram of some of this a little bit later. But you know,
lest you think that these councils were just a thing of the past, the Sixth Burmese Council
was held in Myanmar in Burma in 1954. And it included 2,500 monks from eight different countries.
And the addition of the Pali Canon that was agreed upon and approved at this council can be found
online. We now have different transmission methods. And it's also the Pali version that is found on
Suta Central, which we're going to talk about in our next class on the seventh. We'll talk about
finding suttas, learning how to navigate Suta Central. And on there you can find Pali versions
of the suttas. And that's what the Pali versions are. They're the ones that were agreed upon at the
Sixth Burmese Council. So then we might have the question, well, when did the teachings get written
down? Where was that transition point? So they were exclusively oral at first, and then they got
written down. But actually the oral tradition continued in some form all the way to the present.
It's not like it stopped at that point. But we do have this written version.
So most likely the Pali Canon was first recorded in Pali during the first century, B.C.E.,
so several hundred years after the death of the Buddha. And scholars believe that was done
because there was a sense of threat to the continuance of the teachings. There were some
social unrest at that time. There was some religious persecution of Buddhists at that time.
And there may have also been even difficult physical conditions, like a famine going on.
And so there was genuine concern that there might not be enough monks alive to know who
would know each portion of the teachings. It would be a problem if all the monks who knew a certain
book, like all the ones who knew the Dhammapada, died, it would be lost. And so someone said,
hey, let's write these down. But actually first I'm going to show a little diagram
to give us a sense of this timing. I've been talking about historical time. Let me see if I
can share that. No, not that one. Hang on. There. So you can see then that the Buddha is way over
the farthest to the left. And then we have the Pali Canon and also these Chinese translations
of it, or Chinese translations of the Sanskrit version of it. We won't get into the complications.
But there's another set of texts called the Agamas that are similar to the Canon and Kias.
And then the commentaries come much later. We had a little bit of a conversation about that
earlier, but today we're far over on the right side of this diagram. So you can get a roughly
proportional sense of the elapsed time. And things are a little bit variable because the
commentaries were written over several hundred years. And we definitely don't have time to talk
about the commentaries in this class, but I just wanted to show, because you'll hear these words,
you'll hear these names, the Canon, the commentaries, etc. So I hope that's somewhat helpful.
Okay. So then we can talk about these written teachings. They were first written down on
banana leaves. And that's not the most durable medium, but that's where they were first written
down. The three baskets, I believe, are referred to baskets of leaves, you know, put it in with
the right basket, which where the teachings go. So the piles were kept in these three baskets.
And later people, of course, used other things like paper. And, you know, now we have,
we have them on the computer. And so they continue to change over time. We're definitely,
we're trying to be flexible here with these teachings. But it is also true that they,
this leaf tradition continues now. At the end of when I'm done talking, David is going to show you
a real actual palm leaf manuscript. It's not of the polycanon itself, but it has some suitas in it.
And they were, they're from Laos from maybe a couple hundred years ago. And right there on palm
leaves. So hang on for that. You'll see it in a moment. I guess Diana mentioned a little bit about
the script also. And maybe that's just worth saying is that poly, the language poly, it's
related to Sanskrit. It's an ancient Indian language. It doesn't have its own script, actually. So
you write poly in whatever script you already know from writing. So we have Roman script in the
books that Diana was holding up. That's poly written, that's poly translated into Roman script,
and then translated into English, of course. But you can also write poly in Laotian script,
as David is going to show, or Thai script, or Burmese script, just whatever alphabet is,
you can write the poly sounds in that. So that's sometimes interesting to know. People say, oh,
just, you know, what, what is the script for poly? It's anything. So the, the versions that we have
in Roman script are fully authentic. You know, that's, that's the poly. There isn't any more original
form. Okay, so was that first written version of the poly canon exactly what we have now?
Probably not. That would be unlikely. But nonetheless, these texts have been lovingly
preserved by sincere practitioners for a long time. And so that gives me some confidence in their
transmission over time. And there are people who just their lives were dedicated to preserving these
texts. And I love that we have the original something like the poly versions. So that each
time we translate into some other language, we had a question earlier about translation,
we have English versions, we have Spanish versions, many other languages, you'll see that also when
we do suit the central we have translations into a lot of languages, at least work we have
translate from one thing. And it's not that we're translating a translation of a translation that's
been through a game of telephone over time. At least hopefully we've minimized that by the
method of transmission that's been used. So, you know, we're also invited to verify for ourselves,
as we said in the answer to the question earlier, you know, we can also check these teachings are
aimed at certain elimination of suffering. They also describe particular meditative states that
can be come to through practice. And we can check does that actually happen in our own practice,
we don't have to in the end believe something we can check for ourselves and see if it is
leading toward, you know, maybe someday we can even verify that what the Buddha talked about
as awakening is is true and correct. That's, that's the inspiration for trying this out for ourselves.
Also, I need to add a little caveat here, which is that because this class is on the poly canon,
and there's this set of texts, that's what we're talking about. It can give the impression that
Buddhism is a religion of the book, the way, say, the Protestant religions are very centered around
the Bible. And that it takes maybe the orthodoxy of Buddhism as the highest doctrinal teachings.
And that wouldn't be quite true. Buddhism is more of what's called an orthopraxy than an
orthodoxy. So we talk about practicing in the correct way or practicing in ways that
alter the mind, lead to transformation of our understanding and our way of living.
And there can be many ways of doing that. And it's, yeah, so that's what maybe not that we
haven't had many, many arguments over the years about doctrine. That's very true. But in the end,
hopefully, we can connect over the practices. And so that's partly why David led us in that
lovely meditation on some of the texts in MN 118 that meant to practice these things.
So then finally, I want to show a very simplified chart of the expansion of Buddhism over time.
Very, very simplified. And before I show it, I want to make a huge important caveat statement,
which is that what the chart shows, in fact, I want to tell you how to interpret the chart.
Buddhism is a living tradition that has changed over time. It's been changing since the moment
the Buddha died. And rather than making a search for the true authentic, real Buddhism,
and rather than getting dogmatic or rigid, I think we can recognize that fixed views about
Buddhism were not so helpful. So with that, let me show you this chart.
So first, we have this top part, simplified depiction of the expansion of Buddhism. So
it starts with the Buddha who died, as I said, around 400 BCE. And then here's the whole chart.
It's working. Oops. We lost it. Hang on. Are you seeing that chart? No. Okay. Stop, share. Hang on.
Okay.
Kim, when you scroll, oh, there we go. I'm trying to get to the next page where I have more of it.
There it is. Can you see that? Okay. So the death of the Buddha, 400 BCE. Now we have this.
There is a thing. Let's see if I can change the size of this. Yes. So we can see it all on one page.
So the scholars call this a schism about 100 years after the death of the Buddha. And we have this
division into this Shibiravada and the Mahasangika. And these multiple arrows on the, we're focused
here on the left side, Theravada, Southern Buddhism. That's where we have the Pali Canon.
That's where it's taken as authoritative. There were many different schools through this time. But
the Theravada is kind of the one that survived. And there were maybe a couple of dozen others
in between. On the Mahasangika, the right side, that's what eventually became Mahayana, Northern
Buddhism. And there are many different versions of that. And like I said, this is really simplified.
But I hope it just gives you a general impression. Because sometimes in our modern world, where we
have access to so many different schools, teachings, teachers, people can be very confused.
And they combine things. They mix up various different things. And it's not that we need to be
rigid and dogmatic because the schools are changing, as I said. But I do think it's important to know
broadly where you are in that realm and to not mix up the teachings. It's honorable and respectful
to each school to allow it its own thing. And we're in the Theravada school that honors the
Pali Canon. And that's different from the Mahayana tradition, for example. Okay, so with that,
I've gone a little over, but I'm going to pass it on to David to show us this beautiful manuscript
and then to open it up for questions after that. Thank you, Kim. Yeah. Yeah, I'll just share this
scroll, which came in a way to the four of us as we taught these classes. This was found at a garage
sale in Oregon, having made its way there, probably from a monastery in Thailand or Burma. And it
looks like this. I'm going to show it by hand and then I'll show some pictures of it, share screen,
because it's hard to see. But just to give you a sense of the size of it, this is a series of
thin palm leaves that are spread together. I'll get some light on it. And again, you'll see better
details in a moment, but it's quite fragile. But, presumably, this would be have been carried around
by a monastic visiting, probably laypeople and used to refresh memory. We haven't really looked
carefully into which suttas might be in here. We do know that when it was first, when I first showed
it to a friend of a friend to identify it, they recognized the Thai Lao script and also the sutta
that I just happened to open up to the Mongala sutta, which Kim gave a class about the other night.
So let me show you some better, easier to see pictures by sharing screen. And then we'll go to
questions. This is sort of a picture of the whole thing I just held up in much better lighting.
You can see that basically these letters, these letters are or characters are etched. That is,
they're cut into the palm leaf and then ashes spread over it and then shaken off and the ash
remains in the letter. So there's actually, you can feel there's a physical etching. These are like
just show you a couple more real quick of more detailed. Here's a picture of some of the lovely
script. And in this document, there are apparently several scribes at work. Here's another one with
another completely different hand. So anyway, it's wonderful in a way to just have this direct
contact with one way that these texts and these teachings were kept and carried and shared and
transmitted from warm hand to warm hand. After the questions, just in case you were thinking of
running off, Kim's going to kind of show us yet another way that is the one of the principal ways
that they were. Kim's going to kind of show us yet another way that is the one of the principal
ways that they were communicated and remembered and passed on, which is by chanting. So there's a
there's an intersection of oral and textual transmissions of the teachings by way of text
and language. That's, as she pointed out, very alive, very, very much something that continues
at present as we practice and share what we learn from the practice. So yeah, we'd like to open it
up for more questions about anything that's come up so far. Technical questions, I'm going to
immediately pass on to Kim and Diana. But yeah, what's coming up for people? Yanqui or Yanqui?
Yes. Thank you, everybody. And I'm so I think I spaced out when I think it was Diana, somebody
talking about Pali and how it can be in different languages. Is that Pali is oral? Is it an oral
language? Is that what you meant? And then and then for example, what you just show, what is that
written in? Was that written in Thai? So anyway, I just want to clarify that. I'm a little confused
about and Sanskrit is a written language, I think, and spoken. But Pali is only a spoken, but I'm not
sure. Okay, thank you. I have thought on that, but let me pass it on to pass it back to Diana.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just say that what you were showing, what David was showing on the palm leaves,
so the language is Pali. The script characters are a form of Thai Lao. Yeah, I don't know what
that means. Maybe that's near the border, something like that. Yeah. So but the but so that means
that somebody who had gone to school in that language and was used to reading, they couldn't
read those scripts because they're in Pali. You know, it would look as if we would had opened,
you know, the Pali canon in Pali, even if it's in the Roman script, we can't read Pali necessarily.
So that makes sense. There's a difference between the script and the language. Yeah.
And earlier when Diana spoke of Roman script, that's Pali using Roman letters that, you know,
are familiar in the languages of Europe. Let me give a different example then actually.
Because, of course, Chinese, they're the same, right? We have characters
are the same as the language. But the Roman script, which English is written in, you can also write
German, French, Spanish, they all use the Roman script. And as a, you know, if I don't know French,
for example, so if I see French, I can I can recognize the letters, but I can't read the words. So
there's a difference between the script and the language. Yeah. Okay, I appreciate the last bit.
So tell me again, then Pali is the so Pali is the language. And it doesn't have its own script
associated with it. You know, and so you're just like European languages don't have just one.
They all share the same Roman script. So Pali can be written in any script. And so when we write it
in the Roman script, and it looks like English letters, that's perfectly authentic. But it could
also be written in, you know, Lao, Burmese, any of the languages of South Asia. Yeah. But you don't
say that's a spoken language, then you don't say Pali is a spoken, it's still
spoken. It's still, it has a pronunciation for each of the letters. So yes, it can be spoken.
And maybe I'll just add a little bit, maybe a synonym we'd use for script would be alphabet.
So there's different alphabets, it could be the Thai alphabet or the Burmese alphabet.
And that's why when you see things in the Roman alphabet, the one that we usually write that we
write English in, sometimes you see there's a dot over the N, or there's a bar over the A.
That's because we're trying to mimic a sound that's not exactly in the Roman alphabet,
but it approximates it. So that's one of the dots and the bars are, or say, are doing there,
trying to change our alphabet a little bit to be, to mimic the pronunciation of Pali.
Andrea, is the Sanskrit alphabet used for Pali ever?
I sense, Kim, do you know the answer to this? Because the Sanskrit that I know is in
Devanagari or in Roman, but I don't, is there a Sanskrit alphabet?
I don't know. Yeah, I've only seen it written in other, yeah.
No, I think Sanskrit too can be rendered in various, various,
What we're coming up against is that, you know, there wasn't a lot of written texts in
ancient South Asia, 2,500 years before the common era. This was a time when
yeah, written languages were still coming into being and being used for things. You see the same
thing in Europe, like in Egypt, and scripts were probably invented at different times,
in different places in the world. There wasn't just one invention of it,
but this was all around the time when that was coming into being. And so,
yeah, a lot of stuff just wasn't written. It's hard for us to imagine as moderns.
And I would just point out one other sort of interesting implication of Yankei's question,
which is that although it doesn't, as far as we know, remain a spoken language after a fairly
early period, it does remain a chanted language through to the present. And it's frequently on
the basis of its chanting that it is committed to text. So it's a very special sort of,
I don't know that it's unique, but it's a very specific and special history
through which it comes to us. I think that was a nice transition. Yeah,
stimulating question. And I'll back to you, Kim. Yeah, I love that David brought it back to the
idea of chanting, which is one of the ways that these have been preserved orally over the years.
As you read the texts, you can see some elements of chanting in them. They have repeated sections,
they have ways in which sort of cues that would make them easier to memorize and recite
in the chanting form, but also work quite nicely on our minds in kind of a meditative, repetitive
sense. So what I wanted to play just, it's about three minutes. I'm going to play the first three
minutes and 45 seconds of a chant. It's much longer because it's the chant of the whole
MN118, the one that we've been looking at today. So I'm going to play just the beginning of it.
And it begins first with, you'll recognize the three omeges to the Buddha, and then it goes
into the chant. And we're only going to hear really the first few paragraphs of the chant.
So hang on, we'll get that up.

Thank you, Kim.
So maybe I'll just say just a few more words.
It's a little bit, when we're thinking about Pauli
and translation and script and stuff,
here's one way to imagine it,
that let's say there's somebody who is chanting
just exactly like we heard,
and there was an English speaker in audience.
There was a Thai speaker in audience.
There was a Burmese speaker in audience
and all of them were writing down the sounds
of what they heard.
So the Burmese people would write it
and using their Burmese alphabet,
the Thai person would use the Thai alphabet,
the English person would use the English alphabet.
So that's all.
And that's how it happened, right?
It started with words,
I started with sounds that then got written down.
So the pronunciation of Pauli,
once you know the rules, is easy
because they never vary from the rules, right?
Because it all came from the sound
and was written down.
So there's no, unlike English,
where we have some words that we don't know
how to pronounce by how they're written.
It's the different in Pauli.
So maybe I'll just say that.
And then I will add
that Kim talked about in 1954,
was this council
to go through the Pauli canon.
For me, I'm just like so impressed by this.
One of the rules in order for Burma,
the different Buddhist countries,
how did Burma get chosen to hold the council?
It's because in Burma,
there were some monastics
that had memorized
like all the Nakayas.
All of that, right?
It's just like amazing to think about.
I think there was different one for the Nakayas,
different one for the Abhidhamma
and different one for the,
for the Vinaya.
It's quite astounding, right?
To think that even in modern times,
there are people who chant just like what we heard
and who have memorized, you know,
this is probably some lifetimes worth of work,
probably to do nothing,
but memorize 100,000 pages of Pauli
or something like this.
Just a little comment.
My understanding was that 1954 council,
it took two years to finish
and they ended on the full moon in 1956.
That was exactly something like 2,500 years
after the first council.
So anyway.
Yeah, right. I love this kind of tidbit, right?
Sometimes when we think about the Pauli Canon,
it feels stiff and stale and something like this,
but it's definitely alive.
And somebody put in the chat box that that was divine
kind of listening to that.
So something that the four of us have discovered
and maybe each one of us would describe it
a little bit differently,
and maybe you have your own experience of this too,
but there's a way in which we read the text
and for the meaning and the content and the explanation
and for us to have a better understanding.
Fantastic. Excellent.
And often we find there's something else being transmitted,
but maybe isn't,
we don't have the exact words for or something
maybe a little bit more than just the exact knowledge.
And I'll say for me as a practitioner, right?
I'm a PhD scientist.
Actually, all of us are here, the four of us.
And so that there's we've,
I just want to offer this as a possibility to be open
to both types of transmission and knowledge
and something else that I don't myself have exact ways
to point to you, but that touches me and supports me
and I don't makes me happy
in some kind of way.
So I just wanted to share that.
So sometimes when we teach these classes,
we have homework and we don't have specific homework,
but I do want to say for those of you who do have a copy
of the Majama Nakaya,
to go ahead and look at the table of contents
and you'll see what I was talking about,
the way that it's organized that it has the first 50
and then it has this five chapters
and then within the chapters or the different suit does.
We so rarely talk about this, but it's recognized.
And then we'll build on that next Saturday.
We'll talk some more about that and like why that's relevant
or something like that.
Maybe one last thing as we close here,
we will be sending you an email that has the slides
that I did and that Kim did in the link to this chant
that Kim just shared with us.
And maybe I'll end there.
Maybe I'll just end there.
And as an invitation to you,
it's so great to share this with you all
and kind of explore this together
and to enter into this world of the Polycanon.
We look forward to seeing you next Saturday.
And I don't do any of my co-teachers here.
Do you have some words you'd like to say?
No, I'm looking for Yang.
Yang, she's over here.
Okay, so that's...
Well, take care, everybody.
And we can all say goodbye.
Goodbye.
And really way, we can just all speak at the same time.
So bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dream Team.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
