 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So mindfulness of mind and mindfulness of awareness. Awareness has, in the simplicity of it, has no weight, no color, no shape. Awareness in itself has no history and no future. And to free awareness from all the ways in which we burden it with our desires and wishes and fears and projections. So that awareness becomes simple is one of the great possibilities in this practice of mindfulness. And awareness is released. Awareness is set free. And even of ourselves, and this is one of the more radical things about this practice, the way in which it can free ourselves from ourselves. And so if you engage in mindfulness practice and meditation practice, and you're able to kind of really give yourself over to just being here, just being mindful in the current of the present moment, the current of breathing, sensing, feeling, whatever is going on. Then at some point we get absorbed. This becomes all we're doing. And in that all we're doing absorption and just being present, self-concern, self-preoccupation, falls away. We're still here in a fully, full way. But I like to, for some reason, I like to liken this to basketball players. That if you watch someone playing basketball professionally or something, and there's no time to wonder about, how's that fan thinking about me? Is my shirt tucked in properly? Did I do well? Did I snap my fingers right at that last shot? All kinds of preoccupations and thoughts, there's no time for it. There's a kind of complete losing, what's a giving oneself over to what they're doing. And not most of us are not basketball players, but it could be cooking or playing music or reading a book. There's activities that we do that we kind of forget ourselves. We lose ourselves in a healthy way in the activity. Some people say that time stops when we lose ourselves in the activity. We don't really lose ourselves, but there's a wonderful self-forgetting or stepping out of the clothes of self that we wear. And to have this wonderful getting out of our own way and being free from self-concern, self-preoccupation, referencing everything to self, also begins to free awareness. It frees our presence, our ability to attend to what's here. There's a freedom, there's a lightness, there's an ease in that. And so then as we continue the practice, there's more and more of this kind of self-forgetting or more and more of this shedding of anything that's extra. And there's a kind of a sensitivity that arises to what's extra. So sitting quietly, being with a breath, being with something. And then you have the thought, you know, that breath wasn't as good as the previous breath. But rather than believing it or getting involved in that thought, it's so clear that that's extra, that thought. The goodness of the moment doesn't need it. And so we don't get involved in that thought. We don't pick it up. And we just kind of stay with the flow, the activity of here and here. And so then awareness gets simpler and simpler, we get simpler and simpler. Or maybe we don't get simpler anymore, we've receded from the picture. And awareness gets simpler and simpler and simpler. And at some point, awareness releases itself. Awareness, just like there's a self-forgetting, there's an awareness-forgetting. Awareness forgets itself. And what is that like? When it gets that simple, that free, that safe, that settled, that just being alive is enough, just here. And even awareness doesn't have to do anything, doesn't have to accomplish anything, it's not directed anywhere. And there's a self-forgetting in the awareness too. Awareness is so smooth and operating so simply, it just kind of forgets itself. Sometimes it's called a dropping away. Sometimes it's called a ceasing, the ending of something. And then it comes back. But to have that experience of awareness-forgetting itself, awareness getting out of its own way, teaches something very profound about clinging and the possibility of non-clinging. So the final step for this week about awareness is the release, not only the release in awareness, but the release of awareness itself. Both of those. So we respect our minds, our awareness. We begin by just relaxing, that was the first day. And then there's recognition, a huge part of awareness is its capacity to recognize. And we're building on that capacity so the recognition becomes simpler and simpler and simpler, less baggage, less associations. Just a simple knowing, just in breath, just a thought, just hearing, just being. And then there's this deep respect for this whole process of being aware, of being present, respect for ourselves. I think this Dharma practice is founded on a very deep respect that borders or is a kind of reverence for all this. And so of course we want to be present and attentive and find a way to be with everything that being with is simple, just there with it. We don't interfere with anything. And then there's a kind of restoration of a wonderful kind of freedom of mind that can just know whatever's happening freely, openly. There's no barriers, no boundaries to anything, it's just known, it's free. Everything's known simply, nothing sticks. And then as we continue this process of deepening the awareness and just kind of getting the flow of awareness, just relaxing in the simplicity of being, there is this greater and greater process of simplification. And that might be a nicer word for some of people to hear rather than letting go, releasing. Because letting go can seem like we are dismissing things or we're abandoning things or we're going to be without anything. But this simplification is simplifying into the most, the part of ourselves, the part of life that is most reverent, most respectful, deepest, most sacred. And to trust it so deeply and so well that there's a self-forgetting and awareness forgetting. And then you'll know something new, something different about this life. And you probably never believe that clinging is important again. You might, you're probably still cling, but you will no longer believe in it and that that's what's important. And so the Buddha talked about awareness, he used the word chitta, so maybe mine, but awareness liberated through non-clinging. So, and then you get yourself in the simplest, most beautiful and profound way that you can be, that paradoxically, wonderfully, wondrously also involves a self-forgetting. So it might seem like you're not going to be there to appreciate this wonder, but maybe part of you is not there, the part that's extra. So thank you for this opportunity to teach this stuff and appreciate our time together. And so as I said yesterday, next week I'm teaching retreat and we're very fortunate to have Matthew Brenn-Silver teaching the 7 a.m. And he'll do that together with some other things he does for the week. So if you want to get a deeper immersion in the practice and the teachings and with Matthew, check out the, what Aha is described on the IMC website and, or in the calendar. And includes the Saturday day long, next Saturday. And then on Wednesday, next Wednesday evening, the 17th of November, a few of the senior practitioners, teacher trainees here at IMC, both of them have done chaplaincy training, spiritual caregiving training, involved with that very, very intimately. We're going to offer a grief circle. It's sometimes we've done sometimes the end of the year to kind of honor, respect, commemorate, engage in the losses of the year. And there's been a lot now because of, you know, all kinds of losses with the pandemic and COVID. And so it'll be on Zoom and they'll have a protocol on Zoom. You should read the description because you need to come with something for the ceremony, the ritual they'll do. And so that's this coming Wednesday with Ying Chen and Don Neal. So thank you all and I'll see you, I guess, in a couple of weeks. Thank you.
