 
 Kalyāṇa (1 of 5): Introduction  to Beauty  
in the Dharma  
 
Transcribed  and edited  from  a short  talk by Gil

With this Monday  dharmette,  I’ll introduce  the topic  for 
this week : beauty.  Beauty  is not often  associated  with 
the Dharma  or meditation,  especially  in the usual  
Buddhist  circles  I’m in. Meditation  is usually  associated  
with wonderful  qualities  like calm,  concentration,  
attentiv eness, and clarity.  To associate  it with beauty  is 
something  the Buddha  did – not very often,  but he 
certainly  did. He talked  about  someone  who was 
proficient  in meditation  as being , “skilled  in the beauty  of 
meditation. ” The word  here for meditation  is samādhi , 
so, “skilled  in the beauty  of samā dhi.” 
 
To discover , to align  with, or to attune  ourselves  to the 
beauty  of meditation  can be a guide  and a support  to 
help us find our way in meditation.  To discover  this 
beauty  is one of the wonderful  aspects  of meditation.  
We can call this “Dharma  beauty .” If we want  something  
broader  in meaning , we could  say “spiritual  beauty .” We 
are discovering  and tapping  into something  important.  
This can be a companion,  foundation,  and guide  to our 
freedom.    
  
Certainly , it is freedom  from that which  is not beautiful.  If 
– not as a moral  judgment , but as a felt experience  – we 
actually  tune into them,  then things  like hostility,  
possessiveness,  and conceit  can be reference  point s for 
what  is not beautiful.  
 
But there  is beauty.  Rather  than looking  at our inner  
dispositions  and tendencies  in moralistic  terms,  what  
happens  if we look at them  from the point  of view of:  
Are they beautiful , or are they not beautiful ? 
What  is it to live in beauty,  sit in beauty,  walk in 
beauty,  stand  in beauty,  and lie down  in beauty?  
 
The idea that beauty  is an important  part of the Dharma  
is characterized  by the Buddha’s  often  repeated  saying : 
“The Dharma  is beautiful  in the beginning,  beautiful  in 
the middle,  and beautiful  in the end.”  That puts the 
Dharma  right in the context  of this idea of beauty.   
 
Often  when  people  talk about  the Dharma,  they 
associate  it with truth,  the teachings,  the natural  order  of 
things,  and even  liberation.  But there’s  a way in which  
things  like calm, concen tration,  freedom,  and truth can 
be easily  appropriated  as mine , as in, “This  is the truth.” 
And we stick to our fixed  views : 
I know  what’s  true here. 
I’m calm , and look how great  I am because  I’m 
calm .  
 I’m supposed  to be calm  or concentrated.  
 
Our practice  is so often  seen  through  the filter of self. 
The idea of beauty  doesn’t  lend itself so easily  to being  
appropriated  for self-centered  purposes.  It’s more  
difficult  to think  of inner  beauty  as mine  or as: 
I’ve attained  it. 
I’ve made  it. 
This is the right beauty.  
 
There’s  a wonderful , impersonal,  non-possessive  quality  
in the notion  of beauty.  It tends  to be independent  of our 
habits  of identity,  self-reference,  and personal  
appropriation  of thing s. 
 
The word  translated  here as ‘beauty’ or ‘beautiful ’ is 
kalyāṇa. The Dharma  is: “kalyāṇa in the beginning , 
kalyāṇa in the middle,  and kalyāṇa in the end.” Kalyāṇa 
is most  commonly  translated  as ‘good.’ The Dharma  is: 
“good  in the beginning,  good  in the middle,  and good  in 
the end.”   
 
Of course,  good  is good.  You can’t  argue  with that. I 
don’t  want  to argue  that good  is not good.  To call it 
‘good’ is good.  But I believe  that ‘good’  limits  our 
understanding . What ‘good’ means  is relatively  abstract  
and vague.  It almost  needs  to be explained  further.  
People  might  ask, “In what  way is it good?” 
  
 The word  kalyāṇa appears  in the Buddha’s teachings  
hundreds  of times.  Most  translators  translate  it as 
‘good ,’ and we see the word  ‘good’  peppered  
throughout  the early  teachings.  For me, when  I read the 
word  ‘good,’  I thought  it was nice,  but it didn’t  really  
touch  me in a deeper  way. But when I came  to realize  
that the word  kalyāṇa also mean s ‘beautiful ,’ and began  
rereading  the teachings  of the Buddha  – rather  than 
having  those  teachings  peppered  with the word  ‘good,’  
they were  peppered  with the word  ‘beautiful’  or ‘beauty.’  
And I had a whole different  feeling  for the teaching , 
because  as ‘beautiful,’  it touches  my affect.  There  is a 
different  kind of sensitivity.  As ‘beauty,’  the word  is more  
emotional , and much  richer  than a word  of the intellect.   
 
Maybe  the word  ‘good’  is not intellect ual, like the word  
‘truth’  is. Asking , “What is the Buddha’s  truth?” or “What 
is the Buddha’s  teaching ?” tend to be intellectual  
question s. But what  if we ask ourselves:   
What is the beauty  the Buddha  was pointing  to?  
What  was beautiful  for the Buddha?   
Can we participate  in that beauty?  
Can we align  ourselves  with that beauty?   
Can we live in that beauty?   
 
If you go to the Pali-English  dictionaries,  you’ll  see that 
the first definition  for the word  kalyāṇa is ‘beautiful. ’ But 
it also means  things  like ‘virtue’ and ‘virtuous, ’ ‘good’  
 and ‘goodness, ’ ‘excellent ’ and ‘excellence. ’ It has a 
richer  range  of meanings.   
 
If you go to the Sanskrit -English  dictionary,  kalyāṇa has 
an even  wider  range  of meanings.  I’d like to read that 
list: “beautiful,  agreeable,  illustrious,  noble,  generous,  
excellent,  virtuous,  good,  beneficial,  salut ary, 
auspicious,  happy,  prosperous,  fortunate,  and lucky.” 
Wow,  that’s  pretty  cool!  It’s a great  list. As in the Pali, 
‘beautiful’  is also the first definition  in the Sanskrit -
English  dictionary.  There  is something  about  ‘beautiful ’ 
that encompasses , and is very inclusive  of so much  
more.   
 
I like it because  it connects  this concept  of kalyāṇa to 
our human  sensibility  and experiences , which  are much  
more  holistic  than the abstract  ideas  of philosophy,  
metaphysics,  or even  ethics.  Beauty  is an experience  of 
perception,  affect,  and feeling  – not just intellect.  The 
word  kalyāṇa is also closely  associated  with virtue  and 
inner  goodness.  It’s not simply  a piece  of art that is 
aesthetic  and beautiful , but is related  to something  very 
personal  – something  deep  inside , which  we can 
experience.   
 
As my thinking  and reading  of these  texts  went  in the 
direction  of discovering  that the word  kalyāṇa can mean  
‘beautiful ,’ for me, this brought  to life a very different  
experience  of the Buddha’s  teachings . It gave  me an  
 appreciation  for what  happens  in meditation , and what  
happens  as we live our life in a deeply  connected  way.  
 
A year and a half ago, I found  myself  strongly  drawn  to 
the Navajo  concept  of “walking  in beauty.”  Every  time I 
heard  the expression , it excited  me. It awoke  
something . It resonated  with something  in me. Then  
finally , after letting  it percolate  in my mind  for a long 
time,  I read something  about  what  the Navajo  say about  
this idea.  To my surprise , it is at the center  of their 
religious  life. I can’t  accurately  pronounce  hózhó , the 
Navajo  word  translated  as ‘beauty ,’ although  I tried to 
listen  to a Navajo  speak  it so that I could  say it. When  
the Navajo  describ e what  it means  in English,  they have 
a whole  series  of words , includ ing: “virtue,  harmony,  the 
natural  order,  and goodness. ” Hózhó  includ es many  
words  that are really  rich. Since many  Navajo  speak  
English,  they choose ‘beautiful ’ to represent  the word  
into English.  They  also apparently  use the same  word  
as a translation  for both ‘art’ and ‘religion.’ It’s amazing  
to have  art and religion  associated  with beauty.  
 
I was excited  by this, and wondered  where  in the 
Buddha’s  teachings  one might  find a word  with such  a 
wide range  of holistic  meanings , and which  also mean s 
‘beautiful. ’ For a while , I tried out dharma ; I thought  
maybe  dharma  could  do that. It has many,  many  
meanings.  So I cast about  a little bit, and then 
discovered  that the word  kalyāṇa can mean  ‘beautiful. ’ I  
 thought,  “Wow!”  It came  alive for me. I really  came  to 
appreciate  the rich, emotional,  aesthetic,  and subjective  
associations  that come  with the word  ‘beautiful. ’  
 
Beauty  is not something  that is just objective,  like the 
truth, or the Buddha’s  teachings.  It’s not too subjective  
either , like taking it as mine . It exists  in this wonderful  
interface , which  seems  not quite  personal,  but not 
impersonal  either.  It’s something  almost  larger  or 
deeper  than self, but certainly  deeply  connected  to 
subjective  experience  – to discover,  to sit, to practice  in 
the Dharma,  and to begin  finding  what’s  beautiful  within.   
 
One of the potentials  of the Dharma  is to be able to 
discover  what’s  beautiful  outside  of us, to have  eyes  – 
the inner  eye and the physical  eye, which  are able to 
see what’s  beautiful.  Certainly  for me, over these  years  
of practice  – because  of this Dharma  practice  – I feel 
much  more  in touch  with what’s  beautiful  than I ever 
knew  growing  up. I was in touch  with beauty,  but to now 
have  this clear  word  for it in the Dharma  has made  it 
much  richer. It is something  that I can now relate  to 
more,  embody  more,  and use as a reference  or as a 
teacher  in a wonderful  way. 
 
I’d like to end by saying  that the word  ‘beautifu l’ gives  us 
a unique  and very important  orientation  to Buddhism,  
Buddhist  practice,  and mindfulness  practice.  Today  was 
meant  to be an introduction  to the Pali word  for  
 ‘beautiful.’  Hopefully  the introduction  was beautiful  
enough.  We’ll  talk more  this week  about  different  
aspects  of it as we go along.   
 
In the meantime,  if you’re  interested,  you might  spend  
part of the next 24 hours  reflecting  on your relationship  
with the word  ‘beautiful,’  on what  I’ve said,  and on the 
idea of living  in beauty.  What  would  it mean  if you could  
live in beauty?  You could  speak  with some  friends  or 
people  you respect , or whose points  of view you value . 
You could  ask them  what  they think  “living  in beauty” 
might  mean.   
 
Thank  you. Until tomo rrow.
