So, welcome to the first Monday evening talk of the year. 
And I'm going to use this as an occasion to start a series of talks. 
And the plan is for the next ten times that I'm teaching here on Monday evening to give a series of talks on an introduction to Buddhism. 
And I'm not here every Monday, so you can check the IMC calendar to see if I'm here if you want to just come for that series. 
And one of the things maybe that's prompting me to do this is that when we first moved here, and now it's been some 19 years ago, 18 years ago, 19 years ago, 19 years ago, it was the first Monday. 
In January was the first, you know, talk here. 
Before that, we were many years in Palo Alto and the church there. 
And there was a very strong desire in this Insight Meditation movement when it first came to this country to not include a lot of the Buddhism in it in order to have mindfulness be accessible to people who Buddhism would turn off. 
There are a lot of people who are interested in Buddhism. 
And so a lot of Buddhism was left out of the Insight Meditation teachings. 
And I'm very happy with that because mindfulness practice is a phenomenally effective practice that supports people in all kinds of ways. 
And the Buddhism part is kind of optional for mindfulness. 
But mindfulness is not optional for Buddhism. 
And so we're kind of content with this. 
But in these 20, 30 years that I've been teaching now, the environment for mindfulness has changed dramatically. 
Now mindfulness is everywhere because people have it on their apps. 
And the amount of mindfulness in our society is just astronomical compared to years ago when it was hard to find and it was hardly here. 
I'm not exactly at the beginning of its time in the United States but there was a time it wasn't even here, right? And now the secular mindfulness is just in the schools and believe it or not, my son in college, he's in a fraternity which is odd enough for me, my background, that that's the case. 
And there's a meditation group in his fraternity. 
Now that's not, that's a congregate, you know, cognitive disilence, I don't know to make of that given my background and what all the associations I had with these things. 
And recently I was asked to come to the local college and talk to them. 
They were really eager to get more mindfulness because they say, our students come to our college already knowing mindfulness. 
They've learned it at school, high schools or in society and everywhere. 
There's apps galore and for mindfulness. 
So what it means is that we don't have to be so careful anymore. 
Now we can be Buddhist. 
And you know, we still, I think I still think of us as kind of Buddhist light. 
We're kind of like almost, yeah, it's kind of Buddhist light. 
You know, I don't, but it does give us an opportunity or maybe, you know, is to not have to be so careful anymore. 
And what we have to offer is something different now than just mindfulness. 
We have the opportunity to offer it now much more freely in its original context of Buddhism. 
So I think that's a little bit behind this offering now and introduction to Buddhism for these 10 weeks. 
So first some more introductory words about Buddhism and then we're going to go into the world of Buddhist myth. 
An overarching way of generalization that I've heard no one else ever make. 
There are two kinds of religions in this planet. 
And what they share and what makes them religions is they have to do with teachings and practices that are of ultimate value. 
The ultimate meaning, ultimate purpose of people's lives. 
Meaning it represents the highest purpose or values that people live their lives by and the purpose in which they want to infuse or bring into everything they do. 
It's kind of like the foundation of what their life is about. 
And so whatever it is that brings that kind of ultimate value or purpose that's that pervasive in their lives, I call it religion. 
You might have a different definition, you might not want to use my definition. 
But with that definition there are two types of religion. 
Generally there's theistic religions and there's humanistic religions. 
And theistic religions, as the name says, is founded and based upon deities, divinities, gods, such things. 
And often coming with that is some relationship to a transcendent world, a transcendent reality. 
So there's a heaven, that would be a transcendent reality, something completely separate and distinct from this world here. 
And that often goes along with theistic religions and that transcendent reality of different types plays a big feature. 
And so Buddhism is in the class of some religions which are humanistic in that they're human-centered. 
And there isn't a transcendent being or divine essence that's in a different dimension of reality in a heavenly realm or some transcendent reality that's quite radically distinct from this world we have here. 
And so the humanistic religions tend to be based on values and purposes and experiences that human beings can know for themselves. 
Theistic religions are often based, and many people who participate them are based on things that generally people don't actually know for themselves but they come through books or come through teachers or tradition or something. 
There's a generalization. 
And so Buddhism is really based in the Buddhism that, certainly I teach, the Buddhism that I feel like I belong to and that Theravada Buddhism is humanistic in nature. 
But historically, over time, it has, because maybe human nature or something, it's often kind of started to evolve towards theistic directions. 
And there are forms of Buddhism that would be, I think in my definition, theistic forms of Buddhism where there are kind of supernatural beings, kind of godlike beings, where there are transcendent realms and heavens are very important and such things like that. 
And so Buddhism is not separate from that. 
There's many kinds of Buddhism. 
But the Buddhism that we teach here at IMC comes from the Buddhism of Southeast Asia, Buddhism of Thailand and Burma, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and a tradition called Theravada Buddhism. 
And Vada means like doctrine or teaching, and Thera means the elders. 
So it's the teachings of the ancients, the Buddha and his disciples. 
And this tradition makes the claim that it represents the earliest teachings of the Buddhism going right back to the historical Buddha. 
And if there's any living Buddhist tradition that can make that claim kind of responsibly or something, it's the Theravada Buddhist traditions of this tradition here. 
Most other forms of Buddhism that survived into the common era have other kind of origins in Asia and teachings and stuff like that. 
And if you go back and really dig into this earliest tradition and try to really do some text critical studies to see what was really being taught back there and what was the earliest teachings of Buddhism, the more you dig and look, the more it has a very strong humanistic quality to it. 
And really based on what people can experience and know for themselves, pointing to our own experience, pointing to ourselves being our own teacher, and pointing to something we can discover in ourselves of ultimate value, of ultimate purpose, ultimate meaning that can be so central to people's lives that it could be called a religious life. 
So in the earliest time, that's my reading of it, it's relatively humanistic, but there's a little strange thing that goes on. 
And that is that it seems like from the earliest records we have, this person that we now call the Buddha, didn't quite want to go along with being defined or being seen in the usual ways in which people identify a human being. 
He didn't quite maybe want to be identified as a plumber or as a parent or as a son or he didn't want to be identified as many things. 
In fact, if someone asked him who are you, one very famous story, he answered, I am awake. 
Well, that doesn't tell me much. 
Where were you born and who were your parents? It's like, I'm awake. 
The most common way that he referred to himself, like the name he used for himself, was this little unusual title called tatāgata. 
It's very rare that he calls himself Buddha, other people are calling him that, but he called himself the tatāgata. 
And tatāgata probably means, we don't really know what it means, it has two possible meanings. 
It means either the one, usually people say, the one who is thus gone or the one who is thus come. 
And I suspect the meaning means something more closely to something like, the one who is thus. 
So who are you? Like this. 
It doesn't give you much, right? You get what you see, this is what it does. 
In some ways it's quite refreshing to just be thus, just not have to be definition, not have to be anything for anyone, not have to prove yourself or apologize for yourself or explain yourself. 
You just show up and you don't carry any baggage with you of your identity. 
And you just, you know, I'm thus, I'm like this. 
And then we'll see where we go from there. 
So in this kind of way, also he didn't seem, he did talk about himself some, but mostly he talked about himself as an example of what he had to teach. 
It didn't seem like there's no biography of him in his lifetime, in the early life. 
He didn't kind of say, I'm going to tell you my story of my life. 
That he didn't do and he didn't want to define himself in ordinary terms, human terms. 
So was he human? And well, it's, you know, well, of course he was human, but he's kind of like a little bit amorphous, a little bit not, he's not quite there in the way we expect from a human being in terms of a definition. 
So even at the, seemingly at the earliest kind of records we have, he's kind of a little bit not quite being described or understood in ordinary human terms. 
Well, it turns out that that's also then a very nice blank slate, kind of an ink blot to fill in. 
And down through the centuries, Buddhists have filled it in. 
And there are some pretty phantasmagoric stories about the Buddha and his life and who he is. 
And you can, if you watch the development of the historical texts over time, you watch the growth of what I call the Buddhist myth. 
You're not really supposed to talk about other religions as they have myths, because, you know, myths are not supposed to be true, right? They believe them. 
But since I'm a Buddhist, I think I'm allowed to call them myths. 
That they are these amazing myths that I don't take as being literally true. 
It's just too much to believe as being true. 
But they're kind of fascinating and fascinating as myths. 
There's some people point out that myths have their own truth. 
Sometimes myths can be more true than reality because they point to underlying patterns, underlying realities, underlying processes, truths, understandings of our life that really speak to people, kind of like poetry. 
So I'm going to offer you the myth of the Buddha's life. 
We know very, very little about him as a person. 
We don't know what his name was. 
Nowadays we say his name was Siddhartha. 
But his name, Siddhartha, first appears in text 500 years after he was born. 
So it's possible that, you know, that was his name, but it appeared much later. 
There's all kinds of aspects of stories people make about the Buddha. 
Most of what I'm going to say today is not probably never happened. 
But it makes a good story, especially, and I think it's a valuable story, if you're willing to suspend disbelief enough to take it as poetry, to take it as kind of pointing to something about every person, something about you. 
And I'll give you at least one example as I go along of how I do this around the Buddha's birth, when I teach children. 
So, once upon a time, far, far away, there was in India, northern India, there was a king and a queen. 
We don't know that the Buddha's parents were kings and queens. 
But they gave birth to the Buddha as a prince. 
There's no, much later, this is like hundreds, hundreds of years later, this came up, this kind of idea. 
So I'm going to stop making this caveat, so these footnotes, footnotes, just to give you an example. 
So once upon a time there were these kings and king and queen. 
And at some point, the queen was pregnant to give birth. 
And she then, as apparently was accustomed, was going to give birth in her own home country. 
So she left where she was living with the king and was walking back home to her country. 
And on the way, the contractions began, or something, she knew she was going to give birth. 
And so halfway between the countries, under a tree, she stood standing, lifted one hand up to hold the branch. 
And the Buddha was born out of her side, because that's what is pure, or something. 
And early Caesarean. 
And the Buddha popped out. 
And the first thing he did was he took seven steps. 
That's pretty precocious. 
He took seven steps. 
And then he pointed one finger to the sky and one finger to the earth. 
And he said, heaven above, earth below, I am the world-honored one. 
So that's pretty good for a newborn. 
Oh, and then as he walked the seven steps, he didn't actually touch the ground. 
Deities came and put their hands, or lotus petals, or something underneath his feet, and held him up so he didn't have to touch the ground. 
So I'll tell this story to kids. 
And I say, that's strange. 
Someone would say that about themselves. 
I'm the best in the world. 
However, the way we can understand this story, and I go around to each kid and I say, you're the most wonderful person in the world. 
You're the most wonderful. 
You're the most wonderful. 
You're the best. 
You're around all the kids like that. 
And they said, there's some way in which everyone is the best. 
Everyone is the most world-honored one. 
And that's my interpretation of the story. 
Everyone comes to realize that they're unique and special and important and valuable. 
And that the whole enterprise of Buddhism is to inhabit that so thoroughly that you end up having no conceit whatsoever. 
Isn't that great? So the idea of conceit and being defined that way, you want to be free of that. 
So you start with that kind of as underlying basic foundation. 
So that's my interpretation of that story. 
So then he was raised by the king and the queen. 
And soon after his birth, there came a sage, a tis I think his name is, came to see the baby. 
And he looked at the baby and looked at his signs, looked at, you know, could read signs on the body or something. 
And the sage said, lo and behold, this is a phenomenal person. 
This person will grow up either to be a world-ruling monarch, rule the whole world, or a great sage, a Buddha. 
Well, the father didn't think much of this religious life for his son. 
He was his first son. 
The idea of being following the footsteps of the father and taking over the kingdom and becoming a world-renowned monarch. 
That was the way to go. 
So the father then built all these palaces, three palaces apparently, to raise his son. 
And one for each season, three seasons they had, and this is now in the foothills of the Himalayas. 
And built these palaces in order to protect his son so his son would not see any human suffering. 
Because if he was afraid, if he saw human suffering, really saw the human condition, that then he would go the religious route. 
But he wanted to make sure he went the king route. 
So he made sure that he was living in a gated community. 
He made sure that he went to private schools and had all the luxuries of his life and probably lived in Woodside. 
So that's an interesting way to be raised. 
And at some point, as a young man, I think it was, you know, so he was married probably as a custom of his time when he was late teens. 
And he was married for a good number of years because it says that this happened probably around the time he was 29. 
He got kind of curious about what's outside the palace walls. 
And so he had a charioteer, his charioteer to kind of get the horses ready and the chariots ready. 
And somehow was able to get out, sneak out of the palace and went riding around to see part of the world. 
And lo and behold, he saw something he'd never seen before. 
He saw an old person and he asked his charioteer, what's that? And the charioteer said, that is an old person. 
It's the nature of all people to become old. 
Wow. 
So then they went back home. 
The next night or the next day they snuck out again. 
And this time they saw a sick person, probably really sick. 
The Buddha said, what's that? That's a sick person. 
It's the nature of all beings to be sick. 
Wow. 
He had no idea. 
He was so protected. 
And so then the next day they went out and they said, what is that? That's a dead person. 
And coincidentally, the first time I ever saw a dead person was not far from where the Buddha saw it in the myth. 
It was in Kathmandu when I was 11. 
And they were carrying a body down to the river to be burned. 
So maybe you saw something similar. 
And the charioteer said, that's a dead person. 
It's the nature of all people to die. 
The fourth day the Buddha went out. 
They saw a renunciant, someone who had contemplative, who had devoted himself to the spiritual life, religious life. 
And he was walking down the street in a very different way than the Buddha had ever seen anybody walk. 
Calmly and self-possessed with kind of clarity and presence and simplicity and conducting himself very different than most people. 
Not looking at the billboards and the advertisements and ogling people. 
And so the Buddha said, what is that? That's a renunciant. 
That's a contemplative. 
So these four sites are called the Four Heavenly Messengers. 
And these are the messengers that came to the Buddha to show him what this human condition is like, that he'd been protected from. 
And I think it's not uncommon for people, whether it's consciously done or unconscious, to be protected from a lot of what goes on in this human life. 
To not really see the degree of suffering that exists in this world and the challenges of the world that people have. 
But even what we all share, if we're lucky enough we get old, we'll be sick someday, we're going to die. 
And for the Buddha this became an existential crisis. 
This became something that, you can imagine, someone already fully grown to see this for the first time. 
What's going on here? I have no idea. 
This made a huge impact. 
So much so that the palace life now seemed uninteresting for him. 
He felt like, now I have to get to the bottom of this. 
I have to kind of see what's going on here, I have to understand this. 
I have to find what's beyond this or the freedom or the awakening or something that has greater value or find something here. 
So then the next night the Buddha snuck out again and had his chariot there take him to the edges of the country. 
And then when he was going to cross the river, he took his sword and he cut off his beautiful long hair and took all his royal jewels off and his nice clothes off, gave him his charioteer and then went forth into the world. 
And that's called the great renunciation, renouncing the palace life. 
And many of the people know that the Buddha also, as the way the Smith goes, that same day his wife gave birth to his only son. 
And in spite of just having a newborn baby, he left. 
And that's pretty shocking in modern terms. 
In the ancient world, some people say that as the male of the household, the royal household, he had fulfilled his duty. 
The most important role he had was to make sure there was an heir to the throne. 
And so once he had a son, he was free to do this, go off and discover something. 
And I think in some ways that's pretty dramatic what he did. 
But remember that there were no schools, universities, there were no IMCs down the street. 
There was so little that was available for someone who really wanted to understand this world, understand spirituality. 
There wasn't a therapist you can go see down the street either. 
There was nothing. 
And so what there was, the only thing that was available for people with that kind of inquiring spirit, that kind of existential need, was to go forth, leave the regular lay life and be renunciant, be an ascetic, be a contemplative and live that life. 
So then he went off. 
And the first thing he did was he went and found the meditation teachers of his time. 
And those teachers taught them how to go into very deep states of trance. 
And he became the best students of his teachers, he became equals to them in the ability to go into deep meditation trances. 
And he realized that now that he had mastered his teachers' teachings, this didn't really address the existential issues that he was concerned with. 
And so he left them. 
The other option that was available at his time was ascetic practices, starving oneself and eating just one rice kernel a day, and having no clothes, sleeping outdoors all the time, and just severe asceticism. 
One of them was holding one's breath until one fainted almost. 
And there are gruesome stories of these myths that got formed around the Buddha. 
He always had to be the person who was best at everything, because that's what makes him, that's good publicity for getting new adherents. 
And so he did asceticism more than anyone else had done, to the point where he collapsed. 
And I think on the edge of a river, and laid there as if dead. 
And the people who saw him laying there thought, oh, this person is dead. 
But somehow he revived himself enough, and he thought, you know, I've now done asceticism better than anyone. 
Right up to the edge of dying, this is not providing the answer either. 
Dying is not going to provide the answer. 
So then he decided to start eating. 
When he started eating to get some energy, he had some companions who were also ascetics, who then saw that he had, you know, now he was indulging, now he was giving up the asceticism. 
So they were kind of upset with him, so they left, and he was left alone. 
And then he went to looking for a place to sit, and he found this tree that's called the Bodhi tree. 
And nowadays it's a ficus tree. 
And it was a beautiful place, not far from a river. 
And he sat there, and he's wondering what to do. 
And what's next? And he'd done the different things that the religious people of his time had offered, and it didn't work. 
And then he remembered a story, remembered an event in his life. 
I think the myth says it happened when he was seven. 
And which his father was doing the first ceremonial plowing of the spring. 
And so his father entourage us out in the fields plowing. 
And the seven-year-old was left under a rose-apple tree at the edge of the fields. 
And it was probably a comfortable spring day, nice weather, a feeling of safety, of contentment, just watching some activity in the fields, maybe. 
And in that sitting upright, just sitting there and not doing anything, not being anything, not trying to accomplish anything. 
Just kind of sitting there in a very easy, relaxed way. 
His mind got settled, relaxed, collected, unified. 
And he entered into the first of the deep jhana meditations, into a state of great ease, peace, well-being. 
And as an adult, he remembered that. 
He said, that well-being I had, that sense of well-being and peace and joy that I felt in that meditation state as a seven-year-old, that is the path to liberation. 
Because that doesn't depend on anything in the world. 
It's the experience of well-being that's free, from preoccupy, free of being caught up in sensual desire and hatred and fear and all the kind of things that people get caught up in. 
I was really free of all those things. 
And the well-being I had kind of had a feeling of freedom in it, because it just welled up from inside, not dependent on anything. 
He said, that's the path. 
And so then he continued that evening and through the night, doing this, that line of meditation. 
It's not a trance where you kind of go into some formless realm and really disconnect from the world. 
But it's a deep state of meditation that is very much connected to oneself, connected to this world, connected to the body. 
But where there's deeper and deeper states of stillness, of freedom of the mind from its preoccupations, freedom from it being caught up in thoughts and ideas, identity, desires of all kinds. 
And the mind, in a sense, kind of can settle on itself and come home to itself. 
It's no longer fragmented and caught up with all these things. 
It's a remarkable experience to be able to settle so deeply that we're not in conflict or preoccupied or chasing everything with our minds. 
And then he was in the brink of awakening, of liberation. 
But there happens to be this semi. 
. 
. 
Well, it's kind of a deity, but not. 
. 
. 
Most deities are good, but this one was the bad ones. 
And this deity is called Mara. 
And Mara's job description is to prevent people from getting enlightened and to keep people immersed in the world of sensual pleasures and sensual pursuits. 
And Mara saw, finally, someone's going to leave my realm. 
Someone's going to leave the world of sensual pursuits and become free. 
So we have to stop this. 
So Mara came with his army, huge battalions of people, and started to try to frighten the Buddha from getting enlightened. 
And through spears and arrows and flashing swords and axes, you name it, they threw at the Buddha. 
And the Buddha just sat under the tree meditating and did nothing. 
And every arrow and spear and axe that was thrown turned into flowers and fell on the ground around him. 
So then Mara said, OK, this is not working. 
Let's try something else. 
So Mara got his daughters. 
Apparently Mara had some really gorgeous daughters who, I guess, had been trained for this purpose, maybe, to try to somehow do what, I'm not going to say what, but try to present themselves in such a way that he would be more interested in them than his pursuit for enlightenment. 
And they did what they do, what they did, and probably a little bit x-rated. 
But the Buddha sat peacefully, didn't take the bait. 
So then Mara came with his biggest weapon. 
He came up to the Buddha himself and he said, What right do you have to become enlightened? Now, not a few people have a lot of doubt about themselves. 
They feel they're unworthy. 
They feel I can't do it. 
I'm not deserving. 
All kinds of things for many things in life. 
But when it comes to something as powerful as spiritual liberation, it can rare its head pretty strongly. 
What right do you have to do this? And so in reply, this time the Buddha responded. 
And this time he took his hand, like the statue here. 
The statue here is the picture of what the Buddha did when Mara came. 
Buddha sitting, meditating, and the Buddha takes his right hand and pulls it over his knee and touches the earth. 
And he says, I call upon the earth as my witness to become enlightened, my witness to my right to become enlightened. 
And when he touched the earth, there was an earthquake that attested to his worthiness to be enlightened. 
And that frightened Mara away. 
And Mara ran away and then the Buddha continued to meditate. 
And then in the early morning as the sun was rising, there was a deep transformation. 
He had a deep insight, a deep understanding of reality so that he was able to let go in a very deep way. 
And that letting go was his awakening, his enlightenment. 
And then he went off to teach. 
And he had a career teaching that lasted over 40 years. 
And now for in ancient India, he got to be about 80 or 81 years old, which is fairly old for that time, I guess. 
And he had his challenges as a teacher, nothing too big. 
But then at some point when he was about 80 years old, it was time for him to die. 
And he, at that time, he was walking back to his home country. 
Makes some sense, maybe you want to die in your home country and he was walking back. 
But he didn't make it. 
At some point he got sick. 
And he actually got very sick twice on that trip. 
The first time he was in tremendous amount of pain. 
And I said the only way he could get some relief from his pain was in deep meditation. 
Those deep trances that he'd been taught when he was young, he then used them in order to kind of cope with the deep pain he had. 
When he got better, then he continued on his walk. 
And then after eating something, and we don't know what he ate, the original language, the food that he ate is called pig's delight. 
And some people think maybe it ate some pork that was bad. 
Some people think it's maybe pig's delight, it's mushrooms that wild pigs like to eat. 
No one knows what it is. 
But he was offered it by someone, and he was offered to have that meal. 
He said, I'm the only one who can eat this. 
Don't give it to anyone else. 
But I'll eat my portion and bury it, otherwise it's not going to work for other people. 
So he ate it, and then he got sick. 
So he walked a little bit further, and then he felt he was going to die. 
So he laid himself down under two trees. 
And under those two trees, he then for a couple of days or a day or something, just was available for the villagers, the people around, his disciples to come and visit him. 
And he gave his last teachings. 
One of the last things he said to his disciples was, do you have any questions? Any questions left over? And they said, no. 
They didn't say anything, and he asked like three times, I think. 
And you may be out of respect for me being sick and dying. 
You don't want to ask me. 
But please ask. 
And no one said anything. 
He said, okay. 
And then he said, when the last thing he said was something like, all things are impermanent, practice hard, strive with diligence. 
And then he closed his eyes, and he went into the deep meditation states that he knew. 
He kind of did a last tour through these deep meditation states. 
There's eight of them, and he went kind of through them systematically. 
And when he was in the deepest one, someone asked one of the monks, is he dead? And the monk, who was also a deep meditator, knew that he was, the Buddha was not dead. 
He was in this deep state of meditation. 
And then the Buddha started coming back from his, going through the deepest place, to what's called the middle one, the fourth, what's called the fourth absorption. 
And in that deep, blissful, peaceful, very peaceful state of meditation, he let go. 
And conventionally he died. 
He passed away. 
And that's the myth. 
And it's a myth of someone who discovered how to be at peace, so that when it was time for him to die, he could die peacefully. 
He was no fear, no distress. 
He had done what he had to do. 
He felt complete. 
He had passed his teaching on. 
He'd asked them, do you have any more questions? And they said no. 
And to have that ability to die with that ease and peace is quite a phenomenal thing. 
It's quite phenomenal to have, even if none of these stories are true, it's quite phenomenal for this person to have set in motion a religious tradition that continues right to today. 
And this myth is maybe the myth of every person. 
The myth that somehow or other we are protected. 
Somehow or other we don't really understand what's really going on here for us in our lives. 
We don't really understand why we suffer. 
Some of us don't really face our existential issues of our lives. 
Some people do. 
And that in order to really face them, we have to turn towards them, sit with them, and then in deep insight, deep ability to sit and really look honestly at what this life is about, we ourselves can find something called awakening. 
We ourselves can find a level of peace, resolution of this existential issues of our lives. 
So that not that we're in a hurry to die, but when it's time to die, that we've had a very full, very meaningful, very purposeful life. 
We've touched into something very true about human life that gives us a degree of peacefulness, freedom, love, and compassion for this world. 
That is what Buddhists have been pursuing or practicing for ever since. 
So that's the myth and the Buddhism that has headed off into this theistic religion. 
When we come back next time, I won't be here next week. 
The next time I pick up this series, then I'll offer you much more of my interpretation of this humanistic Buddhism. 
Very much based on some of the existing earliest texts rather than from the myths. 
So you'll get a very different flavor of what this Buddhism can be. 
But I was hoping I could tell this story as a good storyteller and tell it in a way that's inspiring as myth or as poetry. 
So I don't know how well I did, but.

So go out and look for your heavenly messengers and then come back and we'll pick up the story from another way. 
Thank you.
