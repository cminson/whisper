Dharmette : Non-Clinging  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by

In mindfulness practice, Buddhist practice, 
there’s one quality, one approach – a single one  
– that is at the heart of it all, or the sweetener of 
it all, or the protector of it all, or the essence of it 
all, the guide for it all. It’s such an important part 
of this practice , and that’s the quality of non -
clinging – to always remember not clinging to 
things. S o in bein g mindful – whatever is going 
on – independent  of what has to happen  or not 
happen, can I find the place of not clinging to 
what’s happening, or not clinging to my ide as of 
what’s supposed to happen  or not happen?  
 
Clinging, I propose, is always extra. Clinging is 
not required in any situation at all. There are  
many things in our world that we have to take 
care of , and it’s possible to take care of them 
respo nsibly without clinging. There are  many 
things that we have to think about , and it’s 
possible to think about th em without clinging. It’s 
possible to live a very responsible life without clinging.  
 
I don’t think it’s very often that clinging  helps. 
Sometimes it  helps if you’re  at the edge of Half 
Dome, looking over  the edge and there’s a 
railing – you might want to  cling to the edge of 
the railing. That might help in a strong wind. But 
in terms of the inner life, clinging messes things 
up. Clinging is extra. It’s a lot of extra effort, a lot 
of energy. T o learn to develop confidence in the 
mind’s, the heart’s , capac ity to live a responsible 
life without clinging  is one of the great 
confidence s to discover in this  practice.  
 
So, the practice is to say, “Where am I clinging 
here?”  – and to see it as being extra; to look at 
the arguments that you have in your mind. B ut 
why do you feel it necessary to cling? Some 
people defend their clinging. : it’s very i mportant. 
Some people feel that they would rather not 
cling. They  don’t feel that it needs to be 
defended , but sometimes they don’t see their 
clinging, and don’t know how  to let go of their 
clinging. That’s probably why w e practice . It’s 
because it’s not so easy to let go of it.   
 
But to remember that non -clinging is a reference 
point. In practice, where’s the non -clinging in this situation? It might be that the non-clinging is to 
be found  not in letting  go of what you’re holding 
onto. S o say that I’m meditating, and I’m holding 
onto an idea that I’m supposed to be 
concentrated. Everyone else sitting here is 
completely concentrated;  I’m the on ly one who is 
not con centrated.  I’m supposed to be 
concentrated, and I’m clinging to that. And then 
maybe the non -clinging can be  found in being 
relaxed about h aving that tendency f or that 
clinging – not to be upset w ith yourself for 
clinging about not having  a concentrated  mind. 
 
So ra ther than asking the question, “H ow can I 
not cling to what I’m clinging to? ” it might be a 
good place to begin by asking, “Where’s the 
non-clinging in this experience that I’m having? ”  
 
Because it’s not 100% clinging;  it’s not the only 
thing yo u’re doing. Can you take this situation 
and hold it with more graciousness, more 
spaciousness? Can you relate to it , and find out  
what would it look like i f I didn’t tighten up 
around it; if I didn’t contract around it; i f I didn’t 
resist it so much? – all versions of clinging.  
 
For example, one of the very important things for 
Buddhist practitioners to not cling to is Buddhism. And there’s plenty of clinging t owards 
Buddhism: Buddhist ideas;  I’m supposed to be a 
certain way;  I’m supposed to attain these  things; 
I want t o; I have to  cling to beliefs. S ome people 
cling to identities around being a Buddhist. 
Buddhism is meant to be the antidote to clinging, 
not the reason to cling more. So how do we hold 
Buddhism so that we don’t cling to Buddhism or 
to our selves as a Buddhist practitioner?  
 
How do we experience whatever we’re 
experiencing and not cling to an identity around 
it? How do we not cling to the ideas we have 
about what’s happening? How do we not cling to 
our preferences? And part of this requires  us to 
really understand, the best we can, when we’re 
clinging. And that’s not always so easy because 
some people confuse  discomfort with clinging. 
Some people think whenever they’re 
uncomforta ble, this must mean that they’re  
clinging to something. Or some  people think the 
opposite, “ I’m not cl inging;  I’m just 
uncomfortable.”   
 
But to be able to get very familiar with that 
movement of the  mind with compulsion. C linging 
has a quality of compulsion,  of being driven. 
When you cling , or you have c ompulsion or  drivenness, you can’t let go of something very 
easily. I t stays stuck in the churning, the 
thinking, the activity of the mind.  
 
One of the opposites to clinging is the absence 
of conflict  – to experience something and not be 
in conflict with it. And that al so doesn’t mean we 
don’t change it. But conflict means that in the 
inner life, our awareness doesn’t contract 
around confli ct; the heart is not contracted or in 
conflict with what’s going on.  
 
Our wisdo m might say, “I need to say ‘No’ to 
this,”  but the awareness , the heart , doesn’t close 
down to what’s going on. And so, one of the art s 
of practice, which takes  a while to learn, is how 
to stay relaxed, how to stay non -clinging, without 
some inner sense of being in conflict wit h what’s 
going on – and at the same time, do the real 
world things that need to be done , and say, “ No 
not that. I can’t do th at,” or “This is what has to 
happen.”  It’s not one or the other, or you just 
become a pushover, “ I’m not going to cling to 
anything;  I’ll just sit her e, and be Mr . Natural , 
and everything is fine.”  
 
In a sense , everything is fine for the heart . But 
for our evaluation, our consideration, our empathy for the world, there are things that are 
not okay . And so how to engage in responsibly 
taking care of thi ngs without clinging, without 
contracting, without the awar eness being in 
conflict with it? T his is where, for me , the idea 
that it’s meaningful that everything that occurs, 
occurs within the field, within the bubble of 
awareness. Our awareness i s like an optical 
illusion . None of our experiences happen 
outside of our experiencing it, right? We 
experie nce something because we see it; we 
smell it; we taste it; we touch it;  we hear it ; and 
the mind cognizes it . And so everything is 
mediated thro ugh our sense experiences.  
 
The gesta lt of all that, which we often call 
‘awareness, ’ is the awareness of what’s going 
on. Our awareness right now extends to the 
boundaries of this room – our direct, immediate 
awareness. So are you in this room , or is the 
room in you?  Are all these good people here  – 
are they outside of you or inside of you? Of 
course, they’re outside of you physically , but 
they’re inside this wonderful bubble of 
awareness. A nd so one of the aspects of non -
clinging, or one of the ways to get a taste of it, is 
to realiz e that awareness doesn’t have to  be in 
conflict with anything. I t can hold everything within it. It’s very accepting or embracing . It’s 
inclusive, and allows everything to be within it.  
 
When there’s clinging, then we tend to make 
divisio ns, and there’s that which we cling to and 
that which we don’t cling to. There’s a kind of 
narrowing of the  world. So in Zen  they talk about 
the big mind – the big mind within which  
everything occurs. In t hat field of perceptual 
awareness  – which  in a way is an optical illusion  
– everything  happens within. To stay close to 
that and feel it is one way of getti ng a sense of 
this world of non -clinging. And wi thin that field  of 
intimacy, of connectedness, we then step 
forward and take care of what needs to happ en.  
 
So here at IMC, on Wednesdays at tw elve 
o’clock, one of the things  we take care of is we 
clean. We don’t accept;  we don’t just allow dust 
to build up, the windows to get dirty , and the 
trash to overflow  – we take care of these things. 
But hopefully w e take care of these things 
without clinging to any of it. Hopefully, we can 
both take care of things  and be relaxed. We can 
care about things and not care at the same time. 
That’s what we’ll try to do.
