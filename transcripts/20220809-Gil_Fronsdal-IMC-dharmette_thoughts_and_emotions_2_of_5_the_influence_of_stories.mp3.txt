So continuing this week's topic of the relationship between emotions and thinking, thinking and emotions. 
And one of the ways that sometimes we live is we tell the story of our day to a friend that we might see. 
And imagine that the friend sees you and says, tell me how was it at work today? And maybe, you know, maybe not for you, but just imagine your ideas. 
Someone says, someone says, tell me how it was at work today, but tell me about the challenges you had with your boss. 
And, oh, that boss of mine, oh, that boss is always so demanding and so angry, and I can never do enough. 
I can never do it right. 
And there's so much disrespectful and, and, and I have some ideas and the boss takes the ideas and makes it their own and, you know, and I don't get any credit and, and I'm delegated to the back room. 
And so as we tell this story, there's more anger, there's more depression or despair, like, oh, this is terrible. 
But then imagine that the friend said, tell me about your day at work. 
What did you learn about patience today? How'd you learn to be, how did your ability to be patient improve today? And then you might say, oh, well, I have a difficult boss. 
But so many times during the day when the boss was demanding or did something, I was able to breathe deeply and just relax, not buy into my attention and my anger. 
And I'd be able to stay calm with it all. 
And I was able to manage the situation so much wiser with a calm. 
And I had much more patience. 
And then when I was working with a colleague who was really slow in doing the tasks I needed a colleague to do, I found myself more patient. 
And that was really good because later I found out that my colleague was dealing with the big, really big personal issue someone in their family had died recently. 
And I was so glad I was able to be patient. 
So that's a different story. 
And the emotions of telling that story would probably be very different than the first one. 
If the person said to you for your day to how was your day? And can you tell me, I'd love to hear a little bit about what what brought you joy today and delight. 
Oh, yes, it was so nice that, you know, to watch some of my colleagues work together and collaborate. 
And they were so creative and so supportive each other and so kind. 
And we don't do that much at my job. 
And but to watch it across the room and and see how respectful they were of each other. 
That was like a highlight of my day. 
And I got a reminder it's possible to be this way with each other. 
So what I'm trying to convey here is that we can tell the same story more or less with different themes, different purposes, different things that we emphasize. 
And depending what we emphasize, we'll have a different emotional response to it. 
The tone of voice, the body language, everything, the feelings inside the emotions that come, depending on what we emphasize. 
And what happens to many of us human beings is that we're telling stories a lot. 
And but we don't, we're not so conscious of the choice we've made for what we're emphasizing in the story. 
Some people are emphasizing how everything is wrong. 
And a lot of their stories have to do with complaining. 
Some people are emphasizing how how everything impacted me. 
And you know, I'm the victim to everything. 
And it's so hard. 
Some people are telling the story from the point of view of a lack. 
There's not enough here. 
I mean it's an infinite number of ways of stories of a day, a situation can be told. 
And if we tell the same story over and over again, or the same, always the same focal point that we're emphasizing in each story, then we're going to reinforce the inner emotional life, the inner disposition that we have. 
And we might not be aware of how much conditioning, influence the stories have on who we are and how we are. 
And these are stories we tell, say out loud to our friends and people, and stories we tell ourselves. 
And often, especially when we tell them ourselves, but often we're kind of living the story or the stories are an expression of our emotional life and what we think is important or how we're feeling at any time. 
So if we're angry, if there's a version, then a lot of the stories can be aversive stories. 
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? If we're hurt, if we have a deep sadness or hurt, it might still be angry. 
Because we're kind of recoiling from the hurt and we want someone to blame. 
And so we're looking at the stories a lot of blame. 
I'm a victim stories. 
And someone has been perpetuating, you know, has done bad to me. 
And so some of these stories have aspects of truth to them. 
And that makes it more complicated because then we think that, well, it's true. 
And so then it's, I'm justified in telling the story the way it is. 
But truth is varied. 
You know, truth is thematic. 
How we tell one story depends on the angle we take on it. 
So if we tell the story from the point of view of, what did I learn today versus how was I hurt today? We'll tell the story differently. 
They're both kind of true. 
But which is better for you? Which has a better influence on you? If you tell the story of how you were kind today, that's a different story than if you go home and tell a story. 
Oh, I was mean today. 
And I'm always mean. 
And I can never not be mean. 
And this is hopeless for me. 
But if you tell the story how I was kind today, then maybe you'll notice, oh, yeah, there was a moment today where I opened the door for someone. 
I guess I'm not always mean. 
So to tell, to be sensitive that we're biased, we tell our stories in biased ways and select, we select how to tell our stories. 
And when we ruminate, we ruminate when we tell the same story over and over again, or use the same bias to tell the story, the same angle to tell it, it can reinforce our inner life and reinforce our dispositions, our emotional life and how we feel and what we do. 
It's hard to change the ocean liner, make it go a different way. 
But it is possible to start recognizing what is actually happening. 
And one of the ways to begin that is to start becoming skilled at recognizing, oh, that's the story. 
That's telling a story. 
There's a story. 
You can do that in meditation. 
But you can do that in daily life as you're going about. 
You can do stories in your, you know, see, notice your thinking, your story making. 
Notice how much it's happening. 
Once you notice how much it's happening, then spend some time investigating your stories. 
Some of you might actually write them down in a journal, tell the story in a journal, and then see it in paper, and then look at what is the angle that I'm using to tell the story. 
What is it, what kind of self am I in this story? Am I a self that has agency? Or am I a self who is a victim? Am I a self that has rights and needs a demand for my rights? Or am I a self who has, you know, has a sense of confidence? I mean, I'm just making things up and I don't want to imply anything here. 
But, you know, look and see the themes, what, what, what, well, how your stories tend to go. 
And consider not to make a Pollyanna story, but consider are there realistic alternative perspectives to look at the same thing. 
Perspectives that doesn't deny there's been difficulty, but perspectives that you become a better person, supports you, helps you become more free, more kind, helps you become wiser, helps you engage in this situation in a way that's better for everyone. 
And so one perspective that I like for stories, if you're trying to problem-solve and figure out what's happening or something, is ask the question, what is best here for everyone involved, as opposed to what's best for me, what's best for that person, what's best for everyone involved. 
And, and then maybe that story will help living a life that supports everyone, self included. 
So, so stories, they're a very important part of human life. 
Sometimes I think that we shouldn't be called Homo sapiens, we should be called Homo historians, because probably stories are such a powerful characteristic of human life. 
Maybe animals tell stories, but the creativity and the ways we can do it disassociated from reality. 
And the impact stories have on our inspiration, our faith, our confidence, our lack of all these things, and our sense of purpose and meaning is huge. 
It's huge, these things. 
And so to become wise about stories, and in meditation, to the degree to which you become really quiet and still, with thinking very still and quiet, one of the values of that is to help us see, with greater clarity, the stories that we live by. 
And when we see them, let us become wise about that part of our life, so that we are not unduly, our emotional and inner life is not unduly and unhelpfully influenced by the stories we tell. 
So thank you. 
And I hope that today is an interesting day, looking at your stories. 
And if you have someone to have a conversation with, stranger or friend or someone, you might have a conversation about what the role stories have for you, stories have in your life. 
You can become wiser about this whole topic of the storytelling mind. 
Thank you.
