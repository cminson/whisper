Practice Note: Gliding into 
Concentration

Concentration is a partner to mindfulness 
practice  – they work well together . Cultivating 
concentration is very useful. Concentration 
overcomes a distracted mind , and allows the 
mind to stay focused and present .  
 
One of the common focal points for 
concentration and mindfulness is breathing : 
breath ing in, breath ing out, and try ing to hang in 
there for several breaths in a row. Then we try to 
extend being  in touch  with the breath  for longer 
and longer.   
 
The word ‘touch ’ is very important . Some people 
try to approach concentration as a mental 
activity  – as if you were up in a contro l tower , 
with the gaze of the inner eye looking d own to 
keep the breathing in focus . But to be in touch 
means being more intimate  – being in contact 
with the bodily experien ce of breathing. The experience might be of the air moving in the 
nostrils , through  the chest , or in the belly. You 
are in touch, in contact. It is as if you are feeling 
the breathing within the experience itself – as 
opposed to being removed from it, and watching 
it.  
 
Some people , when they  try to get concentrated, 
do so by holding the mind ’s attention. But when 
you hold something in a fixed way, it tends to 
make the mind tight  or brittle . It doesn’t help it 
become softer , or more focused in a nice way. 
It’s like riding a bicycle , and holdin g yourself  rod 
still – you aren’t going to go far. Or imagine 
riding a surfboard and not moving , but just 
standing there holding yourself. That doesn’t 
work , because as the wave changes, you need  
to shift your weight, and move with t he waves in 
a fluid way . Movement and fluidity help with  
stability.  
 
So rather than holding the attention on the 
breath , or on the feet during  walking mediation, 
an interesting approach is to slide onto the 
breath. When you are on a slide, you are in 
touch with the slide the whole time. Especially 
as you breathe out, imagine not that you are 
holding the attention there , but that you are sliding along on the changing experience. Or 
gliding on it. Or riding on it as on  a surfboard. Or 
flying on it with your wings spread . You’re 
catching and riding the updraft. You don’t expect 
to glide or slide forever , but you slide for as long 
as you can  catch the ride.  
 
Then you glide on the breath again. It might be 
easier for the mind to soften  and relax  if you can 
glide into the breath in this way – rather than 
fixating or holding the mind there for many 
breaths in a row .  
 
You are willing for the mind to wander off for a 
moment , but then you get back on and go for the 
next ride. Slowly try to extend how long the ride 
goes , so that the ride is not just one breath , but 
two or three  – like catching updrafts over and 
over again.  There is the rhythm of breathing in 
and out. There are changes in the sensations . 
And you are riding those changes, being fluid  – 
catching this one, and then that one . You ride it, 
glide on it, and you’re in touch.  
 
The same is true with walking meditation. You 
kind of catch the sensation of the foot stepping , 
and you ride and glide with it, rather than holding 
it.  
If this makes sense to you, gives you a different 
perspective, or helps you understand a little 
differently , that’s fine. T hen you might try doing it 
to help you  get more focused and connected. 
Don’t worry i f it doesn’t make se nse to you  – it is 
just a peculiar metaphor that I am using for 
focusing. If it doesn’t work, please don’t feel 
burdened by it.   
 
But if it does work, and you’re riding the breath  – 
especially on the out -breath , or as you put your 
foot down  when you’re ste pping  – see if part of 
that ride can be letting go.  When you go down 
the slide,  you let go of everything. So let go , 
especially as you ride  the end of the out -breath . 
And see if you can let go of your thoughts , and  
let go  of any tension  in the body . Your riding – 
and the mind – get softer and softer, quieter and 
quieter. Over time , perhaps  it will be possible to 
connect together a whole series of in -breaths 
and out -breaths.  Just stay there  – that’s what 
you do.
