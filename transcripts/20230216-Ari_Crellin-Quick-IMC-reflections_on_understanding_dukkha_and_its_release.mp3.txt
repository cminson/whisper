 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. The Buddha, in his inquiry into the human condition and into the nature of stress and dissatisfaction and suffering, and in his seeking a way to actually come to the end of this stress, this dissatisfaction, this dis-ease that we habitually find ourselves in, he arrived at an understanding of how the mind works and one of the things that he, one of the ways that he described the human condition and how we tend to find ourselves seeking happiness is he used the image of being swept up, swept away in the stream of craving. This forward momentum of craving, of seeking happiness through attaining pleasant experiences, through getting that which holds some promise in our minds to finally give us a sense of rest, of satisfaction, of happiness, he called this way of being in life and being in the world samsara, which means something like wandering on, this endless wandering, always seeking and never finding. We're never finding because the seeking, this grasping of trying to find, trying to arrange the conditions of the world and of our lives in a way that will be stable, where we can finally build a home, is actually out of alignment with the nature of our experience, with the nature of the world. We're trying to grasp at that which is actually inherently ungraspable and cannot be grasped. One of the central teachings is that of the three marks, or the three characteristics the Buddha described, that the experiences of our lives and all the conditions in the world are characterized by impermanence. Their nature is that they're ephemeral, they're inconstant, they're constantly coming and going, and that they're not within our control, they're not ultimately governable by our wishes or our will, and therefore they're unable to be a source of lasting satisfaction. You can't grasp at and hold on to that which is uncontrollable and constantly changing and passing away. Yet we tend to seek happiness through trying to control the conditions of our lives, the conditions of the world. This craving keeps us tumbling forward, this restless craving and agitation, as it's never really stopping, never really, even when we arrive at something and get somewhere where the craving has promised that, oh, when we finally get that thing, whether it's that way people see you, that way you see yourself, that relationship, that job, that house, that money, whatever it is, that state of the body, that the nature of craving is that it's actually endless. The story that it spins, that when we finally get what's being craved, that we'll have satisfaction and ease in a way that is actually lasting, that's part of the delusion of craving, that's inherent in the delusion of craving, is not quite getting how quickly things are changing. Even when we taste peace for a moment we may find ourselves wanting the next thing, what's next? How long are we actually satisfied? We tend to be enchanted, enchanted by the story that craving tells. And so craving, when the mind is under the influence of craving, could say, the mind creates a world that feels inherently lacking, that feels inherently incomplete. But when the mind is gripped by craving, there's an immediate separation between what's here now and the possibility of enoughness or contentment or peace or happiness. This is just part of the nature of craving. It's actually not the fact that we are not able to get all that we want that's causing the stress. It's the craving itself that's causing the stress. This is what the Buddha understood. But when we do see craving arise, it's actually a really valuable thing to be seeing and understanding, not something to try to, oh yeah, craving is bad, try to suppress or get rid of it. But the craving and the stress that it causes are to be understood, and it's in the understanding of this process, of this cycle, this pattern of mind, and how it creates so much stress in our hearts and creates this separation between where we are now and peace or ease or happiness. This is such a central learning that when this understanding, when this learning about the nature of craving begins, it leads to its complete release. So this is something that we're encouraged to get to know in our experience, to be curious about, to get to understand. And as is constantly seeking somewhere we can rest in getting the conditions of our lives and conditions of the world to be a certain way, and always seeking and ever finding, just inherent in the nature of craving as it's endless, and it's inherently stressful. And we often find ourselves in this endless cycle of seeking and not finding until we meet the path. There's such good news that the Buddha discovered a path to actual peace and satisfaction, the deepest kind of happiness and well-being that's possible, a complete uprooting of mental distress and agitation. And it's not in getting things, the conditions of the world to be a certain way, but it's in our relationship to them. It's in the peace lies in the alignment with how things are, with the nature of how things are, aligning with the impermanent and uncontrollable nature of our experience and of the world. It may, to the craving mind, to the mind that the habitual ordinary mind, that might sound like bad news, right? Like, no, well, then I won't be able to get the things I want if I'm not controlling, if I'm not in control. But the Buddha discovered that it's actually through releasing this attempt to control everything that there is finally this deeper happiness, this deeper peace that is possible right here in the midst of however it is, this alignment with how it is, alignment with the way things are. This is the Dhamma, the Buddha talked about the way things are and the natural law as being the Dhamma. And so when we discover and align with the Dhamma, our hearts are released and realize the fruit of the path, which is peace and love and well-being and warm-heartedness that is unshakable. And so how do we cultivate this alignment with the way things are? How do we cultivate this non-clinging that the Buddha said leads to happiness, to peace? Well, the one way of kind of very summarily describing the Buddhist path in short is to cultivate that which is wholesome and to release that which is unwholesome. And this is not like a moral judgment of good or bad. This is really practical. Kusala is this word being translated as wholesome, can also be translated as skillful or appropriate. And it's really in this context of stress and its release. So that which is kusala is simply that which leads to the release of stress. That which is ekusala or unwholesome or unskillful is simply that which causes stress. It's not a good or bad judgment. It's just if you have a direction, if you have somewhere that you want to get to, you're asking for directions to this destination. Some city you don't know, there's a right way and there's a wrong way. I was like, oh, someone might say, oh, you're going the wrong way. That's good information. And if you're trying to get in the direction of a destination, that which is wholesome, that which is kusala is that which is often called onward leading. And that cultivates the qualities that give rise to peace, to release. There are many of these. There are so many doorways into cultivating this deeper happiness. There may be heart practices like metta compassion, like appreciative joy, delighting in the happiness of others, all of these qualities that support this movement of non-clinging, of the release of this trying to grasp on and hold on to in a stressful way. And at root, at root in the Buddha's teachings, the root cause of these unwholesome patterns of mind, creative aversion and delusion, they're all rooted in what's often called ignorance or just not understanding, not seeing or understanding the nature of how things actually work. And so our attempts to seek happiness are out of alignment with how things work, the way experience actually is. And so therefore it's just naturally going to cause some stress and struggle because our attempts to seek happiness are misaligned with the nature of the world, the nature of our experience. And so the quality that is the opposite of ignorance or not seeing or not understanding is often called wisdom or the Pali word is pañña, often translated as wisdom or understanding or clear-seeing. It's actually seeing, not intellectual wisdom, not having mastered the texts, not having mastered the teachings, but that can be a support for our practice, but it's actually this seeing in our experience what's actually happening. And it's this moment to moment direct insight into what's happening right here in our simple experience that is where the insight that grows into wisdom arises. So often a frequent term in the teachings is wise attention, wise attention that is so connected to the cultivation of wisdom, the cultivation of these wholesome qualities. There's one sutta, which is just a discourse, a teaching of the Buddha, where the Buddha says that when one neglects wise attention and the hindrances, what are called the hindrances to well-being, are what flourish these qualities that are rooted in creative version and delusion. But when wise attention is established, then what arises are actually what are called the awakening factors, these wholesome qualities that lead to well-being, mindfulness, curiosity, this wholesome joy, tranquility, concentration, equanimity, these wholesome qualities that support the mind in aligning with the way things are. And this wise attention is simply attending to our experience from the lens of experience as experience, you could say, experience as a process. So actually starting to learn what is happening in this experience. Usually we're so glommed on to the content of what we think about our experience and we're so in the story of our experience that we don't see what's happening in our experience as a process. We don't see the activity of the mind, oh, this is actually a belief arising and it's being believed. There's this whole world that the mind creates based on this belief, this whole sense of self. Usually we're just, you know, so entangled with and kind of enmeshed with the content of that, that we're not seeing that as a process. That's not a bad thing. That's what we're all, that's just how all of our minds have been conditioned. And the invitation is actually just to become curious about that, to get to include that and to start to see that when that comes into view and we start to see, wow, this is what the mind is doing. This is how the mind is instructing this experience, constructing the sense of the world and the sense of myself in it and my relationship to the world, whether it's a, you know, a positive feeling sense of self or a negative feeling sense of self. We can just see how this is something that the mind is creating moment to moment. And in the seeing of it there starts to be a seeing through it and become less enchanted by the content and more attuned to the actual conditioned nature of the experience and also the impermanent nature of the experience. And as, as these aspects of what's happening in our moment to moment experience become more and more clearly understood, not through conceptual, you know, trying to analyze or think about so much but through actually observing, through recognizing moment to moment. That leads to the deepest release that can be completely at ease, completely at peace with, even with the mind still churning out these unwholesome patterns, they can be known and understood and not identified with, not clung to. Even after the Buddha's full awakening. He was visited by in the in the suttas. Mara is the is the name of the personification of creative origin and delusion. Even after the Buddha's full awakening. His mind was visited by Mara. But, but the Buddha was never swayed by Mara because as soon as Mara rose the Buddha would say, I see you Mara. I see you Mara. And as soon as Mara was seen. He lost his power. But it wasn't identified with or, or, you know, giving any power to these thoughts, even though they were still arising, you would still have doubt arise occasionally. And in one story the Buddha was noticing that Mara was arising in his mind in the form of doubt and saying, you know, the Buddha had a very, very, a lot of aesthetic leanings and practice really extreme asceticism before, before he found the middle way and became awakened. And he visited him and said, Look at you indulging in four hours of sleep at night, you've become so weak and undisciplined and, and, you know, who do you think you are. And so that was the Buddha's, the Buddha's version of self judgment or doubt. And he just said, I see you Mara. Mara was immediately vanquished within the suit of Mara was became frustrated that the Buddha saw through his ploy and just, you know, walked off. So in the seeing of the seeing and the understanding of what's happening, there is a freedom with it, even with it still happening, there can be a freedom, because there's this unentangled knowing that there can be an unentangled knowing of Dukkha, that is, or, or of stress, of suffering, that is actually free from it, free with it, even with it still there. And then, I think, another, another Suta, another story comes to mind. Just to highlight how central the knowing of our moment to moment experience is to the path to freedom. There's a story that I think it's called the, the marvelous and the wonderful. And that's a story. There's a group of the, the Buddhist disciples a group of monastics that are, they're hanging out and they're talking about all of the marvelous and wonderful qualities of the Buddha. They're going through all of these stories about the life of the Buddha, all these amazing miraculous things like, you know, really, really kind of out there amazing things like when the when the Buddha was born, you know, the whole galaxy shook. And when the Buddha was awakened, interstellar space was filled with pure, bright light, and precious gems rain, rain down from the skies, all these amazing, you know, all these amazing stories and, and the Buddha walked by and kind of heard, just noticed the Buddha was talking and Ananda was the Buddha's cousin and attendant was very close with the Buddha. He was there in this discussion. And so later, the Buddha asked Ananda, what, what were you all talking about back there. And Ananda described, you know, in detail everything they were talking about all of the, all of the wonderful and marvelous qualities of the Buddha is what the story says and. The Buddha simply responds by saying, so he referred to himself as the the tagata that's the kind of the word he used to refer to himself, the Buddha, and the Buddha simply responded by saying, you should remember the tatagata thus, for the tagata of feelings were known as they arose, as they persisted, and as they fell away for the tagata thoughts were known as they arose, as they persisted. they fell away. For the tathāgata, perceptions were known as they arose, as they persisted, and as they fell away. This is what the Buddha wanted to highlight as a wonderful and marvelous quality is knowing of moment to moment experience. Yeah, so just as a lot more, there's a lot more I wanted to say. I see that we're almost at time. But just mainly want to emphasize and encourage that this simple attending to and recognizing moment to moment experience with the curiosity about what's actually happening in experience here, that this is such a potent support for the release of these patterns of stress and suffering, this cultivation of wisdom, it may feel so deceptively simple, this just recognizing experience, it doesn't feel like very much is happening. But over time, this really does develop and ripen into the wisdom that leads to the end of all stress, the wisdom that leads to the deepest kind of peace and happiness that is possible in this life. We have a couple of minutes, just wanted to see if there are any questions or comments or reflections about your own practice before we close for today. I will just add one quick thing about how this shows up in our practice, because this has been something that's been so helpful for me, is it can be so easy to hear the instructions to not cling, to not react to all these invitations. But often when we sit, what we actually observe is how our minds are struggling against experience. They are minds are trying to create an experience, trying to get rid of an experience. We can't just decide to not do that anymore. If we could, there wouldn't be much work to do. But that is also included, that it's not bad news to sit and just feel like you're caught in struggle. It's good news to recognize it. I think Ajahn Amaro, one of the famous teachers said that 90% of our practice is recognizing that we're caught and not being able to let go. But even just recognizing that we're caught, that is cultivating the wholesome, because we're starting to understand what's happening in our experience, as it actually is. But everything is included. However you are, recognizing that is a wholesome and onward leading practice. Thank you all for your practice and kind attention. And I do a quick dedication of the parent. May the goodness of our practice and any wholesome qualities cultivated, may they all ripple out and be of benefit to all beings everywhere. May all beings everywhere be free from danger. May all beings everywhere be free from mental suffering. May all beings everywhere be free. Thank you all. Good to be with you. Thank you.
