 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, so welcome, welcome. And today I wanted to say just a few words about this idea that, you know, when uncomfortable experiences arise, before we turn on the recording, we were talking about how hot it was in Las Vegas, 114 degrees, and still my mind can't quite get around that. That's really, really hot. But whether it's our external experience, our environment, or whether it's our internal, you know, our feelings or emotions or thoughts or something like this, wherever it arises or whatever seems to be the cause for it, humans have an awful lot of uncomfortable experiences. I'm sure you've noticed. If you hadn't noticed, you wouldn't be here at a place called Happy Hour. But often when we have uncomfortable experiences, it's our habit, it's our pattern to shut down or disconnect or maybe start blaming, blaming ourselves, blaming others, you know, one of these ways in which there's a, you know, habitual response when things are uncomfortable. Of course there is, right? Of course there is. We all want to be happy. We all want to have ease. Nobody wants to be uncomfortable. And so much of when uncomfortableness arises, there can be a little feeling. Sometimes it can even be a little panicky feeling like, how can I fix this? How can I make it go away? I don't want to be uncomfortable. Dang it. I've tried to organize my whole life to avoid this and yet here it is. So I just want to talk about briefly today is how what we're doing here at Happy Hour, some of this loving kindness practice and compassion practice can really support our being with uncomfortable feelings. And notice how I didn't say make the uncomfortable feelings go away. That's what we all want, of course. But what's underneath, what's kind of like feeling that making things go away is a little bit or a lot of aversion, a little bit of ill will or hostility or, I mean, it might be really subtle, really quiet, but this, I kind of expressed it just a moment ago by saying, dang it, go away. You know, that this feeling like it shouldn't be this way. And that habitual response is kind of what perpetuates that uncomfortable feeling. So instead, what we're invited to do and what can be really transformative, and I'm not exaggerating this, can be completely transformative. And you're not going to be surprised when I say this is not easy. As best we can, can we be with that uncomfortable experience, not shut down, not disconnect, not start blaming. But instead, there can be a mental thing that we can tell ourselves like, of course I feel uncomfortable. I haven't eaten or that person is yelling or I need to sleep more or my expectations weren't met or you know, whatever it might be. And we don't have to do this. We don't have to go through this long list of exactly why we're feeling uncomfortable, but just this recognition that it's not magic, like it, and comfortableness is arising for a reason. We don't have to know exactly what the reason is. If we sat down and thought about it, we could figure out many reasons. But that's the first thing is maybe just to say, actually, this experience right now is the confluence of so many different things coming together. I am with my feelings a little bit hurt recently. And I was, oh yeah, I had the expectations that this person was going to call me back at a certain time, and we were going to address the things that I had sent in the email that I felt like needed to be taken care of. And I felt like, oh, they don't care about this as much as I do, you know, I had a little bit of this feeling. And just to recognize, well, of course, when you have expectations, but they're not getting clearly communicated or something like this, you know, sometimes we feel uncomfortable. It doesn't have to be the end of the road. Okay, so that's the first part is to recognize it's all these confluence of causes and conditions coming together that are making the present moment experience. Here's the second part. That with loving kindness practice and some compassion practice, we can shift our relationship to that uncomfortable experience. Instead of pushing it away instead of having a little bit of anger or hostility, we can allow that experience to be there. We can be open to that experience. We can be present for that experience, because it is there. It's already there. So, we're just opening to what's there. We can still be uncomfortable. But if we can kind of remove the, the wishing that it weren't there or the blaming ourselves or blaming others, then it can unfold in a different way. And that different way will be born out of this allowing rather than a version. And that this is born out of allowing has comes from a sense of more freedom, or warm heartedness, or there's some okayness that's inherent or is part of or characterizes or division. Exactly but there's that flavor that comes out of the experience. So, to help us to be okay. In the midst of whatever is happening, and especially in the uncomfortable experiences to allow it to be happening to not shut down is transformative. And this is a real key for living a life in which we feel connected to ourselves and connected to others. And Tara Brock she wrote in the preface to the world, and she said, we can't be connected to ourselves, is the key to healing our wounds, and opening our hearts to the world. So there's this way and become having this war against ourselves and we're like, No, I don't want it to be this way or something's wrong or disconnecting from ourselves or whatever it might be. And this is why I'm describing it's not easy. And this is why we have a meditation practice. Part of the reason why right this part. This is part of how the fruits of the loving kindness practice can really make a difference in our lives. And it can be with the anxiety that maybe we don't even know why we're feeling anxious or allows us to be nervous or sad or angry or whatever it might be. And then we'll do some loving kindness practice and then a little bit of compassion practice for ourselves, because that can be a real support when we're having some difficulties is to something we might want to do in that moment to help us allow that moment is some compassion practice for ourselves. Maybe more words than I needed to say but just planting some seeds of some ideas that may later fruit bear fruit or be helpful. So we'll start with a little bit of mindfulness practice. So, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths, so way to connect with the body. Sometimes it's helpful to have these exaggerated breaths to help us connect and then allowing the breathing to return to normal. Just feeling in with what this moment experiences like it can be the physical experience. Be checking in with the mental and emotional experience. Other moods or qualities, a lot of energy, little energy, sadness, happiness, whatever it might be. Can we just notice and then allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing. And then the movement of the chest or belly or air going in and out of the nose. And then the movement of the chest or air going in and out of the nose. When the mind wanders, you don't have to make it a problem. You just come back to the sensations of breathing. You can always come back to this practice, sensations of breathing, just tuning into those experiences. If ever it feels like loving kindness, just doesn't feel like it's the right practice or you're feeling overwhelmed. Maybe emotions come up, you can always come back to mindfulness practice. But to begin the loving kindness practice will begin where it's easy to bring into mind a lovable being. Somebody from a simple, straightforward, uncomplicated to feel warm hearted towards connecting with this being. And allowing yourself to feel this warm heartedness you have for them. For some people it shows up as maybe a literal warmth in the chest, heart area. For some people it's more just like an internal smile, like a little sense of delight. For some people maybe it's they don't quite have access to it right now, perfectly fine. But to help support our, I mean this experience connecting to that well wishing of the lovable being. You can repeat these phrases while having the being in mind. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. You know the goodwill we have for this lovable being. Whether that lovable being is a furry family member. Somebody that had an impact on us when we were young, younger, coach, teacher, mentor. Somebody who's in our life now. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Can we just tune into the goodwill, warmheartedness we have for this lovable being? Maybe tuning into your physical sensations of openness or warmth. Maybe it's not even quite clear what the experience is of care, love, kindness. But tuning into them nevertheless. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then to expand our loving kindness to include ourselves. I think it's really helpful to always include ourselves when we're doing loving kindness practice. Sometimes we might think that we just need to have it for others. Just to have a balanced, well-rounded loving kindness practice, we should also include ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Thank you. And to all of you for your service, good will. Thank you for connecting to that intention of goodwill. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm not going to do something radically different. We're just going to expand what we've already done. So coming from this place of well-wishing, coming from this place of openness and warmheartedness as best as we can. It's perfectly fine if not quite able at this moment to tap into it, but if you can, to allow that experience to be a support, to be a foundation. Or we can do a little bit of compassion practice for ourselves. So bringing to mind an uncomfortable experience, not the most uncomfortable. On a scale of one to ten, a two or a three. And I'm coming from this place of love, care and well-wishing. You can tune into this uncomfortableness, beware of it, and say this phrase. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this uncomfortableness be held with kindness and ease. May this uncomfortableness be held with kindness and ease. Recognizing that uncomfortableness and allowing it to be there and holding it as best we can with kindness and ease. If that uncomfortableness has gone away, you can go back to loving kindness practice. Or maybe bring to mind another one. This whole process should have a quality of some ease. Really moving slowly. A lot of time and space. It feels like too much. You can do simple mindfulness of breathing. You can do it with kindness and ease. and comfortableness be held with kindness and ease. You It's so easy for aversion, a bit of hostility or ill will to creep in towards our uncomfortable experiences course. So it can be really helpful to do this practice starting with some warm heartedness. So we can get used to, is it like to hold something uncomfortable with kindness and ease? You noticed it's easy. You You This idea of holding and comfortableness in a way that Disrupts the patterns in which we you know, maybe not even recognize how we respond to things that are uncomfortable If you'd like maybe you could put in the chat box how was that this this idea of doing loving kindness where it's easy and then for oneself and then to bring in some uncomfortable experiences and doing that I Am writing does anybody wanna put just something in the chat box like how that experience was Heart that's very nice and Let's see. I see Some of it's very nice some of them are direct messages to me so I won't say those out loud Yes on loving kindness and compassion practice. Yeah helpful Yeah, I usually want to run away from uncomfortable feelings, of course we do right It's just natural and we might even not even recognize that Are the attitude that we have towards uncomfortable feelings is one that hasn't little bit of a difference one that hasn't little bit of a Go away, you know a little bit of a I Don't know what the word word is. I'm using the word hostility. I Haven't done metha to myself be myself before with good. Yeah, and it worked well. I needed it today Yeah, right probably many of us need this every day, right? Great great. Thank you for that Dealing with specific issues at this time very helpful to disrupt the old Pattern to allow space inhaling a different path. Thank you. That's exactly Disruptable patterns takes time and is not easy. Sometimes it feels uncomfortable and but this is exactly while we're doing this Physically uncomfortable sensations as well are challenging. You know what? Thank you for saying that I didn't address that Directly when I put this up, but you're absolutely right Because you know just bodily pain Part of what it means to have a human body is uncomfortable Yeah, I mean I'm still trying to adjust to give you a loving kindness to myself Yeah, right this alone is such a powerful practice Because maybe it's that that's another pattern that we are disrupting here instead of beating ourselves up blaming ourselves for everything It could be Transfornive to do that We'll use this one the mind races and insomnia accompanies me. Yeah, fantastic Fantastic. May it be helpful So now I'd like to provide an opportunity for you guys to talk to one another But more directly and kind of explore this idea of being in Uncomfortable situations and being able to Hold up to Hold up to To hold them maybe i'll say this is a maybe a subtle thing, but it can be really impactful notice that the phrase Was may this and comfortableness be held with kindness and ease So I was using passive language. I didn't say may I hold this with kindness and ease because It's too easy then to slip into oh i'm doing it wrong If we don't have this kindness and ease so instead of may it be held with kindness and ease kind of this passive language Okay, so in the Breakout rooms it's helpful to just say one point And then let it go to the next person and they say one point And then it comes back around to the first person and they can say something else Rather than saying all your thoughts and ideas that you might have about a topic. It's really helpful to Just extend this loving kindness that we've been cultivating to other people to create this Container create the space so much people can share and be heard I kind of like to say this and to level the playing field between the areas And to level the playing field between the introverts and the extroverts So not for the first person to take all the time, but just say one thing and then let it go around the circle So that everybody has an opportunity to speak and If it's helpful, you can go in alphabetical order. Sometimes it's not clear who's going to go first We'll just go who's first and now for that Okay, so here we go Okay, so welcome back Does anybody have a comment or a question or something they'd like to say Nope That's all right, we don't have to no question Well, maybe I could add something yeah I think as we were closing we were considering the issue of retirement And One of the issues that I think that we were talking about the issue of retirement and um, one of the realizations that's come to me is I think with the mindfulness work i'm beginning to be able to see that that's a continuation That retirement is an old term Like aging that doesn't mean the same thing today as it did 50 years ago or more And so Looking for continuation of of what and very definitely Dharma practice and other things in my own life, but The mindfulness is i'm very very grateful for that work because this is what it's leading to is What is it? What am I continuing into? Nice Okay, and so you have the freedom to ask that question And then to also like well, maybe here's an opportunity for me to create or Create the conditions at least for something that I really want to do So just following our patterns or habits or expectations or something Great. Thank you. Thank you, pen Peggy Hi, um I just want to say I really enjoyed our group and um It was nice to hear other shares and it inspired Kinder thinking and myself and and also we kind of we followed the instructions and that was actually nice I think we ended up hearing more from everyone and sometimes When share grew into others about Kind of bounced off each other.

Peggy Yeah, I know that I gave this instruction just say one point but some people they you know It's it's not a usual way of talking.
