Good morning, Vendable nuns, dear friends. 
I'm happy to see so many people today. 
And since there is no any particular topic to give the talk, and I believe from this announcement I gathered some of you new, some veterans. 
So I have to give a talk. 
It is very difficult to give one talk to please everybody. 
So I try to give a talk on some aspect of meditation practice. 
This is not just a mere aspect, but this is the real core of meditation practice. 
That is, especially in Buddhist meditation, there are two aspects. 
They are concentration meditation and mindfulness meditation. 
I think many of you are familiar with mindfulness meditation. 
Sometimes it is called insight meditation, sometimes vipassana meditation, and sometimes mindfulness meditation. 
All these are the same, whether you call it vipassana, insight, or mindfulness. 
Although they are related, there are some little differences. 
One is linguistic difference, vipassana is Hollywood, and mindfulness and insight are English words. 
In order to gain insight, we have to be mindful. 
And therefore mindfulness and insight also are not the same. 
Now I want to focus our attention on these two aspects, mindfulness meditation and concentration meditation. 
Most of the meditators, when they come to meditate, they always complain, I cannot gain concentration, assuming that concentration is the only thing we do in meditation. 
That is not true. 
Although concentration is absolutely necessary, almost one half of our meditation, but that's not all. 
We need the other half. 
That is mindfulness, vipassana, insight, meditation. 
However, when we try to gain concentration, we have problems. 
When we cannot gain concentration, what shall we do? We cannot gain concentration because there are so many problems. 
Primarily what you all know is hindrances. 
They arise. 
When hindrances arise, you cannot concentrate. 
You go to overcome your hindrances. 
In order to overcome hindrances, you go to practice mindfulness. 
Only when you become mindful of hindrances and learn how to deal with them, can you gain concentration. 
And therefore you can see how these two are integrated, interrelated, intertwined and supporting each other. 
You are trying to gain concentration and you have hindrances. 
You overcome hindrances with mindfulness, then you gain concentration. 
Then what are you going to do with the concentration? Some people are very much afraid of concentration. 
And in recent, especially in the West, word concentration is a taboo. 
They say, don't concentrate. 
You become vegetable. 
You get stuck. 
You become attached to it. 
You cannot move. 
You don't hear anything. 
You don't feel anything. 
And you will become like a rock. 
Don't concentrate. 
And they are who practice vipassana. 
And when they practice vipassana, they gain little concentration. 
They are afraid of concentration because they have only conditioned, brainwashed, not to concentrate. 
Now these are the misunderstanding of the whole meditation system. 
And therefore we honestly must look at these two aspects of meditation. 
Concentration is the crown of meditation. 
That is why in the Noble Eightfold Path, last is called right concentration. 
Seventh is right mindfulness. 
If you don't concentrate and practice mindfulness and finish there, then you are not practicing Noble Eightfold Path. 
You have practiced Noble Sevenfold Path. 
If you want to practice Noble Eightfold Path, you must include concentration. 
But you cannot concentrate without mindfulness. 
It is such an interesting dilemma that many people encounter without understanding the relationship between these two. 
Of course there is reason for some people to have fear of concentration because they are attached to. 
. 
. 
It's possible for them to become attached to concentration if they don't practice right concentration. 
In the Noble Eightfold Path you can see right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. 
All are qualified with right, right, right, right, right. 
That implies that there must be something called wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. 
Isn't it? If there is right concentration, there must be wrong concentration. 
If there is right mindfulness, there must be wrong mindfulness. 
Some people say mindfulness, it is just mindfulness. 
There cannot be wrong mindfulness. 
If there cannot be wrong mindfulness, why the Buddha qualified that as right mindfulness? For good reason. 
Because even mindfulness can be wrong mindfulness. 
And concentration can be wrong concentration. 
Wrong concentration is a concentration without right mindfulness. 
Mindfulness can be wrong mindfulness without right concentration. 
We have to understand what is right mindfulness and right concentration. 
When Siddhartha Gotama, Bodhisattva, attained right concentration, attained concentration, then suddenly he thought, ah, this is so blissful, so pleasing, pleasant. 
How can I proceed? No, no, I don't have to worry about it. 
I don't have to fear this concentration. 
Why? This concentration has nothing to do with carnal pleasure. 
This is the concentration that has nothing to do with sensual pleasure. 
This is concentration which does not make me attached to this blissful, peaceful state. 
And this is the concentration that is free from the hindrance called greed. 
You can have concentration with greed. 
And this is the concentration, right concentration does not have greed in it. 
Instead you have, at the attainment of right concentration, you have tremendous freedom of letting go. 
You don't attach to anything, you just, when you gain right concentration, mind becomes so clear and pure, as I mentioned yesterday, because of the presence of equanimity. 
Equanimity puts you into a balanced state. 
When the mind is balanced, it doesn't go to one side or the other, greed or hatred. 
It remains equanimous. 
And therefore, why it remains equanimous? Because it has overcome greed as a hindrance. 
It has overcome hatred as a hindrance. 
So, therefore, when we gain right concentration, we don't have these two hindrances. 
And other hindrances, other remaining three hindrances. 
Facelessness, worry and doubt, because mind is so clear. 
Now, let me draw the difference between concentration and mindfulness. 
Mindfulness has a very specific function. 
Mindfulness makes the mind clean and pure, and also it shows things as they really are. 
And that means the aggregates that we have, form, feeling, perceptions, volitional formations and consciousness, these are the aggregates. 
They are called aggregate because, as you know, aggregates is a collection of things. 
When things are collected together and put in a group, category, that group, that category is called aggregate. 
Now, these aggregates, each of them we see in a very special way, in a way that not ordinary, ordinarily we see them. 
For example, form, f-o-r-m form. 
When we practice mindfulness and when we gain clear understanding, f-o-r-m form becomes so clear to us that f-o-r-m form is f-o-a-m form. 
Because when you get lot of bubbles together, when water is running, if there is a log or dirt or leaves and so forth in certain place, this water comes there and builds up little, little bubbles. 
And they collect and appear to us to be a huge, big pile. 
And even if we take, we can take pictures and they look like huge pile or something. 
When we are mindful and pay mindful attention to our body form, this superficially apparent, huge, big, sized body is nothing inside in it. 
When you all learn biology, physics, chemistry and so forth, you take a powerful microscopic glass and look at any tiny little part of the body, you can break it down, analyze it and see eventually nothing in it. 
It's just sort of waves. 
Buddha was so wonderful, his wisdom, his insight was so wonderful, long before people discovered this, what do you call it, this magnetic, what do you call it, what do you call it, microscopic lenses and discovered physics, chemistry, science and so forth. 
Buddha knew this, thousands of years ago he knew this. 
And he said this F-O-R-M form is actually F-O-A-M form. 
There's nothing in it. 
You break one bubble inside nothing and break another inside nothing, break another inside nothing. 
Similarly, when we mindfully look at our body eight parts separately, we can't see anything in it. 
And the feeling, Buddha called feeling is like bubble. 
Pali word is bubbular. 
Isn't it a nice Pali word? I think bubble came from the word Pali, bubbular. 
Feeling is bubbling. 
They appear and disappear. 
When they appear, they appear to our perception, our consciousness. 
They appear to be having something. 
But in reality, feeling, the sensations is just a sensation. 
Also you learn, we learn science. 
Can you ever, have you ever seen feeling under microscope in science laboratory? You can see reactions to feelings, sensations, movement, physical movement. 
But have you ever seen feeling with your eyes or have you ever heard feeling? Although we may cry, laugh, smile and so forth, we never see it, never hear it. 
But it appears to our consciousness something is there. 
And it comes and goes, comes and goes, appears and disappears, appears and disappears. 
That is feeling. 
Then perception, Buddha compared to mirage. 
That also is a very interesting simile. 
It is called mirage in Pali, mariti. 
It comes from the word migra. 
Migra means deer. 
Deer is going looking for water when in dry season, when the deer is thirsty, goes for looking, looking for water. 
And from a distance he sees water. 
Because this whatever tiny little moisture is in the ground, it evaporates and this looks like a vapor, like water from a distance, so he runs after that. 
When he runs after that to drink, it is no longer there. 
And he races, he said, and he sees it farther away, he runs there. 
And he runs and runs and runs, cannot find water, then turns back. 
When he turns back, water is behind. 
So he runs back again. 
And there is no water at the, I mean, no water behind. 
So he looks forward again and then sees water there, then he runs there. 
So he keeps running back and forth, back and forth, and he sees water, but when he tries to drink, there is no water. 
Friends, Buddha said, our perceptions is like that. 
We perceive beauty. 
Where is that? We perceive ugliness. 
Where is that? It is our perception. 
One time, very, very beautiful thing, later on is no more beautiful. 
We all know that. 
So it is a temporary, sometimes we may call, optic illusion. 
It appears to be something, but when we mindfully examine, it is no longer there. 
And the volitional formations even, even more interesting, volitional formations, a Pali word is called sankhara. 
That is also collection. 
Buddha compares it to a banana tree. 
Since many of us, especially in the northern hemisphere, have not seen banana trees except in greenhouses periodically. 
That also is not a real banana tree, but very tiny little one. 
I came up with another simile, which many people can relate to. 
That is spelled as on and on with i in the middle. 
What is that? On, on and i in the middle. 
Onion, isn't it? It is very interesting simile, because sankhara or volitional formations are the things that push us on and on and on in sankhara. 
If we don't have sankhara, we will not have sankhara. 
Sankhara are our backpack for sankhara journey. 
If you take sankhara as a journey, for this journey we have to have a backpack. 
Bigger the backpack, longer we go. 
Smaller the backpack, three-piece short. 
And when we lay down the backpack, we are light, enlightened, no more weight. 
Huge the backpack, it is very heavy. 
We are weighed down, very difficult to carry. 
Now in the center of this onion there is i. 
It is because of this i, we keep on going on and on and on without ending. 
Self notion, ego notion is our mental creation. 
It's a concept as I asked our friends the other day. 
I don't know why I asked this question many times, here or some other places. 
This concept of i, although we very, very, very strongly hold on to it, we never want to give up, because that is the center. 
The core of all our activities. 
Always this is the one single word we use million times every day. 
i. 
It is mere concept. 
So I asked people, it's a convenient concept. 
I asked people, have they ever seen longitude, latitude, capricorn, equator? Oh, have you ever seen Sunday? We are called today Sunday. 
Where is Sunday? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, December, January and so forth. 
Where are they? Is there anything to indicate for us to see, hear, touch, smell Sunday? Monday, Tuesday? No. 
But we very strongly believe that today is Sunday. 
We organize our activities on Sunday. 
You announced Monday we have such and such, Wednesday we have such and such, Tuesday such and such, but where are they? Concept i also is exactly like that, without which we cannot function. 
But we cannot find varieties. 
But all our activities are around this concept. 
Like today activities are in Sunday, on Sunday. 
All are organized on Sunday. 
Activities on Monday we organize Monday. 
But we cannot see that day. 
Similarly, our volitional formations, we keep forming and forming and forming. 
Around the word i, and when we mindfully watch our thought, volitional formations are thought. 
You look at your thought mindfully, can you find anything in it? But thoughts are so important. 
And even if you have original thought, you register in patent office. 
You don't let anybody steal it. 
But they are very important. 
But what is in it? That's nothing. 
So mindfully when we look at these things, there is nothing to register, nothing to hold. 
Let, you know, even dhamma, we like to possess. 
Even dhamma we like to possess. 
It's no owner of dhamma. 
And we like to sell it and buy. 
It is a commodity. 
It's a merchandise. 
So when we mindfully look at these things, we can see inside there is nothing. 
And yet we hold on to them. 
And then fifth, last one, is consciousness. 
Consciousness even is more difficult to understand. 
And yet we all talk about consciousness. 
It is so fleeting, so ephemeral, so quickly changing, and we cannot find it. 
But without that, we cannot function. 
It is compared to magic, magicians' performance. 
You know magic when you watch magic. 
Magicians can create things to look real. 
But when you very closely watch what the magician does, you can see his tricks. 
He is very quick, very skillful, and he can perform so many tricks to make you believe that there is something really existing. 
Our consciousness, so we should like that. 
Seeing these aggregates in this way, as they are impermanent, as they are unsatisfactory, as they don't have permanent, eternal entity, is the practice of mindfulness. 
For that, we have to have a lot of discipline, lot of attention, non-conceptual attention, attention without labels, without names and words, pure, preconceptual awareness. 
This is just in brief I can say what mindfulness is. 
To see things exactly as they are, we have to pay mindful attention. 
As I said, attention also has qualities. 
Unmindful attention is very low quality attention. 
Mindful attention is high quality attention. 
Low quality attention all living beings have. 
High quality attention only when we practice meditation, we can have it. 
So when we pay mindful attention to these, our own aggregates, our body feeling, perceptions, volitional formations and consciousness, we see them always fleeting, changing, appearing, disappearing, without stopping any time, always they are changing. 
Then when the mind gets settled, then we gain, our hindrances will subside. 
Of course, for each to subside, each hindrance we have to work hard with mindfulness. 
For example, when we try to meditate, sleepiness arises as very invariable hindrances, especially when everything is very quiet, calm, relaxed, peaceful, lot of cushions, air conditioned room, no noise and so forth. 
When everything is calm, we feel sleepy. 
At that time we have to use our mindfulness to overcome our sleepiness. 
What we do, we recommend few things to overcome our sleepiness. 
One, if you remember these things, you will be very glad to deal with this hindrance without any, without struggling. 
Sleepiness is very sweet, we are welcoming. 
It is so overwhelming, so powerful, and yet it is not going to bring us an iota of insight. 
And therefore we should not be succumbed to sleepiness. 
When sleepiness arises, we must do everything possible, mindfully, to remain awake. 
What we should do, number one, always do with mindfulness, number one, open the eyes mindfully and roll eyeballs and then keep eyes open for a while and then close. 
If that doesn't work, take a deep breath, mindfully, and hold the breath as long as you can and slowly breathe out. 
And again take a deep breath, hold it as long as you can and slowly breathe out. 
When you do it many times, your body warms up, you even feel, you even perspire, your sleepiness vanishes. 
And then you can come back to your primary object, primary object may be our breath. 
If that doesn't work, you pinch your earlobes with thumb and index finger hard enough with both earlobes, pinch, not with nails, with fleshy part of your fingers, thumb and finger, and press hard enough. 
Don't chicken out. 
Do it with some strength. 
And when you do that, your sleepiness will fade away. 
Don't do it with anger. 
That is not mindfulness. 
Don't do it very lightly. 
That also is not going to work. 
But with awareness, mindfulness, with the intention that you just want to get rid of your sleepiness. 
So for that purpose, to that extent, you have to press your earlobes with thumb and index finger hard enough. 
It works. 
If it doesn't work, you get up mindfully and stand and do standing meditation mindfully. 
And breathe slowly, paying total attention. 
If that doesn't work, take a walk and do walking meditation. 
In walking meditation also sometimes you can fall asleep. 
Because walking meditation is sometimes so calm, so relaxed. 
The other day I showed you how to do the walking meditation. 
If you do that kind of walking meditation, you not only gain concentration, but you become very mindful of every tiny little thing that happens to you. 
But it is so relaxing, calming, soothing, comforting that you can fall asleep. 
That is very dangerous. 
And therefore you have to be mindful when you walk. 
And if that doesn't work, then wash your face with cold water. 
That works. 
If that doesn't work, go and have a nap. 
It is perfectly all right to have a five-minute nap. 
Just like when you drive, when you feel sleepy, you have to pull off the road and put your head on the steering wheel and take five-minute nap, and then you wake up, you can drive. 
Like that, even in meditation when sleeping, as you cannot overcome, you have to do something very practical. 
So go and have a short nap and come back. 
You'll be quite fresh. 
You can meditate. 
All we do with the wonderful, noble, good, pure intention, is only to continue your mindfulness, meditation, not to get indulged in sleep, sleepiness, and then to meditate. 
Then when you come to meditation, another hindrance can arise. 
That is restlessness, just the opposite of sleepiness and rousiness. 
Then what you have to do, you have to pay total mindful attention to the breath and breathe very mindfully to calm your mind. 
And there is a wonderful system that I recommend to overcome restlessness. 
Restlessness and worry comes as a fear, because when you are restless, you worry, and therefore these two come together. 
Or when you worry, you become restless either way. 
And therefore to overcome that, you get to. 
. 
. 
First thing you have to do is to think of very noble qualities of the Buddha to calm and make your mind very peaceful. 
And I forgot to mention another thing to overcome sleepiness. 
That also Buddha recommended that is visualizing bright light. 
It's called aloka-sanya, perception of pure bright light. 
That also is very important to overcome sleepiness. 
So come back to restlessness and worry. 
You start counting. 
Restlessness and worry is what we call monkey mind. 
We are born with monkey mind because we evolved from monkeys. 
And that revolutionary process is still going on. 
So we still have that tendency to have monkey mind. 
So you start counting. 
That's a very beautiful way of counting. 
You breathe in, very mindfully breathe in, breathe out, count one. 
Again breathe in, breathe out, count two. 
Breathe in, breathe out, count three. 
You count up to ten. 
And then come from ten to one. 
Breathe in, breathe out, ten, and so forth, come down to one. 
Second time go from one to nine. 
Then nine to one. 
One to eight, eight to one, one to seven, seven to one, one to six, six to one, one to five, five to one, one to four, four to one, one to three, three to one, and one to two, two to one, and one. 
When you do this kind of counting, your mind stays on the ground. 
And again because of our habitual nature of our mind, it stills drift away, goes somewhere, disappears. 
And then all of a sudden your mind is in the moon. 
Or your mind is in another continent, another activity, somewhere. 
Then suddenly you remember, ah, I was counting. 
Now what happened to my counting? Then you remember counting. 
When you remember counting, you don't remember, you don't know where, at which point mind wanders away. 
Whether when you are at six or seven or eight. 
Then you think, then you remember, I was at six. 
So you come back to six. 
When you come back to six, you don't remember whether you go from six to five or six to seven. 
Right? Then again you start all over again from the beginning. 
And then go to ten again. 
When you come down, ah, you come down up to a certain point, then mind wanders again. 
You don't, mind does not stay on the counting. 
It wanders again. 
When you come to five, all of a sudden you will be at one, and between five and one you didn't count. 
Then you realize, ah, I lost the counting. 
So you start all over again. 
When you do this exercise many, many, many times, then your wandering mind will stay on the bed. 
And that will help you to overcome your wandering monkey mind. 
When you have doubt, doubt arises, ah, doubt is, I use sometimes Pali words for very beautiful reason. 
Pali word is vici-kicca. 
Vici-kicca, cikicca in Sanskrit and especially cikicca in Pali and Sanskrit cikicca, meaning treatment, cikicca is treatment. 
Vici-kicca means untreatable. 
You cannot treat. 
It is so, ah, almost terminal. 
There is no cure. 
Because you try everything and still you have doubt. 
Therefore we have to find a cure for this incurable, untreatable mental state. 
The cure is the trust. 
You go to trust your own practice, number one. 
You look at yourself, you have overcome at least two hindrances. 
That gives you confidence that you can do it. 
You are not hopeless. 
You are not helpless. 
You have one who can do something. 
The very fact that you came to practice indicates that you have a very wonderful intention. 
That gives you strength. 
And you have achieved something from meditation. 
And all this, your own personal experiences gives you confidence. 
Then you begin to trust the dhamma. 
Because it is this dhamma that brought you to this practice. 
Gives you this confidence, this self-trust, self-confidence. 
And then when dhamma does this to you, then you have a deeper confidence in the Buddha who introduced dhamma. 
So it is very logically, you lead to anchor your mind on the Buddha. 
So your doubt will gradually fades away, disappears. 
And the other two hindrances, I left, hindrances don't arise in particular order. 
One thing sometimes can arise is when the mind and body are calm and relaxed, is sleepiness and drowsiness. 
Perhaps that can arise first sometimes. 
But nobody can guarantee the hindrances arises in the way they are listed. 
The list is one thing, and practical experience is quite another. 
You will see that in your own meditation. 
So out of large two hindrances, greed and hatred, perhaps greed can arise afterwards. 
For example, when you are meditating, suddenly there may arise, you remember, I left a very delicious, juicy piece of cake in the refrigerator. 
As soon as that memory arises, your mouth begins to water. 
Your mind goes haywire, and you cannot meditate. 
Your desire is so greed, so deep, so strong, you cannot proceed with the practice. 
Any time greed arises, whether not only in meditation, you go to sleep, even in the middle of the night, if you remember something like this, like corn of ice cream, your most favorite ice cream, the cake, some cookies, your favorite cookies, something like that, you remember. 
Then you cannot sleep, you cannot meditate, you slowly get up and slowly tiptoe to the kitchen. 
Because until you eat that, you cannot settle the mind. 
You try that, see how difficult it is, so you slowly tiptoe to the kitchen, open the refrigerator and get this piece of cake or ice cream or cookie and eat. 
They say, I have a name for that person. 
That person is called Fragitarian. 
Fragitarian is the one who very slowly get up in the middle of the night and slowly tiptoe to the kitchen, open the refrigerator and ransack the refrigerator and take something to eat, very quietly and secretly. 
That person is called Fragitarian. 
You are vegetarian, you are non-vegetarian, this is a Fragitarian. 
So suddenly you become Fragitarian. 
After eating this piece of cake, can you meditate? No, you put a lot of sugar into your body and you become even more hyperactive, you cannot meditate. 
And therefore when greed arises, you got to be very mindful and talk to you mindfully. 
You tell yourself, well, I have eaten cake thousands of times in my life, from my childhood up to this date, I have eaten cake. 
This is not something unusual. 
This is not heavenly cake. 
This is cake that baked. 
I can make even better cake next time and buy new, brand new, fresh, different type of cake made in Japan. 
So I don't have to worry. 
And this cake will not disappear. 
I have locked my kitchen, locked my doors, nobody will come and steal my cake. 
It will be there. 
But this moment of meditation, I cannot find another time. 
I was looking forward to this. 
I built up momentum to meditate. 
This is a very rare occasion, very important occasion. 
I will not live for another minute. 
Perhaps, therefore, let go of this cake, this desire, this greed. 
I will not die without if I don't eat this piece of cake. 
But this moment, once passed, I will never get it. 
Cake will remain there, but the moment will not come back. 
We may not find the same meditative mood another time. 
Like that, you have to talk to yourself and get rid of that greed for that particular piece of cake. 
Last one is called hindrance of hatred. 
In English, you call it ill-will. 
It is called ill-will because when your will is ill, it is called ill-will. 
That is a very beautiful English word. 
Would the call compare one who is full of ill-will to a sick person? When you are sick, you cannot appreciate any food because your taste buds are so badly affected, you cannot enjoy taste, enjoy food. 
When we are sick, we cannot enjoy anything in the world. 
Nobody is good. 
We always want to criticize others, criticize ourselves, hate us, hate others, and so forth. 
Mind is so sick. 
And therefore we have to have good will. 
That is called metta. 
I translate it into English as loving friendliness. 
For good reason, friendliness means. 
. 
. 
The parli word is metta. 
Metta comes from the root mitta. 
Mitta means friend. 
In spoken language, like single, it is called mitra. 
In Hindi also we call it mitra. 
Sanskrit mitra means friend. 
Mitra's nature or mitra's nature is called metta. 
Therefore the word should be loving friendliness, not loving kindness. 
If we say loving kindness, you repeat the same thing twice. 
Because the next word is karuna. 
Karuna means kindness, compassion. 
So if you use karuna or compassion for the first word, metta, then you repeat the same thing for karuna as well. 
Then you say karuna, karuna twice. 
That means compassion, compassion twice. 
Therefore instead of loving kindness, kindness and compassion are synonymous, instead of saying loving kindness, we should say loving friendliness. 
We can be friendly. 
We start everything with friendliness. 
For example, children like to be friendly. 
We like to be friendly. 
When we are friendly, that is the time we become very calm, relaxed and peaceful. 
We can be together. 
Metta is little high-flown, little above our ordinary way of thinking. 
Therefore we use the word loving friendliness. 
Anyway, in order to overcome hatred, we cultivate friendliness. 
Then as a result of friendliness, we gain concentration. 
Because mind is calm, relaxed and peaceful, everybody around us is our friend. 
In front of us everybody is our friend. 
All those who are sitting behind us are our friends. 
We are so calm, relaxed and peaceful. 
No enemy, no threat, no insecurity, everything is calm. 
We gain concentration. 
Friends, concentration is a subject by itself. 
Unfortunately our time is up now. 
I wanted to give equal time for both, but I got carried away with this part and perhaps next time when I give a talk, I will talk about the next one, second part. 
So I like to end this talk and I appreciate your very attentive participation giving us encouragement to give the talk. 
And I wish you all success. 
May you all attain nibbana in this life, not in soon in future lives.
