Hello everyone, I appreciate the opportunity to be here with you and
to offer these words and to have a sense of so many of you who are
participating and have been doing so for a very long time and it's a I feel like
it's a wonderful thing we share here and thank you for the opportunity. So some
of you most of you know that when often usually when I start these guided
meditations I put some emphasis on relaxation if I one of my preferred
things to add is that we relax with a posture that has some expression of
alertness and and there's many ways of doing that of course and we just have a
posture that works for us but even if you're sitting back in a chair or
for example maybe you can put your hands in a place in a way in your lap on
your thighs in such a way that like it kind of expresses I am here but the
emphasis of what I make today is I often start with relaxation and there's a way
of understanding Dharma practice that it involves an ever-deepening process of
relaxation of loosening dissolving letting go releasing and that
relaxation is just one way to describe this and so rather than dismissing
relaxation as being kind of you know beginner meditation or something
simplistic or maybe to appreciate that it actually contains within it the
profundity of the Dharma it all all we're doing in a sense is ever-deepening
relaxation until the final relaxation is a opportunity to let go of all ways in
which we hold tight that were caught up that we are preoccupied that we are
attached so I say this as a way of appreciating the beginning appreciating
the relaxation there's something about it in it with it that has a goodness to
it that has a rightness that has a pleasure trust that take time to feel
that let that be a guide for you so taking an alert posture even if you're
laying on your back you could maybe stick you point your hands up to the
ceiling with your elbows on the side resting and something with the forearm
pointing up and then to gently close your eyes and take a moment to feel your
body before doing any relaxation at all or doing anything as a way of
respecting yourself respecting your body respecting this moment take a few
seconds here just feel and sense what is here for you
and then taking some long comfortably long inhales and relaxing the body on
the exhale could be the whole body or particular places
and then letting your breathing return to normal and I'll guide you if you want
to follow with relaxing different parts of your body and even if all you can do
is soften around that part rather than relaxing something see if you can
appreciate whatever pleasure goodness sense of this is right that comes with
that relaxation even if the relaxation reveals some discomfort maybe there's
some rightness to it knowing it to feeling it rather than ignoring it so on
the exhale relaxing the face maybe relaxing around the eyes the eyes
themselves letting them rest in their sockets not looking with your eyes at
anything the looking can rest the back of your eyes
relaxing the shoulders
even if they don't relax maybe your shoulders appreciate the care that
relaxing expresses on the exhale relaxing in the chest
relaxing the belly
relaxing the thighs and down the legs
relaxing the arms down to the hands
and then again relaxing in the shoulders but this time as you do so also relax
the relaxing the way that you relax let it be relaxed without expectation without
needing the relaxation to happen just an impulse signal to relax that is very
relaxed itself and then turn a relaxed way relax the thinking mind if there's
any tension or pressure or preoccupation around thoughts relax any tension or
pressure associated with that
and relax the mind as a whole so the mind is calmer or stiller without needing
to be directed anywhere just here and in whatever degree of calm the mind has
allow the inhale the experience of inhale to show itself in the mind to be
known in the mind so the mind doesn't go to the breathing the experience of
breathing comes to the mind
receptive available and then on the exhale relax with the exhale release let
go anywhere in your body and mind where it feels good to do so it could be just
in the breathing itself in the exhale itself
relaxing on the exhale giving yourself over to the relaxation so at the end
of the exhale at your awareness is more ready and receptive for the inhale
taking a moment to feel your mind if there's any ways in which to feel tight
or contracted hard solid tense as you exhale let it dissolve let it soften
maybe first it softens on the edges
if you are involved in thinking that's a sign that something within could use
relaxing softening
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to take two three four breaths on
the exhale to relax as deeply in your being as you can maybe if it's a long
little longer than usual exhale exhale from the surface of your body all the
way to the core
and then from whatever feeling for relaxation that you have feeling of
being softer perhaps to open your awareness to take in the room you're
sitting in the building neighborhood wider community your attention goes out
receptively out into the whole land the whole continent the whole world and
letting that open tentative this to the whole world around you be the medium for
carrying your goodwill you're well-wishing for the world a simple idea that it
would be wonderful for people to be happy and safe free and peaceful how
wonderful and that you would like that there is that wish for you may all
beings be happy may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful
may all beings be free and even if such a broad universal wish could never
actually be accomplished it makes a difference to have that wish for many
people it makes a difference for them to know that there are people who care
enough to wish them well may all beings be wished well may all beings know of
people who wish them well may we be well-wishers
thank you
