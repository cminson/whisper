Allow yourself to arrive in this present moment. 
A very general sense of where you are and how you are. 
Be connecting to your body. 
Aware of body. 
And you might explore allowing the body to relax. 
Relaxing the physical body, the muscles of the body. 
Perhaps scanning through and noticing areas where there may be tension and seeing if they can soften and relax. 
Perhaps too there could be a relaxing softening inside the body. 
Maybe the throat can relax. 
Maybe the heart can relax. 
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. 
You don't always have access to this internal relaxation, but sometimes it is possible. 
And in relaxing that part of the body it supports, really supports a relaxation of mind. 
And maybe too the mind can relax. 
Perhaps as an analogy, thinking of allowing the brain to relax. 
As we explore relaxing the body, this is a kind of directing the attention to the body and exploring being aware of tension and relaxation. 
So this is a mindfulness exploration. 
Be aware of the body. 
Maybe since we are exploring feeling tone in these few weeks, you might be able to touch into the pleasant unpleasant aspect of experience, possibly the neutral aspect of experience, with respect to tension or relaxation. 
Maybe as the body relaxes, there's some somewhat pleasant experience. 
Maybe as the mind relaxes too. 
Sometimes there can be a relaxation of mind, even if there's some physical unpleasant experience. 
Maybe the mind can relax with that physical unpleasant experience. 
Maybe there can be a pleasant relaxation of mind. 
Relaxation is about letting go. 
Not about doing. 
If we're telling our cells relax, relax. 
That doesn't usually play out so easily. 
But sometimes we can explore an inclination towards relaxation. 
Maybe the body can relax. 
Maybe the mind can relax. 
And noticing what happens while exploring that possibility. 
If there is a relaxation of body and mind that's available, you're welcome to explore letting go of that particular checking into relaxation and just open to what's here. 
As the body and mind relax, they will very naturally receive what is already happening. 
So letting go of directing towards relaxation. 
What is awareness already aware of? What is being received? What is coming to you? Maybe body sensations or feeling tone of pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. 
Maybe emotions or feelings, sounds, moods. 
This can be, this receiving can be very broad, open awareness. 
Or if it's more natural for you, it's also fine to kind of tune in to one particular area of experience and then receive that. 
For some of you that may be more comfortable to just perhaps receive the experience of breathing, to receive body sensation, to receive hearing. 
It's fine to attune to a particular area of experience rather than having the sense of looking at that area of experience. 
The essence of being with it, receiving, receiving it. 
And of course the mind will wander, it will get lost in thought. 
Equally, of course, mindfulness will return at some point. 
And it can be useful at that moment to recognize that awareness has returned. 
Aware, awareness is back. 
And then perhaps checking in whether there has been tension that has crept back into the body and mind while the mind was wandering. 
If so, it can be useful to take some moments to explore relaxing the body and mind again. 
Remembering that that is a condition that's very supportive for our mindfulness. 
It's also fine if it feels supportive for you to stay with the relaxation, that exploration of relaxation. 
Sometimes you may relax for a while and then feel the tension just kind of come back and it's fine to just explore allowing that relaxation. 
Each of us has different conditions in our lives, in our physical and mental experience. 
And it's up for each of us to recognize and understand what's supportive. 
What's supportive for being present with some measure of balance and ease. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
