 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. Yeah, feel free to settle in. Make yourself comfortable. Comfortable meditation posture. That posture that is relaxed and comfortable, but also alert, so you won't fall asleep. And we can start with tuning into the body. Body in the sitting posture. Become aware of that there is sitting. How do you know you're sitting? Certain areas of the body, pressure, others are released. Our brightness of the back. The way your hands are in your lap or on armrest or on your lap, maybe. The feet on the floor or the surface, you need you. This all makes together the sitting posture. Being aware of breathing. The simple rhythm of in and out breath. When you feel the breath in the belly or the chest, the movement there, the pressure of the in breath, release from the out breath. And continually coming back to the breath. Sometimes there might be distractions. Then we can just gently bring the attention back to the breath. Focusing on the breath like this without anything else, giving anything else our attention, just the breath only. You can help to calm the mind a little bit, help the ground be present for this moment. Take a moment to become aware of what feeling tone is present. Is following the breath pleasant? Is it unpleasant? Or is it neutral? Or maybe in the meanwhile other things come up. Thoughts arise or sounds, other body sensations. All of these come with a feeling tone. All of these are pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. These feeling tones often turn into desire, craving, wanting, unpleasant ones, aversion, resistance, unpleasant feeling tones, delusion, confusion, spacing out for the neutral ones. You can also become aware of that layer in the mind, layer of wanting or pushing away, or of just spacing out, confusing, profusement. Feel free to let all experiences just arise and pass away. Whether it's something in the body, something in the mind. You can be aware of that. Whether this is the body or just the mind that you're aware of. Is this a body sensation? Is this a feeling tone? Is this craving or aversion or a certain mood or thoughts? Just let it all happen in a natural way. Being aware of what is most obvious in this moment. We don't have to go out and look for anything. They'll come to us. For a moment it seems like nothing is really happening. You can be aware of nothing really happening. We'll continue in silence. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Simply being aware of what is most obvious. Whether it's something in the body, something in the mind. What's changing? Chain of experiences. One left or the other. Whatever is here right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have a few minutes of meditation. I'd like to take a moment to be grateful towards ourselves. Taking the time to meditate today. My attention. Cultivating the mind and heart. Every moment of mindfulness, awareness. As a moment of wholesomeness. Even if we're mindful of something unwholesome. We're generating a lot of wholesomeness and beneficial energies during our meditation. Goodness that benefits us. We can also share it with all beings everywhere. Then it just gets multiplied. Everything is still there for us, all the goodness. But it's also shared. All beings everywhere benefit from these wholesome energies generated by our meditation. It's going to relate to their wellness, their freedom. Thank you.
