Warm greetings to everyone, and welcome to our meditation time together.
And I love the idea that we're doing this together, so thank you for being part of this and contributing.
So one of the wonderful teachings that have come down to us, I think from a Thai teacher named Ajahn Chah,
and it had to do with someone, I think, and I might be making this up, but something like this that someone was in the monastery,
and there was a lot of noise, and the person went to the monastery, the abbot, and said,
you know, I'm really, all that noise is bothering my meditation. Can you do something about it?
And that teacher said, it isn't that the noise is bothering you, you're bothering the noise.
And this turning it around and not blaming things outside of us for our mental state
is one of the very important movements here in the Buddhist practice.
So it means kind of understanding better our contribution, what we're doing.
So it's certainly possible to, I've had this happen where I was meditating in a retreat with other people,
and someone near me was extremely loud, came in late, came in like a lumberjack with heavy boots,
kind of pounding in, and always out of breath, and then would sit down and spend the next five minutes
seemingly catching his breath, and then we'd then decide later through the middle of sitting to undo his Velcro jacket
and take that off, and then there'd be more kind of little bit heavy breathing for a little while,
and there was all this noise all the time, and I was bothered by his noise,
and when I was bothered by that noise, I had a few critical thoughts about him.
But it was a long retreat, and after a while I just got used to it, and it just kind of expected it,
and after a while it actually became kind of a mindfulness bell.
The times where my mind was drifting off, it reminded me, it helped me realize, oh, I'm drifting off,
I'm back in the present, and this noise is what's brought me back, or what's in the present moment.
And at some point, in no longer became an issue, all the same sounds would be there, and they were just sounds.
And if a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it, is there a sound?
If there is a sound in the meditation hall, and there's no one who reacts to it, is it bothersome?
And so I learned that the sounds say the same, but my contribution changed over time.
And in fact, I was the one who was bothering myself, in a sense.
I was the one who was getting agitated and contracted and around what was going on.
And so understanding this principle goes a long way to learning how to become in meditation,
because then we stop, for many people, many of us, the habitual way of blaming something else outside of us ourselves.
Or say it maybe a little bit more in a useful way, we stop getting involved in blaming whatever it's going on,
or being upset by what's going on, but rather we're learning to turn around and look at how we're upset,
how we're reactive to it, and seeing what aspects of the upsetness that bothersomeness we can just calm down.
It's just our contribution to the situation, it's not inherent in the situation that we need to be bothered or upset by it.
This can be a very challenging teaching idea, and sometimes it can be quite liberating, quite obvious.
But it involves the principle that in meditation, at least there, maybe not elsewhere, at least in meditation,
we are understanding our contribution to our agitation.
And once we understand that, then it's possible for that agitation to calm down.
It's possible for us not to invest energy and time and concerns into that preoccupation,
and it can kind of, you know, maybe it can't stop, but we can maybe more fully return to just breathing, breathing with it,
and over time it just settles because we're not investing in it anymore.
So to take a meditation posture, and so that your eyes can be relaxed,
so that in meditation you're not unconsciously using your eyes to see and look at your breathing, your experience,
before you close your eyes, lower your gaze in a way that's just relaxing.
Wherever low the gaze goes, it's kind of relaxing for the eyes.
Letting the eyes rest in their sockets, not needing to focus on anything.
To lose open focus, the attention goes to relaxing the eyes, cooling the heat of activity in the eyes,
and now to gently close your eyes.
And gently, as if it's the most gentle, caring thing you could do,
take a few deep breaths just deep enough to stay in the zone of care, caring, gentle,
and connecting, connecting to your body breathing with a few long, slow, gentle breaths.
And with the same gentleness, maybe even slowness, as you exhale, let there be a relaxing in your body.
And then let your breathing return to normal.
And perhaps still in a gentle, slow, kind way, on the exhale, relax the muscles of your face.
Maybe letting the mouth fall slightly open or releasing any pressure of the lips against each other.
On the exhale, releasing the shoulders.
And if they don't release a softening in the shoulders.
And as if you have all the time in the world on the exhale, the next few exhales, let there be a softening in the belly.
And then giving yourself over to the experience of your breathing,
of how your body experiences breathing.
So you're not so much in the control tower looking at the breath, thinking about the breath.
But you're noticing the sensations in the body, almost as if the sensations in the body have a chance to reveal themselves.
The sensations of the body breathing.
Keeping yourself centered on your breathing and the peripheral vision, kind of, relax the thinking mind.
Quiet your thinking.
Perhaps even letting go of your thinking on the exhale.
And then also on the exhale now.
Perhaps the exhale can also be like a calm wave moving through your body, calming the body and mind.
Or connecting you to whatever calm is here.
And if there is some calmness here on the inhale as the lungs fill with air, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if there is some calmness here on the exhale, almost like your inhale fills the calm with the sensations of your body.
And if you find yourself upset with something or bothered by something,
and if you find yourself upset with something or bothered by something,
reactive to anything,
provisionally assume that that's your contribution,
that you're the one who's agitating yourself with the bothering.
And see if by doing so you don't invest so much interest or involvement with the, but rather stay with your breathing and let the breathing breathe through or with the agitation, the contraction, the pressure.
Maybe letting the sense of being bothered or upset be in the background and breathing like waves in the body, washing up and down off the sandy shore.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Okay.
A calm or a peace that you're breathing is supported by.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And perhaps from a peaceful calm place.
Living your life with care for others has a different meaning and orientation.
May it be that this meditation that we do supports us in moving through the world with care for the welfare and happiness of everyone, including ourselves.
May we live caring for each other's well being. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free.
Okay.
