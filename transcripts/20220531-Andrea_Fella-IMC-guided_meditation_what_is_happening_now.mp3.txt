 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Beginning with simply connecting with yourself in this space, in this time, wherever you are, in a simple way, just remembering yourself, remembering this body, this mind. And remembering yourself through connecting with how you actually are in this moment, the experience of this moment. It can be useful to begin simply by taking in, in a broader way, how this body is. Is there tension or ease in the body? How the mind is, is the mind active or calm, settled or agitated? And beginning with just simply acknowledging the experience of how you are. And perhaps it is also useful after connecting with how you are, just as you are, to explore the possibility of some relaxation. Relaxation of body, maybe the body can relax a little bit simply through checking in and seeing if there are places where tension is held and perhaps exploring the softening. Maybe the head, the face can relax. The neck, the shoulders, arms and hands. Maybe the upper torso can soften and relax. All those muscles around the rib cage. Maybe the stomach, the abdomen, middle and lower back can relax the hips, the legs, the feet. Maybe too there can be a little bit of relaxation possible more inside the body, internally in the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can soften. Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can soften and relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can soften and relax. And then maybe too there can be a little bit of softening in the mind. Tension in the mind is often expressed through worries or concerns, the mind looping in thought, either about past or future. Just letting yourself, give yourself this time, for this time here, maybe the mind can put that down for now. Put down the looping thoughts in favor of meeting how you are. Not meeting how you are can be a relaxation of mind. Maybe the mind can relax and be willing to simply connect. Be curious, as a dear friend might be curious about how you are. That is what mindfulness can be with us. Meeting how we are without judgment and without indulging. Simply this is how it is right now. Opening to how it is moment after moment. This itself is a way of practicing. Settling back and being curious how things are in this moment and connecting with how it changes from moment to moment. Body sensations change, sound changes, moods and emotions change. One way of practicing rather than trying to hold on to any particular experience is simply to rest with the flow or shifting, changing landscape of this human experience. And at times it is challenging to be with that flow of changing experience. Sometimes it can be useful to choose a particular aspect of experience such as the breath or body. Explore, connecting with that, how is that experience? The shifting landscape of that experience of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of the experience of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of the experience of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. The shifting landscape of hearing or body, maybe the breath. And of course the mind will wander, it caught into thoughts, worries or concerns. Just drift off perhaps. And mindfulness will return, there will be a remembering, that moment of remembering. Can you recognize in that moment that mindfulness is back? This is what it's like to be aware again. And how are you in that moment? What is the experience of that, of mindfulness returning? What is it returning with? Often it is returning with something that has been shaped by the wandering. So to just acknowledge that, there might be some emotions or body sensations that have come in in connection with the wandering. That's useful to acknowledge. Oh, this is how I am right now. Can the heart open? Can the mindfulness open to that? And having opened to that, having acknowledged that, if there is tension that has crept into the system, if you're aware that there's tension again, or more tension than before, it can be helpful to remind yourself of relaxation, perhaps explore relaxing the body and mind again. This is a connection with our system, with being with ourselves, to be aware and to explore relaxation. And relaxation supports our capacity to be with what's here. So if there is a possibility of relaxing that can be supportive. Opening to how you are again, this moment. Whether the broader sense of settling back and simply receiving whatever wants to show up, whatever is obvious, or whether it's a more directed exploration of the breath or body, aware of and being with a changing flow of experience.
