 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Arriving with yourself, however you are, with this body, in this physical being, however it is, with your mind, however it is, with this question of how are you in your body and mind, not asking it to try to get an answer or think about it, but to feel into how are you, this kind of exploration, to really open to yourself in this way, to have that curiosity. How is this body, how is this mind? This is actually quite a kind thing to do for ourselves. So perhaps you can touch into that quality of kindness or friendliness or care for yourself, to sit in this place and time and to be with yourself. That beautiful wholesome quality of care, really of meta for yourself, simply to be with yourself. So this practice of opening to experience, allowing our experience, curiosity about what's here, it carries along with it or can carry along with it, cultivate along with it, this kindness and care and concern for ourselves. So maybe we can just touch a little bit that sense, this act of settling back, opening to how are you right now, contains that flavor of love, care. Whether what's happening is easy or difficult, pleasant or unpleasant, that quality of care can support us to meet what is here. And if you don't feel it directly, perhaps just a simple kind of reminder to yourself, this is a kind thing to do, might support touching in that flavor of care. And with any sense of that flavor of allowing of care, connecting, allowing yourself to be as you are, fully as you are in this moment. However you are is okay. So this takes some trust. That it's okay to be with yourself as you are. And that trust too is connected to the beautiful and wholesome qualities of mind. If a dear friend were sitting with us and was able to just simply sit with us and let us be completely as we are without pushing anything away or trying to fix us or change us, but just willing to take us in. Oh, that's how you are right now. I think we would probably feel that as being very cared for, very loved. And our mindfulness can have that connecting, caring quality like a dear friend, meeting us just as we are. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
