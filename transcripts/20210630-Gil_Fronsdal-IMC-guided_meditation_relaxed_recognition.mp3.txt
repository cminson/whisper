 So we'll sit mostly quietly today, but I do want to emphasize the role of recognition. And imagine that you're, maybe that you're sitting in your usual way. But imagine that it's as if you're in an easy chair or in leaning against an oak tree looking at a river or pastoral scene. And you're at ease and content and happy, settling back. And in this settled back you're observing, you're just allowing what's happening to appear for you. No reaching out, no trying to figure anything out, no trying to make anything happen. Just settling back and letting everything just come to you and show itself to you. And your awareness, your eyesight is open, your eyesight is receptive, your hearing is receptive. All the perceptions, all doors are open to receive. And then in the most easy way possible, relax almost as if it's from the deep inner place of relaxation, of ease. But with a little bit of clarity, use a single word to recognize what it is that's arising in awareness. No hurry, but just an irregular kind of stream of recognition. A thought, body sensation, sound, inhale. Just very simple in this kind of relate back way. And the recognition is a little bit the tether to the present moment. So you don't wander off, just you stay there, you stay there. So let's sit that way quietly and we'll find our way. So, I'm gonna take my chair. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, one way or another, we have a connection, a relationship to other beings, other living beings, other people, some people we know, we know of, but there are plenty of people who are important for our lives and our lives are cared for, who we don't know and we'll never know. But the circles of people who do things that support our lives, the circle of living life on this planet that keeps us alive is in some kind of way part of us inseparable. And one of the ways to care for ourselves is to care for all these people, all these beings. And one of the ways to care for all these beings is to care for ourselves. And a way to do both simultaneously is to sit quietly with goodwill in all directions, goodwill towards oneself, goodwill to the world, simply a radiance of goodwill, circles of goodwill that spread from us. Turns out that having goodwill is one of the best nourishments we can offer ourselves. And may each of us start our day or continue our day, end our day wherever you are, remembering that you have a capacity for goodwill, for well-wishing, for kindness. And as we go forth from this meditation, may we go forth with the wish that all beings be happy, that all beings be safe, that all beings be peaceful, and that all beings be free. May we benefit from this wish as much as others do. Thank you.
