So now we have a choice at this point. There's a half an hour for walking or a Q&A, either
one, whichever works best for you in your practice today. So if you'd like to go walking,
I welcome you to leave. And if you'd like to stay and ask a question or just be present
for the Q&A, that's fine as well. And also, as a reminder, you know, we record the whole
day of practice. So if you're part of the Q&A and if you ask a question, if you'd prefer
not to have that recorded, my husband happens to be the recorder for this day. And so we'll
just we can just delete the questions that where people would rather not have them shared
online. So just let me know. And there's there was just I think still only one question in
the in the retreat basket question basket. And you're also welcome to just raise your
zoom hand if you'd like to ask a question, but I'll start with the question that was
in the basket. So the question is, and I think I just won't even read the name of the person
who asked so that so there's confidentiality there. When I meditate, sometimes my head
moves side to side, or my body sways without my intention. I wonder why. And that's it's
not uncommon for that to happen. And there are a couple of different possibilities, several
actually. One is that when when we kind of get deep in meditation, sometimes the there's
a sort of release in the in the nervous system that allows the body to move or causes the
body to move causes the head to move to sway. And often that's associated with deepening
concentration. So that can happen. And then there can also be just a kind of release in
the nervous system that that causes that kind of movement as well. So it's not something
you know, to assign a lot of significance to. It's just a kind of artifact of meditation
often that that that this kind of movement happens. And in different traditions, you
know, it's given different meanings. But in our tradition, we tend not to give it meaning
at all just to say that it's, it's a kind of natural function of the body. And for some
of us that happens, and for some it doesn't, it's true for me when I'm actually when I
get quite concentrated, often my body moves a little bit in the kind of swaying motion
quite rhythmic. So don't worry about it. And and don't have to sign too much significance
to it. And if it's enjoyable, you know, just pay attention to it, don't make it more don't
exacerbate it, you know, don't add to it, just just be present to it, meet it. And then
there's another question here. Sometimes when I meditate, I'll get more agitated or angry
than when I started. What do I have to do? Do I stop meditating? Thank you. No, I didn't
I wouldn't suggest you stop meditating. I think sometimes I don't know if you're a new practitioner
and person who asked this. But I think sometimes when we're relatively new to practice, what
happens is that we become aware of things in meditation that were happening all along
in our lives that we didn't notice. So when we become quiet, when the mind becomes quiet
and mindful, it's not being distracted by all our our daily activities, then some underlying
difficult kinds of emotions can arise some kinds of like agitation and anger that could
be those could be those could arise. And so that's one possibility. And also, sometimes
I think there's a kind of resistance to actually meditating, there's maybe there's something
we don't want to see that's arising in our mind, or maybe we're just not used to sitting
still and it's we find it boring and irritating for that reason. And so it's something to
be met that kind of any kind of arising of emotion is something to be met with kindness
and with investigation. And I don't know if you've heard of the the technique that is
often taught in relation to working with emotions in meditation, rain is one version
of it. It stands for recognize, allow or accept, investigate and then not identify. And the
the the idea is to recognize what is this that's arising. Oh, it's anger or oh, it's
agitation. And then to allow it to be there, which doesn't mean we approve of it being
there just means that we recognize Oh, yeah, this is what's happening now. And, okay, this
is what's happening now here it is. And then investigating it is not thinking about it
not analyzing or evaluating coming to some kind of conclusion about it. It's just keeping
the mind and the heart very close to it feeling into it in the body. What's the effect of
this in my body? What's the effect in my mind? Is it generating some kind of thinking? And
just being present to it with a kind awareness. Okay, this is what's happening. And then the
last step that the end of rain is to not identify, which means you don't really take it personally
just to recognize that this is something arising due to causes and conditions. It's not within
my control. It's not who I am. And then just just sit with it. And if you are new to practice,
I would highly recommend taking an introduction to mindfulness class, you know, the IMC offers
classes really often series of classes five or six weeks, which goes through how to work
with all kinds of different aspects of our mental activity, our heart activity, including
emotions that are kind of challenging. So I would recommend that. And so now I'm open
to questions from any of you would like to raise your zoom hand and see if there's anybody.
Okay, someone wrote a question in a text. Suggestions for how to how to approach meditation
when breathing is uncomfortable. Thank you for asking that's a really useful question
because for a lot of people, the breath is not a good anchor for meditation. I love it.
And a lot of people do love it because it's rhythmic. And for us, it's soothing. But I
know for a lot of people, if you've had trouble with breathing, if you've had some kind of
traumatic experience that involves not being able to breathe, all kinds of reasons that
the breath isn't a good anchor for for some. So finding something in the body that that
is that you can pay attention to another sensation, another aspect of sensory experience, like
sometimes we'll we'll suggest the feeling of your hands in the lap in your lap, just
feeling them. They're there in your lap or on your thighs wherever you tend to put your
hands. And then just keeping your connection to them. So continuing to come back just the
way you come back to the breath if you went off into thought or fantasy or whatever. Just
coming back to feeling what's there, you know, maybe the warmth, there might be tingling,
there might be pulsation, especially as you continue to pay attention, the sense of your
your hands against the clothing that is touching or the skin that is touching on your on your
legs and the temperature to 19 temperature, and that's warmth or coolness, just recognizing
the quality of the sensations that are there. That can be really useful. When when, often
when people do standing meditation, there's a lot of bodily experience to pay attention
to the sense of balance, the sense of just the what's called proprioception, you know,
the sense of the body in space that can be that can be useful to pay attention to. So
standing meditation is a kind of a good alternative. Also, I think if you don't resonate with
the breath. So, you know, different parts of the body are in soles of the feet on the
floor or if you sit in a in a cross legged position on a cushion, then sense of the thighs
or the buttocks on the cushion someplace where there's solidity. Of course, there are other
other ways of practicing mindfulness meditation. The the the elements, as they're referred
to in in the Sautiputana Sutra and other sutras that the sense of solidity, sense of flexibility,
sense of air in the body, sense of movement, all those can be subjects for meditation to
just what we're doing, of course, is we're training our attention to stay mindfulness
develops when our attention is able to stay with an object become more clear. And and
so the what the what we pay attention to isn't really that important. It's just the training
of the mind to stay. That's important. So experiment with parts of the body. Or if you
want to do a four elements meditation, there's a lot of, you know, you could just Google
that and there's a lot of information about it. I'm sure there are a lot of guided meditations
as well on on audio dharma and dharma seed and all over on the web. So that's helpful.
Anyone else?
Oh, another question. Okay, let's see. Okay, here we go. Let me see.
How do I respond? Okay, when I'm sitting in meditation and noticing what comes up, how
do I respond to what comes up? Do I investigate in the moment or wait until meditation is
over? How to respond to thoughts about work that won't go away? This happens often when
I'm meditating. Yeah, that's a good question too. I think our our general guidance is when
you're meditating, don't think about anything. You know, just let it go at the time. What
you the way to respond to what comes up is just to be aware of it to know it. Okay, there's
a thought about work. There's a thought about what I should do maybe at work, something
like that. And then just know it as a thought and see if you can just let it go. And if
you can't let it go, know that. Oh, I'm really attached to this thought. I can't stop thinking.
Because if thinking goes on for a long time, we'll suggest saying, okay, stop, not going
to think right now. It's not usually too successful. But if all else fails, that's one suggestion.
But mostly what we want to encourage is just knowing what's happening. What's happening
is thinking. And it's not really useful to think. It takes us away from our present moment,
you know, moment to moment experience of what's going on in the body. It is what's going on
in the mind. But if we just know it simply as thinking, that's fine. And then after we've come
out in meditation, then that's the appropriate time to just think about to think about whatever
it is we need to think about. And so often when thoughts are repetitive, when they won't go away,
as you mentioned, they sometimes thoughts about work won't go away. If they're repetitive thoughts,
if they come back often, that often indicates that there is some kind of emotion underneath them,
driving them. And so in that case, it's often useful to use that, that
rain technique that I described, RAIN. And if you're not familiar with that, you can also google
that. And there's a lot about it on the, on the web. Tara Brock is kind of an expert in that area.
And, and Gil has a similar, Bill Fronstahl has a similar technique, which is raft. It's slightly
different, but RAFT and I would, you could look that up as well and see, they're both, they're
really useful practices for working with emotions. And often when thoughts are repetitive, when they
keep coming back, they have, it's because there is an emotion underneath them that really needs to be
investigated. Yeah, I'm a worry person. How can I help not to worry so much?
That there are some people who can resonate with that one.
And I think one thing about worry is it doesn't help. I think often when we are
worriers, we have a sense that if I stop worrying about this, something bad will happen,
that somehow worrying is productive. But if we look at it, I think we can recognize it's not,
it isn't helpful. It's just, it just keeps the mind in a kind of spin keeps it, when we worry,
it generates thoughts that causes to worry more. And then that worry can generate more thoughts.
It gets to be like a squirrel on one of those wheels just going around and around. Or sometimes we say
going down the rabbit hole, proliferative thought can arise out of the worry. So
to recognize A, it's just not useful. And B, to maybe investigate not on the cushion, but
in daily life, do the things that you worry about, do they actually happen? How often are you
accurate in your prediction of something that's worrying you, the prediction that something's
going to happen? Often I think when we do that, we find that most of what we worry about is not
really, it's not actually going to happen. So working in that way, if you're kind of a chronic
worrier is useful. There's a teacher, James Berra, who teaches at Spirit Rock, and he often tells a
story about his mother who was a real worrier, just worried all the time. And he asked her to do this,
she wasn't a Buddhist practitioner, but he asked her to do this practice. Every time she had a
worried thought, he asked her to add to it, and I'm really blessed. And she began doing that,
she would worry, oh, golly, I think I'm really worried, I'm not going to have the time to pay
that bill. And I'm really blessed. And even though it was just was kind of fake, you know, really,
but she did it, she did it as a practice. And she said it really had an effect after several
weeks or maybe a couple months of just of always adding the opposite, actually, of worry
to her thinking, it shifted, it shifted her thinking, and she she began to worry less and less. So
that's another possible possible kind of antidote to the tendency to worry.
Let's see here. Someone asked about the online mindfulness class series,
that's talked by IMC. If you go to the IMC website,
it's pretty easy to find. Actually, maybe you're on, I wonder if you could, if you could find.
Yeah, thank you. That'd be great. You post it. And then somebody else asked, what are your
thoughts on doing a personal non guided multi day personal retreat? I think that's a, if you have
an established practice and feel like you have the discipline to stick with it,
and and don't need guidance, I think it's a great idea. It's it's a really good idea. And often,
people who I know, and myself, use the recorded retreat, to get some input, you know, when
we're doing a self retreat, so you can listen, you can listen to the talks that one of your
favorite teachers gave on a retreat and kind of that way, you might have a theme for your
retreat, if you want one, or it's possible just to, just to sit and walk and sit and walk and
sit and walk. That's possible as well. But I tend to, if I'm doing self retreat, I tend to want to
add a little Dharma, a little Dharma understanding a little of the teachings to my retreat. So
I'll read something or definitely listen, usually listen to talks by teachers who I really,
I really appreciate, usually on a theme to keep it going. So I think it's, it's, it's best at first
to sit retreats where you get guidance from a teacher and you get, you have a structure that
kind of holds you, allows you to develop discipline, but then after you've got that discipline within
you, go for it, you know, non guided, multi day personal retreat is a great thing to do.
Any other questions?
Any more questions? Okay, I'll refresh.
Let's see if I can.
Yeah, someone asked about uncomfortable physical sensations like legs falling asleep, etc.
Asking should you change position or work through it? Is it your body or is your body trying to
distract the mind? I think
that's a, that's a great question as well. And it's, it's something that you have to kind of
develop some experience with in your own practice. Sometimes you're, when you're uncomfortable,
it's because you're actually damaging your body, you know, and sometimes it's just what we call
meditation pain. And it's, you know, I, I tend not to encourage people to sit through pain,
especially if it's, you know, if it continues for a long time. And let me just see something here.
Yeah, okay. And if your legs fall asleep, for example, did you mention that? Yeah,
if your legs fall asleep, and when you stand up for meditation, or and begin to move very soon,
the sensation comes back, of course, it's important to stand up carefully. If your legs
have fallen asleep, sometimes the muscles don't work so well. And if the sensations
dissipate within a couple of minutes, and you start to feel normal, then that's great. But if
your legs, if the, if the sensation doesn't come back, that's a sign you might be pinching a nerve
somewhere, and that's definitely not something you want to do. So you just have to kind of experiment
and see, am I harming my body or not? We don't have really strong guidance in this, in this
practice, about not moving. It's not like Zen practice, where the the postures are really,
really staying in the posture is a really important part of the practice. We do encourage
stillness, because stillness of body really is compatible with stillness of mind, it encourages
stillness of mind. But if there's, if there's pain, and there could be damage, then
it's unlikely that the mind is going to be still. So, so changing your position to be more comfortable
is fine. But, you know, you just have to, I think you just have to experiment and see, is this really,
some, is this really physical pain that is in some way dangerous? Could I be harming myself? Or is it
what we call meditation pain, that somehow just disappears as soon as we stand up and walk around?
And I hope that's useful. And though, and then someone mentioned that for Tara Brock, the
Annan rain is for nurture, yes, right. She has switched it from the original, which was not
identified. So, recognize, allow, or accept, investigate, and then nurture yourself, offer
yourself some meta or compassion for feeling this difficult emotion. So, let's see, is there any
more? Now, refresh again and see. I think that's it. Well, I think, you know, we have five minutes
until the next sit, which is the final sit of the day. And then I'll be giving a little
darn met after that to close out our day. So, you might want to take this opportunity to
refresh, use the bathroom, whatever is necessary. And then we'll gather at
315 California time in four minutes to sit again. So, thank you. Thank you for your questions.
Great questions.
