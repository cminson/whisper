Practice Note: The Shape of Awareness  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

In terms of the practice , I am inspired to say some 
things about awareness , prompted by whatever was 
going on out in the street . I think that they’re cleaning 
out or drilling a major sewer line . There was all this loud, 
grinding motor sound that was strong enough that I was 
vibrating a little bit inside . It was quite nice [laughs ]. So I 
thought I’d say something about awareness.  
 
Awareness is not a thing ; it’s a process . It’s probably 
many processes that come together . And so the idea of 
being aware is, for some people, a strange idea in that 
awareness is not a thing . When we bri ng our awareness 
to awareness  itself, it’s quite fluid, quite flexible . In part, 
awareness is  what we say it is . We partly define it  and 
create it by how we engage in it, how we frame it, how 
we apply it.  
 
I think of awareness as being more like water than a 
container . Water can flow into any kind of container and 
take the shape of the container . And awareness can 
flow into all kinds of containers  – the container being the 
definition we have for it, or what’s needed for it at any 
particular time . Part of becoming free is to have fluidity  – and for awareness take different shapes at different 
times.  
 
For example , in mindfulness practice sometimes the 
mindfulness or the awareness becomes very narrow 
and precise – like putting  our experience under  a 
magnify ing glass or a microscope . It gets very focused. 
At other times , awareness can become more like a 
wide-angle lens . It becomes very broad , spacious , and 
open . And it is possible to go back and forth between  
these two modes.  
 
It’s possible for awareness to feel itself quite 
independent from what it’s aware of . Sometimes 
awareness can feel like a very safe cave or refuge 
where all kinds of stuff goes on  around us  and within us . 
And you feel you’re not really touched by it . You’re free 
of it. You’re independent of it, cozy in that inner 
sanctuary of awareness that is not touched by the 
things around you.  
 
Sometimes awareness is not held as something 
separate from experience , but rather awareness is not 
apart from it because it  becomes the experienc e. It 
becomes what’s going on , and there’s no separation at 
all. There’s no sanctuary away from things . That’s too 
dualistic and separate , and can hold things at bay 
sometimes . Rather , awareness can become 
transparently porous and penetrated by everything . There’s a freedom that can come when there’s no 
separation : things just arise and pass through.  
 
So with that loud sound that was going on , what I did 
was I just became the sound . I could see periodically 
how thoughts arose: “This is too loud, ” or “Maybe too 
much, ” or “Maybe I should go out and talk to them? ” 
[laughs] Different kinds of thoughts arose , and I could 
see how my thoughts created a separation between me 
and the sound , which could lend itself to me suffering , 
or being caught up . And the mo st peaceful thing to do 
was to become the sound – to let go of the thoughts that 
were separating me from the sound , and to let the 
sound completely fill my awareness and fill me.  
 
It was quite interesting . Any time there was a thought 
that took me away fr om the sound , or if I judge d the 
sound , or separat ed from the sound – I just let go of it , 
and became the sound again . In that way,  there was not 
a problem to have the sound there. I got pretty peaceful 
with it, pretty present . And it was interesting to see as 
time went along , the shifts within me among  how I felt 
the sound, how I experienced it, how it filled awareness, 
how it was there . Then at some point , the workers  
moved on down the street  and were no longer there.  
 
The idea that awareness is not a thing , but rather 
something we shape , and use , and apply in different 
ways comes into play when we practice . We can be curious about : “What’s this thing called awareness? 
What is it to be aware of something? What is it to be 
aware o f the breath? How am I when I’m being aware of 
the breath? Do I hold myself separate from the breath 
and watch it from above? Do I watch it from inside? 
Does awareness go inside and feel it? ” 
 
Sometimes we feel apart from our  awareness, 
sometimes right in the middle of it , sometimes  sensing it 
from the inside and out . Sometimes awareness feels 
very contracted ; sometimes it feels very broad ; 
sometimes it feels that the awareness is entangled with 
our emotions and our attitudes and we’re aware with 
fear, or desire, or expectation , or striving.  Or is there no 
food coloring in the awareness , and a wareness is 
independent of our attitudes and feelings ? We can be 
aware of them , but we’re not somehow swayed by 
them.  
 
In some ways it’s a mystery , in the sense that  it’s so 
variable what awareness is . It takes so many different 
shapes . As you practice today , you might get curiou s, 
not only about what you’re aware of  – paying attention 
to your breath or your feet as you walk – but you also 
might get curious about the awareness that knows, the 
mindfulness knows, that capacity of being conscious . 
What’s the shape? What’s the quality of your 
consciousness here?  
 You’re only conscious in the present moment , and so if 
you’re curious and interested in consciousness and 
aware ness , it might shift your perspective about the 
things you take so personally,  the things you think are 
so important: your feelings, your emotions, what 
happened yesterday at work , or whatever . It puts you 
right here . The awareness that knows all this  – what is 
that?   
 
Thank you.
