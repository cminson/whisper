So let's sit together. At a yoga teacher. Sometimes say, what is what is light make heavy what is heavy make light. A posture and an Asana. What is light make heavy what is heavy make light pointing to this gesture of smoothing out smoothing out body mind. Evening out the energy is a body mind. We can use the breath as a way of unifying smoothing energies of the moment. What is hyped up hyper active. Bring the soothing breath to that constellation of feeling in my chest. Breathe into that. Maybe there are places of of numbness or tea and spa. Now we breathe life into it. Spine reaching upwards to the sky. The rest of the body hanging the sleigh. Unifying the field with breathing, breathing the breath in your whole body. You You You You You You You You What would we do if we weren't busy clinging is inherently agitating complicating and so easy to repeat our habits of greed version as we sit and yet practice is practicing non clinging. I use that word practicing in the same sense that one might practice a free throw playing basketball. You You Energy somewhere in body mind. what is heavy make light. We smooth out the energy especially of our body. The energy especially of our body. And rather than acting out greed, we practice, practice. Practice equanimity with longing. Rather than act out aversion, we practice equanimity with imperfection. This way, our moment starts to get very simple. Clinging is complicated. And letting go feels very simple. Simplifies. You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you the moment can get very simple. Sacred really. And saying, sense of the Dharma and sense of the Dharma You're coursing through it. Just the rest there is enough. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
