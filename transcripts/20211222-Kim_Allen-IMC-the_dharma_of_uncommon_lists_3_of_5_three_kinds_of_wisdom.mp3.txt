The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, so today we are continuing with the Dharma of Uncommon Lists and so that
means that today we will explore a list of three and I want to talk about the
three kinds of wisdom that are mentioned in the suttas. Wisdom is such an
important quality in the Buddhist teachings that maybe it's not
surprising that it's considered multi-dimensional and these three are
sometimes mentioned in Dharma talks but not often in much detail and usually
the first two of them are minimized but I like to think of these three kinds of
wisdom as forming a kind of ecology in the heart and mind where we need each one
to support the others so all three are important. There is one that of course is
more liberating than the others that's why the other two get minimized but I
see them as an ecology that are that are all of them should be there. So the first
is called the wisdom of hearing or listening. So this is a kind of
understanding or wisdom that comes from listening. We are listening to teachings
generally so it's good to listen to things that are worth listening to for
at least part of our day. So that means hearing the Dharma, we can listen to
audio Dharma, we can come to talks like this. In these days I think listening
probably includes reading where we take things in also through the linguistic
part of our mind and we can also maybe include talking with wise friends as I
am hearing, listening to what they say. So sometimes people want to discount the
wisdom of hearing or listening as just the first step but
nonetheless hearing the Dharma is actually listed as one of the factors for
reaching the first stage of awakening. It said that we need wise attention and
the voice of another. So I assume that means we need to hear the Dharma, most of
us. So this form of wisdom is called sutta maya panya, panya being the word
for wisdom and then sutta, that's not the teachings, sutta is that's s-u-t-t-a,
this is sutta s-u-t-a, it's a different word and it means what is heard. So
sutta means what is heard and in other contexts this word sutta is used to
mean learning or one who has learned so it has to do also with learning. I think
that's kind of interesting because anything that involves thinking tends to
get short shrift in the Dharma world and certainly it's true that we you know
spending a lot of time thinking on the cushion is distracting but across the
teachings it would be hard to ignore that the Buddha did emphasize the
importance of learning and so I want to quote from a sutta that talks about
learning as a form of wealth. It says this way, and what is the wealth of
learning? Here a noble disciple has learned much, remembers what they have
learned and accumulates they have learned. Those teachings that are good in the
beginning, good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and
phrasing which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life, such
teachings as these they have learned much of, retained in mind, recited
verbally, mentally investigated and penetrated well by view. So that's kind
of a lot, no.
