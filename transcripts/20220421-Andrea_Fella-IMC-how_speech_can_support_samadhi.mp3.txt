The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Tonight I thought to respond to a question that came in last week or a
couple weeks ago I guess the last time I was here. It was after the last time I
was here. And it's a question about, I'll just read the question, the first
part of the question. I've been curious about the connection between speech and
samadhi, that is concentration. Both the deeper kinds of samadhi in formal
practice and the natural open flavors of samadhi in everyday life. A few
instructions from the suttas have resonated. Samadhi imbued with sila,
sila being ethical conduct, speech conducive to samadhi, and clear
recognition when keeping silent. Later it basically says, I'd love to hear
anything that sparks for you, so I'm going to start there. Just what this has
sparked for me, this kind of question about the connection between speech and
samadhi. In other words for samadhi, it's often translated as concentration, but it
also can be translated as collected, composed, stable, settled, those kinds
of words, what samadhi means. In meditation samadhi is often the collectiveness of
mind that comes as we sit, and the mind kind of settles down, it lets go of the
thoughts, and kind of the running around of the mind, just kind of running
around all over the place as the mind starts to stay stable in the present
moment. In our meditation, it usually feels pretty good to have that happen, you
know, to just have the mind kind of settle, collect, and be able to just be
with ourselves. Thoughts may come through, thoughts aren't necessarily counter
to having that collectiveness of mind, it's where we're not kind of picking up
on those thoughts and running off with them. So the the collectiveness of mind
is, it's understood as being kind of the place where we can start to really see
what's happening in our experience. Without that collectiveness of mind, we're
kind of bouncing all over the place and not able to really connect with what's
happening for us and to see what's going on in our hearts and minds. So samadhi
is a pretty important aspect of our practice. In the Buddhist teaching, in the
path that the Buddha talked about, the Noble Eightfold Path, samadhi is the
third part of the Eightfold Path. It starts with wisdom, wise view, wise
understanding, and wise intention. And then based on that understanding, the
wise perspective of what would be helpful and what would be unhelpful, what
would support us in moving towards harmony, towards ease and peace in our
hearts and minds, then the the intention is supporting a connection with
sila, ethical conduct. That's the next piece of the path, this connection with
wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, actions that are conducive to
harmony, conducive to non-harm.
Given that the path of practice, the the aim that the question the Buddha
started out with is how might it be possible to not have this
suffering? Is it possible to live with with ease and peace? Is it possible to
not suffer? Then the the actions that put suffering into the world would be
things that we would want to avoid. And so this is the second part of the Eightfold
Path, the the connection with wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood. In
terms of what supports relationship, connection, care, love, what supports
harmony, what supports not harming. And then from there the path moves towards
the the the shaping of the path moves towards not only kind of cleaning up or
creating harmony in our relational world, but also creating harmony in our
inner mind, in our inner world. And that is strengthened by wise
effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration. So that's where Samadhi is
in the path that those three together are the Samadhi aspect of the path, the
Buddha's path. And so Sela comes before Samadhi in the in the path. Ethical
conduct, non-harming supports the movement of heart and mind towards
settling down. And we can see how this connects actually just if we think about
it a little bit. If we engage in actions that do create harm, engage in speech
that's harsh or unkind or false, if we if we do that then you know it it may it
may make us like feel some relief in the moment as we say something to somebody,
but it will kind of rebound on us. So having done something that created a
disharmony in our relationships, then when we sit down to try to I mean
basically that that impacts our mind. It's not just in the outer it's not just
in the relational field that that creates a wobble. It also creates an
internal wobble in our minds. When we speak harshly, we speak divisively, we
speak falsely, we engage in actions that harm others. And so that that wobble in
relationship kind of translates into a wobble in our minds. And that wobble in
our minds means it's pretty hard to to stay stable in meditation. So the the
connection, one of the connections of how speech and Samadhi connect is if
there is speech kind of if the if the if you're engaging in a speech that's
unskillful, it will create tension, it will create struggle, it will create
stress in the mind, it will create perhaps regret, it will create that that wobble
in the mind. And so when you try to sit down to meditate what happens often is
that you're you start thinking about those things. The mind goes off gets caught
thinking about those things instead of being able to settle. So that's a direct
connection to how how speech can connect to Samadhi. This is really the the
connection of ethical conduct with the mind that can settle. When we engage in
any kind of harm, harmful conduct, it makes it really hard for the mind to to
not be pulled into thinking about that. Either self-justification, it might be
well they deserved that or I was right. The mind will be not able to to settle
into just being with things as they are often. Because what's going on with
things as they are is the mind is feeling pretty rattled, pretty unsettled, and we
don't tend to like that. We can be with that. That is it is possible for us to
turn towards those feelings. Wow, this is what it's like to be a human being
that has said something that hurt someone. And that's what we would have to do
in order to have the mind moving more in the direction of Samadhi again, more in
the direction of collecting and gathering. But there's a lot of challenge
with that. It's not it's not easy and it's not certainly not pleasant to meet
ourselves when we have harmed someone. It feels off. And so the the Buddha
encourages us to engage in actions that don't harm so that we can
settle, so that our minds can settle. And then there's a lot of support that we
have, you know, that we have to, you know, look at what's happened. If we have done
something that's created harm, then looking at our minds there, understanding
what's happened, understanding the feeling of this is what it's like to be a
human being that's created harm, that will begin to allow the mind to settle
again. But it's a lot of a lot of work to get through or to kind of move through
that wobbliness. So that's one piece that unskillful speech and speech, unskillful
speech is said to be four. There's four kinds of unskillful speech, false speech,
harsh speech, divisive speech. Those three kinds of speech are really in the
terrain of harmful speech. The fourth kind of speech might not really be
harmful in the conventional way, but it is, it creates wobbliness in the mind.
And that fourth kind of speech is what's called an idle chatter. So that's, you
know, what the the the suttas describe that one as being talk that has no
purpose, talk that has no point at all. And that is just said to kind of make
the mind kind of scattered, restless. You know, it's not it's not conducive to
settling because the mind kind of will just pick up on all kinds of random
things. You know, if you if you do a lot of the Buddha teaches the one of the
Buddha's famous sayings is whatever one frequently ponders, that becomes the
inclination of the mind. So if you frequently ponder kind of stuff that
doesn't matter, you frequently talk about stuff that is purpose, purposeful
list, purposeless, then that will be the tendency of the mind. It won't want to
engage in something purposeful. It won't want to engage in connecting, collecting,
settling and engaging with the practice. So that kind of speech also counters or
runs counter to a settling of the mind. So that's that's one side of the
connection between speech and particularly why speech and samadhi. When
we when we engage in speech that's not harmful, it's much easier to settle and
collect in in the meditation. And that's my understanding of what the
phrase samadhi imbued with sila means. That you know when we when we engage when
we when we engage in non-harmful speech, when we engage in speech that is not
false, not harsh, not divisive, our mind is much more settled. It's just not it's
not going to be so shaken up before not engaging in idle chatter. There's going
to be a lot more capacity for subtleness. The other piece around concentration, one
of the ways concentration is sometimes defined, the kind of the mind moving
into concentration when the hindrances are abandoned. So the hindrances are
five energies, we could say five qualities or activities in our mind that
keep the mind from being settled. And those five are desire, sense desire, ill
will, restlessness, sleepiness, sloth and torpor, and doubt. So with those when
those five are present we are not concentrated. And the definition of
concentration is basically the fading away of those hindrances. As those
hindrances begin to weaken, then the mind moves to concentration. And so if you
just listen to those, you know, it's like, okay, sense desire, ill will, the sense
desire, you know, certain kinds of speech, harmful speech, or you know speech
speech about so divisive speech or harsh speech could be could and lying also
could be motivated by wanting something from someone or wanting to have
something that somebody else has or something like that, could also be
motivated by ill will by not liking something, by wanting to have somebody
do something different. So the the harsh speech, divisive speech, lying could be
motivated by those hindrances. And so cultivating that kind of speech is just
reinforcing those hindrances as well. And so it also the very kind of definition
of concentration where concentration is the the release of those hindrances. So
engaging in in unwise speech, we are already pretty far from concentration
because those kinds of unwise speech are connected to those hindrances.
Restlessness also. The restless mind might be the one with the idle chatter. So
there's the those hindrances are that the the engagement with false with with
wrong speech with speech that causes harm is already connected to those
hindrances. So that's another way that there's this connection between speech
and Samadhi. That's the kind of the disconnection between wrong speech. When
there's wrong speech there is not going to be Samadhi. And so then the connection
with wise speech is that it conduces to it creates it supports the conditions for
Samadhi to to be there. The other side of the question that this has kind of
sparked in me is the question around more in daily life. What does it mean? You
know, how does how does speech support a settledness of mind? How might so like
skillful and mindful speech? How does that connect to composure, collectedness
in the kind of concentration that the collectedness that we experience the
possibility of a collected mind in daily life where the mind is, you know, able to
be with experience aware of what's happening moment to moment. That's
another way concentration is understood not just the settledness and
collectedness of mind in concentration but the mind being able to be present
not pulled out into thought not lost in thought but able to be with ourselves
moment after moment. It's another way that concentration is understood in in the
practice. And so how can certain kinds of speech support that? So this is this is
kind of moves into the direction of first of all skillful speech and if we're
not speaking skillfully then we are as I just said we're kind of cultivating
those qualities that keep us from being collected and settled. But if assuming
we're speaking in skillful ways then there's also the piece of connecting to
being aware while we're speaking because that is so hard. It is not it's not an
easy it's not an easy place to be mindful. We have a very strong habit of the
mind getting lost while we're speaking losing track of being present. And so
the kind of the question is well I lose that connection with with the present
moment when I'm speaking how how might I stay connected? So there's a lot to say
about this I'll just say I'll just say a few things and then and then open it up
for some reflections or questions.
The first piece for me in exploring being aware while speaking is really just
to keep it so simple. We might be trying to and the question actually somebody
the person who wrote the question said the mind believes that speech connected
to Samadhi is going to be more deliberate or slow or elevated. So you know
kind of the idea of what it might mean to be mindful while speaking. I mean if we
are moment to moment aware while we're speaking there's a form of Samadhi
there. There's a form of collectedness of mind there. And so the idea of what it
means you know what does it look like to be aware while speaking. Oh it means I'm
speaking really slowly or that the topics of my speech are certain kinds of
things. What I've what I found for myself is that the first place to try to
connect with speaking mindfully is just to keep it so simple to just simply try
to know that I'm talking while I'm talking. Just that just know that I'm
talking while I'm talking. I used to try to really bring all the same kinds of
awareness that I could have in my sitting like awareness of the sensations of a
whole body and kind of knowing what was going on in the mind and being aware of
a moment to moment kind of changing nature of experience. And you know with
with being aware while talking it's it's like you got to start at a really
gross level. Trying to be aware of all of that stuff brings it's too hard it's
too hard to start so just simple. Can you know that you're talking while you're
talking? And then as that begins to build, as that begins to grow, as that begins to
stabilize, then you can start being curious about how am I while I'm talking?
What's the emotion in there while I'm talking? What's the intention? What am I
going to say in a moment? Is it a skillful thing? Is it an unskillful thing? This
is one of the great things about mindful speech and skillful speech
is that the practice of skillful speech does begin to cultivate some degree of
mindfulness of speaking. But the kind of continuity of mindfulness while speaking
that for me it's taken a long time. It's not easy. But then the kind of
keeping it simple starting with just can I know I'm talking while I'm talking? The
continuity or the samadhi because that's what that's what samadhi is is a
continuity of mindfulness. The samadhi develops by just that simple knowing.
It's like sitting down and breathing and knowing your breathing or sitting and
knowing you're sitting. Just just the simplest act of knowing in the moment.
And then as that builds, as that concentration, as the continuity of
that strengthens, then the mindfulness can start to see more naturally. Rather
than trying to see all the detail of what's going on, the continuity or the
concentration, the samadhi actually begins to reveal what's going on. So that
we don't have to talk slowly for instance. We will tend to, if we are mindful, we
will tend to know we're going to say something that might be unhelpful and we
would tend to have the recognition not so helpful to do that. With that
continuity of mindfulness, it will help us to see what's skillful and what's
unskillful in terms of speech. So I would encourage, in terms of like
practicing with the daily life kinds of speech, just start by by trying, you
know, if you even remember. It's hard to remember in the first place. It's hard to
remember. If you remember, just try to keep it that simple. Can I know I'm
talking while I'm talking? The other piece that that the questioner mentions is
something about noticing that they're silent. And this is also in the suttas,
the kind of the clear comprehension, the awareness of talking while talking and
the awareness of keeping silent while keeping silent. In the Satipatanasuta,
the Buddhist Instructions for Mindfulness, he mentions these two pieces. He says,
just know, be aware, clearly comprehend when you're talking and when you're
keeping silent. So that's essentially what I'm talking about. Just know you're
talking when you're talking, clearly comprehend that. Know you're silent when
you're silent. If you know you're silent when you're silent in a conversation,
it's so much easier then to be aware when the silence is going to turn to
talking. So you can practice when somebody else is
talking, knowing that you're keeping silent, but also not lose touch with
what they're saying. So this is a little bit of a kind of a
relational practice there. It's like, yeah, I'm keeping silent and I know what
they're saying. That's a thing to practice with. So know that
you're being silent and know what's being said. And possibly in there, again,
with the continuity that begins to develop with knowing that you're keeping
silent while you're keeping silent, you might start to see your mind producing
thoughts of like, what am I going to say? What am I going to say after this person
finishes talking? So you'll start to see that. It can happen naturally. Just with
that, again, the simple, the simple instructions. Know you're talking when
you're talking. Know you're keeping silent when you're keeping silent. The
momentum, the samadhi will build and it will begin to kind of reveal more of the
underlying things that are going on. The motivations, the thoughts that are going
to come up that want to come out in speech. So those are those are my
thoughts on that topic. And yeah, just curious if there's any any comments or
reflections. Yeah, I just realized I always thought I didn't do idle chatter
because I'm a very serious person. I realized when you're speaking how it
happens, I do. And what happens is in a conversation, especially with if it's an
important relationship, if someone, if they say something that kind of, you know,
that comes throws you off balance or comes out of left field or something, I
panic a little bit. And instead of confronting it head on or saying I'm
confused, please clarify. I'll just kind of start chattering. And one thing I
might do is if there's a feeling of threat or something and having to make
it better. I'll try to tell the person what I think they want to hear. And if
something, if anything is pointless, it's that. Well, that's so great to notice
that, that that's when that happens for you. You know, that kind of idle
chatter. And I will say that, you know, it's it's important to understand with
idle chatter. You know, we might think a certain things are, you know, just
content wise would seem to be idle chatter. But the the definition of it
is talk that serves no purpose. And so, you know, sometimes a kind of
conversation with somebody you've just met, you know, you're probably not going
to dive into a deep Dharma conversation, you know, and so a little bit of like get
to know you conversation serves a purpose to connect, to find some kind of
relationship. And so, you know, I look at it that way, you know, it's like what
purpose is this speech serving? There are times when, you know, it's not serving a
purpose and that's useful. That's useful to recognize. So, I'm just happy that
you're interested in that topic. Thanks, Beverly. Anyone else have a comment or
reflection? So, there's a comment to me about just the appreciation for just
know you're talking while you're talking can lead to that kind of stability to
see more awareness of what's happening in the body. And yeah, it's really it's
really fun. It's nice to keep it simple and trust. It's kind of a trust to let
the momentum of mindfulness build in the process of just being aware while
talking. And that can also be like in daily life, like just know you're
chopping vegetables while you're chopping vegetables. Just know you're, you
know, brushing your teeth while you're brushing your teeth. You know, just know
that you're just be with yourself and the continuity of mindfulness can
develop there.
