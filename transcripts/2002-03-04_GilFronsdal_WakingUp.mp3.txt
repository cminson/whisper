 Friday from teaching a month-long retreat that some of us, some of the people here in this room were at. And it was quite a happiness-producing event for me personally. It was very nice to be there. And one of my favorite things to do is to teach retreats, long retreats, contemplative retreats in silence. And a month is a long time. It's like 40 days in the desert, 30 days in Marin County. And it's wonderful to be part of people's ongoing spiritual practice over the course of those 30 days, to see the change, transformation, the challenges that arise for people. Now there was one talk given at that retreat by Carol Wilson. Many talks inspired me, but there was one that she gave that kind of stayed with me for a while and thought, oh, I should give that talk. And usually teachers only give their own talk over and over again. But you don't give another teacher's talk. So I won't do that. But the chain of associated thinking in my mind over the last few weeks has led to what I'm going to say today. And what I want to do is talk about the notion of being awake, waking up. Many of you know that in Buddhism, the word Buddha comes from the Sanskrit word bodhi, which is often usually translated as to wake up, awakening. And the Buddha is a title, actually it's not a given name, it's a title because he's the one who's bodhied, who's awakened. So he's the Buddha. He's the person who's awakened, the awakened one. So the idea of being awake is very important in Buddhism. And I've read many people who said that it's common in many different spiritual traditions to emphasize some kind of awakening. And the opposite of that is that they emphasize that people generally are asleep. That the general human condition is people are somehow sleepwalkers. That something about the way in which we relate to the world, we relate to ourselves, some way in which our thoughts captivate, our attention, our focus, our concerns, is equivalent to being asleep. In that we don't see reality as it actually is. We see something different. When I was a Zen student in the meditation hall, the Zendo, they had a rule that you could not cross across the middle of the Zendo in front of the Buddha image. So it was like here in this room here, there's a Buddha here. So there would be a line right down in front of the Buddha to the wall there, and you weren't allowed to cross that line. No one's sitting in front of it. There's this line right straight to the wall. Are you sitting here? Okay. That's a Zen. And the Buddha was actually kind of a little bit away from the wall quite a bit. And so then there was a walkway behind. So if you want to get from one side of the room to the other, you'd walk behind the Buddha, because it's disrespectful to walk in front of somebody, right? So you walk around. So there was this kind of line down in the middle of the hall. And I knew about this rule about not crossing in front. And my sense was this line was this kind of force field. Very powerful, because you get a little bit closer to it, and you've kind of felt nervous, and you feel like, you've got to be careful now. And you didn't really want to get too close because you kind of stepped over by mistake. And there was this, I don't know, I was afraid I'd get electrocuted or something. And I didn't think about it this much, but that was kind of like the way I related to it. And I was always very careful to walk around, so was everyone else. Everyone participated in this rule and this idea that there was a line you didn't cross. So one day I was in the meditation hall, kind of just in the back of the hall doing something at off times, and there were some tourists who'd come to visit. And they were kind of checking out what the zendo looks like. They didn't know anything about how to be in a zendo, and they didn't know about this line. So I was just watching them, and they kind of were talking, and they just walked casually past that line as if they were in the train station or something, just kind of walked right by, without any thought about it. And at that moment I had a little awakening, where I realized there was no line there, there was no force field there. It was all in my head, in our collective heads, and we had created this thing. And it didn't exist there really in nature, it was just kind of this idea that we had, and I was projecting and relating to this idea. The force field was in my mind, not there. And that was kind of a awakening for me, oh, I'm living in this mental construct, and it doesn't really exist. So the question is, how many of us are living in mental constructs that maybe don't really exist, but are like force fields, or we have very powerful relationships to them that could be otherwise, that's not in nature to be that way. So also when I was a Zen student, when I was at Tassajara, which is a beautiful Zen monastery deep down in the Los Padres National Forest, it's a kind of wilderness area, and we had this Zen Dos meditation hall, that there would be about 40 of us there doing our Zen practice, and there was a lot of chanting in Zen, so every morning we'd have the service of about 40 minutes of chanting, ritual and bowing and offering incense and many things. And there was kind of an atmosphere that creates 40 people together, involved in the spiritual practice, and bowing and chanting and being devotional or whatever people were thinking or feeling. And it was really lovely to be part of it for me, other people hated it. But it had a certain power, a certain kind of aura, an atmosphere, a certain kind of sentiment, a certain kind of feeling to what we were doing. And so at some point I decided I would try to see if I could shift my mental construct, what we were doing there. And I would imagine, what it would be like if the 40 of us were standing at Tassajara before there were any buildings built there, 150 years ago or so. So there were no buildings, no Buddha, no Zen-do, no nothing, just these oak trees and this river and this dirt ground, and the sky and the mountains around us. And we were all facing each other, because in Zen you faced two groups facing each other, and we were doing all this bowing and chanting. And when I did that imagination, I would in a sense separate myself from the atmosphere we'd collectively created. I'd see it from a different perspective. And I felt it was very freeing. And then I'd go back into the atmosphere, and then every once in a while I'd pull myself out and see it be different. I don't know if that made sense. Do you? But did it make some sense? It was kind of like what I did when I was 20. I'd go to museums, and maybe this is a terrible way of judging paintings, but that's what I did. I would look at these paintings on the wall, and I'd stand there and look at them for a while, and imagine what they would look like if instead of hanging on a museum wall, they were hanging on a tree in the forest. And then if it still would keep my attention, then I would stay and look at it longer. But if the forest was more interesting, then I'd move on. So if anything, I'm trying to convey the idea that we have these social constructs, perspectives, frames of reference, by which we understand our experience, our life, and they're flexible, they're fluid, and we can change them and move them around. So to wake up is in part to wake up from the social construct that we have that we think is inherent in reality itself, in nature, how things actually are. And to realize they aren't that way actually, and to wake up, oh, things are different. They can be different. It's an interpretation. And what's the amazing thing that we discover, I think any kind of deep spiritual practice, is to what amazingly large degree the world that we live in is a world of social construct, the world of our mind and ideas and concepts, and the very seldom that we actually see the world as it actually is, that we paint it with our concepts. And this is one of the first insights I had when I came to Tassajara, was doing the Zen practice, was how much of my reality was being painted by my concepts. I would see something and immediately have some idea of what it was. And I'd paint it in a sense. I would see just almost anything. I would see a bell, and I would paint it with an idea of what a bell is, what it means, or associations with it. I wouldn't see the bell in and of itself. Or there are certain things that are quite flexible. There are certain things in one context and other things in other contexts. There was a particular chair at Tassajara that wasn't always a chair, it was sometimes a stool, sometimes a stoop. Sometimes you use it to stand on to get up to a higher shelf. When was it a chair? When was it an all-association pair with chair? When was it a stepping ladder? I would paint it with different things. We do the same thing with people. I don't know how old I was. I was 19. I went traveling in Morocco with a couple of friends. And I noticed when I was traveling around Morocco, it was the first time I'd been to a non-Western country as basically an adult, on my own with my parents. So I was paying attention in a new way to people and reality and things. Back then in Morocco, I don't know how it is now, people still wore very much the traditional clothes. The men wore these yelabas, they were called. I don't know what to call them, dresses, but these mourning coats, these coats, these dresses, these yelabas. And the women often had their faces covered. I noticed after being there for a while that I felt a certain kind of way of being more relaxed than I usually am, walking around streets. I was wondering, why am I more relaxed? What's this more extra little piece of relaxation in the corner of my mind? And I realized that the reason why there was this corner of relaxation was that I had no categories by which to judge these people. In America, I could judge people all the time. I knew who they were. Back then we had all kinds of words for them. They were jocks and squares and hip. It had to immediately put people into categories of who they were, what kind of background they had, what kind of social status, what kind of economic class they were. But back in Morocco, I didn't have any way of doing that for the people there, because I didn't understand. Probably if I'd lived there long enough, I'd understand the differences. But there wasn't any of it. I was freed from that piece of painting people with my concepts and ideas. It was very nice to do that. It was very happy. Freeing. Certainly a better way than going around, always judging people. To understand this idea of waking up, I think it helps to understand how much of our life is spent in our thoughts and ideas. So even something as simple as a bell. Maybe all of you can see this bell here that I'm holding up. It's a very nice bell. I could have the desire to have this bell. I can cling to this bell. I can have all these ideas. If I have this bell at home, then I can have really deep meditations. I can ring that bell at the end of the meditation. I'd really be spiritual because I have the right bell. I have all kinds of ideas about what it means to have this bell. I can really want it. It feels really important. I could cling to the idea of this bell. I could ask, wondering, maybe I could buy it from the center. Maybe I'm a teacher here. Maybe I wouldn't notice if I just took it. Maybe I could replace it with another bell. I can get carried away with my ideas and thoughts because I'm clinging to this bell. The interesting thing about clinging is that I'm holding it up because I want you to see it. I'm actually not clinging it physically. If I was clinging it physically, I'd go like this and really hold on tight. But the clinging is not in the physical world. The clinging belongs to the mental world right now. I'm clinging to the idea of the bell and the idea of what the bell will do for me. If the clinging exists right now, it belongs to this inner world, the psychic world, the mental world. There's nothing physical about it. If we don't realize that, then we might not understand where the freedom lies in relationship to this clinging of the bell. The freedom is also in the mind. A relationship that's formed in there. The clinging is not to the bell, but the clinging is to the idea we have. That's actually true in a lot of different situations in our life. We cling to people, we cling to possessions, we cling to all kinds of things. We say things, but more often than not, it's not the things that we're clinging to, but there's some kind of clinging in our mind towards some idea and concept that we have about it. To wake up is to see the clinging to these ideas and concepts and not to the literal, actual thing. That's very hard sometimes to see. We have a bell, and I ring the bell, and it makes a sound. The perception of the sound is relatively simple, fair. I think all of you probably heard it without any effort, just the experience of hearing the bell just arose in the hearing organ. But what's interesting is not right now what the sound of the bell is, but what happens to us when we hear the bell. And what happens is that there's often, there might be, and it depends on your background, all kinds of associations of what that sound is like. For me, when I hear a bell, I associate it very strongly with monastic life. It means I have to do something. So I always hear a bell, what do I have to do now? Do I have to bow? Do I have to go to meditation? Do I have to end my meditation? What does it mean? And a good way to get a Buddhist monk to stop doing what he or she is doing, just ring a bell, and they'll get their attention. And so I hear the sound of the bell, and I think about monastic life, and this means that I'm supposed to do something or change what I'm doing, or I'm supposed to bow. This reminds me of how wonderful it was to be at the Sahara, at the monastery, and maybe if I tape record these sounds, I can play them on my tape recorder, tape deck in my car, and just hear wonderful sounds, and just get in a nice mood, and be reminded to always be present, and not to rely on any external part of the world. And there's all these ideas and associations, what a bell means. Other people might have other associations of what a bell means. Some of you might, bell means, might mean, it's time to, you know, maybe on bells you heard growing up were school bells. You know, it's time to go to school. And the last thing you want to do right now is to be reminded that you should go to school. And so you have a little bit of aversion to hearing that bell, and you don't like it because of those associations. What other associations might you have with the sound of a bell? Help me out here. Fire. Fire. So you, maybe there's a fire somewhere. Yeah. What? Come in for dinner. Yes. I guess the scientific thing, like in Washington, you know, the science of it. Uh-huh, great. I like it. It just seems like it starts out really this way. Thank you. So you find it pleasant? Yes. It's an association. Yes. I feel it's kind of a little, a little town, just suddenly brought me back. So all kinds of memories, all kinds of associations might arise. And then once an association is born, it sometimes gets born to a second association, or a third. So I hear this bell, I'm reminded of Tassahara, and how nice it was at Tassahara, and how nice it would be if everybody can go to Tassahara, and how nice it would be for me to go back to Tassahara, but I have all these responsibilities in the family now, and it makes it kind of hard to go to Tassahara. And why did I take on these responsibilities in this family, when I could be a monk, and what would it take to renounce the world again and be a monk? And, well, I can't admit this, you know, to people that I have these thoughts, and now I'm embarrassed, and now I'm frustrated with myself for being embarrassed, and frustrated because I have this idea that it would be nice to go to Tassahara, and I can't do it, and now I'm angry with myself, I'm making the choices I make in my life, and on it goes, you know, these thoughts. And it was just... That's all it was, you know, the sound of a bell. So I'm hoping you're getting a little bit of gist of what I'm saying, and so to wake up is to realize, you know, this whole world, mental world, associated world, concept and stuff, is to see how it gets born in our mind. And part of the opportunity of mindfulness practice is to use the calm that you maybe get through meditation, or the insight of the mindfulness, to begin noticing the response inside of us to the stimulus in the world, to see how we construct this social reality, how these mental constructions come into being and paint our experience in certain ways. And it's very hard to see that. A lot of things we don't see unless sometimes we go into very radically different environments for a while and see that things can be different. One of the things, for example, to do... There's a saying that I like. I've heard that's a saying they say in England, and the saying is, you don't know... English say to each other. They say, you don't know England until you've left England. Somehow leaving a situation that you've been embedded in for a long time can give you perspective what's going on there, and you realize, wait a minute, there's a social reality here that I bought into that maybe it doesn't have to be that way. Going on retreat is that way. It's very powerful to be together with people in silence, to be involved in social interaction, talking, and all the various things. And to let all that part of our mind rest. And then when it's all over the retreat, it's to see how we reconstruct it, how our concerns about being liked by people are not liked, how our concerns about approval or how our concerns about... All kinds of ways in which when we relate to people, all kinds of things, get reborn. And from that kind of background of silence, of letting go of all those kinds of concerns, sometimes we can see all the extra ways in which we interpret ourselves and our lives, which aren't inherent in life itself, but is a social, mental construct, which is invisible to us otherwise. It's very helpful to find some way to step outside of the mental world we create for ourselves so we can see how we do create it. And that's one of the things that meditation is trying to point to, is that possibility. I've told this story a lot. I apologize for repeating myself, but I think it's a good story. And it kind of points to what I'm trying to say here today. There's something on retreats, vipassana retreats, that's called vipassana romances. And I call them virtual romances. Because they often have nothing to do with who that other person is. So I was in a three-month retreat, which is enough time to get one of these going. And... Can you do it in a shorter retreat, too? It can be done in a one-day retreat, just in one minute. You don't have to even be on retreat. But it's called vipassana romances because sometimes you have all the silence and concentration, stillness. The mind sometimes kind of gets carried away. So I kind of was attracted to this woman on the retreat. And I'd never met her, never talked to her. And so I started formulating this fantasy about who she was and what it was going to be like to meet her at the end of the retreat. And talk to her, and go for a date, and do more with her, and hang out with her, and start living with her, and getting married, and having children, and getting divorced. And it was three months is a long time to kind of... Long enough to go through all those things. So the retreat came to an end, and we were finally going to break silence. And breaking silence involved hearing people speak for the first time. And the first time she spoke, I heard she had this really strong, I think, French accent. And at that moment I woke up. Because at that moment I realized that the whole fantasy was built on the idea of her being an American. And being an American I had some idea of what kind of person she was. But as soon as I realized she was French, then I realized I didn't have a clue who she was. Even if she was American I wouldn't have had a clue. But because she was so different than anything my fantasy was about, I kind of woke up from that. I was startled, and I realized I didn't have a clue who this person was. I woke up. So I would like to ask you all, have you had this experience of waking up in this way? What would you like to tell us a little bit as a group, some examples, of how you've woken up? It doesn't have to be the big awakening. I had one just this past few weeks, about three weeks ago I decided to test out my belief that I'm addicted to chocolate and I simply cannot have it in the house. Because whenever I do I just gobble it all up until it's all gone. And so I bought a one pound box of seized chocolates and I've been having one each day. No problem. No temptation, no craving, no, it's fine. And so now I have this, you know, how many other beliefs am I clinging to that simply aren't true? It's just a pretty shock. A friend of mine had, many years ago, had a dream. In the dream he was holding a snake by the neck, so a poisonous, a deadly poisonous snake, so it wouldn't bite him. And the problem was he wouldn't let go of it. But he couldn't let go of it because then the snake would be free to kind of turn around and bite him. So he didn't know what to do, he was holding and he really wouldn't let go of it. And in the dream he finally let go of it. And that moment the snake vanished. Yes? There's a movie that I saw that's called Land of Hannah, it's an Australian movie, and that's the book of movies, all of that. It sort of plays the audience with all of our expectations. And what happens to each of the characters based on these conceptual, I guess you call it stereotypes almost. Like this woman, she dies because she has this idea that the guy who's in the room is doing a, who's having a bad day for her, her car breaks down. She actually ends up, well, I should have typed it. That's what the movie's about. It's a very interesting twist. I have a question. I am a puzzle, totally confused and helped by interpretation and misjudgment of people that they imparted on me. So I feel in daily life that I have to work on myself and my misinterpreation about the world, at the same time to explain all of the negative interpretations that people important me in the whole environment. I haven't been successful to have that kind of distinguish. Yeah, that's good. I think that what we have some control over in Buddhist practice, where the point is, is to see what's going on inside of us. So even when other people are doing terrible things to us, is there some way in which we're augmenting the problem by our own relationship to it? So, it's a difficult thing to discuss briefly, but for example, the issue of what we think we need in relationship to others. And for a long time, I was very much driven by the idea of wanting people to like me and wanting approval. I didn't even know that I had this issue, so it was kind of invisible to me, but it was kind of drove me and affected me in my emotions and what I did a lot. And at some point in my practice, I started seeing it, partly because it became too painful. And then I saw clearly, and I saw at some point that I didn't need people's approval. And that was really helpful for me. And I still sometimes get caught by that. But I know, kind of in my heart, that in my heart I don't really need people's approval. That's not really, you know, I don't want to offend people, I listen to feedback, that's really nice to get. But my kind of core sense of well-being is not dependent on how other people are going to see me or not see me. And that was really helpful to come to that. It reminds me of a woman, I was reminded of this woman who told me this some years ago. She told me that she was kind of in her late 60s when I heard this. And she said that she kind of woke up finally and realized that she didn't need a man. And she had grown up with the idea that she needed a man in order to take care of her in life. She was a very competent woman, she worked and did all kinds of things. She could take care of herself quite well. But it wasn't until her late 60s she actually could understand that was the case. And wasn't always looking for a man to protect her, take care of her, do something for her. And she woke up from that. Yeah, Courtney. I have another small example too. The phone rang the other day at right about the time when the telemarketers always called. It kind of had a little bit of agitation to begin with. The answer to the phone and it was kind of a pause and then someone sort of shuffled around and tried to get the name out and the name sounded all distorted. I think the average person at that point would have hung up but I have this thing where I feel like I have to at least politely go through the motions with these people. And then after he finally said what he was saying I realized this was for somebody I actually called for something and it was someone who was calling to deliver some good news to me. But when they start trying to address you by misses or miss or whatever, all of a sudden I had all this agitation and assumption. And then woke up. Yes, yes. I'm not sure how this is waking up. And it is waking up and it's sort of a little different story but I have a daughter a while ago. And I still have her but she was because she was homeless. And I did a trust up program and a lot of the stuff that would go on there would be a lot of like let go and love and all that stuff. And I always interpreted it as if things are going badly she has to learn herself that that's better. And it was just an incredible awakening for me one time when I realized that I had to lick. I didn't know what was good for her. But I was still making even though there was that let go and I'm still making the assumption that I still had the answer and that I had to let go of making her see it and some day she would see it. And what I woke up to was I had not a clue how things would turn out to her. That what was right for me was not necessarily right for her. And that was an incredibly freeing thing to wake me up. All the assumptions that I made about how I have the answers or I know what the right way is. But there is a right way. Even there is a right way. And I happened again too when I was cancer that somehow making a decision not to have treatment about something. And a friend of mine made a different decision to have the treatment to insist on the treatment. But I was letting go. And for a while it was hard to let go of recognizing that her decision around her treatment was that she could be making the exact right decision for herself. And if my every day is exactly right then you have to do the same. There is something about the end. This is my decision and work from the end. So that whole waking up to your smile right away. So I don't know. So there are assumptions. Suzuki Roshi said, I said something like, I think he simplistically said something like you can understand Buddhism in three words. And those words are not always so. Bill? Back in the late 60s I was in college in Alabama. Which is a war story. But while I was in college I performed in a play called Way In For Go. Which is a very existential, weird, unusual, very difficult play. And my parents were living in Washington D.C. and I was going to school in Alabama. So I traveled back and forth every quarter or every semester in the back of Alabama. And I had a relative who lived, my mother's sister, who lived halfway in between the sparklers of South Carolina. She was married to probably the biggest redneck I have ever met. A very interesting man. A Catholic and an incredible genius. This philosophy was very, very big. And I showed up there at my usual, I showed up late at night. And was talking to my aunt and she said, well what have you been doing in school? And I said, well I've been working on this play, we've been in this play. And she said, well what play? And I said, well I don't know particular ways, if you would know anything about this play. And she said, well what is it? And I said, well it was ready for you know. And she had not only read it, but she talked to me for several hours about it intelligently. And that's sort of the point at which I realized that every human being in the United, there was something about them that we didn't know or understand. And it led me to a question from many years I played this game where I actually knew it was to find a thing that I didn't expect about them that was interesting. I called it the interesting thing. But it was like, what about this person in my mind that I've already tight-liked, but I tight-tiked him. At that point I didn't know what I was doing. But I spent years playing this game which kind of prepared me to meet people in a different way. Very nice. Thank you. Okay, the last thing I wanted to kind of, one little piece I wanted to weave into this is that it could be this idea of waking up from our mentally constructed world. It doesn't entail a rejection of it. And it isn't necessarily bad or wrong. Sometimes people reject one mentally constructed world or socially constructed world, only pick up another one. Sometimes the one they pick up is the, they're rebelling against it, they pick up the opposite as a way. And they think they're free, but they're really reacting to the original one. I think the idea and the opportunity for us is not to necessarily accept or reject, but rather to use the mindfulness to help us to be in conversation with the mentally constructed world, with the socially constructed world. To see it as that, and then to reflect on it and see when it's useful and when it's not useful, and to see where, you know, to have a conversation with it. And I think that's really the necessary thing. A lot of times people will practice Buddhism, but reject that world entirely for some kind of idea of emptiness. But it doesn't need to be rejected at all. It just needs to be seen clearly for what it is. So that in a sense you're in charge of it, it's not in charge of you. So may your practice help you become freer and more awake from the world of mentally constructed projections that we have in the world we live in. So thank you all very much, and have a wonderful week.
