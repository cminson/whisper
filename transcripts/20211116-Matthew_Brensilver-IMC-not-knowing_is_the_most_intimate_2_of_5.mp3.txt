 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Thank you. That's good to sit with you. So the question, who am I? That's not a question we ask so often, but it has venerated spiritual history, right? And we ask it, we try to answer it every answer we might give. Feels wrong, feels somehow inadequate or inauthentic. And, you know, in our alienation, in that alienation we have our answer. Who am I? I'm a meditation teacher. No. Who am I? In the alienation we have our answer. And before the mind kind of leaps up to try to answer the question, it stops. Who am I? It stops and it creates a certain kind of wonder of mystery and it's a kind of acquired taste maybe on the Dharma path, but we have to learn to love becoming mysterious to ourselves. You know, when kind of the familiar autobiography just kind of cracks open, yet you know those moments, something stops and the familiar autobiography cracks open and sometimes it's the power of the Dharma of insight, which is often a little startling, surprising. And sometimes it's the, I find in the beauty and the goodness of others or a certain sense of like awe for their power, their grace, their goodness, there's something, something just opens in me. And sometimes of course it's Dukkha that cracks open the familiar self story and it highlights the truth that we kind of get too knowing about ourselves, but also too knowing about others. Simone We said, I am also other than what I imagined myself to be. To know this is forgiveness. Only in our knowing, in our certainty, do we indict ourselves. I'm also other than what I imagined myself to be. And one's child, parent, partner, best friend forever, colleague, co-worker, they are also other than what we imagine them to be. To know this is forgiveness. When teachers meet, row one carrying bags, the other asks, where are you going? I'm going on a pilgrimage. First teacher asks, what's the purpose of your pilgrimage? I don't know. Says the one with the bags. And the first teacher responds, not knowing is most intimate. Maybe you know the experience that happens typically with those we love most. Over the years we get so familiar with them that at some point it's almost like we stopped looking at them. Yeah, we stopped seeing them. They become so encrusted in our concepts and the concepts feel so thick. It feels like they almost live behind a six-inch wall of plexiglass. And then sometimes after months or years or decades we might deeply look at them. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you really? Because we're animals and vulnerable and dependent on many conditions. And live amidst the nitya, amidst change and unreliability, uncertainty. Because we live under these conditions, we try to make everything predictable. And with our ex escalating dependence on others, our love and care, the ways in which we entrust our heart to others, that entails a measure of risk. And so we try to make them predictable too. In the novel, Human Staying, writer Roth writes, In description of one character noticing something about another, Previously concealed was the small Popeye-ish blue tattoo situated at the top of his right arm, Just at the shoulder joining the words U.S. Navy inscribed between the hook-like arms of a shadowy little anchor and running along the hypotenuse of the deltoid muscle. A tiny symbol, if one were needed, of all the million circumstances of the other fellow's life, of that blizzard of details that constitute the confusion of a human biography. A tiny symbol to remind me why our understanding of other people must always be, at best, slightly wrong. When we're relating to another as a concept, we sacrifice the intimacy and the spontaneity, not knowing is most intimate. And in making the other predictable, in making and defining them and casing them in those concepts, we're orchestrating a certain kind of flatness in how we relate. The spontaneity and the intimacy, the aliveness of not knowing. It's really possible to ignore the fullness of the other person's experience. It's almost shockingly possible to do this. And we know them only kind of in relation, in our relation to them, but we freeze them as a parent or a child or a spouse or whatever. And in a way, what's happening is we're confusing their role in our life with who they are. And sometimes I'll glance at somebody I love, and maybe in that moment they don't see me seeing them, so they're in their aloneness. And there's something very kind of powerful about seeing someone in their aloneness, you know, to see, to recognize their being completely other to me. And we get into these highly choreographed routines with each other where we kind of play out our concepts, we play out our role with so much fidelity. And so it's this orchestration of predictability. And that's very soothing in some ways and flattening in other ways. The teacher Eugene Cash, on Father's Day, I think has this routine, sits down with his daughter and says, I'm not your father. And not in the Jerry Springer way, the Dharma way, I guess. I'm not your father. And then she says, I'm not your daughter. And it's this kind of affirmation of like, our being is not reducible to the roles that we play in each other's lives. And to start to take that in is like, oh, that's intimate, that not knowing that's intimate. Can we have reverence for the not knowing, for the kind of mysterious quality, the being of another? Can we try to perceive the other outside of our particular relation to them? And can we gaze in this way? Can we put down some of what we know, look with new eyes? This is the exploration offered for your consideration. So, welcome to join this evening, this evening and Thursday evening. We'll have a meeting session on Zoom, not here. There's a link in that page or it's on the IMC calendar. And we'll just sit and have some dialogue, 45 minutes, same time, actually just 12 hours later, 7pm Pacific to 745. We'll just see what's happening, how interpersonal life is going on this day. So, yeah, feel free to join us and we'll keep pushing forward in this exploration. And it's lovely to be with you. Yeah, I saw some questions about recordings. Those are, I don't know when, should be soon. I'll check into that but it is being recorded and get that posted. So, yeah, thank you all have a good, a good day and maybe I'll see you in 11 hours or so. Be very happy to close the day with you all and see some faces actually on Zoom too. So, may you be well. Thank you.
