The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in
Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org.
Okay, so the next thing we're going to talk about is emptiness. And so the first
question is, what does that mean? All right. Things are empty of inherent existence is
the usual way of putting it. For the Buddha, things were empty of a self and
what pertains to a self? Okay, so this is mine, except it's empty of mine. There's
no real mine in here. It's just the convention that we have. It's the
conventional truth. This is mine. It's not yours. It's mine, right? But it's empty
of myness on the absolute level. On the conventional level, it's mine. And on the
conventional level, this is me. This is Lee Brazington, who lives in Oakland,
California, wrote two books, etc. Right? But on the ultimate level, yeah, it's just
the intersection of a bunch of soda pie. We need to operate from both of those
levels when appropriate. And I'll talk about that in a minute or two or more. So
emptiness for the Buddha was empty of self or what belongs to a self or what
pertains to a self. But as time went on, emptiness was seen to be, well, have
broader implications. And so we wind up with the Mahayana version of emptiness,
which is best exemplified by the teachings of Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna was an
Indian born in South India to a Brahmin family. And by the time he was 20, he was
recognized as a quite brilliant Brahmin scholar. However, he had a sensual side
that was unfulfilled. And he and three friends learned from a sorcerer how to
make themselves invisible. And they went sneaking into the palace, into the
harem quarters. And well, let's just say when the king found out about it, he was
most displeased. He had soldiers stationed behind the curtains and told
them strike above the footprints and the carpet. When Nagarjuna and his friends
returned, his three friends were killed. Nagarjuna was only able to survive by
standing next to the king. He managed to flee the palace and headed for the
hills. He had discovered craving can lead to dukkha. So he began studying
the teachings of the Buddha. It is said that in three months he completely
mastered the earlier teachings. And it was at this point he met a monk from the
Mahayana tradition. Mahayana Buddhism was just getting going at this point,
beginning of the second century AD. And its view of the world, shall we say, from
a more broadly interconnected viewpoint, very much appeal to Nagarjuna. This
emphasis on compassion. And so he left his mountain hideaway and began traveling
throughout India, seeking other Mahayana teachings. He eventually started
engaging Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike in debate and defeated all comers. He
found an order and rules for his monks to live by and eventually said, I have no
master. It was at that point some Nagas. So Nagas are like, well they play the role
of dragons in Western mythology, but we have Nagas in India. They're like
mythical sea serpents, except these Nagas lived in a lake. So lake serpents. And
they recognize Nagarjuna's learning, and they took him to the bed of a lake
where the prajma paramita sutras had been stored. Now supposedly these were
given by the Buddha, but people in the Buddha's time weren't sharp enough to
fully understand them. So they had been entrusted to the Nagas until someone
came along that was wise enough to be able to understand them. And the Nagas
now thought that that was Nagarjuna. He brought back these wisdom teachings and
wrote commentaries on them, one of which is the Malaayamaka Karaka, the fundamental
verses on the middle way. It's quite a brilliant teaching and it seeks to
elucidate emptiness. Now the story goes on to say that a king arranged for a
contest of magic between Nagarjuna and a Brahman scholar. The Brahman scholar
created a giant lotus pond with a giant lotus in the middle and seated
himself on the lotus pond and mocked Nagarjuna for being stranded on dry land.
Nagarjuna conjured up a white elephant which waded into the lotus pond, grabbed
the Brahman scholar with his trunk and threw him back on dry land. The Brahman
scholar admitted defeat but wished that Nagarjuna were dead. Nagarjuna locked
himself in his room. The next day a worried disciple broke down the door. A
cicada flew out. The room was empty. Well that's the official story. Make of it
what you will. What we do know that the author of the Malaayamaka Karaka was an
absolutely brilliant mind, perhaps the most brilliant Buddhist teacher since the
time of the Buddha. And as I said his Malaayamaka Karaka, his fundamental
verses on the middle way, are an attempt to elucidate emptiness not by
describing it directly but in a more poetic fashion. And so there are three
chapters in my book entitled The Middle Way and they are discussions of a small
part of the Malaayamaka Karaka. So this is page 56 and the PDF if you want to
have a look. And if you don't have page numbers this is the first of the three
Middle Way chapters. This one is the Middle Way introduction to emptiness.
So what I want to do is share with you some of Nagarjuna's Malaayamaka Karaka
and as you'll see if you glance through you know this chapter you will see their
translations. However for this chapter I'm not going to use the translations that
you find in the book. The translations you find in the book are my
translations. However I don't know either Sanskrit or Tibetan. So these are
translations of Stephen Batchelor's literal translation of the Tibetan
translation of the Sanskrit Malaayamaka Karaka. Okay so especially since I was
doing the last bit of it there could have been something lost in the
translation. So I'm going to go back to Stephen Batchelor's actual poetic
translation from his book Versus from the Center which if you're interested in
studying Nagarjuna this is the place to start. It's not a literal translation it's
an approachable translation. Stephen did a really good job of capturing what
Nagarjuna was saying in a way that is more poetic than what Nagarjuna had to
say. So the first one I want to share with you Stephen entitled Walking. I do
not walk between the step already taken and the one I'm yet to take which both
are motionless. Is walking not the motion between one step and the next? What
moves between them? Could I not move as I walk? If I move when I walk there would
be two motions one moving me and one moving my feet. Two of us stroll by. There
is no walking without walkers and no walkers without walking. Can I say that
walkers walk? Couldn't I say they don't? Walking does not start in steps taken or
to come or in the act itself. Where does it begin? Before I raise a foot is there
motion a step taken or to come when it's walking to begin? What is gone? What
moves? What is to come? Can I speak of walkers when neither walking steps taken
nor to come ever end? Were walking and walker one I would be unable to tell
them apart. Were they different there would be walkers who do not walk? These
moving feet reveal a walker but did not start him on his way. There was no walker
prior to departure. Who was going where? So what Nagarjuna is pointing to is the
fact that walking and walkers are inseparable. You can't have a walker
unless there's some walking and you can't have walking unless there's somebody
doing that walking a walker. Were walking and walker one I would been unable to
tell them apart. Were they different there would be walkers who do not walk? So
the concept of a walker is not the same as the concept of walking and yet each
relies on the other. Neither of them has inherent existence and this is what has
been in the Tibetan or in the Mahayana about emptiness. Things are empty of
inherent existence. They don't stand alone. It's not possible to have a walker
just be a walker without having some walking. So a walker is dependent upon
the action of walking and the action of walking is dependent upon there being
somebody there to do the walking. And as we'll see it's going to turn out that
everything is empty of inherent existence. Everything arises dependent on
other things. The next one is entitled seeing. If my eyes cannot see themselves
how can they see something else? Were there no trace of something seen how
could I see it all? Either seeing nor unseeing see. Seeing reveals a seer who
is neither detached nor undetached from seeing. How could you see and what would
you see in the absence of a seer? Just as a child is born from mother and
father so consciousness springs from eyes in colorful shapes. Without these eyes
how could I know consciousness, contact, Vedana, craving, clinging, becoming, birth,
aging, and death. Seers seeing sight explain hearers hearing sounds, smell or
smelling smells, tasters tasting tastes, touchers touching textures, thinkers
thinking thoughts. So seeing reveals a seer who's neither detached nor undetached
from seeing. So just like walking you don't have a seer who's not seeing and
you don't have seeing unless you have somebody who is seeing called a seer.
Both of these are empty. Both of these are dependent. Neither has inherent
existence. The next one is body. I have no body apart from parts which form it. I
know no parts apart from a body. A body with no parts would be
informed. A part of my body apart from my body would be absurd. Were the body here
or not it would need no parts. Partless bodies are pointless. Do not get stuck in
the body. I cannot say my body is like its parts. I cannot say it's something
else. Feelings, conceptions, drives, minds, things are like this body in every way.
Conflict with emptiness is no conflict. Objections to emptiness, no objections.
So your body is made up of parts, right? I mean you have the fingers of your left
hand and you have the fingers of your right hand and your eyeballs and your
nose and your feet and your heart and your lungs and your liver and there's a
lot of parts there. So your body is not the same as its parts but it's not
different from your parts. I cannot say my body is like its parts. I cannot say
it's something else. Think about it. You go get a haircut. You walk in and it's
your hair. Half an hour later you look at the floor. Oh no, part of me is on the
floor. You have that reaction? No. But when you came in it was you and now it's
on the floor and it's just trash. How did that happen? Or you clipped your
fingernails, right? They were you and now they're in the garbage. It went from
being you to not you. Or what if you lost a valuable part of your body? No, let's
don't do that. It's too gross. Think about your red Corvette. I assume all of you
have a red Corvette. Yes? Okay, good. So you have your red Corvette. What if you
remove one of the wheels? Is it still a red Corvette? What if you remove all four
wheels? Is it still a red Corvette? What if you remove the steering wheel and all
four wheels? What if you take out the seats and drop the engine, pull the
transmission, remove the differential? What if you unscrew everything that could
be unscrewed and you lay out all the parts? Is it still a red Corvette? Or is
it just a pile of parts? And if it's just a pile of parts, where did the red
Corvette go? At what point when you were taking off the parts, did it stop
being a red Corvette and just become a pile of parts? And when it stopped being
a red Corvette, where did the red Corvette go? Your body is just like that in
every way. Only we don't have interchangeable parts. The red Corvette
is empty of red Corvette-ness. It's just a pile of parts. Your body is empty of
you-ness. It's just a pile of parts also. And just like the red Corvette, it's
nothing but, well, the intersection of a bunch of streams of dependently arising
processes interacting. That's all that's going on. So your red Corvette is empty
just like you are empty. It doesn't have an essence in it. It's just an
assemblage of a bunch of stuff that we give this concept red Corvette to. Or
this concept of me to. But in both cases, it's nothing but soda pie. The next of
these that I want to take a look at is entitled self. And that's in the next
chapter in my book. And let's see. That appears on page 60. And if you want to
read along, I did actually take Stephen Batchelor's translation included in the
book. I did my own translations of the previous because I couldn't
exceed fair use for how much I included in the book because they wanted more
money to include everything than that I was going to get in my advance for
writing the book if I went with a publisher. So I just could only use
fair use. So you get one of Stephen's best translations. All right. So self.
Were minded matter me, I would come and go like them. If I were something else,
they would say nothing about me. What is mine when there is no me? Or self
centeredness eased. I would not think of me in mind. There would be no one there
to think them. What is inside is me. What is outside is mine. When these thoughts
in compulsion stops, repetition ceases, freedom dawns. Papuchus bonds thoughts
that provoke compulsive acts. Emptiness stops. Papuchus.
Buddhists speak of self and also teach not self and also say there's nothing
which is either self or not. When things dissolve, there's nothing left to say.
The unborn and unceasing are already free. The Buddha said it is real. It is
unreal. It is both real and unreal. And it's neither one nor the other. It is all
at ease. Unconceivable by your Papucha. Incommunicatable, inconceivable,
indivisible. You are not the same as or different from conditions on which you
depend. You are neither severed from nor forever fused with them. This is the
desolate teaching of Buddhas who care for the world. When Buddhas don't appear and
their followers have gone, the wisdom of awakening burst forth by itself. This
might be worth going through the second time. Were mind and matter me, I would
come and go like them. If I were something else, they would say nothing
about me. So if you are your body and mind, well, they say you change out all of
your cells every seven years. I mean, you got almost nothing left from the point
where you were born. Maybe there's a couple atoms hanging around, but yeah,
it's all changed. Does that mean you're somebody different? And your mind, you
change your mind all the time. Did you become somebody else every time you
change your mind? Yet your body and your mind do, well, say a lot about me, right?
But this is in a conventional sense, but in an ultimate sense, they're just, well,
more so to pie. What is mine when there is no me? This is the Buddhist strategy
for getting out of Dukha, right? You're to investigate in each of Dukha and
not until the point where you can actually uproot that sense of self. This
is, this is one of the last fetters to go at the fourth stage of awakening. It's
usually translated as conceit, but better would be conceiving of the self, right?
Because if you don't conceive of a self, then there's nobody there to crave. It
can't be a thought of, I want to get that. You know, want to get that implies
somebody who's going to get it. And the same thing with clean. There's nobody
there to think, I have this. Because if there's nobody, there's nobody to own it.
What is mine when there is no me? Where self-centeredness is eased, I would not
think of me and mine. There would be no one there to think them. So the Buddha
is basically saying, yeah, try and look at the world from a less
egocentric perspective and get a real sense of what's going on. If you can get
enough insight from that direction, a real sense of the world from the non
egocentric perspective, then maybe you can let go enough. Actually, let go of the
sense of self and get free of dukkha. What is inside is me. What is outside is
mine. When these thoughts in compulsion stops, repetition ceases, freedom dawns.
All the compulsions that we have, yeah, it's me behind those compulsions. I got
to get this. I got to get rid of this. Whatever it is. It's I. Repetition. I got to
do it again. I got to do it. Yeah, I. That stops freedom dawns.
Pappancha spawns thoughts that provoke compulsive acts. It can keep your rotten
potatoes. Empty this stops Pappancha. Once you really begin to not just
understand, but experience the empty nature of reality, you're far or less
likely to get carried away into Pappancha.
Buddhists speak of self and also teach not self and also say there's nothing
which is either self or not. So when the Buddha is teaching the Brahma Viharas is
speaking of self, one should give meta to all as to one's self. And so there
are selves there. But other times he teaches not self. If you remember the so
called second discourse, the discourse on not self, he asked his five ascetic
friends, is body self? Well, it's impermanent. It's Duke. I know that's not
going to work. And then the same for each of the other aggregates. They're all not
self. And so he's teaching not self. And he also teaches there is nothing which
is either self or not. To me, the most profound Sutta in the whole of the
Canon is Samyuta 1215. Kacchanagota Sutta. In that Sutta, the Venerable
Kacchanagota comes to the Buddha and wants to know right view. What is right
view? The Buddha says, this world for the most part depends upon a duality, upon
the notion of existence, and the notion of non-existence. We're actually
literally the notion of it is and the notion of it is not. But when one sees
the arising of the world as it actually is with correct wisdom, one does not
think in terms of non-existence. And when one sees the ceasing of the world as
it actually is with correct wisdom, one doesn't think in terms of existence.
This world is caught up in views and opinions and ideas. One with right view
does not get caught in views and opinions. One with right view does not take
a stand about myself, my soul, my atta. Right? The Buddha is saying, if you can see
the world not in terms of existence and non-existence, then you won't take a
stand saying, I exist or I don't exist. I have a self, I don't have a self. People
ask the Buddha, okay, once and for all, is there a self? He wouldn't answer. Is
there no self? He wouldn't answer. He said that if he said there was a self, that
would be the mistake of eternalism, and if he said there was no self, well, that
would be the mistake of an isolationism. Better not to say anything, because that
would just get people more confused. They needed to practice more. So what the
Buddha is basically saying is if you really get this dependent origination
thing, you don't think in terms of existence, you don't think in terms of
non-existence, you think in terms of soda pi is how I would phrase it. He says
that one with right view sees that when there's an arising, it's only
dukkha arising. And when there's a ceasing, there's only dukkha ceasing. But
when I first read that, I was like, what? That chocolate cake that arose the other
day, that wasn't dukkha. That was really good. I wish I had some more. It's all
gone. And that headache that I had when it went away, when it ceased, that was not
dukkha. Hope it doesn't come back. So the thing is to realize that nothing's
going to give you lasting happiness. When there's an arising, what's arising is
not going to give you lasting happiness. And when there's a ceasing, what's
ceasing also wasn't going to give you lasting happiness. The chocolate cake
ceased, no lasting happiness. The headache ceased, that's happiness, but it
might come back. So no lasting happiness. Another translation for dukkha would be
not a source of lasting happiness. Everything exists. This is one extreme.
Nothing exists. This is the other extreme. Without veering towards either of these
extremes, a tatāgata teaches the dhamma via the middle. With this as necessary
condition, that arises. If this doesn't happen, that does not arise. Now if you
look at the sutta, you'll find that it actually says something slightly
different. It gives the twelve links of dependent origination and the forward
arising order and the forward ceasing order. I suspect that was a later
addition. It doesn't really make any sense and turns out I found some scholars
that are saying the same thing. Govindsi Pandi says that in his studies in the
origin of Buddhism and he quotes Carolyn Reese-David's for saying the same
thing. What I suspected all along that it said was something like this, that
conditionality dependent origination. And then somebody sent me the Chinese
version of that sutta and guess what it says. It's that conditionality dependent
origination and then has the twelve links. But anyhow, the sutta is not
about a self or they're not being a self. It's neither a self nor not. It's
just, well, streams of dependently arising, processes, interacting. When
things dissolve, there's nothing left to say. The unborn and unceasing are
already free. We go around thingifying the world. It's a water glass, right?
Obviously a water glass. It's got water in it, it's glass. You just thingify this.
It's just some pixels. That's all that's happening. You know, you're seeing some
colored pixels and you're making it into a water glass. We do that with
everything. We conceptualize it. Sanya, right? Can you experience the world
prior to Sanya? This is the advice to Bahia. Remember Bahia? He came to the
Buddha, wanted some teaching when the Buddha was on all around and the Buddha
said to him, in seeing, let there just be seeing. In hearing, just hearing. In
sensing, just sensing. Cognizing, just cognizing. When you can do that, Bahia,
there's no you in that. There's no you in this. Just this is the end of Duga.
Well, that was enough for Bahia to become fully awakened. It was a play on the
teaching in the Brihara Ranyaka Upanishad that the Buddha knew that Bahia
was following because he was Bahia of the bark cloth. He was dressed like a tree,
which is what the followers of the Brihara Ranyaka Upanishad wore. But in
seeing, let there just be seeing. Don't see objects. Can you just see seeing? When
things dissolve, there's nothing left to say. The unborn and unceasing are
already free. If you don't get born, you don't die, right? If you don't go around
giving birth to things, they're not going to cease, right? There's just the
visual field. It's all free already. The Buddha said it is real and it is unreal
and disposed real and unreal and it's neither one nor the other. It's very
important to remember the Buddha wasn't doing consistent metaphysics. He wasn't
doing metaphysics at all. Metaphysics is trying to explain how reality is what
it's like. The Buddha said repeatedly, I teach only Duga and the end of Duga.
And so it depended on to whom he was speaking, what he had to say. And so
sometimes he would say it's real and sometimes he'd say it's not real and
sometimes you say it both. Sometimes he would say it's neither. But it depended
on his listener. What the Buddha was teaching was what he felt people needed
to learn so that they could practice effectively. Now, indeed, there is such a
thing as Buddhist metaphysics. It's a big deal in the Abhidharma and the
commentaries. But it's not from the Buddha. It's from taking what the Buddha
taught and converting it into metaphysics. The Buddha was, well, if you
want to give him a title, a phenomenologist. He was studying phenomena
and how we respond to it. The way out of Duga don't respond with craving and
clinging when you have pleasant or unpleasant Vedana. Okay, that's not
metaphysics. That's the way out of Duga. It's all at ease. No amount of
Pappancha is going to put it at ease. It's incommunicatable, inconceivable,
indivisible. The universe is as it is. It's just there. But it's too big for our
little pea brains to handle. So we need to chop it up into bits and pieces to be
able to find things to eat in a place to live in, etc. But this is our
conventional approach to staying alive. But it's not what's actually there. What's
actually there is incommunicatable, inconceivable, indivisible. Remember, I
said there were only verbs. Nouns were just slow-moving verbs. Truth be
told, there's only one verb. Unfolding. We could say the universe is unfolding, but
the universe is superfluous. There's just unfolding. That's all that's happening.
But that's a little too much for our pea brains to take in. So we need to chop it
up into bits and pieces to find something to eat and something to wear and
it's a place to live, etc. But at the ultimate level, it's indivisible. It's
all interconnected in ways that aren't readily apparent. It's inconceivable. There
is no concept that's going to give you an accurate picture of what's going on.
And incommunicatable. All I can do is sort of be the finger pointing at the moon
and hope that you don't start looking at fingernail polish or rings or something
like that. So yes, a good teacher can point you in the direction, but
you're going to have to get there yourself because it's incommunicatable,
inconceivable, indivisible. You are not the same as or different from conditions
on which you depend. You are neither severed from nor forever fused with them.
This is the deathless teaching of Buddhists who care for the world. Those
six lines right there are more of the source of soda pie than anything else.
I've studied. You are not the same as or different from the conditions on which
you depend. You're neither severed from nor forever fused with them. So what do
you have for lunch? Do you have some lettuce maybe? Right? So you're not that
lettuce, but you're not separate from that lettuce. Right? It's become part of you,
but you're not forever fused with it, yet you're not severed from it. The fact
that you ate your lunch today has had an effect on who you are, how your brain
works and how your body works. You're not the same as or different from the
conditions on which you depend. You're neither severed from them nor forever
fused with them. This is the deathless teaching of Buddhists who care for the
world. This is soda pie. This is dependent origination. When Buddhists don't appear and
their followers are gone, the wisdom of awakening bursts forth by itself. You
don't need the Buddha to explain this to you. You don't need the Buddha's
followers to explain this to you, but it's really hard to see. But if you look
carefully, you can see this for yourself. I would have never seen it without the
Buddha and his followers pointing me in this direction. I really needed their
help. I wouldn't have gotten here otherwise, but it's there for anyone to
see who looks carefully. It's really nice. There are those who can teach us where
to look and how to look so that we can see all this stuff.
The next one that I want to share with you is entitled, well, it's entitled
Awakening by Stephen Bachelor. It's often entitled The Four Noble Truths. That's
the next chapter in my book, which starts on page 63. Again, this is a
different translation. This translation comes from Jay Garfield and his
Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way, which is a more literal translation. It
has a really good commentary. I would suggest you read Stephen Bachelor's
Fundamental Verses or Verses from the Center multiple times before you tackle
Garfield. Garfield's a little difficult, but yeah, reading them both will take you
a long ways. But I'm going to go with Stephen Bachelor's translation to start
with. So this particular chapter in the Malayama
Kakaraka starts with an imaginary opponent giving
Nagarjuna what for, saying, basically, you're corrupting the dharma by
teaching your emptiness because this opponent thinks that
emptiness is equivalent to nihilism. If something is empty, it means it doesn't
exist. This is a very common mistake. Please do not make that mistake. It just
means it's empty of inherent existence. It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
So if everything is empty, there would be no rising and passing.
Ennobling truths would not exist. There would be no understanding,
letting go, cultivating, realizing. Without tasting the fruits of practice,
there would be no sangha. With no truths, no dharma either.
With no sangha and dharma, how could you awaken?
Talk of emptiness, maligns, what is of value?
Acts and fruits, good and evil, conventions fall apart.
Nagarjuna replies, not knowing emptiness,
the need for it or the point of it. You subvert it.
The dharma taught by Buddha's hinges onto truths, partial truths of the world
and truths which are sublime. Without knowing how they differ,
you cannot know the deep. Without relying on conventions,
you cannot disclose the sublime. Without intuiting the sublime,
you cannot experience freedom. So the dharma taught by Buddha's
hinges on two truths. This is one of the early
elucidations of the doctrine of the two truths.
It doesn't show up, per se, in the suttas. There are hints of it.
The closest you'll come to finding the two truths
probably is at the end of my Digenekaya number nine, the Podapada Sutta.
There the Buddha says, a tatagata, a fully realized one,
can use these words, I, me, mine, and not be fooled by them.
So a fully awakened person can use the conventional
terms, the concepts from our conventional reality,
but not be fooled by them. The first time that
the doctrine of the two truths showed up in Buddhism, as far as I know,
is the questions of King Melinda. King Melinda was one of the Greek kings left
behind by Alexander the Great's army in Afghanistan,
and at that time Afghanistan was a Buddhist country.
Remember when the Taliban blew up those very tall statues of the Buddha?
Yeah, that was Buddhism from the time
after Alexander the Great, when there was
Buddhism in Afghanistan. And so King Melinda
asked a bunch of questions to an enlightened monk named Nagasina,
and what shows up in there is the first teaching on the two truths.
Here it says, partial truths of the world and truths which are
supplied. The actual literal Sanskrit says
truths that don't fully reveal and truths which are supplied.
So the truth is, this is my phone, right?
Touch your phone, my phone, right? But that doesn't fully reveal what's going on.
It doesn't fully reveal, well, the dead dinosaurs to make the plastic or the
sand that was dug up to make the silicon, or the
minerals that were mined, the metals that were mined, and the
sweatshop in China where they assembled it, and whoever wrote the software, and
all the rest that went into it. So when I say it's my phone or the conventional
level, that's true, but it doesn't fully reveal what's going on.
And it's the case for, well, all the conventional truths. Anytime you say
me or mine, on the conventional level, yeah, it's you.
I'm the one giving the talk right now, it's not you.
Conventionally, that's true, but this talk is
actually coming to you as a result of a whole bunch of soda pie,
right? The practice that I've done, the dharma talks I've heard,
the books I've read, the discussions I've had with my noble friends when we were
having noble conversations. Oh, that's what's feeding into it.
I'm just the mouthpiece of trying to express what the Buddha
expressed. Hopefully I'm doing a reasonably good job of it.
Okay, but me, that's only conventional, and then truths which are sublime.
Truths that, well, are inconceivable,
incommunicatable, right? It's just a little bit more than we can
express with our conventions. Without knowing how they differ, you cannot
know the deep. Without relying on conventions, you
cannot disclose the sublime. So the ultimate truths,
the non-conventional truths of the world, do need to be disclosed,
but just like you can't take somebody's hand and put it up against the moon and
say, now do you understand the moon? You just have to point.
And so that's what Nagarjuna is doing. That's what the Buddha was doing. That's
what I'm trying to do, is point you at these ultimate truths,
these truths beyond our conventional way of
accessing the world. And why? Without
intuiting the sublime, you cannot experience freedom.
The only way out of the dukkha is to gain an understanding of the world from the
ultimate perspective. The relative perspective, no
matter how accurately you get it, is not going to set you free.
Okay, now it's talked about as two truths. I prefer to talk about it as
two perspectives, truths seen from two different perspectives.
So if I had a bowl here, just a regular ordinary soup bowl,
is it concave or convex? What do you think? Concave or convex?
I mean, those are opposites. They can't be both, right?
Well, no, it's actually both. It depends on your perspective,
and it's very important to pick the proper perspective.
If you want to pour some soup into your soup bowl, you better take the concave
perspective. Otherwise, you're going to have a mess.
If you want to elevate a tea candle, it's probably going to work better if you use
the convex perspective, right?
It's really important to understand both perspectives.
Often when people begin to get hints of the ultimate perspective, they want to
throw away the relative perspective, the conventional
world. It won't work. You can't cross the street
from the ultimate perspective. Well, you get to the corner, you look down there,
you see a blast coming, you go, it's empty. You step in front of it,
you're dead. It's not going to work. There are times when it's absolutely
necessary to operate from a conventional perspective.
When you're eating your peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it's very important
you eat the sandwich and not your fingers, right?
When the Buddha was eating his food, he was fully awakened. He never ate his
fingers. He only ate the food, right? So the
relative perspective doesn't go away,
but it doesn't fully explain what's going on.
You need to be able to look from the ultimate
perspective, and what you see from that perspective,
well, you see soda pie, you see dependent origination,
you see, yeah, it's inconceivable, indivisible, incommunicatable,
but it has to be understood because that's where you find freedom.
That's the perspective that is going to enable you to let go of that
selfing, and when you let go of that selfing, that's where you're going to
find your freedom. Misperceiving emptiness
injures the unintelligent, like mishandling a snake or
miscasting a spell. The Buddha, disparate of teaching the dharma,
know it, knowing it hard to intuit its steps.
Your muddle conclusions do not affect emptiness.
Your denial of emptiness does not affect me.
You could see where Nagarjuna would be pretty tough in a debate,
right? Your muddled conclusions, right? It's like picking up a snake by the
tail and expecting not to get bitten. Doesn't work.
When emptiness is possible, everything is possible.
Where emptiness is impossible, nothing would be possible.
The fact that everything is dependently originated processes
means that they're changeable, right? It's all changing all the time.
If something had an essence, an implication of that would be that it
wouldn't change, right? I mean it's a water glass, right?
And if it had an essence of water glass, I could drop it on the floor and it
wouldn't break because it has an essence of water
glass and the essence means it's in there and it's not going to go away.
I drop it on the floor, it's going to break, right?
So if things had essences, they would be locked in that way.
If you had an essence, when you got it, you better hope you were in a good mood
because that's where you're going to be stuck forever, right?
In projecting your faults onto me, you forget the horse you are riding.
So this is a story about a man who had two dozen horses
and he went out one morning to count his horses. So he mounted up on one
and he rode around counting one, two, three, 22, 23. Oh no! One of my horses is
missing. Somebody stolen one of my horses, forgetting to count the horse he was riding.
Remember the Buddha disparate of teaching? Because
he didn't think people would get it. They had too much dust in their eyes.
So what Nagarjuna basically is saying to his an opponent is, you've got too much
dust in your eyes, Mr. Opponent. You forget the horse you're riding.
To see things existing by nature is to see them without causes of
and conditions, thus subverting causality, agents, tools, and acts, starting,
stopping, and ripening. So if you impute an essence to anything, you just
froze it. And furthermore, you assume it's been
like that since beginningless time. Nothing has an essence. It's all
dependently originated. And then what most
scholars consider the heart of the Malamayamaka Kaka.
Dependent origination is emptiness, which dependently configured is the
middle way. Everything is dependently originated.
Everything is empty.
So when you hear teachings on emptiness, you're hearing
teachings on dependent origination. It's just another perspective on the same
thing. Everything is empty because everything
is dependently originated. And furthermore,
this translation here doesn't really bring it out,
but emptiness also is empty. It's just another concept
that we're using to try and help you understand what's going on.
Don't make a big deal about emptiness. It too is empty.
It's independently originated phenomena. It's as empty as everything else.
There's a lot more to say about emptiness, but I'm going to share one more thing
from Nagarjuna's Malamayamaka Kaka. This comes from the next chapter,
which is entitled Nirvana.
This is something that gets people all wound up
when they hear it. Samsara is no different from Nirvana.
Nirvana and no different from Samsara. Samsara's horizons are nirvanas.
The two are exactly the same. What this is saying is that this
right here, this is Samsara if you look at it with the eyes of
craving and clinging. And this right here is Nirvana
if you look at it with the eyes of a Buddha.
Nirvana is not someplace some far away heaven for arhats or anything like that.
It's right here, right now, if you can process your input in a way that
doesn't lead to craving and clinging.
In fact, the whole idea of conceiving of Nirvana or
nibbana, however you want to do it, nibbana is Pali, nirvana sanskrit,
as having ontological existence as being a place that you can get to or
something like that. Well, it's got a serious problem because
we know that nibbana is unchanging.
And if you ain't in nibbana right now, you ain't going to get in because it
ain't going to change to let you in. You better hope it doesn't have ontological
existence. Nibbana is a realization. It's a realization
of the nature of reality that's so profound that it uproots
all of your tendencies to craving and clinging.
It's not a place or a thing. It's a realization.
And it too, yep, it's dependently originated based on your practice.
That's why we practice. All right, so it's with a fair amount of
angst, I say. Any questions?
Matrice,
you're still muted. Thank you. Thank you for this. It's been great.
This is going to sound like a stupid question, but I can't seem to get it out
of my mind. So if I have no essence, which
I can accept, I go to karma, then how do we explain
karma? How can you do karma? Okay, so the Buddha's
teachings on karma basically is pay attention to what you're
about to do. Actions have consequences.
Kama means action. That's what it means. Now at the time of the Buddha,
spiritual karma was ritual action. For example, if you were a farmer
and you want to have a good harvest, then you better get the gods on your side.
But to do that, you had to perform
ritual action, but you didn't know how to perform the ritual action because you
were a farmer, but luckily for you down the road,
there was some priesthood for a modest fee would perform the
ritual kama, the ritual action for you to engage your harvest. And the Buddha
goes, no, karma I declare on monks is intention.
In other words, pay attention to what you're about to do. It's going to have
consequences. That's what his teaching is primarily about.
Now we do find in the sutras where the Buddha is using
previous actions to explain why bad things happen to good people
or why good things happen to bad people. That's in the sutras, but is this just
skillful means or was it inserted later?
I don't know, but the teachings on kama are about paying attention to what
you're considering doing. It's going to have consequences.
What people want to do with kama is balance the books,
right? They want to say, okay, this person did an evil thing, so
they're going to have something evil come back to them.
But that's personal. That's on the relative level.
And we were just talking about, you know, when you get really down to it, the
person sort of disappear. Think about, well, one of the most
recent evil actions done, not this year, but not too long ago, was the invasion
of Iraq. That was, well, that was really bad
karma, really bad karma, really bad action. It resulted in the death of,
well, somewhere between 100,000 and a million Iraqis,
and it left how many millions of Iraqis with PTSD and how many of the soldiers
that went there with PTSD. And it led to the rise of ISIS. And I
mean, we could go on with all the really unwholesome,
unhelpful results of that action. Yes, those guys that actually did the
action, they seem like they got away with it.
And I don't like that. But when you start looking at the bigger picture,
no, nobody got away with anything. It was a very unwholesome action, and it
caused a whole lot of problems for a whole lot of people.
We want to make it personal, but the Buddha is pointing out that,
well, turns out we're much more interconnected
than it appears on the surface, right? So, yeah,
realize that every action you do is going to have
results that, yeah, depend on what's going on there,
and it's going to affect more than you.
Let me read you something. This is from the last chapter of my book, which is
actually entitled, Don't Be Fooled By Your Conceptualizing.
A human being is a part of a whole called by us, the universe,
a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and
feelings, as something separated from the rest,
a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
The striving to free oneself from this delusion
is the one issue of true religion, not to nourish the delusion,
but to try to overcome it is the way to reach the unattainable
measure of peace of mind. That's from Albert Einstein.
He was a smart guy, right? So, karma is about paying attention
to what you're about to do. It's going to have results,
but the Buddha said, don't try and figure out the threads of karma. It will lead
to either madness or great faclation. So, just pay attention to what you're
about to do. Does this address at all your
question? Yes, it does. There's still a little bit
more. Okay. If I hear you correctly, you're
saying there really isn't, it's just a view or an idea.
There's no collective, like a cumulative karma. No, I'm saying it's only
collective. It's only collective, but it's, but what about
a cumulative? It's collective in the sense that
karma, as long as we are not
in that stream, we're all subject to the karma,
karma that's universal. We're all creating it and we're all experiencing it.
I think that's what you're saying. Yeah.
But what about a cumulative then? Well, it's cumulative in that,
you know, they invaded Iraq and now we're dealing with ISIS.
That's cumulative to the world at large that there are all these terrorists who
were basically created by the invasion of Iraq.
Maybe Putin invaded Ukraine. He thought, well, the Americans got away with
invading Iraq. Didn't seem to go too bad for them.
And so the cumulative karma of it gave Putin bad ideas and he invaded Ukraine.
Maybe that's part of it as well. Don't try and figure out all the
threads that lead to madness or great vexation. So, yes, it accumulates. And
where does it accumulate in the universe? Okay, there's not some guys upstairs
that are writing down. Oh, she did a good thing. We'll give her two points. He did a
bad thing. That's minus seven. That's not happening.
What you do changes the universe. And so it's accumulating in the universe with
every action that you do. And it's accumulating in your own brain
with every thought, speech, and action because you're reprogramming yourself
with everything that you do. For example, someone joins an urban
gang. What do they make them do? Go out and commit a
crime. So they'll be useful to the gang. So they'll get used to committing crime.
So it won't be a big deal for them. Reprogram their brain so they'll be
a criminal. Well, we reprogram our brains with everything
that we do. So it's accumulating up here and it's
accumulating in the wider universe as well. Does that help?
Yes, thank you very much. Oh, you're very welcome.
Jeff.
So I haven't read Stephen's book yet and I think I will
definitely do that. All the other times that I tried to read
Nagarjuna, I've, you know, besides getting a little
perplexed, I've just really felt like I was trying to get my merit badge and
emptiness. Right. And so I was so glad when you
brought up the fact that the Buddha just teaches
suffering in the end of suffering. He's not really trying to get us to go
through this mental exercise. And, you know, as you're
saying, who's keeping score? And as you said, emptiness is a concept too. So I
was just looking at the PDF and for me, the
three lines that just are really helpful. I always think of this as,
okay, I've just had this great meditation on emptiness, right? And I get up and I'm
walking and I stub my toe and suddenly I'm, you know,
in a rage or something like that. Obviously, you know, obviously I'm
missing something. So your line here, Pappancha generates
thoughts and I guess you could put in Sana or Sankara.
Right. It leads to compulsive acts. Pappancha is stopped by emptiness.
And to me, that's the emptiness I want to understand. I don't, I don't need to go
through all of the manifestations, but if I can get
down to that simple level, then I'll be happy.
Yeah, that's, that's where we want to go. Part of that emptiness
that helps stop the Pappancha is realizing that
not only is there nothing worth craving, there's nothing that can be clung to.
It's all empty. It's all impermanent. It's all changing all the time.
And furthermore, there's nobody home to actually
succeed in clinging to what is craved. And so
getting that at not an intellectual level, but at a felt-sense level.
This is what the Buddha's after. This is the way to freedom.
Uproot the craver and there's no more craving. No more dukkha.
All right, Lynn. So I really like what you were saying about
sort of the universal nature of karma and not trying to
make it too personal. It's out there somewhere in the world.
And yet, I am the owner of my karma, here to my karma, born of my karma,
related to my karma, abide supported by my karma,
whatever karma I shall do for good or for ill of that,
I will be the heir. So how does, how do those fit together?
Thank you. Okay. So sometimes the Buddha taught self,
and sometimes he taught not self, and sometimes he taught there's neither
a self nor no self at all. So this is the teaching
on self. The five daily reflections from
Angrutra 557. I am of the nature to grow old sick and
die. I am not exempt from those. All that is
mine, dear and delightful, change and banish.
These are very much relative teachings. They're being taught on a
relative level. We can't dismiss the relative level.
So from the relative perspective, yeah, I'm going to grow old sick and die.
The old part's already happening. I can see every time I look in the mirror,
right? I've had things that I found dear and
delightful that changed and vanished. Okay, so on a personal relative level,
all that's going on. The actions I do, yeah, are going to have
consequences. So I live supported by my karma.
My previous actions, well, I worked as a computer programmer, earned a bunch of
money. You know, now I get Social Security and I
got a nest egg. So I live supported by my previous actions,
right? I am born of my karma. Who I am is
right now has occurred for actions I've done in the past.
Were they done by some other person in the past that has
made me who I am? Well, certainly a lot of people. Those
English guys that came over and ran off everybody else or suppressed them.
Yeah, that's part of who I am now. So it wasn't me,
but those actions have had an impact on me. I'm related to my karma. It's a time
of the Buddha and no Social Security. You only had your family.
Your relations were the most important thing that you had.
Your actions and their consequences are as important as your relatives
when you look at that from perspective of India two and a half thousand years ago.
So yeah, getting a sense of that. This is a teaching from
the relative perspective, the conventional perspective.
And it's very important to realize that the Buddha wasn't doing consistent
metaphysics. It wasn't like he stopped talking about
I and only talked about something on an ultimate level.
He's like, yeah, this is important. Do this practice. It'll be good for you,
right? And until you get fully awakened, you're going to be
assuming you have an eye. So your eye is going to get old sick and die. Your eye
is going to be dependent upon the actions that it does.
Pay particular attention to what you're about to do is going to have consequences.
That's what he's trying to teach. So yeah, does that help?
All right. Any other questions?
John. Hi. I just saw a simple question. Is there
will there be a way to access these recordings to listen to some of it again?
Yeah. Awesome. Yes. It'll be on audio Dharma. Give it a week for them to,
you know, edit the recordings. It will show up there on audio Dharma.
And after it shows up and I realize where it is, I will put a link
on my web page under talks that will point to it as well, but probably easiest
just to go to audio Dharma and plug in my name, search for it.
Thank you so much for this. Yeah.
Ronnie. I guess I may be stating something really
obvious. When you said emptiness is also a concept.
I assume that you can't just have that at that very get go. It's like the raft
analogy. You have to kind of go through
understanding all the soda pie and everything else. And maybe to it's the
end of this, you can give up or abandon this idea of emptiness.
And not abandon it. Just know that it's just another concept.
A useful one. Because something's empty, doesn't mean you abandon it.
You just know that it's dependently originated as well.
But I guess maybe my point is if I think of that as just another
concept at the very early part of this whole idea of dependent
origination, I seem to think that that may make it
harder for me to go through the understanding of this
part of the teaching. So I guess maybe I'm clarifying with you if there's a
timing part of this to understand this. That's
one of my questions. Yeah. So that very definitely is.
So I had read Stephen bachelor's translation versus from the center.
Let's say somewhere between a half a dozen and a dozen times.
Never got a hint of it. His translation doesn't do it justice really.
And I read Jay Garfield's translation, which does do it justice.
And it still went over my head until I read it the second time.
And when I got it, I literally jumped out of the couch that I was sitting on and
go, yes! That I understood at that point that
yeah, even emptiness is just another concept to try and help us out.
All of this, the Four Noble Truths, they're concepts to try and help us out.
Dependent origination is just another concept to try and help us out.
But these are all very, very useful concepts.
As it turns out, anything that we can talk about is,
well, we're just talking about concepts. We have to conceptualize it to be able to
talk about it. But it doesn't mean that just because
it's a concept, it's not useful. Because it's all, I mean,
this is a cell phone, right? It has material existence.
But unless I conceptualize it as a cell phone and, you know, punch the thing on
the back that makes it wake up and, you know, dial the number or
whatever, until I actually start using it,
it's, yeah, it's just a concept. But even then the idea of a phone call
is just a concept. But it's a very useful concept.
They're all concepts. But some of them are quite useful.
And emptiness is just another one of these quite useful concepts.
But I would say, don't worry about it. I'd say the most important thing is just
realize that whatever you're experiencing is
dependently originated. And just keep looking at that
more and more. And then hopefully at some point the fact that
everything is a concept becomes equivalent to, oh, everything is
dependently originated. I'm just stopping these streams at this point and
making a concept out of it. Because that's useful at this point
at the conventional level. Does that help?
Yes, very much so. A second question is regarding the concentration
practice, the genre practice. Is there a certain stage in one's
spiritual path where one should engage in that? Or just it's just whenever you
feel like you're ready? Or how would you sort of
get out to some of us? So when I tell people if you want to
come on a retreat with me, you need to have done two
one week or longer residential retreats.
By that point, you will have enough meditation experience
to where you can start to learn the Janus,
hopefully. There's no guarantees, but that seems to be the minimum.
You really go on your first residential retreat to find out what it's
like to be on a retreat. And you go on your second
residential retreat to find out it wasn't quite like what you thought it
was. So then on your third retreat, you're really ready to get going.
And so two one week or longer residential retreats
is usually enough background so that at that point you could
make sense of what's being taught. Because to do that, you're going to
have to have learned to meditate. You're going to be doing stuff before
you go on the retreat, between the retreats and so forth.
So get some skill at meditation. Be able to follow your breath at least
somewhat. Learn how to do some metapractice,
those sort of skills you want to have coming in. Because my retreat, I just
assume everybody knows how to meditate. And so I
say, all right, here's some ways that you can work with your breathing that will
take it to a deeper level. But I don't tell you
so much about how to do it.
Thank you. And someone put in the chat, residential
retreats are not easily accessible. Well, yeah, these days
they're not easily accessible at all, unfortunately.
So I do accept two one week or longer Zoom retreats.
But of course, you will have to be really dedicated on that Zoom retreat.
You can't just show up for the Dharma talks. I mean, you've got to really
actually meditate and keep silence and so forth to have
enough background. But even, you know, back before COVID,
yeah, you needed to be able to take time off work and they cost money and so
forth.
I wish it was more easily available. It would be
be a better world if everybody had an easily available retreat.
Amy.
Hello. Hi. Thank you very much for today for your book.
I want to address or ask you a question about
the idea that we conceptualize everything
used, you know, the example of the corvette
is very helpful. If you think about its component parts,
we conceptualize it as a corvette. The example of the cell phone
also very easy entryway into that idea.
Even your glass as actually my experience of it would have been pixels
actually. And even if that glass was physically
in its space with me, I could also break it down to,
you know, again, I think you said if it fell and smashed into
a million pieces, it would still be the same thing.
It wouldn't, I guess it's an entryway into seeing the concept of the
glass as false. Also, what I'm a little bit
stuck on is, for example, the water in the glass.
Yeah. If I may. Yeah. So materiality, if I spill the water on the floor, it's still
water. All right. But what if it soaks into the
floor?
I mean, it didn't evaporate, it just soaked into the floor.
Now it's part of the floor. So it's changed. It's not, right?
Now the hydrogen and oxygen atoms are still the same.
Okay. So at that level, there's not a lot of change going on.
Except when we really get down to that level,
that's not where we're doing our craving and clinging.
Right? We're doing the craving and clinging at a much more
macroscopic level. You know, I'm not really
clinging to the, when I'm thirsty, I'm not clinging to the oxygen atom at that
point in the glass. Right? I'm clinging to the water
because it'll slake my thirst. So we're working at the level of
practicality for understanding the reality that we're interacting with,
such that we don't interact with it with the craving and clinging bit.
Yeah. Materiality may change form, the water may evaporate, it may freeze,
something like that. It's still water. Okay.
But when it's ice, it's conceptualized different
than when it's steam. Those two are really conceptualized different,
even though it's the same atoms, perhaps, that are involved.
And so we, we, yes, can get down into the quantum level and all this other
stuff, but that's not where we're doing our craving and clinging.
So when we step back to the world in which we're operating where it's craving
and clinging, yeah, it's a glass, it's a cell phone,
it's me. Right? And I'm just, I'm empty as
everything else. I'm just the product of a bunch of
streams of dependently arising processes interacting.
And so it's at that level that we're going to find freedom.
I don't think we're going to find freedom by not clinging to oxygen atoms or
something like that. Does that help? Yes, it does. Thank you very much.
Hi, thank you. This has been truly helpful. My question is, you mentioned earlier
Buddhist metaphysics. Yes. And having been originally trained in
meditation and Buddhist philosophy in the Tibetan system,
I definitely got a big dollop of that. Yes.
Some parts, whereas the explanation of the emptiness
that I received in the Theravada system make sense to me.
I can understand that there was something that felt always
elusive, highly convoluted, abstract, and not clearly proven
by the example that we're giving on the way emptiness is explained in the
Tibetan systems. Now, some teachers say that the two
explanations are compatible. Others, like Tanisaru Miku, say they're not.
And I like to have your response to that,
because I don't want to give up something just because it's difficult or
maybe it's not being the terms that have been translated
poorly or it's whatever. But I don't want to continue to put a
lot of effort into something that doesn't go anywhere.
And particularly when it comes to emptiness or phenomena and like
everything is like a dream, sometimes it seems to be taken a little bit to
extreme to me. It becomes almost like, what is the
term? There is a term that comes from
spiritual bypass. Yeah. Yeah. Do you get what I'm
saying, right? I get what you're saying. So, I have
studied some Tibetan philosophy and teachings and practices,
but I would not say that my understanding of
Tibetan philosophy is broad enough to say that, yes, it does
come together exactly the same place that the
emptiness comes together from the Theravada
perspective. But I see a lot of similarities and I see where it could
be possible, but I can't, you know, I just don't have enough
background to say for sure. Certainly, the, there are
schools in the Tibetan who are looking to the Muayyamaka,
Kharika, as a very basic foundational practice for their
understanding of emptiness. But, well, the truth be told,
I haven't found any system in Buddhism or anything else
that I totally agree with. You know, I mean,
maybe it's, it's hubris on my part, but, you know,
they say if you understand quantum mechanics, it proves you have no clue
about quantum mechanics. Okay, I don't claim to understand
quantum mechanics, but I think the standard interpretation of quantum
mechanics is so-called Copenhagen interpretation.
I think it's mistaken, right? You know, but I'm not going to sit here and try and
explain to you everything about why I think it's
mistaken and what the right way to look at it is. I just get the sense that, no,
they've missed the point here. And yes, it does have to do with
conceptualization. So, I mean, I don't agree with
orthodox Jirvan Buddhism. I don't agree with Tibetan Buddhism. I don't agree
with Zen Buddhism. In any of these in their entirety,
but I agree with enough of what they're teaching that I find it useful.
And so that's what I'm working on. What can I find in here
that's helpful for me? What can I find in these teachings that
propels me down the spiritual path? What can I find in here that
helps me do less craving and clinging, helps me to be a more compassionate
person? And I'm finding that in all of these,
or maybe not in quantum mechanics, but in all the Buddhist teachings I do find
there's helpful stuff there. So, I take what I find helpful and the
rest of it I just put in the I don't know bucket.
The I don't know bucket that I've got is really quite big.
And I just pull stuff out and look at it and a lot of times just throw it back
in. Sometimes I get an understanding and come up with something
like soda pie. So, yeah, I don't know bucket and throw
a lot of stuff in there and pick stuff out of it
occasionally when you get some new information, see if it makes sense.
Thank you. Thank you. That's helpful. Thank you. Good.
So, we've got five minutes. I think that's time for meta.
So, in order to begin, please put your attention on your breath for a few
moments.
So, do you like to be happy? I mean, if you're happy, is that a good thing?
Do you like that? Can you appreciate it when you're happy?
Wouldn't it be nice to be happy right now?
Can you get in touch with the fact I like being happy?
May you be happy? Do you like it when your friends are happy?
I mean, is that a good thing? I like it when my friends are happy.
A lot more fun to hang out with them.
Wouldn't it be great if all of your friends were happy?
May all of our friends be happy?
What if your acquaintances were happy? What if everybody at work,
everybody in the grocery store, all your neighbors, what if they were all happy?
That'd be nice. You know, all the clerks are happy,
your neighbors are all happy. Wouldn't it be great if all of our
acquaintances were happy? May everyone we encounter be happy?
What if the difficult people in our lives were happy?
I mean, genuinely happy. Happy because of wholesome activities,
not that evil thing, whatever they were doing.
Alright, but wouldn't it be nice if all the difficult people could find a
source of wholesome happiness? They'd probably be a lot less difficult.
May all of the difficult people be happy, wholesomely happy.
What if everybody on the planet was happy?
What would that be like? Everybody, everywhere happy.
I'd like that. That's where I want to live.
May all beings everywhere be happy.
So thank you. It is said that a good way to make good karma is to teach Sadama,
so I appreciate this opportunity. So may any merit
from today's teachings be for the benefit and liberation
of all beings everywhere. And as I mentioned earlier,
all the dana that you sent to Sati Center for today
will go to Ukrainian Relief. I'll leave you with these words.
All I'm saying is simply this, that all mankind is tied together.
All life is interrelated and we are all caught in an inescapable network of
mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny.
Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.
For some strange reason I can never be what I ought to be
until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be
until I am what I ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of
reality. That's from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
May all of you be happy, healthy, and may your practice be fruitful.
