 So fear is a very important part of both the spiritual life and also just any life of being alive, I believe. And as we do a mindfulness practice or an awareness practice, one of the important emotions or feelings, responses that we become sensitive to, aware of, become familiar to it, is fear. And we become familiar with fear both in the sense of getting to know it, but also familiar in the sense of becoming comfortable with it, becoming at ease with it, so that we're not frightened by our fear or not aversive to our fear or not confused by the fact that we're afraid. It's possible that fear is one of the most common emotions that we have that causes us difficulty or trouble or inhibits us in our lives. A lot of people, as soon as they start doing some kind of self-reflective practice, getting aware of what goes on inside of themselves, their thoughts and their feelings, become surprised to the degree in which fear is a big part of their life. It's fairly common for people to come to me and say, I didn't know that there's an underlying pervasive layer of fear that's there all the time. I didn't know it was there all the time. It's always pretty subtle. It's kind of like the background or the wallpaper. It's always there, the fear. The fear can be many things. We all have our own pet fears that are kind of the loudest or the most strongest influence in our lives. But there's the fear of rejection, a fear of what other people are going to think of us, a fear of making a fool of ourselves, the fear of losing our security, the fear of what are some of your fears that you guys have. Can you add to the list? Fear of losing people that you love. Fear of death. Fear of wasting your life. Fear of fear. Let's keep the fear at your arm's distance. What else? Fear of not achieving what we want. But I wonder if that's a little bit abstract way of saying you're afraid of something else. What are you afraid will happen to you if you don't achieve what you want to achieve? You might ask, you kind of explore a little bit. What are you afraid? Why is it so bad not to achieve what you want? What would happen to you that would cause you fear? Think about it. Typically you are afraid to choose your face at this point. Choose your face. Lose your face. Because you assume that you will achieve something in your faith? A fear of embarrassment is connected to that. What else? Fear of change. Fear of change. Does that cover them all? That's a big one. Fear of change. The perception, the insight of change is one of the important insights that comes with mindfulness practice. To the degree in which we are afraid of change, to that degree, as the practice deepens, the practice itself will evoke fear. Because the practice reveals how things are changeable, how they change. What else? Fear of speaking in front of a group? The rest of you? The fear of the unknown. What do you mean the practice reveals how things change? Not how so much, but that they do. In practice, if you pay very careful attention to what's going on in your experience, you'll find that your experience is changing very rapidly. And the things that we want to rely on, that we want for our security, to provide us with security, aren't there as steadily and as fixedly as we might hope. And this is true in small microscopic details of experience. And it's obviously true in great things. For example, we put our security in our loved ones. Our loved ones disappear. So what happens then if we don't have them to provide us with security? Fear of anger. Fear of our own power. Sometimes it's connected to or connected, but sometimes not. Fear of success. Again, for all these things you can ask this second level of question, but what are you afraid will happen if you succeed? I've seen myself undo myself and that's what I assume it was. It's hard to nail down. I'm afraid you'll undo yourself. I've seen myself undo myself from doing things to sabotage myself. To stop myself from getting what I thought I wanted. So afraid of success, so then you undermine the success, undermines the possibility of it. But what's motivating the undermining? What are you afraid will happen if you succeed? Any change? Same time, why? The second level questions are tough. Are tough? There are second level questions in a sense, but I propose to you that they get closer to what's primarily going on. Sometimes when we state what we're afraid of, that's the second level actually of removed from what we're really afraid of. So as an exercise you might ask yourself sometimes, what am I afraid of? I'm afraid of A. A happening. If A happens, then what am I afraid will happen if A happens? So for example, I'm afraid of failure. Well really what you might be afraid of is you might be afraid of the embarrassment of losing face. And it might be more interesting to study or become aware of how we're concerned about our reputation or our face or whatever than it is about failure itself. Does that make sense? It's interesting that Buddhism has five great fears that they list. And I don't remember all five I think at the moment, but one is fear of death, the other is fear of unusual states of mind, the third is fear of losing one's livelihood, the fourth is probably fear of losing those who are close to us or dear to us, and the fifth is fear of public speaking. What? It seems that way, but I think there are people, I know people who probably would prefer to die than to speak in front of a crowd of people. And maybe they're incompatible, but fear of death and fear of speaking in front of others, what is that? It's probably a complicated thing, but perhaps in a kind of metaphorical way, maybe ultimately it's a kind of fear of dying, a fear of letting our self-identity or self-image dying in front of others. Because many of us are self-identity, our self-image is so important. Fear of rejection, which is kind of a dying also maybe. What would you say that one would do? Unusual states of mind. Drugs. Sorry? What sounds like drugs? It could be drugs, but there are a lot of unusual states of mind that can happen. One form it takes is afraid of going crazy. I've known a lot of people for whom a parent who actually went a little bit, I don't know what the right word is, but a little bit crazy, they were maybe institutionalized in a mental hospital or something, and growing up then with that idea that happened to their parent, they're afraid, the same thing will happen to them. Those states of mind, so they're afraid of that. But they can be powerful states of mind, kind of openings of consciousness, unusual states of perception, black holes that we fall into of severe depression or severe anxiety, all kinds of strong states of mind that might arise that we're afraid of. Fear of intimacy, not the same thing exactly, but I just came to my mind right now, no one said it. I have a question. Yes? Someone said that people who do a lot of planning and meditation have fear, so is that really true? I don't like so much the language true because there seems to be, I wouldn't say it's always the case. So I'm trying to figure out if this is like the only time I have pride in my life so I can plan? Maybe. Or if there's actual fear involved, because I've spent a lot of time reflecting on that because you brought it up with people and they can't figure out what I'm afraid of. Or maybe forgetting to do something. Maybe. I think the investigation shouldn't be, in this case, maybe what you're afraid of, not thinking or analyzing it so much, but just drop into your body and feel what's going on in your body. And it might be a very, very low level of apprehension or subtle anxiety. So you feel your way into it rather than kind of think what it might be or what it's about. But it might not be fear, but more often than not, people spend a lot of time in planning. There's kind of a level of apprehension that seems to be the factory for it. But I wouldn't say always. I mean, planning, to some degree of planning, is a necessary inherent part of life. If you never do any planning the rest of your life, if you're completely not given any chance at all, you might have to finally get the outlet for going to help the amount of planning. I don't know. So I wouldn't pathologize or problematize everything. But if you do the investigation, do the sensing into your body, and you don't find any fear, then I wouldn't worry about it. I'm not worried about it. I just thought I'd bring you that. But usually, if something is very reoccurring, it seems like you try to go back, you'll be in the present moment, you try to, maybe it's your breath a little bit, and the common thing you keep going back to over is the same thing. Then there's something which is fueling it. And it might not be fear. It could also be, for example, excitement or curiosity. Or it could be delight even. You have minus delights in ordering everything into order, and it just brings you a tremendous sense of security and well-being, to know that everything can be, at least in your imagination, tomorrow, it could be this way. I wouldn't say it's a hindrance to meditation, but to be preoccupied in that is a hindrance to being present. Because when we're preoccupied, the definition of preoccupation sense is not being present, because you're lost in some concern. And what we're trying to do in meditation is not to be preoccupied in anything. But that doesn't mean we're trying to stop everything, it's just simply not preoccupied. But who's in control? You or the planning? That's a good question. It depends. If the planning's in control, you're probably not free. I can go away from it, back to the breath, but then I'll be very concentrated from that, and then I might go back to that, or I might plan something else. And sometimes I don't plan anything for days at a time. I see. So I don't know, it's just... Yeah, that's your job. It's possible that the details might be different, but fear is pretty universal. So the Buddha listed the five great fears, right? So maybe for us, maybe those five are only true for Indian, ancient Indians from 2500 years ago, maybe. But I suspect that sounds pretty... Maybe we could come up with a sixth one for our culture. But fear itself, I think, is a pretty universal phenomena. Perhaps the ten fear I'm talking about is the low-level anxiety. It's possible that anxiousness. For example, the fear of... Perhaps the fear of what people will think of us, the fear of rejection. Perhaps it isn't as strong. In a community, it's tightly bound, strong family connections, strong village or town connections. You know everybody, and you grew up with all these siblings who took care of you, and a lot of people who loved you. It's possible in that kind of environment. And that could happen in this country also in some small communities. That the kind of sense of unworthiness, a sense of being alienated, and the kind of feelings that might arise from that, the loneliness, the anxiety of being rejected, might not be so prevalent. So I think the details of what we're afraid of could be very different in different cultures and different backgrounds. But fear, I think, is pretty universal. It's universal enough so that the Buddha defined the fulfillment of the Buddhist path as attaining a state of fearlessness. And it's considered one of the great gifts you can give others, is the gift of fearlessness, your fearlessness. But the details could be particular to differences in different cultures. Do you have any experience in comparative studies? A little bit, yeah. What do you know? Well, it was what I redefined as the anxiety that linked Western culture and Western consciousness being much more clear, in which you were talking about the sense of alienation, fragmentation, and that's more succeeded than Western culture. There's some famous stories that I've told a few of them, told them here. But one of them is Ajahn Sumedho, who is an American monk who lived in Thailand for many years, now teaches in England. And he was asked once, what was the difference between being a teacher for Thais and being a teacher for Westerners? And he said, self-hate. In the West, there's a lot of self-hate. And he didn't encounter the degree of kind of epidemic self-hate among people in Thailand. So there are differences. And self-hate, feelings of unworthiness, feelings of shame, are very strong, seemingly epidemic in our culture here. And there are also strong cultural differences and also differences in the way people live, who are here and there. So if any of you are fearless, your choice is being lonely, because you cannot just leave among the people who don't share your point of view this way. So if I understand you, or just to kind of continue that train of thought, one of the common fears for people who practice is that the inner changes that are happening as they practice will make them kind of lose their connection with their friends or their family or society around them. And some of that is kind of a necessary fear, because some degree it's not going to happen, but some degree there is a kind of change like that. And especially sometimes kind of the integration of the sense of integrity that can arise through meditation practice, integration of that integrity, of that sense of fulfillment into our daily actions and our daily conversations and relationships is a whole practice in itself, is a whole difficult task to learn. And a lot of people will find that they get afraid of their own spiritual practice because it's requiring them to explore a new way of being with their friends and family that's different than who they were before, and then their relationships might have to change. So my own example was that when I started sitting on a regular basis, I was living with a couple of friends, and I felt at some point that I either had to give up my friends or give up my meditation practice, because who I was becoming through my meditation practice was different than how I was usually with my friends. And no three of us, no one of us could figure out how to find a new relationship. So in that case I actually gave up my meditation practice because I didn't know how to integrate it. It took me some time before I was able to start again. And some of our, for example, some of our friends, some of our professions, some of our relationships are based sometimes on a lot of, on particular patterns of personality, particular patterns of relating to each other. So for example, some people might know, the way we relate to them is that we boost each other's ego by criticizing all the people we know. You know, you get together and you gossip, you know what they, the person did, my boss said he's such a jerk, and this person's so terrible, and everybody else is so bad but us, right? And that's, you know, we kind of play this game, and each time you play it you feel kind of, you know, you get energy from being critical, and you kind of feel kind of bonding with the other person, you feel really great, and you feel like you belong with this person, and really close. But you know, it's at the expense of feeling separate. And as you sit in your spiritual practice, or in your self-awareness practice, and realize, wait a minute, this feels kind of yucky to always be kind of criticizing everyone, you know. I don't know if I want to continue always criticizing people, so I'll try not doing it. And then you meet your friend, and your friend still wants you to play the game, but you don't want to play the game, and then you, what kind of friendship do we have? If we don't have, if the friendship has been established on this game of criticism, what kind of friendship do I have from not playing the game? And it can be very frightening, oh my God, I might lose my friend, because we don't have any basis except through criticism. And so it can be frightening. And some people might decide that, you know, to kind of, in a sense, let go of those friends, and some people might decide or find that they can find new ways of being with those friends, based on a different premise, based on a different way of relating. So the practice itself can bring fear, on many different levels. Fear of what's arising within us, fear of what we have to see about ourselves. Self-knowledge is seldom nice. It's often kind of a surprise, what we learn about ourselves, we pay attention. And many of us also, but we can be afraid of, you know, how our relationships might change as a result. And I hope you have some sense that you're not becoming asocial through spiritual and meditation practice. Isn't that you're supposed to become separate and removed and distant? And meditation practice, I hope, doesn't do that for you. But it might mean a re-evaluation and a re-orientation of some of the values by which you've organized your life. And sometimes that requires real change. And to expect that a spiritual practice will never require you to change, kind of sacrifice something, is actually unrealistic. It does require maybe sacrifice or re-orientation at times. For example, the story I like to tell is of a lawyer. I came to retreat and he came for an interview with a teacher. And he said, I'm a lawyer and in my particular law practice, the kind of clients I have, the kind of situation I find myself in, I'm expected to lie. Can you please tell me how I can be a good Buddhist practitioner and lie at the same time? And he expected an answer. He expected some positive little trick to do that. And we had to tell him, sorry, there's no way you can do this. And if you're really serious about developing your self-awareness, developing your sense of personal integrity, at some point you have to renounce your line. And perhaps that means finding a different kind of law practice or a different kind of occupation. So sometimes spiritual practice does require something of us and that creates fear also. Or finding different friends, you might not be easy. It might not be easy. So sometimes there's a transition period in people's lives. The transition period is quite awkward because we don't have the support, don't have the kind of contact and friendship that we used to have. But for some people they have fine relationships with others and they find that a meditation practice or a mindfulness practice doesn't require them to give up their friendships or their relationships. It just makes them richer and make them feel closer because there's less fear, less inhibition, less being preoccupied. And when you're less preoccupied, you're more attentive for other people. And if you're more attentive to other people, the relationships become richer. So fear. The simplest definition of fear, perhaps, is that it's a movement of aversion to pain, aversion to feeling pain of some sort or other. And I don't know if some of you have studied psychology, but do you have a better definition of fear? Linda, do you know? I just trumped that up as a definition. It's usually defined against anxiety and fear. It's usually that which has an object and anxiety is the sort of fear without an object. The pre-floating kind of fear. So in Buddhist psychology, fear is connected to aversion. It's a form of aversion. But I think aversion to pulling back from, in a sense, from some kind of threat. Maybe not necessarily just pain, but just some kind of threat. And what's interesting about Buddhist psychology is that it categorizes or divides fear into some kinds of fears which are considered healthy to have and some which are considered unhealthy to have. Some which are kind of inappropriate to have as a range of experiences we go through life and some which are not. And so it isn't that all our fears are problematic. Some fears are actually, the Buddhist word is our guardians. My wife listened to NPR the other day and they were interviewing someone who wrote a book called The Gift of Fear. Has someone heard the program of the name of the book? This person thought something about fear as a real gift because, as she explained it to me, there's a lot of real creative responses that can happen under the intensity of fear. And sometimes that's true. One of the forms of fear which in Buddhist psychology is considered healthy is the fear of violating, in a sense, our personal integrity. We get a sense from our meditation practice of a sense of integrity, a sense of wholeness, a sense of personal honesty. Integrity is a word I like to use the most. And there would be a fear of doing something that threatens that or destroys that or violates that. So lying, for example, if you're very sensitive, you'll notice how lying will actually taint or color or darken over or fragment the sense of integrity within you. And hurting someone else intentionally, hurting someone, stealing from someone, you can't really do those things without the kind of violation of your integrity. And to feel afraid of that, to feel it coming, to feel looming up the possibility. And then there's a kind of a pulling back, kind of a fear, which is not considered a problem in Buddhism. If you don't have that kind of fear, you're considered to be unhealthy in Buddhism. So fear is not such a bad... The kind of fear which is, Buddhism calls unwholesome or unhealthy, is often the kind of fear which is maybe kind of nonspecific. It has to do with anxiety. It has to do with threats which are not really clear and present. If someone is about to mug you, it's good to be afraid. And I think, however, I think that was kind of an example of my wife used in telling me about this NPR book review, The Gift of Fear. I guess the guy said something like, if you're about to be mugged, it's good to be afraid. And because the fear might elicit unusual, appropriate responses that you can take care of yourself. And I suspect that's probably true oftentimes. But many of us, our fear is often mixed with anxiety. So we're about to get mugged, and not only are we afraid, but we're also very anxious. And so, can we be afraid without being anxious? What would that look like? Because I've had a lot of friends who've been held up, because I lived in a Zen Center in San Francisco. It was a... a high mug area. And many times I've heard Zen students say, you know, I was held up. What was really remarkable was how calm I was. And they would tribute it to their meditation practice. And I just seemed to know what to do. That kind of kept the situation under control. I didn't freak out. I didn't make things worse. I kind of was able to deal with it. There was one friend of mine who was held up at knife point. And he took out his wallet and said, look, this is what I have. And you're welcome to accept, you know, I need a little bit of money to get home. I need to keep a little bit of it. I'll give you the rest. And they had this conversation back and forth talking about... And the other friend walked by them and thought they were just having a conversation and just kept going. And he kind of meant that he didn't mind too much giving him the money. And he wanted some money for himself. So they kind of worked it out. It's interesting that you say that because some years ago I was attacked and I didn't have sort of enough fear. I mean, I didn't pay attention to the fear that was there. And so I got attacked. And in the aftermath I became very afraid in all kinds of circumstances. And on one of my bodies I suddenly became aware that I lived in another dangerous neighborhood. Which I really hadn't tuned in two before because I had money to move. So it alerted me to all of the things. Which came off with that sort of level of constant fear. And I decided to take her off. And it's that... I mean, was the whole Satan who succeeds fear... or paranoia, should have to hide in front of her awareness? So maybe there's fear in the learning system. And maybe if there's really something there, it might be just popular. And if there's not something there... So isn't it actually healthy? Yeah, I mean, in this sense, for example, you know about letters from your goodness events. Yes? Learning from our experiences is a wise thing to do. But sometimes we make the wrong conclusions from our experience. So for example, if we get... it sounds like Linda was, you know, she had kind of... maybe she was afraid, but she didn't listen to it well enough. And so she allowed herself to get into a situation where she was mugged. And so then as a result of that, she doesn't trust herself anymore. It doesn't trust her own ability to kind of really notice realistically what the difference is between a threatening situation and not. And so then she stays... she has this heightened... unnecessary heightened level of fear all the time. Because she's learned she can't trust herself anymore. And that second... that kind of... that kind of reactive level of heightened fear might or might not be useful. One of the interesting things about Buddhist practice, I believe, or Buddhism, is that... it actually takes all these things, all our fears, all our... even anger and all kinds of... considered to be kind of negative emotions here in the West, and say they all are, in a sense, things to be respected. Because they all indicate that something needs to be paid attention to. So in a sense, in a kind of funny way, we can say all fear is healthy. Because it says there's something here which is wrong. And so I need to find out what that is. And if someone's about to mug you, you might find out you're about to be mugged, and you better get some help. But if you find yourself feeling anxious all the time, then that constant anxiety is also an indication of something that needs to be paid attention to. And so what is that? What is it that really needs attending to? Maybe it's the fact that you've learned you can't trust yourself, because you don't know how to pay attention to your emotions and feelings. And if that's the case, well maybe you need to learn the skills to have greater self-awareness. Yes? That really fits back into the point I was asking about cultures before, because if as a society we reinforce this pre-floating anxiety, and so that among our friends, or groups, or organizations, or institutions, the patterns of behavior reinforce that. And then it takes a tremendous amount of effort for individuals to recondition their experience to be encountered. What is the reinforcing patterns? I think so. So give one example. Try not to be a loser. Try not to be a loser. Yes? I was surprised before, and actually what you said made for the reason, when you said the Buddha said one of the greatest gifts is to give somebody to not be fearful anymore. And I, as you went on to say, I thought thought two fears can be a very useful thing. Did you really mean not healthy fear there? Fearlessness in terms of, you know, as a kind of goal in Buddhism is not the absence of fear necessarily, but rather is you're not controlled by your fear. You're not preoccupied. You're not caught by your fear. So fear might be there, but you see it as something that's there. You recognize it, but you don't, and then you can, then you respond to it wisely. Say, oh, this is information I need to find out. Is this really a real threat now, or is it just an imagined threat? So the gift of fearlessness is, I think what it's more is that to be around someone who seems to be fearless feels very reassuring. And so the gift of fear, you're not giving people, you know, making them fearless necessarily, but you're providing them with your sense of you are fearless. You know, not in the sense of the decals and people have behind their four-wheel drive pickup trucks that says, say, have no fear. I think that's a little bit different meaning. Buddhist fearless. There's an alternate amount of movies that absolutely it's still fear. That's exactly what they're for, the horror of. That's almost, seems like a lot. Why would people want to do that? It is so, it's hurtful if you have it for a long time. Why do you generally, younger people want to do that? I'll give two theories and then maybe some of you guys can offer some ideas. One is recently a friend overheard this conversation between her two and a half year old and a four year old. They were talking to each other. And the four year old had just gone to scene some kind of movie. I don't know what it was. And she was talking about how it was really frightening. She was really afraid. And the two and a half year old said, I won't go. I'm not going to go see that. I don't want to see that. Why did you go see it? And the four year old said, oh, it's really neat. And maybe there's a certain level of maybe developmentally that kind of exploration of emotion, emotional states. Maybe for this four year old it was kind of exciting to be in an environment where there was fear, but also at the same time knowing was safe. And kind of exploring limits and exploring things. So maybe it's, you know, sometimes it's developmentally, it's kind of an interesting thing to do. Another reason perhaps theory would be some people live a very unfulfilled lives and really kind of maybe sometimes cut off from themselves emotionally. And don't have a lot of natural sense of aliveness within them. And going to a terror movie can really get the aliveness pumping really fast up and alive. And some of these kind of rush you get from that. And you feel really alive and really energized and really, you know, you're not preoccupied with your loneliness or your, you know, your relationships with others or with, you know, all these kinds of concerns you might have. And you feel really great. So it can be kind of an addiction to get this kind of rush of adrenaline or whatever that might come and makes you feel more alive. So those are two theories. I just want to, I'll fear an unusual body of violence thing if the matter is. Yes. It's kind of healthy but it's also anxiety producing and stress producing. So it's really attractive. Yes. When did, if you're going to a horror movie, when that, couldn't it release sometimes things that you trapped inside maybe? Maybe so, yeah. That would be the reason why some of the film. Maybe so, yeah. You know how you're always telling us to pay attention to the feelings that we have in our body when we're meditating? Well, I was thinking about that in relation to this talk that you're giving us about fear and saying that fear is an aversion to feeling pain. So I noticed when we did that body scan one time, I noticed how upset I was when we did that. And I think that the reason that I was upset about it is because I was having that aversion to feeling pain. It was like you kept making me pay attention to my body. And I was getting more and more angry with you because there was something I didn't want to pay attention to. In your body? Yeah. But I didn't know that that was what was going on and I didn't know that for a long time. But that's clearly what was going on. So I was just thinking, the thing that you said about self-knowledge is seldom pleasant. So this whole meditation thing is really quite a process, isn't it? That's for sure. I feel like I've embarked on this river trip and now I'm on it. I'm never quite sure what's going to be around the next bend, but it's like I'm allowing it all to happen. But it is quite an adventure, isn't it? It's quite an adventure. And in a sense, perhaps the opposite of fear is trust. And one of the things we can learn by doing a practice like this is a kind of a trust. So as you go down the river of life, you can float on top of it rather than having to constantly swim against the current or trash around and drown or whatever we do. In a sense, the opposite of living a life that's full of fear is living a life that's trustful. But you may be fearless and still not be trustful. Sorry? I believe you may be fearless but still not be trustful. I guess it's possible. Something added. There's maybe two kinds of trust. One is you trust something, which is kind of a thing you do, you add that to your life. And the other is a kind of trust, which is not really a thing at all, it doesn't really even exist. It's simply the absence of fear. And I call that trust, but as soon as you give it a name, it's kind of like it becomes a thing. But it's really the absence of anxiety. And of course it's trusting yourself versus trusting others, which is something else. I think that enlightenment is having trust that has no object. It's not even trusting yourself, you know, just trust. Can you let go of fear enough? Can you let go of enough? So it's enough just to trust without even knowing what you're trusting. It doesn't have to be an object to the trust. Can you trust the awareness? That's one of the things we learned in this practice, that awareness is a wonderful thing to trust. Remember there was a, I don't remember the whole poem, but in one of the inside brochures, it's something about practice the way it will always sustain you. When you talk about trust, I get this kind of disturbance. I don't really know what I trust or what. Yes. That's right. That's pretty good. I think that's very good. It's one of the things we learned. We can trust, maybe this way, we can trust our life when we are aware of it. But maybe we can't trust our life so much when there's not the awareness there, what's going on. Yes. There's a little haiku, since simply trust don't believe, splutter down just like that. Nice. Is blind trust, though, seems like that could get you a drop. Oh yes. Usually the word is blind faith. And that's again, you know, that's believing. Usually that's kind of believing something without having any proof or verification that's the case. And trust is a kind of a spectrum, a range between belief and faith and trust and confidence, perhaps. And trust is not so much a belief system, but it's more like a kind of confidence. And I guess you can have blind confidence, you know. No fear. Let's go. I hear a rock climber saying all of her friends have no fear, are no longer with us. So fear definitely has its place. You know, I had a whole talk to give about fear, and you know, we just scratched the surface. Should we continue next week? I mean, this is like, fear is so important. Seems like a big subject. If we just understand this one, we don't understand anything more about Buddhism. And that's why the Buddhist notion of fearlessness, it doesn't mean the absence of fear, but it means that you're not controlled by your fear. But certainly if it's there, you pay attention. And maybe one of the things I'll talk about next week more is, in a sense, all fear is healthy, in a sense. And next week maybe I'll talk about how that's the case. Yes? That means you're saying about trust, not wanting to have a object of trust. That means you want to then objectify fear, making no objects. Yeah, I don't follow. Well, you said trust is something that really gets rid of fear, or is a way to get to that, not to that, not affected by it, controlled by it. And you don't want an object. I don't remember the exact words you used. You want a non-objective vibe, trust. Trust. And so then you want to objectify fear, then to the opposite. I think what you want to do with fear is to understand it really well. And the more you understand fear, the less power it has over you. So it isn't so much a matter of getting rid of the fear, but coming to a kind of sense, coming to a place where the fear is not controlling us, but rather we're in charge. This is a generalized way of talking, but in a general sense, we're trying to understand fear, so it doesn't control us. I think something you've said a number of times is pretty relevant, which is, if you recognize fear and you know the source of the fear, then you have a choice about what you do about it, as opposed to just being overwhelmed by it. And I think that kind of makes the distinction between whether it's wholesome or unwholesome, because if you know it's there, I know some of my fears, which are clear to me now, that weren't a year ago, and now I make choices about them that I couldn't do a year ago. And one of the choices we can make is to try to understand better the roots of it. If you see fear as a response, what is it a response to? What is it a response? What's really, what is it arising out of? In that sense, what are you trying to protect? That's one way of asking that question. And so one of the choices when fear arises is to kind of look deeper. What's the roots of this fear and get to know it better? Do you think it's possible to make sense for me? A real stretch of my imagination, I think, maybe it's possible to have a sort of mutual respect. Absolutely. No, I can't really say that, but respect is a major one. I like it. Yes, it's possible. I notice when I, in public speaking, I get fearful, and with fear comes adrenaline. And I know if I don't have that, you know, slap. And so I actually do look forward to the fear, because anyway, it makes me more energetic and also makes me more fair-hearted. And that's the case. I once I recognized it, I actually do look forward to the slight amount of fear. No, another question. A organizational question. I hope you say you're interested in the real question. And we don't move too far with your thoughts. Would it make sense to hold a question and let you address all the issues that you want to address so we can learn and then have questions? Because on the topic like that is a lot of discussion and a lot of, you know, because of ideas and the problems. I think it's a good observation. Sometimes that's true that works better that way. And sometimes it works better to kind of let the collective wisdom, the collective questions and collective kind of movement and process and development take its own way. And it also depends what we're trying to do here. If you're simply just trying to impart my particular limited understanding and knowledge, you better shut up, right? But if we were trying to do is also, for example, other things, for example, sometimes you get to know each other better and get to know that we're not so different. We many of us have some similar issues and how different people deal with different things and what their concerns are. Having more of a group sharing is actually more important. So it varies. And so that kind of concern, what you bring up is in the back of my mind. So next week when I come, I have to consider, you know, what should I do? What's best now this week? Should I just spend the next 20 minutes just doing a talk since we've had so much kind of discussion already or should we just continue more of the discussion? And I thought today was great. I really appreciate it very much, all your participation and sharing. And I hope that you all found it valuable to do it this way. And the other reason to ask to be more open and have questions is that I know that my responses are maybe more relevant, more closely relevant to what your concerns are. If I just sit up here and talk, you know, give a monologue, how do I know that it has any relevance to anyone, right? That's the risk of giving talks. You know, you're just kind of in my own little world talking away here. Are you afraid of it, are you afraid of it? I'm not afraid of it, but I'm concerned about what is most useful for us here together, what serves us the best. And one of the things I like about Thursday is Thursday does give us a chance to have more discussion and talk more. If you want to get my monologue, you should come on Monday. So we'll talk about fear next week. And one of the things, since we're going to pick up the theme again, one of the things that would be nice for all of you is if you would study your fear during the next week, during the week. Just become a kind of connoisseur. Just notice the fears that arise and pass. Notice the fears, the subtle fears. Maybe it's more interesting to study the most subtle fears during the next week than it is the powerful ones, the big ones. But whatever way, just spend a week getting to be really familiar with the movements of fear in your life, and then we'll have more material to talk about. So let's end with a very short sitting. And many sit.
