 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome. Welcome all. It's nice to see the names and hellos streaming over there with the comments. Yeah, so let's practice together. So taking some full deep breaths. There's almost like a sense of, especially on the exhale, kind of wave, ripple, of relaxation that smooths out the energy of the body. This kind of breathing, we're making sure the breath gets into our belly, letting our belly be soft, letting our face be soft, area around the eyes, the jaw. Shoulders hanging loosely, the hands untenced. Suffering usually arises as a kind of increase density somewhere in body, mind. And so we breathe in such a way that smooths out the energy of body, mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We're not asking our breath to resolve the complications of our life, the predicament of any human life. We're just using the soothing ripple of the exhalation so as to suffer a little less right now to bring tranquility and a brightness right now. It's okay to put down the rest of our lives just for this time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The effect, kind of emotional circuits in our body are the engine of so much thinking. The kind of pool of energy, increased density in our body. And this seems to necessitate thought. We need to, it's like our mind needs to understand this little whirlpool of density in our body and our feeling life. And in our practice often, it's just to smooth out the energy of our body, to breathe into it patiently, to commit to being softened by intensity rather than hardened by it. As we meet our bodies, its densities, with this awareness and care, the whole realm of thinking feels less urgent. Just lavishing a kind of love, awareness on your body, and using the breath if that's helpful, in unifying the field of the body, smoothing out the densities. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
