 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's kind of resonant for me today. It's been coming up in some conversations I've been having with some folks. And coming up in my own practice is a reflection around views. And then I noticed that when I was away, one of the teachers talked about views during one of the sessions. Dawn talked about views. But, you know, I feel like there's always new perspectives and new things to say. So I'm going to reflect on it from my perspective and offer some thoughts about how powerful views are and how they are intimately connected with suffering, the struggles that we have. And I will propose that whenever there's suffering, some kind of view is operating. Usually some kind of unseen perspective or view, some belief that's happening in the background of our minds. And so, yeah, it's an interesting reflection to consider how views are formed and how they work in our minds. The Buddha is said to have pointed to views as being a powerful process in our minds that is at the root of a lot of the struggles in the world. And we can see this, you know, we can see this in our own country, you know, how different views, different political views lead to so much stress, divisiveness, hatred, violence. And this happens all over the world. And so there's some, there's some like very, you know, gross or obvious kind of views that we can see and understand lead to suffering. What is said that views are at the root of quarrels and dissent. He also, there's a quote something like, people attached to perception and views roam the world offending people. And if like that, that that perspective because it really is the attachment. The views themselves, you know, views, views allow us to look at things from a perspective. And they're not necessarily problematic in and of themselves. But the problem comes when either we are very attached to them, basically think I'm right, this is this is the right way to see things. Yes, they have another view and it's wrong. You know, so we know it's a view, but we believe our view is right. That that that kind of attachment to view creates a lot of stress and suffering in the world. Then there's, there's also sometimes we don't see views that views are so subterranean that we don't even know they are happening. We just take them to be the way things are. We believe those views so deeply that we don't even conceive there's another possibility. It is just truth. And so those those can be more deeply buried. And those are some of the more tenacious views in our in our minds. Now, those those kinds of views are connected with taking what we, you know, take taking what is impermanent to be permanent, taking what is unreliable to be reliable, just so deeply embedded in our in our minds and our in our almost sometimes and even in our biology was talking with someone today and and said, you know, sometimes just those very those those views around the stability of the world like, you know, we look around and you know, things look pretty stable. These walls have been here for a long time. So there's that kind of sense of the the solidity or stability of the world. And some of that stability is formed because of the way our our perceptual process or processes work. That we, you know, when we look out and see things, the mind stabilizes the world so that we can navigate it. And so there's a kind of a way that that our very human processes reinforce a little bit or support or or don't or we could say don't really expose these these ideas of the stability or the reliability of what's happening to be views, to be kind of an idea or a belief. With a little bit of reflection, we can recognize or think about or understand, yes, this these walls are not permanent. I know that an earthquake could shatter these walls, you know, so we can we can we can we can remember or reflect on that and see, oh, it's this idea that it's permanent or or stable is just an idea. But there are those those are hard. It's hard. It's hard to see that. It's hard to even knowing that even reflecting on that. It's like, yeah, well, I know that that an earthquake could take these these walls down. But, you know, that's not likely to happen. And so we we operate in this realm of the stability of things. We operate in this place as if it's stable, even kind of consciously knowing that it's not stable. We are functioning from a place as if it is stable. And so when or if something happens that shatters that belief, shatters that perspective, points out that, yeah, this was not reliable. It was not stable. Often we experience we don't necessarily experience the suffering of the view of the permanence of our walls all the time. I mean, it's it's more the that suffering can be revealed when the illusion is shattered. So the walls come down, there's a fire or an earthquake or something that happens and we discover, oh, yes, it wasn't permanent. And then and then we feel perhaps things like, well, what we know, whoa, is me. You know, why did this have to happen to me? And so we suffer. We suffer. So views. There's so many different kinds of views. So there's these, you know, the kind of more obvious or grosser views that are kind of on the surface, our political views, our views and beliefs, sometimes about our our friends and our families and things, things we think about what we what we're capable of, who we are. All of these kinds of views they do when they're not understood as views, when they're not seen as views, it really is in the attachment to them or the kind of the belief in their truth. If we take a view to be truth, then there there will be some kind of suffering that comes along with that at some point, maybe not immediate in the moment. We may not experience immediately in the moment, but at some point, there will be a stress or suffering when that view is shown to be a view. But views are useful and not all views, not all views lead to suffering. So there are there are I mean, some views, I mean, some some views are just like helping us navigate the world. They help us wander around and go to appointments and meet people and get things done. So, you know, views, views function in our in our lives. The problem happens when we don't know them to be views. When we're operating as if they are truth. And so that this is a big part of the kind of the exploration around views is to begin to be curious about what are views? What are you know, what are the views that are happening right now? There's always some kind of view or perspective operating in your mind. And so to kind of understand or be curious about what is the view that's happening right now? I said a moment ago that that not all views lead to suffering. And there's certainly there's views that actually help us to move in the direction of freedom. That's what wise view is the views of it's useful to pay attention to experience. It's useful to notice what's happening in the present moment while it's happening and be curious about it as a human experience. That's a view. It's a it's a it's a it's a it's a belief. It's a view that I heard that view from my Buddhist teachers and kind of like, well, I don't know how it's going to work, but, you know, I'll give it a try. And so I tried it on and found it to be helpful, found it to be useful. And so understanding, you know, views as views, we can kind of try them on. Is this a useful view? Does this view support me in moving towards freedom from suffering, moving towards more ease, more peace in my life? And we may have other relationships to views. I mean, maybe some some views we may may be more practical. Like, does this view help me to get from here to there when I have a job to do like the view that my car runs on gasoline and I need to fill it up with gasoline, you know, those kinds of, you know, kind of practical kinds of views. So, you know, that view in itself is not like moving me towards freedom from suffering, but it's, you know, it's it's not necessarily an unwholesome view. And it's a it's a useful view to recognize if I don't check the gas in the tank, you know, I need to check the gas in the tank in order to know if I'll have enough to get there. So, no, it's a belief, it's a view, but it's useful. So these these there's, you know, there's a lot of these views and beliefs that that just function in our in our lives to help us navigate our world, help us navigate to get through our day. So it's useful recognizing views as views, but then to recognize, is it a useful view? Is it is it helping me? Is it helping me to get through my day? Is it is it supporting me to move in the direction of freedom from suffering? Or is it creating tension, stress, pain, suffering? Is the view creating stress? And what I'd say is mostly we feel stress, we feel suffering, we feel distress, we feel reactivity. And often in the feeling of that, you know, we're not aware so much of what view might be happening in connection with that. And so that's a piece I'd like to talk about this evening is to kind of explore the connection between when we are experiencing suffering. There is some view, often an unseen view that's at work. Now, if what you're mostly experiencing or feeling is the emotional distress, that's a really useful thing to pay attention to, you know, to recognize, okay, so there's anger here, there's frustration here. The mind is whipping around, the mind feels, you know, very agitated. And so noticing that, that's the first thing, that's the most obvious thing often when we're suffering is that the experience of the reactivity of the of the distress itself. And so that's where we start. We start with that, that exploration. And then as we can land with it, the practice that we explore here and in all of these events at IMC, you know, to be present with experience, to not push away experience, even reactivity, but to open to it. We start to explore the experience and as we as we do begin to get familiar with, okay, well, what does it feel like to be, to have the experience of anger? What does it feel like to have the experience of frustration or boredom or confusion or agitation? What is that like? And as the mind can kind of land and be with that and not be like pulled out into reactivity about it, then there might be some capacity to get curious about what's the belief, what's being believed in connection with this reactivity? Because there is some belief in there. Often, you know, there's some basic forms of belief that kind of underlie so much of our reactivity. You know, just the simple kinds of beliefs like, it's not supposed to be like this. That just that that view, that that perspective, you know, it's like, that's it's a very deep, deep underneath kind of belief, you know, something's going on. And it feels wrong. It feels like that's not the way things are supposed to be. That may be connected with a belief that I'm doing something wrong. I'm a failure. I'm not trying hard enough. Somebody else is doing something wrong. Somebody else is a failure. They're at fault. So there's all kinds of views that can be associated. We have layers of views. You know, kind of sometimes at the basis are these very simple perspectives like it's not supposed to be like this. This is wrong. And then it's interesting to kind of be curious about, well, what are the perspectives there? So sometimes we come at it from the reactivity. And you may just kind of see. So for instance, from my own experience with anger, you know, the looking at anger, being with the anger and then hanging out with it, seeing all kinds of views like that person is evil, you know, that person did a wrong thing, you know, that and maybe they did a wrong thing. But, you know, so there's that belief. And with that belief, then comes that kind of tightening around, I need to get back at them or they need to suffer or something like that. I saw some of those some of those views, you know, some of those ideas, beliefs connected with this, the belief that the person who harmed me should suffer. That was that was humbling to see, you know, to see that belief in there. And it was painful, you know, to see that the that the mind wanted somebody else to suffer. And when it was seen as a belief, there was a way the mind just kind of began to let it go a little bit, to let go of that idea of. And to to appreciate, I think in that moment when I saw that view, I appreciated how, you know, there's so much suffering in the world because people have that kind of view. It was it was seen as not just a personal view, my fault for believing that, but seen as just conditions of the way a human mind reacts and responds to situations. So the the kind of the understanding there was, wow, no wonder there's so much pain in the world, so much distress in the world. This is like the seeds of where war comes from. And it was it was humbling to see that, you know, that view that I wanted somebody to be hurt. But at the same time, in the seeing of it, then the heart opened to compassion for how much suffering happens out of views like that. And so there was a learning, there was an opening that came through seeing the view. So that's an important piece, you know, a kind of curiosity about the views that are happening. It's not it's not an intention to like find it and then get rid of it, but it's it's more like to just expose it as a view and then see what happens. See what happens to to the view when it's recognized as a view. See what happens in your experience. See what happens in your heart, in your mind. And so often I find when there is a view that's exposed, sometimes the view doesn't go away. You know, sometimes the mind is holding on to that view. But when it is at least acknowledged, oh, that's the view that's happening. There's some kind of a shift in the experience. Sometimes when the view is exposed as a view, it's like the whole thing falls apart. The the the stress or the suffering that was connected with that view just can't can't stay put together because the view has been kind of the bubble of the of the of the view has been popped. It's no longer believed. It's just, oh, that's just an idea. It's just an idea in the mind. And so seeing it as a view, sometimes the whole the whole set of suffering around the experience can fall apart. Sometimes, though, our minds are holding on to views tightly. But what I've seen is still it's useful. You know, the the perspective of. You know, at one point I was working with somebody who was was noticing a lot of self hatred and I had worked with a lot of self hatred in my own practice. So I was very familiar with this and very familiar with the beliefs that are underlying it. And I suggested that that person might just check in and and notice what the beliefs were connected to that self hatred. I'm no good. I'm a failure. I'm wrong. I'm bad. You know, those kinds of thoughts often that might be connected with self negativity or self hatred. And I said, and the person said, yeah, I see I see those thoughts that I'm bad. I see that I'm wrong. But but I think they're true. I said, that's OK. You know, you can just like you don't have to try to disbelieve the belief. This is another important part around looking at views when we see something as a view, it doesn't necessarily mean that we have to try to convert the view into something else. But just notice that it's there. So I counseled that person to say, yeah, when you see that view, just know that it is a view. What's happening right now is the mind is believing it's a failure. That's what's going on right now. So and you don't have to then try to convert it into or tell yourself, I'm not a failure, because what I saw in my own practice around some of those deeply held views is that trying to tell myself, you're not a failure was just like it just reified or reinforced that part of the mind. It was like, no, you know, I've got a lot of I've got a lot of history with this. There's a lot of reasons why I think I'm a failure. And so to try to convert that view into something else can can just lead to conflict and actually paradoxically reinforce that very view. But just noticing that it is a view. Sometimes that creates a little bit of space or a little bit of kind of the mind is acknowledging, yes, it's a view that I'm a failure. That's what's happening right now. The mind believes this view. And it opens the doorway to the mind to recognizing it as a view rather than simply taking it as truth. And there's a shift there that can happen in the mind, a shift from it's just true that I'm a failure from two. The mind is believing I'm a failure. And that that is it. There's a big difference between those two. And there can be a little bit of space, a feeling of space that comes with that. So I really would just like to encourage a lot, you know, the kind of curiosity. When we're struggling or suffering about what views or beliefs might be there and not to try to change them or or fix them to something we think would be a better view, but just to recognize them. To be curious about them and to see can there be some holding of recognizing, oh, what's happening right now is this view that's happening and and maybe understanding that it is connected to that suffering. Maybe seeing as the mind acknowledges, oh, this is a view being held that a little bit of that suffering shifts. So that's a that's a whole terrain around emotional kind of reactivity and views that are held with respect to our emotional reactivity. There's a whole other topic that that we could talk about that I'll just mention here. This is this is really where, you know, my own practice has been in this terrain in the last few weeks is around beliefs about the meditation beliefs about the practice. Ideas we hold about how we're supposed to practice or what it means to be mindful. So much suffering can happen when we don't see that we're holding beliefs and views about the practice itself. One simple one that I'll just point to that was more present earlier in my practice, I've been discovering there's just like layers and layers of these kinds of beliefs that that kind of infiltrate our practice. It's kind of amazing. But earlier in my practice, I'd say one belief that I had about the practice was if I'm not choosing what I'm paying attention to, it means I'm not being mindful. So that there was a belief that the directing of the attention was what mindfulness was about. And if I didn't have control over that, it meant the mindfulness wasn't proper or wasn't right. And that I have since learned is not the case, you know, that that that this capacity to be aware, to be mindful, we can simply settle back and just know without choosing without consciously deciding. There can be an awareness of what's here. But there was so much suffering in the early part of my practice around that view or belief. And so sometimes when we're in the meditation, if there's something we're struggling with about the practice, that's another useful time to check in. What's the belief? What am I believing? And sometimes it's hard to see those because they're so deeply embedded in how we have learned the practice. Again, we're just taking it to be this is true. This is this is the way practice is supposed to be.
