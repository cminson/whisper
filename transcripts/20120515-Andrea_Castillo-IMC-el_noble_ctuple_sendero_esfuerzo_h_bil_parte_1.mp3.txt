The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
We have been discussing and investigating for six weeks something called the Noble Octuple Sendero.
We will talk a little bit more about how to situate them.
You have not been here at the beginning.
In itself, the Sendero, as the name suggests, is a noble Sendero.
The idea is that the Buddha, when he was liberated, looked back and said,
This is very difficult for people to know how to find a way to free ourselves from suffering.
Then his idea was to offer us a path of eight steps as a guide, simply a guide of how to train ourselves,
disciplining our actions and our minds to have the greatest probability of finding happiness.
Remember that the Noble Octuple Sendero is divided into three groups. The first is wisdom, and the second is understanding.
Before starting this Sendero, we need to re-capacitate and analyze our lives, our priorities.
Why are we here? What do we want? What do we seek?
From there, we establish a clear understanding.
This has to be done by each person. In these teachings, there is no commandment, there is no one who tells you to do this, not this,
but to see, investigate and learn from your own experience.
So we start with the understanding of wisdom.
Once we have this clarity of what we want from our life, then we establish a noble intention.
This is the first group.
The second group has the morality as a general theme.
If you remember, we were investigating first the Abla Abil, which is a source of a lot of suffering.
Sometimes we use words that hurt other people or hurt ourselves.
Then, the noble action, how we behave, and the last group of morality is the medium of life, Abil.
This is what we saw last week, we investigated how we can gain life in a way that is the most positive for the type of person we are and the type of life we want to take.
So now we come to the last group. Of action, of external life, now we go to the internal life.
This group of these last three areas is the mental training.
Here we put the most difficult question, because it is now a matter of working with our mind.
But it is fascinating and I hope that in these three weeks we will see how we work with our mind, that we all learn together.
It is very important to establish a very firm base with the actions of the Abla and the medium of life, Abil.
Because this is something very concrete that we can see out there, how we are acting in the world.
If we start from a firm base of speaking in a way Abil, of gaining life in a way Abil and of actions Abil,
then we will have much more stability to analyze something that is more complex that is how we work with our mind.
So this last group of mental training consists of the three areas, which are
Abil effort, Abil full attention and Abil concentration.
If you remember last week Francisco asked how we can get to know ourselves better.
And I think the answer is here in this, in how we work with these three areas.
So I am going to try to explain to you in various ways how these three areas are related,
so that we can get more and more into this mental training.
When we achieve to work with these three areas, what we achieve is to have a serene, calm mind
and that works with clarity, that we see things with clarity.
This at the same time is not the end, it is the middle for an end, it is the prerequisite
to be able to get in touch with the internal wisdom we have.
It is an internal vision that becomes penetrating, clear and wise.
Because what we are discovering is that the agitated mind, which is 99.9% of people who live with agitated mind,
causes a totally niope vision.
We do not see it clearly.
The mind is playing from one topic to another, quickly, quickly, and we do not see it clearly.
So we have to focus on the skill effort and I want to start by analyzing how we can observe
the skill effort within the context of the noble octoplesender.
The skill effort is not more than energy that we apply to observe our internal life.
And of course, also our intentions.
Then we make adjustments so that we promote what allows us to advance in the noble octoplesender
and let go of what is stopping us.
For example, if there are full thoughts of anger, as happens to all of us,
I stop to consider the most able way to relate myself to this feeling of anger in the present moment.
In such a way that I do not repress it and I do not increase it either.
I apply full attention to investigate it and then let it go as soon as possible.
This is in the case of an inalienable or negative mental state.
But there are also healthy or noble states.
For example, we notice that we are happy to observe that another person is doing well,
that he is happy with his life.
This state is healthy, so we seek to cultivate it.
We want to promote it, that it remains with us as long as possible without stopping
and we share it with the people around us.
There is an interesting saying in German that says
a suffering shared with others is divided in half.
A joy shared with others is multiplied by double.
We have to remember this to use the healthy mental states in a way that we promote them.
The inalienable effort implies observing ourselves to the extent that it is not possible,
that our internal ecology flourishes, that we are cultivating it.
Now, an inalienable effort also implies regulating our energy,
so that we can persevere in the path despite the difficulties,
but we also do not tense ourselves by contracting the body, the mind,
by closing ourselves to a specific goal that we have set ourselves.
Here again, in this way, we do not realize the idea that we return to,
which is the middle path.
A lot of this is talked about in Buddhism.
We do not close ourselves, we do not push ourselves,
if we do not go on the middle path.
What we are looking for here, and we want to imagine ourselves,
is that it is not possible to carry out a constant, soft and joyous effort.
These three things.
This is the summary of today's talk, because what we are doing is,
observing four ways that we are going to develop the inalienable effort,
which is, one, preventing the mental states from emerging,
which are either unhealthy or negative, to overcome the unhealthy mental states that are already present.
Those two are the negative thoughts.
If they have not emerged, we are looking for them to not arise.
If they are already there, how can we overcome them?
Now, the positives.
To encourage the healthy mental states to arise,
those who are already present, increase these healthy mental states that we have.
Now, to be able to understand the relationship of these three areas,
in this last group of mental training,
it is very important to have very clear the difference between full attention and concentration.
I know that some of you already have it very clear, but it is always good to go back.
For example, who can describe to me how is the focus of concentration?
Is there anyone else?
With three adjectives.
In concentration, the focus is narrow, restricted, reduced,
static, and one is missing.
It is precise, static, and reduced.
This is the typical focus on the flame of a candle.
I focus on this part of the nose, which we did in meditation,
and observe how the air feels when it enters and goes out.
This is an essential part of meditation.
This is concentration.
A focus is like a lens of a camera, we close it.
And we leave it in a small area.
Now, the full attention is the other way around.
It opens, it is a wide focus, it is a flexible focus that is capable of changing
according to where the experience of the strongest moment is.
If I am very concentrated, my attention is here,
and suddenly, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,
then I say, listening, okay, and then it gives me a sound in my ear,
I say, eating sound, and then it gives me cold, I say, cold.
And then I think about what I'm going to eat now at night, I say, planning, and so it goes.
That is the full attention.
The ability that the attention goes to what arises at the moment,
but it always has to be joined to the present moment.
Because at the moment that I disconnect and start adding comments,
for example, oh, I love the sound of the cell phone,
how would I love it?
I'm going to change the tone of my cell phone so that it has the same tone.
That is no longer full attention.
There, I already put in a comment.
Are we going well?
Of course, right?
Okay, so it is very important to keep that difference in these next weeks
when we talk about these three areas.
How are we going?
Good?
Now, let's remember that we need both full attention and concentration for meditation.
If they help each other a lot,
an image that we use often is that these two disciplines are like the two wings of a bird.
The bird needs both wings to fly.
Now, what happens when we lose the focus of concentration,
let's say because we hear a noise on the street?
We are going to see two answers and I want you to tell me what answers,
in which response we are practicing full attention and in which we have been distracted.
We are sitting, we are meditating,
and we hear a loud noise that happens on the street.
Answer number one.
I listen and I think,
ah, I recognize you.
That's a Ducati motorcycle.
And I would love to have a motorcycle.
I can imagine going at full speed and passing everyone.
First option.
Second option.
You hear the noise and something says,
notamentally, you listen, you let go, you go back to your body,
you go back to your breathing.
What is the answer?
That's great.
In the second option, if you are using full attention,
in the first option, not only are we distracted,
but we are cultivating one of the obstacles.
And what obstacle would be to see those who were here with the obstacles,
which we have to review now?
What obstacle would it be?
Remember the first one,
the most common one,
the sensual desire.
Desiring something.
What am I thinking?
I would love to have a motorcycle.
And then the other,
which is even stronger and has so much power on us,
the feeling of being important and powerful on the motorcycle.
That's what Gil calls selfing,
a word he invented that makes me very good.
If it were possible to say it in Spanish, I would love it.
But I imagine myself as cultivating the yo-mi with me.
My own.
For him it was the jo-ism.
It's better than yo-ing because I was thinking of yo-ing.
There is no yo-ism.
Yo-ism is very good.
Yo-ism.
Very good.
Even better than selfing.
Yo-ism is very good.
Okay.
There is a very clear symbol in the comments of the Buddha,
the Mahjong Manikaya, where the interdependence of these three areas is described,
the noble effort, the full attention and concentration,
which I want to describe to you,
because I think it will fall very well on the coin
about what this is about, how they relate to the three.
Imagine, there are three children going to a park.
They look at a precious tree with beautiful flowers.
They think they are going to gather a branch of these flowers.
The highest child approaches them,
tries to reach the flowers, but he doesn't.
Then the second child says,
ah, don't worry.
I'll scratch you, you'll get on my back,
and then you'll reach the flowers.
The child gets on the back,
tries to reach them, but he's shaking.
The third child runs and offers his shoulder
to stop the child's shoulder,
and then, ta-da!
He stops the third child,
and on the back of the first child,
the highest child reaches the flowers.
And there it is.
The highest child is concentration.
Concentration is supported by the noble effort
of the child who is hooked.
Concentration is stabilized thanks to the shoulder
of the child who is stopping him.
Concentration can then be stretched
to reach the flowers that symbolize
the fruit of our effort,
of our wisdom.
We see how these three areas
are in the most wonderful way.
Now, let's see another example
where I want you to tell me,
to see if it's clear,
which of the three elements of mental training
has failed in this situation?
It's an example that some of you have already heard.
This is a person who was in a meditation retreat,
very long, for a month,
in full meditation, seated,
as is Manuel,
he was very focused on his breathing.
Suddenly, he saw a very strong wave of energy,
and the torso, the breath went forward
and hit the front against the floor.
What has failed there?
Which of the three areas of mental training
has failed?
Full attention, exactly.
Why?
That's it.
There, what happened was the wonderful effort.
There it is.
It was a retreat for a month.
It's a lot of fun.
There he is, doing the effort, meditating,
with an impeccable posture,
putting attention on his breathing.
But what happened?
He focused so much on the concentration
that he forgot to pay full attention.
If you have the balance between full attention
and concentration,
at a certain point you realize
that something of tension is accumulating in your body
and that you must open your eyes
and maybe stop and go for a walk
because you never go deeper into meditation,
that you can't keep calm and stable.
Meditation is a tremendously powerful tool
and you must know how deep it is to go.
Especially in retreats that have the possibility of going deep.
If you can't go deep with stability,
then you stop.
That's where it failed.
I think it does help this example.
It is clear to everyone
the difference between full attention and concentration.
It's a lot of information for those of you
who are here for the first time,
but I think they are doing well.
Meditation is a constant adjustment
of effort, full attention and concentration.
Meditation is a chemical substance
that combines chemical substances.
You must constantly look for the right proportion,
from moment to moment.
Before continuing, I would like to mention
that for this topic I especially
depended on a book that I would like to recommend,
which is by Bikub Bori.
It is a monk of this tradition,
a Buddhist tradition,
he is a North American,
and he has written a book specifically
about the noble octuple ascender.
There is no Spanish, unfortunately.
Bikub Bori talks about the mental factor
called virya.
Virya is the word pali for energy.
It is interesting that he mentions
that this mental factor, virya,
which is essential,
is the same that we use
both for desire, aggression,
violence and ambition,
as well as generosity,
discipline, kindness,
concentration and understanding.
But here what we are looking for is
to use the noble effort,
that is, virya, the energy
to cultivate healthy states
with the simple goal
of liberating us from suffering.
Now,
this about the energy
or the essential diligence,
the Buddha, in the teachings,
he does it step by step,
step by step,
that we are the ones
who have to make the effort.
In the teachings,
it is simply aimed at you
where, for example,
this path,
but no one will walk it through you.
You are the one who has to make the effort,
you have to observe and discover
your own abilities,
your own strengths
and walk the path.
We all begin
in this path of walking
the path,
unfortunately,
with a busy mind.
That is, a mind that is worried,
that is agitated,
that has doubts,
that has many desires,
etc., etc.
But this is exactly
what the noble effort is about,
that is, how we work
with this mind
that, naturally,
is visiated if we do not learn to discipline it.
So, the noble effort
in this context is referring
to the cultivation of the calm mind
in peace and full of clarity.
And the best way to work
with these three areas,
obviously, is in meditation,
for several reasons,
because you are doing on one side
all the stimulus of the senses
and you can concentrate
on what is happening in the mind.
In Buddhist teachings,
we have four areas
of how to manage
the noble effort,
which I already mentioned
and that is now
how we are going to focus on the topic.
I start with the first one,
which is to prevent
the mental states,
which have not emerged.
First, we start with
which are the negative states
and, obviously, the obstacles
that we saw a while ago.
So, as we saw them,
we only give them a review
to remind us.
First, let me remind you,
obstacle, the name,
as it implies,
the name is simply something
that prevents us
from progressing on the path.
When the mind is full of
sensual desires,
which has to do with avarice,
we want, we want, we want,
the mind is agitated,
we do not have clarity,
the body, if you remember,
if some have realized,
undoubtedly when there is desire,
the body does this,
it inclines forward.
That is why I told you in meditation,
we have to imagine ourselves
as a tower of blocks
perfectly aligned
from the coccyx to the head.
It is incredible the effect
that it has when you have the back
in that relaxed and very straight way,
that the thoughts also enter
in a certain way the controls,
the controls better.
So, sensual desire
has the desire to seek
pleasant smells,
pleasant textures,
pleasant sounds,
pleasant visions,
all the five senses.
But we can also extend it
towards the desire to wealth,
to fame, to power.
The second obstacle,
if you remember, was the opposite pole,
the evil will,
the opposite pole of the first
because it is evil will or aversion,
to reject something.
And within the evil will
can be hatred,
hatred, resentment, etc.
The third,
does anyone remember?
The third,
laziness and delay.
And this,
these two are the inability
to handle the mind.
The interesting thing about laziness
is that it understands boredom.
And boredom is nothing more
than mental inertia.
If you ever,
imagine that you are in a meeting
and you are bored,
but you are sleeping
and someone comes and tells you,
hey, I know you have
a very interesting life.
Tell me what happened to you
when X, Y, Z,
guaranteed that the energy
goes up.
Why? Because you have to see
something with us.
So now, suddenly,
it is interesting.
So it is very useful
to realize, one,
why is the energy going down
and two, that what we consider
boring is
what has nothing to do with us.
But when something has to do
with us,
we already have that energy.
Then the delay,
which is expressed as
sleepiness and consists of
mental inertia
and with the desire to sleep.
Obviously, if we are meditating,
we are sleeping
and we do not achieve anything,
we feel like we have something
in our heads,
we do not achieve much.
The fourth is anxiety
and concern
that is characterized by the mind
that plays from one topic to another
at full speed.
And there we find,
the concern towards the past
that is expressed in delay
or the concern towards
the future
that is fear.
We are constantly worrying about it.
And the last is doubt.
When we are in meditation
and if there is constant doubt,
especially when one is new.
For example, if
it is your first time,
it is totally normal, natural,
it is expected,
that the doubt arises and says,
what am I doing?
This is very strange,
to be sitting without talking
with all these people
and not moving.
It is natural.
It is at length,
if we have chronic doubt,
it becomes an obstacle.
However,
it is different
to the intelligent critic
who asks,
who wants to learn,
who questions.
That is different.
That is something that is constantly
in Buddhist teachings
is mentioned.
Think for yourself.
Ask.
Check for yourself.
Experiment for yourself.
Obviously,
meditation is difficult for us.
Then,
we seek with full attention
to capture
the moment when
some of these obstacles
start to arise,
to be able to tear them
like a plant that has roots.
It is very small.
If you capture it immediately
or very little after it
starts to arise, it is very easy
to remove it.
But if you already have
a habit of being
with a thought,
with roots like this,
with a huge tree,
it will be very difficult
and it will take you years.
Obviously.
Bikubori mentioned
something very interesting
in this section.
He says,
remember
that the obstacles
do not come from outside.
They come from inside.
When the mind receives
a stimulus
in a careless way
or inactive way,
then the objects
that we perceive with the five senses
activate
evil states in us.
If it is not very clear,
now we see an example.
Let's say that
we are meditating
and someone is cooking
in the kitchen
and the door is open.
We have a smell
and then
the mind goes.
This is my favorite soup.
Now that I get up
to meditate,
I'm going to eat a huge plate
and add cream
and then
maybe I should open a restaurant
because this soup
would surely make me famous.
Super classic.
What happened here
is that through the sense of the olfato
we activate
the first obstacle,
the sensual desire.
Is that clear?
Okay.
Another example.
We are meditating
and we hear someone
playing violin
and the mind
says,
what a barbarity.
That person doesn't have ears
but if he is playing in such a disaffected way
it looks like cats
moaning.
What happened here?
The
sense of hearing
that is the door of the senses
captures the hearing
and what happened?
Here it activated
the second obstacle.
The one in the version.
We are judging.
And so we can go
with the five obstacles.
So we see
that the great importance
is to apply the very wise attention
to our senses.
That is, to see, to hear,
to read, to touch and to like.
Not only
in the contact point,
that is very important,
but also
to restrict the quantity
and quality
to what we expose ourselves to.
And that is something that nobody teaches us
and in this society
we are constantly
stimulating
the eyes, the ears.
You can't even look
at the floor in the supermarket
because there too
there are ads.
So we have to take care of ourselves
because what happens is that we are
stealing our attention
and the more disaffected
we have the mind
the more power
the world has on us.
We have less control.
Less option.
How do we go from time to time?
It's dark, I didn't turn on the light.
We have ten minutes.
We could do
How do you see it?
We stop here and ask questions
or continue.
How do you see it? Questions?
Because I don't want to give you
too much at the same time.
Because I don't want to finish
and then I don't have time
for the questions.
If there are questions
and if I don't continue
I don't have time.
I have a question.
The microphone.
To work on the skill
Yes.
Maybe for me
how difficult it would be
to see if a person
if I have already identified
with a skill
to think
or evil
it's not normal
for me.
So that identification
it's hard
it's hard
to see it clearly
because there is no reference
within my experience.
So
obviously through practice
maybe
you can
see with more clarity
those patterns
that keep me
in prison
we would say.
But there is the difficult
for me
it makes me more difficult.
Look
if we all had
the opportunity
to sit down
to do nothing
and just
meditate for a few minutes
there begins
to open a door
and show us
where we are totally blind.
So a person
who already has a chronic tendency
to speak
to think in a bad way
in the moment
that he feels to meditate
and pay attention to his body
he will feel
a
amount of
discomfort
huge
because
every inane action
we have
recorded in the body
in some way
every pain
every frustration
in some way
at the cellular level
the body
knows it
has it.
So
there is a very direct way
to
discover
that there is something
that we need to pay attention to
and at the beginning we don't know
how big, how small
it is
we know that there is something
that needs our attention
and that needs to be changed
and little by little
we are discovering
what it is.
I liked the answer.
Very good.
How are you?
Good?
So
maybe I will cover one more
to see how long we can use
The next
key is that there are 4
ways to work
with the effort
of Abel
would be
to overcome evil states
that have already emerged
that are already present
So
let's take into account
that despite our effort
to apply full attention
we are going to have
evil thoughts
for the simple fact that we are not
free yet.
So
what do we do when these
thoughts arise?
We all have seen ourselves
in situations where we are
totally unhappy
because we didn't realize
that our inner voice
is that you are not worth anything
you realize that you are a disgrace
you realize that you have no talent
for anything
and sometimes we take this monologue
for hours
and suddenly we feel miserable
and we don't even know
when this voice started
to criticize us
to torture us in a funest way
there is no one
who can hurt us more
than our thoughts
when we discover that
we realize the importance
and power of meditation
because the full attention
gradually shows you
clearly the moment
when this voice begins
and you stop it
and you say
it's not necessary
In Buddhist teachings
we have five ways
of thinking
the first
is to replace them
by thinking
take a thought
that is hurting you
and turn it around
for example
if we have
thoughts full of hatred
of anger
we can try to bring
thoughts of cultivating
bondage
they are the phrases
that one repeats
but let's say
the good will
try to think
in terms of good will
of kindness
and turn this negative
if there is a lot of anxiety
we can anchor the mind
in the breathing
and in that way it begins to calm
it is to exchange
the negative
something that will help us
the second
is to investigate
the disadvantages
and effects of bad thoughts
let's say
that I feel
nervous
because I'm afraid I won't find work
so first
what I need to do
is to clarify
I begin to investigate
and I need to clarify that
worrying won't help me
but on the contrary
I'm getting afraid
then I establish the intention
to take my time
to clarify my values
and to find work in a wise way
in me
so this is something
in which way
it is hurting me
to have these thoughts
how are we going?
we have three more of these
the C is what?
the three more
I won't be able to
I don't want to get tired
the third
the third is
simply we don't pay attention
but one thing that is important
is that
we recommend
one by one
we have
a negative thinking
first we try
the first option
which is the best
replace it with something positive
if that doesn't work
we move on to the second
and the second is
investigate the consequences
of negative thoughts
if that doesn't work
then we don't pay attention
we are aware
if I return to the same example
that we are
worried
that maybe we don't get work
and with all the love
we say
now no
now I'm meditating
I promise you that when I stop meditating
I pay attention
as you would say to a child
right now, but for a while
the fourth is
consciously relax
the action
or mental fabrication
we return again
to what is the fear
of not finding work
and we observe
as there is tension around
this thought and again
around the body
in what way is this fear
to a muscle level
and we are able
to do
or at least
around that area
because sometimes we are
so, so, so, so chronically tense
that we don't achieve even if we want
to soften that area, it's very common
so there is no problem, we accept it
with love
and we try
to soften the area around
and if we can do that
then we imagine
that the space around us
is soft
and it's just like a hug
of acceptance to what is happening
and the last one
is
consciously
to relax these thoughts
with conviction and energy
so if we already went from
1 to 3 to 4 to 5
then you just say no
and you say a no
as you say to a little boy
who is trying and trying
and trying to
pass the rules
we just say no
and it's a no
with energy
and there it is
those are the 5 ways
to deal with thoughts
that are challenging us
it was a little short
but we'll see that next time
how to incentivize
the mental states
healthy
and then increase the mental states
that are already present.
