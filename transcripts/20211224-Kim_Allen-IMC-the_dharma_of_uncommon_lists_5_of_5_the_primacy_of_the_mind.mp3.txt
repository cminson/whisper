The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Okay, so first today, I'd like to share a list that I received this week,
because it relates to our countdown theme, if you will.
So this is the 12 days of Christmas Buddhist version.
On the 12th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me,
12 links arising, 11 arahants laughing, 10 perfections growing,
9 devas dancing, 8 fold path, a leading, 7 seka seeing, 6 doors ascending, 5 training precepts,
4 noble truths, 3 precious gems, 2 wings of awakening, and a Buddha neath a bow tree.
I thought it was pretty good.
So that takes us then today to our list of one.
I don't know how unusual this one item is, but I can say that it's not clearly defined anywhere in the suit does in kind of an analytical way.
And yet it is incredibly important.
So that is the word that is often translated as mind, or sometimes as heart, or sometimes as heart mind.
And the word is cheetah cheetah.
And it is to the degree that the Teravada teachings say it this way.
It is what gets liberated.
So it's not that you are going to get liberated, but your cheetah mind, your heart might get liberated.
So this language of what I like to call the primacy of the mind is very clear in the suit does.
So I'll read from quote from the Buddha.
I do not see any other single thing that brings such woe as the mind cheetah, that is untamed, uncontrolled, unguarded and unrestrained.
Such a mind indeed brings great woe.
I do not see any other single thing that brings such happiness as the mind that is tamed, controlled, guarded and restrained. Such a mind indeed brings great happiness.
So I don't think we need to see this in a restrictive way, but more in a sense of not letting the mind run rampant over our own heart and others.
So we see that it is about the mind. The Buddha's teachings emphasize that the key is right here in the mind or the heart, and how the cheetah is strongly influences the amount of happiness or suffering that we have in a given moment.
This is also stated up front in the writing the first two stanzas of the Dhammapada.
So all experiences preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind, speak or act with a corrupted mind and suffering follows as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox.
All experiences preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind, speak or act with a peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never departing shadow.
It's relatively simple, not easy to do, but relatively simple that if we have peace in the heart, then what comes forth from that is somehow related to happiness for ourselves and others.
So where can we learn more about the cheetah and how it fits into the path? It's effectively threaded everywhere throughout the teachings, the word cheetah, if you search for that, there's many, many instances of it.
But maybe the most prominent place where it's stated directly is right in the foundational text on the cultivation of mindfulness, the Satipatanasuta.
And there the Buddha identified the cheetah as one of four areas of experience where we can establish mindfulness.
So it's worthwhile to look at our mind as we did in the sitting.
So I think it's noteworthy that we can observe our mind through the instructions of this sutta, which I'll talk a little bit more about in a moment.
We can observe our mind as a set of shifting, changing mental qualities.
That's what we see when we're mindful of the cheetah, rather than say an individual experience of I.
There isn't just one thing going on in the mind, there isn't just one experience, one self that we could point to.
It's actually quite profound, although it may not sound that way.
But the instructions in this sutta and the establishment of mindfulness are simply to observe a series of qualities in the mind and notice whether they're there or whether they're not.
And they are some of the ones that we looked at in the sitting.
So for example, sensual desire, or sometimes it's translated as lust.
We just notice is that present in the mind right now, or not.
Is the mind actually says something like is the mind influenced by it at this moment or not.
And the same for hatred and the same for delusion, those are the three kind of overarching difficulties that we have in the mind.
But we're also then supposed to notice if the mind is contracted, kind of small and contracted, or if it's scattered and broad, the mind feels different at different times, doesn't it?
Sometimes it feels very narrow, focused.
Sometimes it feels scattered or broad.
Sometimes it feels elevated, kind of lofty in a sense, and sometimes not so much.
We're also supposed to notice if the mind is concentrated in the sense of whether it is gathered and kind of organized, or is it unconcentrated, scattered, flipping around to different things.
And interestingly, we're also supposed to notice if the mind is liberated or not liberated at a given moment.
So that's something that we can detect also.
I don't see a difference between noticing these things on or off the cushion.
We can sit, and when we're sitting peacefully, quietly, we have maybe a little bit more clarity in how we can precision in how we can observe the mind from moment to moment.
But we can definitely observe it also in daily life, while you're cooking or cleaning or even with enough practice while we're talking.
We can observe how the mind is, whether it's leaning towards something, whether it's leaning away, what emotions are coming up.
And the instruction in this suit at least on mindfulness is just to know, just to know how it is with no judgment.
See how the mind is.
There's a certain importance to using modern language to taking data about our mind.
Noticing how does the mind get upset when it is angry?
What does it feel like?
Instead of immediately saying, oh, the mind has anger.
I'm not supposed to be angry. I'm a spiritual person.
I'd better quickly do some metapractice to eliminate that anger.
There's a little more leeway in this suit where as long as we're not acting on the anger, like it says in the Dhammapada verses, we act on anger, and then yes, there will be some suffering.
But if we simply are knowing that the mind is in an angry state, that's important.
We can learn what it's like.
What does it feel like?
What's the consequences internally of having that?
So it's important.
This is kind of a data taking exercise to know about the moods of the mind, the flavor, how things come and go.
It includes the emotional tone of the mind.
It includes the cognitive tone of the mind.
And then also once we see these qualities, the sutra asks us to observe them arising and passing away.
And now on the one hand, we see how the conditioning of the mind works.
We see what conditions lead toward certain states of mind and what conditions lead toward more peaceful states of mind.
And also at just a fundamental level, we're learning that mind states are impermanent.
There's no mind state that has persisted since the beginning of your life and probably not since the beginning of today.
So we see that all these things are coming and going.
And it's important to have the process of beginning to disidentify the mind, beginning to see it as conditioned, influenced by different things.
And then we see that in the book on Naliyo's book on Satipatana, sustained contemplation of the mind will expose the degree to which what one takes to be one's own mind is in fact influenced by external conditions.
Realizing the impermanent and conditioned nature of the mind leads toward nonattachment and nonidentification.
It's interesting, right? It is, in a sense, our own mind. It's not somebody else's mind and it's a huge influence on our experience.
But we see that actually we have a lot of conditions that have come into it from the culture, from our family, from our experience, from our upbringing.
Is it really ours, really?
Some of us are with family at a time of year like this and don't you see where your habits come from if you observe your relatives?
So, you know, it's something that we can see clearly as having a lot of different influences coming in.
And interestingly, we do observe the mind, but we also cultivate the mind, which he does to be cultivated along the Buddhist path. It's important to, it does change over time and we can refine it.
We can hone it, we can elevate it, we can refine it.
And interestingly, these two tasks of observing the mind and cultivating your mind are similar.
Because mindfulness has a way of enhancing what is wholesome and diminishing what is unwholesome, kind of the magic of mindfulness.
So interestingly, the cheetah develops or refined by seeing its qualities and by also seeing what is not present.
So it's interesting that we're supposed to see what's there and what's not there.
And once we've seen this clearly, the only, maybe the only clear instructions on what to actually do with the mind, we can see in the Anapanasati Sutta on mindfulness of breathing.
We are said that it said that we should gladden our mind, so to the degree that we can, we should influence it positively.
We should also work on concentrating the mind, work on having some degree of samadhi, some presence in the mind, and then eventually this will lead to liberating the mind.
I don't think we have to do that exactly.
So we observe the mind, we try to have some kind of positive influence on it.
For example, during the Siddha, I asked us to bring in our confidence in the practice, our confidence in the process of the path, and then we gather the mind somehow and try to kind of keep it in the roughly in the present moment.
That's kind of it with the mind.
Of course, there's infinite detail on that in the suttas, the main practices we can do. But I think at a broad level, that's it, we strengthen the mind through all of this, and a strong cheetah is linked with the ability to stay with uncomfortable experience, and hence be able to
penetrate through various habit patterns.
What we're doing is becoming free of the mind's conditioning, so that the mind is able to be present, even though it has all these influences from our family, from our culture, etc.
So this maybe could be called maturing the mind. A few days ago, I talked about a list of four qualities of mind that we cultivate and we emulate in others, and the kind of collective term for those four was mature conduct.
So we're maturing the mind through all this observation.
It doesn't impact on us, of course, but also on our relationships. You know, the more free we are of all the habits and patterns and reactivities that have been put into our mind, the more present we can be for others.
So it's likely that our response is going to be compassion, or wisdom, or love, something that's in the realm of freedom, rather than anger, reactivity, control, manipulation, and we agree, the other things that we do.
So when we're less stuck on our stuff, we can meet others where they are, unruffled, and be helpful to them.
The free mind is highly available, highly responsible, highly responsive, responsible also.
And so it's compassionate, it's attuned.
And so then, you know, what's the fruit of all this cultivation. There's a wonderful term in the teachings, Chaito Vimuti, liberation of mind, which is one of the qualities of Narahant, but we can, we can feel it too anytime the mind is relatively free of greed, hatred, and delusion.
There's a nice image from the teachings.
Let me just read it.
Just as if there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and undisturbed, so that a person with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting.
And this is the path of suffering, and this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering.
So, just as if we're looking into clear water and seeing everything that's there, the shells, the fish swimming around.
When the mind and the heart are clear, aware, present, we can just look at the contents of life and see, okay, that one's dukkha.
There's the reason it's happening, there's some clinging, this is freedom, and these are some of the qualities of the path.
We see clearly and experience the four noble truths, and that allows us to navigate quite easily away from the suffering and toward the end of suffering.
So, as we go throughout our day, see the mind clearly, know its qualities, know that there's suffering, know that there's the end of suffering.
Be with whichever of those we can, hopefully weaning toward the end of suffering.
We can do it in the kitchen with our relatives, we can do it while taking a walk, while sitting.
So, remembering what the Buddha said at the very beginning, I do not see any other single thing that brings such happiness as the mind that is tamed, controlled, guarded, and restrained.
Maybe we would just say simply the mind that is well observed, clearly seen.
Such a mind indeed brings great happiness.
So, thank you all for this week of Countdown, and I wish you much happiness.
Thank you.
