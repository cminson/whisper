So the topic is Desire. Desires. And it's easy to listen to Buddhist teachings and
believe that in Buddhism, desires have a bad rep. And that somehow we're not
supposed to have any desires. Desires are, having desires is the most natural, one
of the most natural things a human being can have. It's fact, I think that we
shouldn't be called human beings, we should be called human desire links.
Because this, you know, even just for me, we lift up my hand here to make an
exp, you know, the gesture involves some kind of very simple desire to move my
hand and make some gesture, some communication with my hand. To shift
my posture as I'm sitting here involves a desire. To feel hunger and want to eat
is a desire. To have a bladder full and want to go pee is a desire, you know,
that is a desire. Desires are just part and parcel of life. They're part of
probably every moment almost of our life that we're operating under some kind
of desire that either is appearing in the moment or got us to the place where
we're at now. You come to meditate and if you're able to sit completely desire-free
in the meditation, imagine that. Zero desires whatsoever. But if there was a
desire that got you to the meditation, there's no way around that. You don't
just kind of like just drop out of the sky on a meditation cushion and, you know,
I had no plans. I wasn't planning this at all. You know, look, I'm innocent.
There's no desire operating here. So desires are completely normal part of
life. You will have desires. If you're fully liberated and enlightened, you'll
still have desires. There's no way around it if you're a human being. The only
maybe way around it is to be depressed. To be, you know, super
depressed, you know, no desires for anything at all. So desires are a normal
part of life. The question in Buddhism is how we, how to have desires, how to
desire, how we relate to desires, how we involved with desires, not whether or
not to have it. And one of the things we're trying to do in Buddhism is to
liberate our desires. Isn't that nice? And in a very simplistic way is we're
liberating our desires from ourselves. That's, as I said, that's simplistic. So
we're liberating desires from our clinging, our compulsions, our headlong
kind of picking them up and going along with them. And, you know, and if a desire
comes with an urge, kind of like feeling, well, I want to follow the urge. I want
to follow that pressure that's there. It's important to do it. And that could
be their pressure and the urge to say things. Because whenever you speak,
there's a desire operating, but it can be a compulsive desire. It can be a strong
kind of, like I have to say this, I have to give this person my opinion. I have to
give this person a piece of my mind. I have to, you know, and so, so we relate,
how do we relate to the desires? And then, and then as we look at desires, we
discover that desires, there are different nature, different kinds of
desires. Some desires, in and of themselves, are compulsive, driven. There's a lot of
craving, a lot of pressure behind them, a lot of tightness, contraction. Some
desires have a lot of self conceit, conceit around it. And some of the
desires come along with a lot of ill will. Some desires come along with a lot
of greed, a lot of ambition. So what we're doing here in Buddhism is
understanding and studying desires, getting to understand what is a
desire, what's extra, what goes along with desire, so that we can liberate
desires. And what does that mean to be liberate desire? It means to recognize
the naturalness of how, where desires can appear. When they appear without any
kind of effortlessly, desires can be a dime a dozen. They are a dime a dozen. It
was the last time I knew, but they're actually cheaper. But to begin
recognizing the genesis of a desire, and discovering how there can be a desire
that has no weight to it, has no pressure to it, no contraction, no tightness, no
tension associated with it. It's like a desire that has a feather touch, a desire
that is almost feels effortless in the way it kind of floats up or floats
through. It's not easy to discover that or feel that, but if you're not told that
that's possible, then you see all these desires that are crazy making in us and
get us in trouble. You're like, I've got to stop desiring. No, you have to discover
a new way of desiring, having desires. And so in desires which have to have the
desires well up and relate to them in a way that promotes your well-being,
promotes happiness, freedom, liberation, how do you have a desire that nourishes
you, that supports you, that is not a drag to have? How are you free in
relationship desires, and how do you free desires from you? How do you live with
desires in a good way? So to discover this takes a lot of attention. That's why
one of the reasons to meditate is not just to get calm, but to become calm enough
so you can look at desires in a new way. If you just think of meditation as
becoming calm, and then like then you're going to go around to get up from
meditation, I'm going to stay calm, and that's the whole point, you might not
learn anything about yourself. And then you have to go meditate again to become
calm because you got agitated, because of your desires. It spun you out. But
to get calm and then from that vantage point see what you can discover, but
take a good look at how desires work for you. Now one of the great desires is
the desire to be mindful, the desire to be aware in some clear present
moment way, to be in your experience, in your life, aware of it in the living
present, in the lived moment. That's a desire to be mindful. That's a wonderful
desire to experiment with, to explore. How could I have that desire so that it's
not mixed up with conceit? Like I have to be the best meditator here. That's
why I'm doing this. Or how do I do that? That desire without aversion. I hate
myself, I hate my life, and this Buddha was supposed to help, and I'm just going
to bring, I've done this, bring mindfulness to kind of like get rid of
something. You know, if I just, if I do mindfulness, it's like bringing the, you
know, it's like bringing a garnet, a garnet to it. It'll just, I'll just blow it up to
smithereens and it won't be there anymore. So call whatever the issue is. So
there's hostility in the mindfulness and in the desire to be awake. Or there
could be greed. You know, I've heard that the meditation is a way of having like
great pleasure, ecstatic joy. Oh, I can't wait. And so the desire, you know, is
like, okay, I can't, you know, so there's almost like a death. So there's all
this extra stuff we bring to the desire. Part of it, to have the desire to wake
up, the desire to be mindful, without anything extra. It's very simple. And then
that desire does it come with any pressure, tension, contraction, weight? Or can
you find a way where that desire can well up, can arise, can be there, can be
called on, so that it just kind of has a very easy going, easy feeling, just easy.
There's no demand. It's kind of like take it or leave it. The desire is there. But
the desire doesn't need to be acted on. The desire doesn't, nothing, nothing
needs to happen. Just wow, there's that desire. Isn't that nice? Is there a way
in which the, so, so here's an interesting thing to look at. If you
occurs to you, you know, oh, I've heard this talk today. And, and so I think I
want to have a desire to be mindful now, because that seems like a good exercise.
So let me have that desire. So this is what's interesting. You had the desire
for that desire. It's possible that the way that you thought, I'm going to call
up the desire to practice, that that desire to call up the
desire to practice, that was the peaceful one. And then as soon as you
are going to be the one who do it, then you kind of get caught into gear. The
old kind of warrior came into place. I'm going to do this well. But you missed
the fact that the initial kind of thought, oh, it'd be nice. Let me try to bring
this up. That was done innocently. That just seemed like a good idea. Where is it?
Does that, where can you tap into the desire that has this innocence or
simplicity or likeness to it? So when the desire, so you can feel the desire to
be present. There's no pressure. There's no extra. There's just, it's just a very
simple desire. But it's a desire to be present. Where just having the desire is,
begins the process of being present. It isn't that you have the desire to be
present. Then you have to do something more. It's even just having the desire
and being present for it and feeling it well up, this simplicity. It's like, it's
like magic. It's like parting of the water, which is a great biblical miracle.
Wow. I just have this simple, very simple, no pressure, no expectation, almost a
non-doing kind of, I'm not doing the desire. There's a desire to be present.
And as that wells up, I'm present. Look at how that happened. How's this work?
So whether everything I said makes sense to you or not, that's what, you know, I'm
assuming it all makes sense. But I'm hoping that this is a call for you to
take your desires seriously as a field of mindfulness practice. To really kind of,
you do the investigation, you do the study of how desires operate in you.
Because this is the, you know, one of the key areas that we want to discover and
become, understand if we want to become wise in this practice. And not to have the
idea that it's just no desire at all is the point. The point is to have desires
that are free. That where you feel freedom and ease and peace with it and are free
of the unwholesome compulsions, that reactivity, that can be a big part of our
lives. For most people, this will be a radically different way of operating in
the world. To operate from this kind of, these kinds of desires that are, have no
weight to them, that have a feather touch, you know, are just like, you know,
simple, like a dandelion. See, it's just blowing in the wind, just on that light,
that kind of easy. But it can be that way. And it's a, and you probably discover
with that kind of ease or naturalness in your desires, that your desires probably
be more likely to be wholesome than unwholesome. And if they are unwholesome,
there's no pressure behind them. So you don't have to go anywhere.
Nothing has to happen. Just go, look at that.
Look what's just went through. That wasn't very nice. No pressure, no nothing. So
this ability to see the lightness, the naturalness of the welling up the
genesis of a thought, of desire, and have the lightness, the naturalness of it
being there, gives us wisdom to know what to pick up and what not to do, what
desire to follow up on and what not to follow up on. So may you make desires a
subject of your study. Thank you.
