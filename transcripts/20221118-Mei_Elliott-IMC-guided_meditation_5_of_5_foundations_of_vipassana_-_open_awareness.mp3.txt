 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Well, welcome back and good morning. My name is Mae Elliott and here we are on our last day of a week-long study on the foundations of Vipassana Meditation. So today's instructions are on open awareness. Up to now this week we've covered four different areas of our experience to pay attention to. Breathing, body sensations, emotions, and thoughts. And today is when we bring these four different aspects of meditation into a seamless whole. So this is the culmination of the work we've done so far. So far we've seen that we can be mindful of any of these parts of experience. And today we see how we can be unified together. So let's begin our meditation. Go ahead and connect your meditation posture. A posture that invites ease and well-being. That's both energetic, ready to meet the moment, and relaxed. Sitting with a soft forehead, relaxed temples, a released jaw, relaxed shoulders, and a softened belly. Once we begin to sit, we can connect with our primary anchor. That might be the breath, the soundscape, or maybe a global sense of the bodily posture. For the sake of simplicity, we'll focus on the breath. For this first part of the meditation, just being loyal to the breath. Connecting with where you feel it predominantly, and staying connected to it. So we're seeing all preoccupation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Connecting with the breath at the moment, an inhale starts, feeling it for its full length. Noticing the moment the inhale ends. And the shift to exhale. Noticing the full length of the exhale, and the moment the exhale stops. Taking contact with each transition of inhale to exhale, and back again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as the mind begins to settle on the breath, we'll now begin to include every phenomena. At any given moment, there are lots of things happening, sounds, sensations, emotions, moves, thoughts. So the way that we'll include these, we'll begin to open the awareness a bit, rather than focusing solely on the breath. If one of these other aspects of experience becomes predominant, we'll allow the attention to go to that new experience, and to feel it fully, to get to know what it feels like in the body, in the heart, in the mind, in the present moment. So we still have a preference for the breath, and that's where our home is. We keep coming back to the breath in between the objects that we notice, but we'll venture out to different sensations, feel them for a bit if they're predominant, then come back to the breath. When emotion arises, we go feel that emotion. We connect with it, explore, feel it. When it's no longer predominant, come back to the breath. Our capacity for attention functions a little like a spotlight. It shines on one thing at a time. We're also working with this practice for allowing whatever is predominant to be in the spotlight. Noting practice can be particularly supportive for this style of meditation. Making a soft note in your mind, then inhale, exhale, objectsem Inhale, exhale. Inhale, exhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. Inhale. One in emotion. In this way, we keep meeting whatever arises. The breath might be something that comes into predominance and we note it, but we're not intentionally returning to the breath as our primary anchor. You could think of this as an anchor-less practice. We're allowing the attention to move from one object to another to another, not trying to control anything. Just enjoying receptive attention, receiving whatever appears in awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Whenever the mind wanders off, you can try re-orienting to the practice by asking, what's happening now? We're now turning to notice the changing objects. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What's happening now? What's happening now? What's happening now? What's happening now? What's happening now? What's happening now? What's happening now? What's happening now? What's happening now?
