Dharmette: How Do You Carry 
Yourself?

An area of exploration for self -understanding is how one 
carries oneself in the world . With w hat attitude do you 
hold yourself?  What image do you have of yourself? 
What se nse do you have of who you are and how you 
are in the world?  
 
Everyone has some way, some approach for how to be  
– some attitude of who they are and  how they are in 
relationship to what’s around . What is yours? T here are 
different options.   
 
Actually , that sense of self and  of how to carry oneself is 
quite fluid and changeable . It’s not fixed in a  particular 
way. I’ve written  a story  about  this. I f you can , imagine a 
big fat fly landing on the back of an ant. It’s a big deal 
for the ant , I think . But if the same fly lands on a n 
elephant, the elephan t probably doesn’t even notice. I t’s 
not a big deal for the elephant. E ven if the elephant 
notices  the fly on its back , it probably  doesn’t matter .  
 
When you carry yourself as you  walk around in your life, you probably have all kinds of problems, troubles, 
challenges , and difficulties to address. Some are 
completely mundane and ordinary . The car needs an oil 
change ; the tire is flat. Some are not ordinary . You are 
diagnosed with a serious illness , or someone in your 
family is dying . How do you carry yourself with that? Do 
you carry yourself more as an ant , or more as an 
elephant? Do you take on these difficult ies as if they are 
a huge burden on your shoulders ? Or do you take them 
on as serious , but because you’ re so big , you address 
them and deal with them?  
 
Another image would be that some people approach  life 
more as a deer, but others  as a lion . I talked to  
someone recently who said their profession  is about 
protecting people from danger s, so it is necessary to be 
proactive  – to be looking for and aware of the danger s. 
The whole workday  is taken up with thinking ahead of 
all the dangers that might come along, figuring them 
out, preparing for them , and preventing them. Whenever 
they’re at work, the world is filled with dangers and fear 
is a regular emotion . Rather than saying, “Here’s how  
you can live without fear,” I suggested that with  fear and 
danger as part of their work , they might approach their 
work as if they were  a lion , rather than approaching it as 
a deer . The lion also has to deal with dangers , but how 
does a lion d eal with dangers compared to a deer? The 
deer is trapped in  the headlights and looks skittish .   
 How are you with the dangers in your life, in your world? 
Are you more like a deer , or more like a lion? Do you 
have confidence in your caution and in your 
engagement? H ow do you app roach your life? H ow do 
you carry yourself? Sometimes the focus is so much on 
the difficulties that there’s no sense of  your contribution 
of how to be with the difficulty, how to hold yourself, how 
to carry you rself. M aybe the difficulty is not going to get 
any easier , but if you’re a lion , you might be more at 
ease , than if you’re a frightened little mouse in the 
corner.  
 
Another way of understanding or carrying yourself is as 
being solid , or soft . Some sense of solidity may be 
useful,  but the sense of solidity could also make you 
fragile . A sense of being soft may be useful if someone 
says or does something , and you just flow with it. Or the 
sense  of softness might mean  you’re a pushover . How 
do you carry yourself when you walk int o a new 
situation? Are you hard? Are you  soft?  
 
Sometimes you carry yourself with no image of your self 
at all, no concern of sel f – there’s an emptiness or 
transparency of self . Someone may say or do 
something . Problems  may occur , such as a flat tire, or 
someone saying they don’t like you  – and it goes right 
through you, like the wind going  through an open 
window .  
 Sometimes you’r e not so empty and transparent. It’s  
clear that in certain situations who you are has a  
bearing , and you have to take that into account . For 
example, i n our society it’s not useful that a man , feeling 
quite empty, like he has no identity  or is free of identity, 
and feels  transparent, liberated, beautifully free – and 
then he walks into the w omen’s bathroom. He might 
think , “It’s all empty, who cares ? I have no identity  – I 
haven’t got the identity thing going. ” That doesn’t make  
sense when it’s time to go to the bathroom . He should 
be clear  about identity when going to the bathroom. 
When he  come s out of the bathroom , maybe he doesn’t 
need to be as  concerned about men  or women. I can be 
empty that way sometimes.   
 
How do you carry yourself? Wh at’s the image? What’s 
the idea you’re operating on? You’re a lmost always 
operating on some idea. H ow do you carry yourself? 
Ask the  question : “How am I carrying  myself in this 
situation? ” If it’s been unexamined and you’re on 
automatic pilot , stop and look : “How am I carrying  
myself in this situation? A re there alternative ways ? Can 
I enter this m ore like a lion? Or maybe now is it useful to 
be more like a mouse ?” Maybe I want to be 
inconspicuous . There are times for being a fly or an ant 
that no one notices  – quiet, off in a corner .  
 
At other times you want to be someone who’s very 
much noticed . You’re a parent , and your kids are playing with matches in the living room. Y ou w ant them 
to notice you  – you don’t want them to hardly  notice 
you’re there . You don’t want to be  quiet and  
inconspicuous . You want to be conspicuous ! In another 
situation , you are at the funeral of a friend. I t’s not the 
time to stand out and be conspicuous , or make sure 
everyone notices you . In that situation, i t’s 
inappropriate . But with your kids at  home with the 
matches , it’s appropria te to approach them in a 
conspicuous way.    
 
What’s the approach? Ho w are you carrying yourself? 
That is the question . I say this carefully because it’s 
different from asking about the sense of self, the self -
image, and the self-identity you have . Carrying yourself 
is broader. Carrying yourself with certain attitude s and 
approaches might even be  independent from the self -
image or self-identity  you have. How do we carry 
ourselves?   
 
Then , while it is very important to ask the question of 
how you carry yourself, I think you can make the 
investigation richer by asking another question : “How do 
other  people see you carrying yourself? How do other  
people see you? ” The self -image you have and how 
other people see you can be very different . You might 
think you’re fine the way you are , but other people  may 
experience you as a bull in a china shop , and you don’t 
understand why they  are standing back . Or you  may feel relaxed , calm , and centered , but other people feel 
like you’re timid , fragile , and have to be taken care of.  
 
The disparity  between how we see ourselves, how we 
carry ourselves , and how that is seen  or experienced  by 
other peop le is interesting. Although it is sometimes 
harder to be mindful of how other people see us , or to 
see the impact we have on others, for wise living I think  
it’s useful to take  that into account . Given how I carry 
myself , how is that perceived and responded to by 
others ?     
 
My hope of course is that at the right time and place , 
you are a lion  – and at other times and places you are 
not there .  
 
Thank you.
