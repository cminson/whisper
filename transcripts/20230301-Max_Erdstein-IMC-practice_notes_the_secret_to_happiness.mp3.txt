 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, as I was saying, I saw a friend quoted this morning saying, happiness is what's happening right now, minus our expectations. And it reminded me of this scroll, this teaching that was on a scroll in a Japanese meditation hall. And the teaching translated into something like, don't remove delusion. Don't even seek the truth. Don't remove delusion. Don't even seek the truth. But isn't meditation all about removing delusion and seeking the truth? So it's one of these questions. Why would this teaching be in this big, beautiful scroll, this Zen calligraphy, Japanese calligraphy, is not just like typewritten on something. The idea is that it's the expression of the awakened mind. So the Master gets into a meditative state and has their brush and has their ink and has one chance to... And they pour their being into this expression, this creation. So why would that teaching be prominently next to the Buddha? Don't remove delusion. Don't even seek the truth. And for me, that's related to what my friend was pointing to when he said, happiness is right now. When we are able to meet it directly in a fresh way, without our preconceived ideas of, this shouldn't be happening, this could be better, yeah, this moment is okay, but in some future moment, I'll get there. In some future moment, I'll really be happy. So it's like we sacrifice this moment for some imaginary moment. And what I think both of these are pointing to is the contents of our experience right now, whatever they are, whatever thoughts are flowing through, whatever emotions, whatever comfort or discomfort, whatever sounds, just the ordinary moment. The contents of this ordinary moment are exactly the contents of our practice. Our practice is not somewhere else. It's not in Japan or Thailand or Tibet or on a retreat or... Those are all wonderful things, places, things. But the ordinary contents of this moment are the contents of our practice and also the contents of our awakening. We awaken to this, what's happening now. There's no abstract awakening that's independent from the contents of this moment. It's just the contents of this moment without expectation. So I hope that's not too weird as a practice note. And I'm delighted to be here at Half Day Retreat. I think it's been three or four years since I've been teaching here on these half days. So you probably know the schedule, but we'll have a period of walking right now and then another period of sitting at 11 and then a short teaching. And then we'll have cleaning the center and then a closing circle. So, yeah, I mean, the wonderful thing about practicing in this way that happiness is right now is that there's no special particular thing to do, right? You know, other than to be present for what's happening and to notice when does dissatisfaction come in? When does expectation come in? When do I start to try to, as the scroll says, remove delusion, whatever that means? When do I try to seek some truth that's outside of this experience? And so I notice that, oh, yeah, there we go. And I come back to just the contents of this moment. So thank you very much. Enjoy this morning.
