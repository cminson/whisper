Practice Note: The Weight of Concerns

A primary activity  of the mind is to have concerns. The 
mind can be concerned about all kinds of things  – some   
quite reasonable , and some maybe not so reasonable. 
But the mind has concerns. Sometimes the se concerns 
happen t hrough the vehicle of thinking. F or som e 
people , concerns happen more through the vehicle of 
emotions , feelings . Sometimes our concerns are carried 
through intentions, wishes , or desires.  
 
One interesting thing  to feel, to investigate is : “What is  
the weight of your concerns ?” How heavy are they? Do 
you carry the burdens of the world on your shoulders? 
That’s an expression of weight. How intense are your 
concerns? How engaged are you  with them ? How glued 
to them  are you ? How much pressure comes with your 
concerns? How much tension comes with them? How 
much sense of compulsion?  
 
For me, I like to ask if th ere is a weight to them. T o 
investigate that means to turn aside a little from the 
subject you’re concerned about. Usually , when you are 
concerned , it’s about  something  – and what is 
interesting i s what it’s  about . But for a meditator , what’s  interesting is not so much the concern itself , but ho w the 
mind holds the concern  – how the mind is involved  or 
engaged  in the concern . So the interest is in  this idea of 
the weight , or the tension , or the pressure , or the glue , 
or the texture of the conce rn. How is that felt? How i s do 
you experience  that?  
 
With some concerns , the mind gets contracted. There is 
a very dense feeling inside , like pushing ahead, trying to 
resolve something . Other concerns  just kind of float 
through like a cloud in a vast open sky . You have a 
concern but it’s almost id le. The concern floats in ; you 
know you have this concern , and then it floats out , and 
you don’t t hink about it again for a few days . It’s very 
light.  
 
By investigating th e weight or the quality of a concern , 
then you can consider : “Is this the way you want to 
relate to it ?” Do you want it to have  so much weight? Do 
you want it to be so dense? Do you want to be so 
intense around it? Is it possible to open up around it? Is 
it possible to relax a little  with it, to lighten up?    
 
Even if  it’s not possible to change a concern, the whole 
game changes if you step back and just observe it from 
the point of view of its weight , as oppose d to observing 
from the point of view of the subject  that you’re 
concerned about.  That’s part of my offer ing for today .  
 As you ’re walking and sitting, for those of you who might 
have a concern or t wo, look at the weight of it, the 
weight of your thinking. S ee what happens if you  look 
through that perspective. S ee if it helps you relax.  
 
I hope you enjoy your morning. Thank you.
