 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hearing impaired, that even with the hearing aids, that I sounded a little muffled. So if you experience any difficulty with how I sound, feel free to, if I'm not loud enough, put your hand up or something. To let me know my voice has become too soft. And also you can type in chat if you're having any difficulty with my clarity. So, as I was saying, my name is Liz Powell, and I have been a practitioner at Insight Meditation Center for the last 17 years. Time flies when you're having fun, and even when you're just noticing what's happening. And during that time, I've spent about 15 of those years very intensely involved in doing META practice every week, several times a week. So I've found that it's very beneficial as both something that arises naturally, the more mindfulness practice we do, perhaps the more we start to become kinder and more compassionate with ourselves, or maybe sometimes we start with being more kind and compassionate to others. But also, it helps sometimes to just practice it deliberately, and that's what I've done for many years, is practiced it in many ways deliberately. So, the inspiration that's come from me this week is mindfulness of kindness and compassion in everyday actions. So what got me started reflecting on this was I traveled to California, from Colorado where I live right now, and I happened to go to the airport, the Denver airport on a day when half of their train system was not working. So I was confronted with, I came a couple hours early, but I found this huge area that is Denver airport leading up to the security gates thronged with so many people you wouldn't believe it. And in the Denver terminal, there are two wings that have baggage claim on both sides, and the line for security stretched all the way around to the very end of all the baggage claim and wrapped back around, doubled itself. And so, I, I and everybody else waited in line I was in the TSA pre check line for two hours. But what was so interesting was, I realized that it was kind of an experience of kindness and compassion that was going on in the terminal so there are these, I think, hundreds of people all masked but very close to one another. And what I noticed was people were quiet. They were kind to each other. They were compassionate. There wasn't a lot of yelling or, you know, I rate behavior going on. Even when we reached the, you know, I saw some people who made it all the way to the security agent. They waited in line two hours before me, and they got to the security agent and they were turned away for one reason or another maybe they didn't listen to the announcements that said, you should only be in this line if you have TSA pre check printed on your pass, or something else happened. And even those people, when they turned around and walked back to the line, they weren't, you know, fuming or swearing or any of the things you might expect. Yes, the comment was made Midwesterners are quiet, and they were quiet, mentally folk, and who knows whether all these people were from the Midwest or where they were. But, you know, people were in generally compassionate, we reached this place where everybody was waiting at the top of the stairs, you could go through the train, then you had to wait at the top of the stairs for the train to be told you could go down on the train platform. And then the train platform had about three train loads deeper people, but there was no cutting in line, no shoving. Even the security agents and people who worked at the airport, you know, there's only a couple hundred staffers there for all these people were very calm and very kind. So what that got me reflecting on is how often in daily life, people do, you know, each of you, each of us, and the people around us do innumerable acts of kindness and compassion that we might not even stop to look at. So, for example, I noticed being on a bicycle, sometimes how people will carefully, you know, give you extra space as they go around and they'll tell you, even though you're already in a bike lane, they don't cut too close to you. Or if you see people greet one another, you know, in people greeting a grocery clerk and smiling and making eye contact. And especially people just showing up and doing their jobs on time. There are all these things that feel like, well yeah of course people show up on their job, show up and do their job on time. But when you really think about it, we're so interconnected and so many of these things actually have a great deal to do with our feeling connected with one another, safe in one another's company, you know, to whatever degree we can feel that just that adds to the daily experience. I thought this evening, I'd like to honor this piece of compassion and kindness that we show on another in very everyday ways, as we do our guided meditation. So, I'm going to invite you to find, you know, into finding a standing, lying or sitting position that offers you some balance between relaxation and awareness in meditation. You need a little alertness and also need to be able to be comfortable within your body. It's very conducive to loving kindness and compassion meditations. And even starting by just noticing how you are right now. So, this moment, extend the kindness of listening to your body, listening to your heartline. And seeing what's there with as much compassion as you can muster. The way I've heard Bill say it sometimes is, look at it with soft eyes. And taking your time, whatever time is needed to settle into this meditation. Sometimes we're right there and ready to drop in. And every time we need time for the mind, heart and body to settle in. Allowing that meditation as you allow yourself to settle in. Perhaps, allowing an image or a sense of the daily kindnesses you offer to other people. And again, our mental meditation with the traditional subject of yourself. Any kindness that you can notice about yourself. Even if you find it difficult to say kindness to yourself. This one thing that what you could do could be very small could be greeting a friend, asking how someone is in actually wanting to hear the answer. And then finally, just buying and preparing food. Showing up for your work. Doing you. Whether that's caregiving, or a job, volunteering. Is a form of kindness so just allow what the kindnesses from your day to bubble into consciousness at their own pace. There's no rush. Sometimes you have a sense of that part of yourself that's kind. Send me that part. Those kind moments, those compassionate moments you're well wishes. We might offer whatever kindness phrases or compassion phrases that feel right to you right now. But I'll just start us off with some fundamental well wishes. We might offer those small and large kind moments of her. We might be healthy. We might have a sense of you can be very normal human wish for health needs to terminate. Your awareness, and if what's coming to mind is always in which you don't feel coming to it, don't feel compassionate. May I be healthy. You may have a sense of acceptance of whatever it is. May I be safe. And if it is arising in this moment, it's safe to allow awareness of it. May I be safe. May I be content. Like all human beings, I have each of us has a wide range of experiences. Some are present. Some are unpleasant. May I be content in meditating on all of it and extending myself the wish for content, whether it's here right now, or is a possibility for the future. May I be content. May I be free of suffering. In offering kindness phrases, sometimes the opposite awareness is arise. Still suffering, let's itself be known. Feel safe enough to show itself, or it can be that your kindness is showing itself, or your compassion. And just wishing all of those experiences well. Thank you. May I appreciate kindness and compassion arising in this world. In small moments in large moments in whatever way. May I appreciate kindness and compassion in myself, and in others. Thank you. And picturing or allowing to bubble up in your mind, or your feeling sense, anyone that you've encountered, from whom you have felt some kindness or compassion towards you. And again, taking your time. And this could be a human, it could be a pet. It could be an infant, or small child. It could be someone close to you, or even a stranger. And allowing an image or images to come to mind. And maybe more than one person who comes to mind. Taking your time. And extending wishes for that person, or people. And the kindness phrases compassion phrases that bubble up in your mind, or you can follow along with the phrases I'll offer. Be healthy. This is simply a well wish extended to the other person. It's not a demand. It's a kind of tension or sending. It's a kind of tension or sending. Be safe and protected from all harm, inner and outer. It's a kind of tension or sending. May you be content. It's a kind of tension or sending. May you be free of suffering. May you receive kindness and compassion. May you receive kindness and compassion. May you receive kindness and compassion. May you receive kindness and compassion. And then allowing other people from your life, familiar people or strangers that you don't really know that well but you see as you pass through your life. Sending kindness and compassion, well wishes for kindness and compassion in their direction. Getting an image or a sense of their kindness and their compassionate moments. And then letting that distill your heart. May you be healthy. And then your wishes for their safety. And then your wishes for happiness or contentment. And then your wishes for happiness or contentment. And then your wishes for happiness or contentment. Thank you. May you receive kindness and compassion from those around you in the world. Thank you. May your kindness or compassion phrases float up in your mind, offering those wishes those well wishes to the person who you're holding for the people who you're holding in your heart right now. And then all parts of them, the best in kindness and compassion. When they're suffering. When they themselves are kind and compassionate. When they themselves are not kind and compassionate. And they're the best in loving kindness. And then they're the best in loving kindness. And then they're the best in loving kindness. And then they're the best in loving kindness. And then they're the best in loving kindness. And then they're the best in loving kindness. And then the final couple of minutes of this meditation. Perhaps once again, allowing yourself some appreciation of the kindness you've offered yourself by coming to this practice, doing kindness and compassion meditation for yourself and for others in whatever way was available to you. And then the next evening, every drop of practice, every moment of practice is an act of kindness and compassion for the world, as well as for yourself. You and all beings everywhere. Receive kindness and compassion. Cultivate kindness and compassion. And bring freedom to the world. So our, our interconnectedness with other people in these small ways, these small ways of being, these small acts of kindness is really kind of an amazing thing to reflect on. Because people cared enough for our health. When we were born, you know medical people, our parents, our caregivers, whoever they were, cared enough for us that we made it this far. That's pretty amazing. And along the way, somebody cared to teach us new things and provide us with some level of education that enables us to get this far. A whole vast network of people did their jobs, you know showed up to work to grow the food we eat, to make sure that food got to places where we could obtain it. Many people cooked for us. Perhaps we cooked for them, so that we were nourished well enough to be here today. If you just look at one meal, and everything that's contained or everyone who is involved in that one meal from the person who made the utensils, you are using to the person who grew the food, the bees and insects that pollinated the plants that made the food. It's just an amazing exercise in interconnectedness to reflect on kindness and compassion rippling throughout the world. And you're part of that. So even when you're very hard on yourself, guaranteed, there's some way in which you've had, probably even without being conscious of it, you've had an impact on someone else in your life. And through kindness and compassion. I remember having teachers in school who had no idea that one little thing they said to me, made a big difference in my life, and for them that might have just been a comment that came out. And for me it was everything when I was a child when I was a teen, when I was a young adult. And now, as somebody who continues to learn every day. So, just honoring these interconnections of kindness and compassion this evening. I want to give you all a chance to exchange with each other a bit about what came up for you just now. And, you know, maybe each person makes one comment in your group of three or four, and then let's the next person make a comment and let it go around the circle in that way so everybody gets to share something. It does not matter by the way, whether what came up for you felt like kindness and compassion, or felt like the opposite sometimes we need that purification process of acknowledging the moments that were not so great. So I'm going to send you into six groups, or five or six groups, and enjoy the time together. And then you'll come back in about 10 minutes. So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome back everyone. Hope you enjoyed your conversations and we have time now for any comments questions. I wanted to share with me or with the group reflections. Jesse. Yes, please. Thank you for this meditation today. Yeah, I really appreciated that you brought contentedness and contentment into the meditation today. And that's what we talked about in our small group. And I guess for me, I've been having a lot of feelings of overwhelm coming up and so this contentedness felt like a natural antidote to overwhelm to come to stillness to turn to meditation even for five or 10 minutes which for me is a small amount of meditation. And just to think about contentedness and then coming back to kind of the theme you brought up today about bringing kindness into the world. Thanks for letting me share. Thank you. I really appreciate that observation that contentedness served as an antidote to overwhelm. And also that just five or 10 minutes of meditation can be so powerful, even a minute that we take just to breathe into and out of whatever's happening with us is so amazing. And I don't see a name but your phone number is displayed 650-323-5532. Please share. Hi, Michael from IMC. Hello. So, I just wanted to thank you and I also to appreciate you bringing in contentment and the small group was delightful. And so deep bow for you channeling the Dharma and holding the space. Thank you, Michael. Yes Wayne, please. Hi. Well, I appreciate Michael just reminding me how all of the uncertainty of our times is just kind of one of the biggest messages that life is full of uncertainty and change and change and change. Yeah. So, that was nice. Yes, against that backdrop sometimes we have to have our or it's helpful to bring any measure of compassion we can to how we experience that constant flux but I don't know, it's probably gone on throughout human history but it just seems so heightened. And this seems like one of them. I'm noticing that kindness is a place I feel some agency. I'm not a partner like just when I go to this grocery store just choosing to be kind to people. It, it just brings me joy and it brings me ease, and it's simple and precious, and it's right now what I got. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I remember early in the pandemic. I went to one of the counters at the grocery store where you need tasks for service. And the person behind it, you know, wasn't making eye contact and I asked him how he was. And then he kind of, he looked at me and he said not not very well, you know, you know, people are being really mean and it was when during that phase when the shelves for the store were just empty. And so I listened to what was going on with him. And, you know, his family and his concerns about his kids, and it was just, you know, it was a really small thing to do. But I could feel just I felt better just talking to him and kind of humanizing we were going through this insane moment and and how much pressure. He felt so I agree with you, you know, sometimes we have little to no control over anything. And yet there's this small things we can offer. I just mentioned one thing I just realized I remembered something that I teach in a middle school, public middle school in El Cerrito and one of the kids this morning in a class that kids, I can't remember how this got started but we were one kid just mentioned you know that it seems like one really bad thing happens about once a year. And some other kids said yeah yeah yeah it does seem like every year there's something really bad that happens. And I just. I somehow I just filled me with the joy to think just I felt like it's so fascinating working with young kids or with young people just recognizing that. You know these things grow in us and compassion starts small and grows. Yeah, that kids show each other the caring of one kid being willing to share it, you know, how he actually was experiencing things and another kid going yeah. That matters hugely. Well, like I know there's one child in my class who was biking. His mother told me this shortly before school started that he was biking with his father somewhere out in the country and his father had a heart attack right there and died and so that he was going to be he would be going to trauma counseling once a week and. So just thinking of all the different ways in which kids from minor minor difficulties to major traumas. Yeah, and in a case like that, that anyone, you know, can listen to that child or the people that no doubt came to him through trauma counseling. You know, there are these amazing moments when somebody can be supported through these huge things. So, thank you all very much for being here tonight, and wishing all of you. May we all have kindness and compassion flowing towards you, as well as flowing from you and feeling that interconnectedness between us in freedom, and through times of suffering. And through kindness and compassion find more and more ways to gradually come to freedom, and may we all be free of suffering. You can unmute if you'd like to say good night to each other. Good night. Thank you. Thank you, Liz. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Christine. Good night.
