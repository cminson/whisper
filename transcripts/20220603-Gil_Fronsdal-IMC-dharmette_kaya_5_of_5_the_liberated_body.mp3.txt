The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So then we come to the last talk in this five-part series on the different ways
to experience our body, the kaya, K-A-Y-A, and that the experience we have of our body
is very much influenced by our states of mind, activities of mind, our thoughts,
our judgments, our attachments, and as those shift and change, then the
experience of the body changes as well. And when we practice, when the different
kinds of states and ways of mind works while we meditate, can give us a different
experience of the body. Which experience is the true experience of the body? You
know, is the one that you're most commonly, the most common way you feel
your body and know your body? Is that the how you really are, the true body? In
fact, I think that there's no basis for deciding that the karmic body is the
accurate body or the real body. It's accurate enough as a karmic body,
but that's what it is. It's experiencing the body through the lens or
through the mind states that's caught in the world of karmine. As the mind
becomes free of that world, relaxes, settles in, then sometimes we start feeling
the joy body and wonderful feelings of suffusing joy or well-being, contentment.
And as practice deepens, then the tranquil body becomes more evident and
the body is just very peaceful, equanimous. And as mindfulness develops, we have
the insight body. The body as experienced when through observation or
perception, that's very present, very attentive, but freed of the labels,
ideas, concepts we overlay on top of experience. And part of the value of
seeing free of all the concepts and ideas and seeing more of the stream and
the flow of the body is to loosen up the attachment to body, attachment to
self and relationship to the body and all attachments. And as we release our
attachments as clinging and grasping and striving and resisting, judging and
bias and fear and hate finally quiet down, the experience of the body changes
dramatically. And we can have the experience of the liberated body. And the liberated
body is the body that's not entangled in the mind. The experience of the
liberated body is a little bit the product of the mind, but it's the
product of the mind free, non-clinging, at ease, peaceful. And so the result is
that the body feels much more at ease, it feels lighter, it feels more
refreshed. It doesn't have to live with the weight and the stress of the
puppeteer, the mind, which is constantly maybe thinking and reacting and being
afraid, being desirous, being angry, and all the ways that kind of seeps into the
body, certainly in muscles being tense, tight, but also in all kinds of chemicals
that the body releases, stress chemicals and things that releases into the body
from stressful activities of the mind, things of the mind. And so as the
body gets freed of all this, it tends to have a feeling of more unity, of flow, of
ease, a certain kind of delight, joy, lightness, the weightlessness in a way.
That kind of grace goes with it. It just feels like there's almost like grace to
move an arm or to walk or do anything. Maybe partly because it's all just kind
of a wonder, a surprise, a delight, and to be present for all that. The liberated
body is one where we don't impose on the body all the then issues of
identification, me, myself, and mind. This is who I am. We don't put on the body
expectations that should be different or judgments, ideas, that interfere with the
natural functioning of the body. A liberated body is a body that has certain
kind of harmony to it, and a body that all the parts of it, as they are, are just
fine as they are, in and of themselves. A few days ago, I injured my finger a
little bit, and you know, I kind of would like it to heal properly, and it is. It's
not a small little cut, but my finger doesn't mind. My finger doesn't know
that it should be any different. It's just a natural way in which this world
exists this moment, that there's a finger with a cut in it, that from the point of
view of our body in itself, whether we're bald, I have long hair, or thin hair, or
curly hair, or kinky hair, or straight hair, it's all just fine. It's all just
from the inside out. It just is what it is, just like you would look at a tree,
and you wouldn't say, well, that branch is all wrong, that it's the angle in which
it's coming off the trunk, or it's twisted, or bent in a certain way. It's just
all the way that nature works, and the way nature grows, and it can all kind of a
marvel. So to give that kind of freedom to the body, and let the body be the body,
let it be the natural event that it is, that we don't identify this as my body,
we don't define ourselves by it, and the same time we care for it. It is just as
much worthy of our care, our love, as some other person, or an animal. Some of you
love your pet, and you know, I don't know if your body should see as your pet
exactly, but it could be something that you care for, and love, and treat well,
and with respect you don't. It's not an afterthought. The body is not just a
convenient vehicle for getting you from one place to the other. The body is, you
know, a valued, vital, important part of this whole process. So I wanted to read a
couple of quotes from the ancient Buddhist texts. One is from the verses of
the elder monks, and I delighted this little poem, and I see it as kind of a
little poem about a liberated body. Hey, my body is light, having been touched
with vast joy and happiness. My body feels like it's floating, like cotton
blowing in the wind. Here's another quote, actually, from the Buddha himself.
I immerse the body in the mind, and the mind in the body, and when I dwell, having
entered upon a blissful perception, and a buoyant perception, in regard to the
body, on that occasion my body becomes more buoyant, malleable, wieldy, and
luminous, a luminous body. So these are all ways, different ways of experiencing
the body. There is, you know, the karmic body is not the only body to
experience, and we want to kind of free ourselves from the idea that this is the
real body, the really singular real body. It's real enough. We have to respect the
karmic body and take care of it on its own terms. But there are other ways of
experiencing the body, and so free ourselves up from kind of attachment or
a fixidity on this is how the body is, and I have to constantly negotiate and
struggle and work with this. As the mind meditates, as the mind becomes freer,
more concentrated, more insightful, the experience of the body changes. As the
experience of the body changes, in return it changes the mind. There's kind
of a reciprocal relationship that goes on here, and so as you begin feeling the
lightness of the body, the freedom of the body, the joy, the tranquility of the
body, that's a lesson for the mind. That's a teaching to the mind, what's
possible. It's a reminder of the mind to, yes, here, this is a good place to dwell,
to be centered and relaxed here, as opposed to being carried away on the
kind of freight trains of thoughts that carry us away. So the liberated body,
it's fascinating to me that how dynamic, complex, sophisticated this human body
is. That's so many systems working, so many complicated chemical systems,
neurological systems, mechanical systems at operating, that any one of us, even
with a PhD in engineering and biochemistry, simply could not track it all
and manage it all. It's an amazing, complicated thing that happens mostly on
its own. And in addition to that, the mind itself is a wondrous thing.
You know, most of the mind happens offstage. We don't really know
all the complicated ways in which the mind works as well. I don't think any of
us is smart enough in our conscious self, the self that we consciously know, to
direct and manage and supervise all the ways in which the brain works, the mind
works, and all the ways in which the body works. The part that we can actually
have some say and do, the part that we get attached to and get cling to and get
preoccupied with, is actually a very small sliver of who we are in our
totality. And it's remarkable how much trouble we can get into in this little
slice of that we're conscious of, where we take, this is who I am, and this is
what I have to do, and it's all up to me, and I have to navigate and do all
this. This practice of ours can teach us what it's like to put that little
sliver, that little subset of our whole, that subset which is the conscious
part. If we can let that rest, let that be at peace so that it can be informed, it
can be guided by this huge percentage of who we are that we're not so conscious
about. And that is where living a Dharma life, living a life that's ethical, that's
peaceful, that's not caught up in greed, hate, and delusion, that's where we've
come into this beautiful harmony of the dharmic body, the dharmakaya,
the dharmakaya, the liberated body operating in the fullness of all its
systems, integrated, harmonious, and free. So thank you for this week and for
today, and I hope this has given you an interesting perspective for your body,
and if you, what I talked about today is of interest for you, maybe through this
weekend you can look, you could spend some time meditating and walking and doing
simple things with your body, to see if you can kind of intuit or feel into what
a liberated body is like, ways of your body like when the body has, is not just
peaceful or tranquil, but has a sense of being, operating free of attachments, free
of clinging. Thank you.
