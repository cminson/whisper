The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So we're talking this week about mindfulness as a protection in different dimensions of that image.
And we talked earlier about mindfulness as safety and non-mindfulness as danger.
And kind of along similar lines but with a different facet of that,
sometimes the Buddha talked about mindfulness as a strength and lack of mindfulness as weakness.
So today we'll talk about protection in the form of strength.
And there are a whole bouquet of wonderful similes about this in the discourse that is on mindfulness of the body.
That's Machima 119.
For those of you who want to look it up.
I just want to read a little bit about some of these images are really great.
So when someone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body,
Mara, that is the forces of distraction,
Mara finds an opportunity and a support in that person.
Suppose someone were to throw a heavy stone ball upon a mound of wet clay.
And then he asks, what do you think?
Would that heavy ball find entry into that mound of wet clay?
And the monks say, oh yes, yes, venerable sir.
And so if someone does not cultivate mindfulness of the body, Mara can get in.
And then later he's, and then he says the opposite of that, you know, suppose that someone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body.
In that case, Mara cannot find an opportunity or support.
And the image is suppose a person were to throw a light ball of string at a door panel made entirely of heartwood.
What do you think would that light ball of string find entry through the door panel of heartwood?
And of course, the monks say no, no, it wouldn't.
So we have this, these two powerful contrasting images of a heavy stone ball thrown into wet clay and a light ball of string thrown against a door of heartwood.
And so as I reflect on this,
I know that there are times when, you know, when the emotional state is kind of one of collapse, right?
And so, you know, the mind is just kind of collapsed.
And so it's easy for even small things to push their way into our psyche at times like that.
And so this image of a stone ball kind of points toward heaviness and burden.
And then in contrast, a door that's made of heartwood feels upright and strong and solid.
It has a clear shape and clear boundaries.
So I think that's the contrast being made here.
I know I've had sittings where my mind was repeatedly overrun by certain emotions or thought trains.
And then when I look back after regaining mindfulness, it's as if I had no firmness along that dimension where the thought or emotion was coming in.
And even if I was vaguely aware that those thoughts were starting to emerge, I had no real resistance to they're just pushing into my whole consciousness, like the wet clay doesn't resist an entry of a stone ball.
So then, you know, what's the remedy for this when we realize, you know, sometimes it can help to just be a bit firmer in our resolution to sit in meditation.
Or we can use, as I mentioned in the guided meditation, the feeling of substantiality and body to bolster the strength of the mind.
So the door image nicely conveys that we're kind of closing the door on certain inputs that they don't gain entry into the mind.
And just saying, no, thank you.
This is not the time for that.
And we, in that way, we kind of bolster our healthy boundaries in mind, if you will.
So then there's a second image.
We're going to do three images all from this Sutta today.
The second image says, again, suppose that somebody were not to cultivate mindfulness of the body.
And so they says, suppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood, and a person came with an upper fire stick, thinking, I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.
And so you think, monks, could that person light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the dry sapless piece of wood with an upper fire stick.
And they say, oh, yes, that would work well.
And similarly, he says, my Mara can find an opportunity or support in someone who hasn't cultivated mindfulness of the body.
The opposite image is suppose there were a wet, sappy piece of wood, and a person came along with an upper fire stick and wanted to light a fire, but they would not be able to do that.
Because of the wet, sappy piece of wood that they were striking it against.
And similarly, we have this image then of this image I think relates especially to irritation or aversion, but it could also I think apply to greedy or deluded thoughts.
But when the mind is weak and is not connected well to the body, the mind can easily pick up a small input, like a pain in the body or a subtle thought of frustration or dislike,
and keep rubbing away at it until it catches fire and becomes a huge conflagration in the mind.
But with mindfulness of the body that repeated irritation can't build up and cause the fire.
I've had sittings like this I certainly have. So I remember one time having a conversation with a nun who was talking about how her mind sometimes felt like it was on fire and she was struggling to put it out during meditation.
And she said that often when she would investigate more carefully around the edges of that fire, maybe the parts that weren't so much in the foreground of her consciousness. She would discover that some part of her own mind was throwing kindling on the flames, you know, kind of in the side, where she wasn't looking so carefully.
And that's actually the case. You know, we, so maybe the image from the Sutta would be that over on the side we were rubbing the fire stick and just generating more and more sparks to build up the flame.
So, you know, we think that what we need to do to deal with is our irritation and our frustrated our frustration because that thing is so irritating and I have to manage my irritation of it and it's so irritating.
In fact, there are many supports in our own mind that inflame irritation or frustration. The image of the two fire sticks is pretty apt in that we're supplying half of the stimulus.
Right.
We're supplying both halves. So, often we have views and beliefs that we aren't quite aware of or expectations. That's very common. So the mind is getting riled up. If the mind is getting riled up repeatedly.
It can be worth investigating to see what ideas or expectations in our own mind are contributing. And then bringing mindfulness to those. And one supports can be to feel the stillness and the relative coolness of the body.
So to imagine the body is kind of a lake and at least the awareness of the body as a calm lake. And then this conflagration in the mind is kind of on top of that and contrasts with it.
So we should be able to use that to investigate and see how it is that we're riling ourselves up.
Okay. And then the third image in the Suta is of a water jug. So, in the case of non mindfulness of the body, suppose there were a hollow empty water jug set out on a stand, and a person came with a supply of water.
What do you think? Could the person pour water into the jug? Oh, yes, yes, of course.
And so similarly, someone who has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, Mara finds an opportunity and a support.
And then the contrast is that if there were a water jug that were full right up to the brim with water, and a person were to come along, could they pour water into that jug.
And the monks say, no, no, of course not. And so if we've cultivated mindfulness of the body, then it's like trying to pour water into a full jug, but we can't do it.
And so in this image, there's a sense of fullness as a strength. And in my own practice, I see this as relating to continuity of mindfulness.
So there are kind of two dimensions of continuity in relation to mindfulness of the body, and my use of the breath as an example in the meditation.
So we can be aware of the full spatial extent of the breath. It's not just in the lungs, but it kind of pervades the whole body as energy.
And actually, even if we try to look for the boundaries of the body, sometimes they're not so clear. So it might be that the breath extends even out into space a bit.
And when we're full to the brim, we haven't left out any aspect of the breath in the bodily experience. There's a fullness to how we're experiencing that.
And then there's also the second dimension of continuity in time. So we can be aware from the very beginning of the in breath to the end of the in breath, a little gap in the start of the out breath and then all the way to the very end,
even as it gets very subtle before the next in breath.
And when mindfulness has this kind of fullness, then there's no opportunity for some distraction to slip in any more than we could pour water into an already full pitcher.
So if we pay attention in our own mind, we can check where in the cycle of the breath does mindfulness tend to be weak.
You know, that's where the thoughts can find entry, or are there parts or regions of the body that we're not really aware of. And so, you know, if we have thoughts or emotions that are related to that part of the body, they would easily get into the mind and start growing.
So these are interesting images about mindfulness as a strength and not succumbing to the weakness of being overpowered by these various things in the mind.
And then the Buddha, after that, lists a bunch of benefits of mindfulness of the body. We don't have time for all the benefits, but I want to just mention a few of them.
So one of them is that, and again, it uses this image of you'll hear the strength metaphor, one becomes a conqueror of discontent and delight.
And discontent does not conquer oneself. One abides overcoming discontent whenever it arises.
One becomes a conqueror of fear and dread, and fear and dread do not conquer oneself. One abides overcoming fear and dread whenever they arise.
So there's a sense of strength in being able to overcome various issues in the mind.
And then it goes on. There's another one about overcoming. One bears well with cold and heat, hunger and thirst, contacts with various physical things, wind, the sun, creeping things.
We also want to endorse ill-spoken unwelcome words and painful bodily feelings. So there's a way in which this mindfulness of the body gives strength for unpleasant physical and mental experiences and our willingness to be present in our form helps us to overcome those things, to conquer those things.
And then I'll skip to the end of the list, which is where one realizes for oneself with direct knowledge and abides here and now in deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom, the destruction of the teens.
So all of that is code for one reach is full awakening. So mindfulness of the body can take one all the way to freedom from great hatred and delusion.
So all of this power or strength I want to emphasize is not the kind of power that is oppressive or dictatorial or aggressive.
Instead, I will suggest that it comes from compassion. It's the strength of really caring about our own mind and heart, and also caring about other people.
So, you know, when we're strong and mindful, we are protecting our own well-being from the various inputs that we've said many times, we're not going to be able to not have input.
So we're going to have to learn somehow to meet them with mindfulness and this strength that's being pointed to here comes from caring about our well-being, caring that we are able to meet things well in life.
Everything from the irritation in our need to ill-spoken unwelcome words to discontent because life is challenging and we can't get things the way we want it all the way up to the moment of death.
So when we're strong and mindful, we can protect not only our well-being, but we can, I'm now going to say, extend that protection outward to care for others.
And that's tomorrow's topic, is mindfulness as protection for both ourselves and others.
So I hope you'll appreciate these images of strength and be inspired as mindfulness is really a powerful force in our lives and they had bring you a lot of benefit today and also spread to those around you.
See you tomorrow.
