 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. Oh, hello, hello, and good evening, good morning, good whatever time of the day you're joining from in right now. So let's just start practicing together. This is what I've been exploring the past few sessions and then the Dharma instructions will come through the guided meditation, but I'll keep it pretty light tonight. I think that's what my heart is called to, to keep it pretty light in instructions with a lot of silence for us to settle together. So with that, I'd like to invite us all to arrive to land, to land in our bodies, to land in our chairs, cushions, come together and meditate. Let go. Let go of wanting to meditate, wanting to do something in a particular way, but step into the possibility of just being, not doing but being. Letting go, letting go, let's start by letting go. Let go of all the busyness that have, that might have come for this moment. Letting go of thoughts, plans right now. They might be darting back and forth, smilingly saying thank you. I'll engage with you later. Please come back later. Right now I'm going to give my whole heart this way of being, just being, being simple, this mysteriousness of being without asking questions, trying to figure it out. Let just be, be a body. Be a body that breathes. Let's just be a body with all magical sensations. And after thoughts, arising, tightness in the body plans to simply, as if you're blowing the flower petal to the wind. Gently, gently blow it away as if you're blowing a kiss to this thought. Later, thank you. Mmm, settle in with breath. Mmm, that's good. Mmm, that's good. Mmm. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is figuring out the thoughts. You can let them go. It's okay. It's okay. Just take refuge. It's simplicity here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let go. Let go. Just here is enough. Just being here is enough. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, I want to thank you for all my help. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have so much good work here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your help, for your help. But to just be, just to be alive in this life of yours, whatever it is, in this moment. What if you breathed with that? With this? Let it infuse your heart, your mind, your body. This, letting go of expectations, of needing to be someone to do. Drop it in this moment. Experiment. See what might open up. No where to go, no one to be, nothing to do. Be free. You And facilitated by, by physical spiritual Freedom from planning the next moment. Freedom from the past. Put it all down. Freedom from your role, your responsibilities, your chores. Put it all down in this moment in your mind, in your heart. Freedom from your an you you're not releasing it all forever but just in this moment putting it down, exploring, experimenting. What is it like to put down expectations of yourself, of the world, of others? Simply being, being simple is profound beyond words. Thank you. string. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we bring this, sit to a close together, letting go of any expectations, any shoulds, letting go of any expectations. Letting go of expectations was exactly what it had to be. And we behind you could of needed us to be Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice. So the theme was letting go of expectations, letting go of shoulds, of demands of just letting go, letting go of that sense of no one to be, nowhere to go, experimenting, offering ourselves this release, release from expectations, release as a form of metta because we often layer on so much on ourselves and the society does the same. And of course, many of that is appropriate for who we are and what, you know, the wholesome aspirations we have in the world, the roles we have, the relationships, not to let go of all of that. However, experimenting in this moment with this practice, what if I let go of that? I can bring it all back on, you know, 30 minutes after this meditation is over, but what if I let go of expectations on myself? What can I, if I let go of it as much as possible, what happens? Do I notice the weight of it? How much of it is extra? How much of it is appropriate? How much of it is extra, this being driven to do and be and whatever it might be, the shape of it in our constructs and our psychological and life constructs, but just noticing that difference. If I put it down, oh wow, it's different. It's just, it's profound to just be, to just breathe, to just live this life simply. It's profound, it's beautiful. Nothing needs to happen. So that was the invitation to explore that a little bit as much as might have been available or not. It's perfectly fine. So I'd like to invite us now to turn to explore this question of doing, being, becoming, and letting go of that just for a minute as an exercise in this practice, offering this freedom, radical freedom to ourselves as an act of metta to explore that together in small groups, in conversation. What was that like? What did you notice? And the answer might be, I fell asleep. I was so relaxed. I let go so much. I wasn't even here. That's fine. Not a problem. You can also offer your silence, your presence, and when your turn comes to say pass. So let's go reverse alphabetical order. Share just one thing, one reflection about this exploration and the next person, the next person, then you can, after everyone has gone around, then you can open it up for conversation in the time. So not asking questions from one another, but just keeping it simple and light, letting each person be in their experience. Just offer from your own experience. That's all. If you don't want to offer, you can offer silence and kindness, offer kindness, offer freedom to each other. No expectations. See what it's like to take the spirit of this practice into the breakout rooms. No expectations, no expectations of yourself. So then create the rooms. I'm opening them up. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. So everybody's back. Welcome back everyone. Now let's just take one or two reflections. What did you notice either in the meditation or in the conversation about this topic of the heaviness and noticing the heaviness or letting go of expectations on oneself? Especially I like to invite those who haven't spoken recently to pull forward. If you've spoken recently and happier, pull back. Make space for others. You can type in chat also or raise your hand. Christine, please. Well, thank you, Nikki. That was a great meditation tonight. In my group, we had a lot of quiet time and we were content. I was content. There was an element of embracing just being content and quiet tonight. So then we were saying how it sets us up for the weekend. So just say thank you a lot for that tonight. I enjoyed that. Thank you. Thank you, Christine. Lovely. Just lovely. Brightens my heart with contentment. And I am content, but if there are any other reflections, burning ones, we'll make some space. Otherwise. I think that was a lovely one to end our session with this sense of contentment. Yeah. Letting go of expectations. So, so thank you all. Thank you for your practice. Thank you for coming from so many different time zones and places in this amazing world for this cultivation. May all beings be well. May all beings be free, completely free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone.
