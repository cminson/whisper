 So I recently learned about a game called Mind Ball. And in this game, two people sit across from each other wearing headsets. And there's a flat track between them with a ball on it that starts in the middle. And the aim is to move the ball onto the other person's side and over a goal line. But here's the key. The headset detects a pattern of brainwaves that are associated with being calm and at ease. And the strength of the calm signal is what moves the ball toward your opponent. So the person whose brainwaves are more easeful will do better in this game. So clearly focusing on winning and focusing on the goal is probably a way to lose in Mind Ball. So it's much better just to close the eyes and become settled and connected into the present moment. Of course, there's no competition in meditation. But when I heard about this game, I thought that there was a broad similarity to the process of meditation. There is some effort to be made. But the effort is something like moment to moment ease, being diligent about not letting the mind get tense. And the result of this effort is to move in the direction of more calmness. And the more you try to make something happen, the less calm and ease there will be. It's interesting and sometimes kind of subtle. So in Mind Ball, there's this physical ball whose movement tells you how easeful or not your brainwaves are. And in meditation, there are also indicators that we learn to tune into. Tensions in the body, tensions in the mind. And part of what we're doing in practice, and especially here on retreat, is to learn the language of our own mind-body system, to learn how all of that works for us. So today we are talking about Samadhi. And the talks over the last couple of days by Gil and Ying brought forth several qualities of mind that relate to an overall sense of serenity and well-being. Qualities of gladness and joy and then tranquility from which the mind can connect to a deep sense of happiness that doesn't rely so much on external conditions. And all of these, as well as faith, support the emergence of this factor called Samadhi. It's the fruition of bringing together a handful of these key conditions. We heard the term a gathering, the different parts of the mind together. The body, the emotions, the mental activities, and the spiritual dimension. And today we'll talk more explicitly about this unification process of the mind. So often, up until now in the retreat, we've been using the word Samadhi, often untranslated. We've just been saying this Pali word. And that's partly because it has several different aspects and so it's hard to translate it into just one English word. And it's also partly because the word itself is evocative. Samadhi. Right? It has that ahh in it. Can you feel that? So Samadhi. And it's like the verse that Ying read yesterday from the Dhammapada that starts out, Ah, so happily we live without hate among those who hate. Ah. So it's a good word, Samadhi. The word roots literally mean to stand together. So Sam is together, Adhi is related to standing, the verb for standing. And the English word whose roots also mean standing together is the word compose. So calm is together and pose is like posture or position to stand. So Samadhi is about having a mind that's composed in some way. Probably the most common translation that you'll hear is concentration for Samadhi. And this can unfortunately evoke ideas of a strong focus or of bearing down like that. I think some of you are discovering though that just furrowing your brow and bearing down is not so effective actually. But I think there is a way that concentration is a good translation. In that concentric means having a common center. So it describes a mind that is gathered around something. I think of it like maybe like people gathered around a campfire. There's an idea of being harmonious. So Samadhi means gathered or gathered together. All the different parts of our mind are gathered together like people around a campfire or unified. You could say that too. The suttas sometimes say brought to singleness. It's a little bit more formal or unusual language, but I kind of like brought to singleness. And then because of exploring these different words, we can also understand what would not be Samadhi. Distraction or scatteredness or disunity or dispersion. Probably we all know what those experiences are like also. And there's nothing wrong when our mind is in a state like that. It's one more thing to notice. It's just a matter of what conditions are present, what state the mind is in. So Samadhi is what is classically called a resultant. So that's not a very common word. We don't say that very often. But a resultant means that rather than trying to create Samadhi directly, our job is in setting up the conditions for it, and then it's the result. So there are conditions that we can put in place, and then the Samadhi comes about from those conditions. The Buddha definitely considered Samadhi to be a very important practice to do at some point on our path. It is the eighth step of the Eightfold Path, SamƒÅ-Samadhi. And it comes along with a very wholesome form of pleasure and happiness, which are themselves onward leading in practice. And when the mind can soak in Samadhi for a while, it changes in ways that are beneficial, ways that further the path. So like in mind ball, the key is to be content and to nurture the conditions, which include maintaining some continuity of usefulness, and probably include forgetting about having a goal. So it's raining today here at IRC, and there are clouds across the sky. And they started as moist clouds that had a certain amount of water in them. And then there were atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure and humidity, such that the water came together into drops in the clouds. And then eventually that couldn't be held in the clouds anymore, and so it falls to the ground as rain. We can see that there are interacting conditions that lead to rain. And if any one of those conditions was outside of a certain range, or if all of them together were not in the correct range, then the rain couldn't happen. Right? It's not so complex with the issue of rain. We can understand that. And it's actually similar with Samadhi in the mind. There are a variety of conditions. And as we do this practice, it's helpful to start knowing the territory, knowing the territory around which these conditions come together. I know people who arrive in meditation, like maybe their first day of meditation, and they're all about getting concentrated. And that's what they want. They want to get concentrated. But as if they could just start with that. But actually it's necessary to create the conditions. And if all the conditions aren't there, or they aren't in the right balance, then we don't get the concentration. So not creating the conditions is like wanting rain without there being even any clouds in the sky. So we need to understand the conditions that will be there for Samadhi to arise, and also the conditions that are not there for Samadhi to arise. Right? What has to be absent in order for there to be Samadhi? In meditation practice we tend to have those two sides. But rather than treating this as kind of a laundry list of various qualities that are helpful or not helpful, I want to talk about it as more of a process. Because we are engaged in a process here. Actually, we've been on retreat for several days now. Everybody is...you may not think so, but everybody here is more settled than you were on Sunday. Something has been happening. So maybe we'll have an image. So imagine the gathering of a raindrop in a cloud, and the water molecules start out kind of in the air. You know, the cloud is a denser form of them, but still they're in the air, they're in the atmosphere, and they're in kind of a dispersed state. These water molecules flying around, not really connected to the other molecules. And then gradually some of the water molecules begin to connect with other molecules. And the energy gathers into bonds between them. And for the molecules that are slowing down and connecting, starting to turn into little drops, the molecules that are still bumping around and haven't connected yet, those ones look kind of agitated. You know, relative to the ones that are starting to gather. So we're in that state. Our mind is maybe starting to gather, starting to become more still. And as that happens, even if it's just for brief periods, it makes what is not still and what is not gathered easier to notice. You know, we have a reference point of being even just a little bit gathered together. Then we can see more clearly factors in the mind that are more agitated. So classically, there are five mind states that, let's say, contrast with the gathering and stilling of the mind. And these five are not highly specific. They're more like broad categories that include some variations within them. And in the suttas, they've actually been called visitors to the mind, these five. So I kind of like that description because it helps us to remember that maybe they're not inherently part of our mind. They're just visiting. But they do visit. For sure they visit. But, you know, understanding them as visitors can help us to meet them better when they arise. So I want to talk about these five. They're named the five hindrances. Gil pointed out in his talk that the mind can get to a state that is ready, receptive, free from hindrances, elated, and confident. So that's a little bit the fruition. But what about this phrase in the middle of that, free from hindrances? What does it mean to be free from hindrances? Well, it turns out that all of the hindrances are linked to water images. So that's good for us today. And being free of them is something like allowing water to purify and settle. So as we settle, we notice that these visitors in the mind are sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt. Those are the five. We'll go through them. And as the mind gathers, it's easier to see them. At a top level, the first way to meet all of them is with mindfulness, with a balanced willingness to see them without judgment or some other agenda, just meeting them with mindfulness. And then we can look a little bit further. Kind of in the way that Ying talked about this morning, we can see that each of the hindrances consists of several different component parts. There's a bodily part, there's an emotional part, there's often thoughts associated with the hindrances. And when we see the hindrances as consisting of different parts, it shows how fluid and changeable they are, which is also helpful for becoming free from them. So we'll start with this first one called sensual desire, or more broadly, we could say wanting something. And it doesn't mean that all desires are hindrances. Instead, it's more that we can feel when the mind is caught up, when it's caught up in wanting or it's attracted to some alluring object. And the water image for sensual desire is it says it's like a bowl of water that's mixed with lac, turmeric, blue, or crimson dye. So the water has been dyed some color. And I think of this as an early version of what we call rose-colored lenses. And so when the water is like that, we can't see as clearly in it. We're not seeing accurately. And it's like that, right, with objects of desire or things that we find alluring. We tend to see them through these rose-colored lenses and think they're going to be really great. And they may not be in the actuality. But we can feel in our body what wanting feels like. It feels sometimes like leaning forward. I've sat on the cushion sometimes and realized that I was literally leaning forward. And when I settled back, it's like, oh, it's like some muscles could relax. I was not balanced. It can also include tightening up or gripping, grasping, essentially. Even if you're having a calm sit, you might be subtly gripping in order to keep the calm, right? You've got to hang on to this one. This is good. And as soon as you do that, it's slightly less calm, right? Or you may feel the energy moving to the front of the body. You're thinking about supper and the energy's all the way in the front, getting ready to walk to the table. But sensual desire can also actually be about collapsing in some ways. I remember one time that I was sitting and I was noticing that my mind was getting quieter and quieter. And I was thinking, oh, this is pretty good, getting tranquil. My body was upright, felt at ease. And suddenly this strong thought of desire came through my mind. And I felt my body literally sag. It was like the desire sapped the uprightness that I had in my spine. And it kind of caved in. It was kind of dramatic. That's why I continue to remember it. But it was sort of a clear example of the way these hindrances affect the energy of the body. Emotionally, there's a core of dissatisfaction with what's here. We wish that there were something different here, or that we want to hold on to what's here even if it's leaving. And the thoughts tend... there's so many thoughts that go with desire. You can hardly name them all, but planning, strategizing, justifying the need. We know what these are. So in kind of in more coarse form, this hindrance can appear as lust or fantasy, wanting to obtain certain sensual pleasures, certain foods, for instance, thoughts about desirable objects, etc. But it can be more subtle also. Even if we're relatively settled in, desire still appears in the mind as a sense of leaning slightly, a little bit of straining, pushing, holding. It can actually be kind of subtle. It can be quite subtle. And desire will be with us for a while. We'll have plenty of time to study it, let's say. And then the second hindrance is, in a way, the flip side of the first. It's usually called ill will, but more broadly it's various kinds of aversion. So, you know, hatred, anger, resentment, and it appears as pain or strong solidity in the body. We know this kind, but more subtly it can be just resistance. You know, don't want that. Or maybe a subtle holding in the body, like resisting the movement, the natural movement of mind and body and meditation. And the image for this is water being heated over a fire, bubbling and boiling. I think that's for the grosser form. So like anger can literally feel like energy that's boiling over in the body. These are meant to be very visceral images that we can connect with in order to help us feel the hindrances in the body. I find with this one, it's very helpful to notice the feeling tone that goes with it. Feeling tone being the simple quality of whether something is pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant. And aversion, as you might guess, it always has some kind of an unpleasant component of solidifying or creating a wall or pushing away. This is an unpleasant feeling, but interestingly it also has a pleasant component. The energy of righteousness, for instance, can be pleasant. And there can be a kind of strength in aversion. Some people get attached to the solidity that feels like strength that comes with anger, for example. The Buddha knew about this. He said that anger has a honeyed tip and a poisoned root. And this is another visceral image that we can feel. It's got that temptation on the tip. Ooh, that would be so... But we can feel underneath that it's coming from a place that's really not wholesome. Looking at feeling tone, like being aware of the feeling tone, can be a protection from developing ill will. I remember I was on retreat one time, a long retreat, and it was in the wintertime, and I was taking a nice warm shower, and the water suddenly went cold. I'm not sure what happened. But I was very settled on retreat, and I could have said something, some kind of expletive at that, but actually what my mind said was unpleasant. And I thought, wow, that would not have been my reaction always, but in the middle of retreat. So this can be a protection to pay attention to the feeling tone side. Aversion can easily multiply, because it's very easy to have aversion to aversion, once we've already got aversion in the mind. So, for example, we could feel resentment and then think, oh, that's not very spiritual. I need to get over this resentment. I need to make it go away. Well, we have aversion to our resentment then. So there's a lot to play with here. These first two are about wanting and not wanting, essentially. And each of them can be associated with a lot of discursive thinking that feels like it's going round and round and round, and it just seems to feed on itself. And when we notice that, it's very helpful to tune into the energetic feeling behind these thoughts, like Ying pointed to this morning. Then we have a sense of pulling the plug on the thinking. If the thinking is just feeding on itself, going round and round and round, as soon as we tune into the energy of that, it's like we've pulled out the rug a little bit. It doesn't mean it will stop immediately, because it has momentum, but we're not feeding it anymore, at least. And so as long as we're not directly involved in the content anymore, it can slowly wind down. So I recommend tuning into the energy dimension of both desire and ill will. And then once those are somewhat settled out, another pair of hindrances becomes prominent. And these ones are more about the balance of energy. So that's another reason to tune into the energy level, is that some of the other hindrances are associated with energy. So the next one is classically called sloth and torpor. And it's those various factors that contribute to sluggishness, sleepiness, laziness of mind. It's helpful to know that there's both physical and mental energy. And so we can have just sluggishness of the body, but also some laziness or sluggishness in the mind. And the image is water that's been covered over with water plants and algae. Does this feel like how your mind can be sometimes? So it's got this image. And again, we're not going to be able to see anything clearly in the water if it's got this muck on the surface. And it can be a little bit insidious because it masquerades as peace or calm, and it can actually be pleasant. I mean, this is one of the hindrances that is sometimes actually pleasant. You know, it's so nice. We're kind of peaceful, and pretty soon we're not very mindful. And the mind just drifts along, and it's really not very present. This is starting to succumb to this hindrance. So in this thought of physical energy and mental energy, it's helpful to know that on retreat, both of these can shift. You know, we may have worked out in our daily life how to balance our physical and mental energy so that we can be generally awake throughout the day, do our work, get enough exercise, get enough sleep, et cetera. And then you come on retreat, and some of those rules don't apply anymore. Like you may have discovered by this far into the retreat that it's helpful not to eat quite as much. Sometimes if we eat too much, it just messes up the energy in the system. We don't need as much, quite as much food with the level of activity we're doing here. You may also find that you don't need to sleep quite as much because of the gathering of the mind and the mindfulness that we have. There's kind of less dissipation of energy in the mind, so we may not need the same number of hours as we think we do. So part of this is about learning to adjust our expectations, our understandings of how the mind and body can work that can help us work with these hindrances. Some of the issues with energy are based on belief about what we think is necessary. So sort of in its grosser form, sloth and torpor is falling asleep, accompanied by feelings of heaviness or fogginess in the mind. But it can get more subtle than that also. There's a sort of a finer form of sloth and torpor that's called sinking mind where it's a mind that is actually getting calm, but there's a little bit too much calm compared to the amount of mental energy that we have. And so it just doles out a bit. It's not really that we're tired, but the mind has an imbalance between energy and concentration. There can also be at an even more subtle level kind of a tendency not to want to engage. Once the mind gets a little bit settled and we think it's nice to be settled, there's a way in which we can decide not to quite meet experience. But that's kind of pseudo calm when we're not actually connecting enough with experience to know what it is. So it has this bit of laziness in it, and if it's not tended to, the mind can fall into sloth and torpor. So it turns out that mindfulness is the best balancer. There are lots of strategies for sloth and torpor, sitting up straighter, opening the eyes, breathing more on the in-breath, etc. But it turns out mindfulness is actually pretty good but just being aware that the mind is sinking can in itself bring some energy. Being interested, oh sloth and torpor, I wonder what that's like. And then we can't see it because the interest we've generated counteracts the sloth and torpor. It's kind of interesting. So don't try to control too much these energy ones. I prefer to use mindfulness to balance them. So then the fourth hindrance is restlessness and worry. It's kind of the other side of this, the other side of the energy imbalance. For many people, many people will say this is the most prominent one. There's the restlessness, there's agitation, but it too can get subtle. The image for this one is water stirred by the wind, rippling, swirling, and churned into wavelets. So it's as if the surface of our mind has been stirred up. And I like that because it points out that restlessness is really a surface issue. It's because we're hanging out on the surface where this water easily gets churned up rather than allowing ourselves to settle down where it's naturally quieter farther under the water. So in its grosser form we would have anxiety, hyperactivity, incessant chattering. Sometimes the body feels like it wants to leap off the cushion. Gill is described as feeling like a ping pong ball moving through his body. Boing, boing, boing, you know, the energy like that. But, you know, more subtly there can be a fluttering of mental activity. Even when there aren't really a lot of thoughts going with it, the mind can just be a little bit fluttery feeling. Distractability, like easily knocked off balance. Basically restlessness is any tendency to move away from the present experience that we're having. We think something else would be better in any direction. That's restlessness. So in that way it's kind of the root of all the hindrances. Even before we have desire or aversion we have a sense of this present moment is not enough. That's restlessness. And unfortunately it's the last one to go. So we'll get to know it pretty well. But sometimes I think about a quote from the monastery within the book, The Monastery Within, Your problems will not be solved, they will be dissolved. And I think with all the hindrances it's important to remember this. It's not that we need to work on them and figure them all out and overcome them in some heroic way. They'll be dissolved through mindfulness, through working with them, through patience. So these energy level ones is something that we're going to do throughout our practice. The energy related hindrances, you know, actually calling them hindrances, is actually just the surface level. I'm going to talk more in a moment about balancing energy as a support for samadhi. But first I want to talk about the fifth hindrance, which is the hindrance of doubt. Doubt, doubt. We doubt ourselves, the practices, the teachers, the sangha, the path. So much doubt. But what's interesting is that we often don't doubt the doubt. First of all, we believe the doubt. That's part of the hindrance, that we believe it. But probably the hardest thing about doubt is that it's hard to see. You know, we have this doubt and we're doubting and then we engage with the content of those thoughts. And we worry about, we actually worry about this or that, as opposed to stepping back and saying, oh, this is the hindrance of doubt. We don't simply see it. Doubt is a normal occurrence on the path. Believing the doubt is the problem. That's the hindrance to concentration and wisdom. So the water image on this one is water that is turbid, unsettled, muddy, or placed in the dark. So once again, we have this not being able to see very clearly because of the hindrances. That's what they do. They all obscure our vision in some way. So in this grosser form, we have lots of questions, lots of discursive thinking. Doubt has its own internal logic that goes around and around and around. And it can actually sometimes masquerade as wisdom. That's the challenge with doubt, is that it explains in very cogent language why we probably shouldn't be practicing, why it's bad for us, why we can't do it, why we have all these issues that need to be solved before we're going to be able to sit. That's all doubt, actually, but it sounds like wisdom. So we have to be very careful. This is a very insidious one. And then at a more subtle level, doubt can just be a feeling of wavering, not sure where to place our trust, not sure how to practice with a new situation. It happens on this path that we keep moving into unfamiliar territory in the mind. Some of you may have found some territory in your mind so far that you already haven't been to before. And then there can be doubt, well, how do I deal with that? What is this? So that little wavering, and if we meet that with fear, it actually stimulates the hindrance of doubt. But if we meet it more with confidence, as we've talked about, it's less likely that doubt will arise. Remember that the most basic form of faith that I talked about on Monday is the willingness to meet experience. Willingness. So it's helpful with doubt to really feel it in the body, rather than letting the mental component run away. Where is it in the body, for example? Where is doubt? It's an uncomfortable feeling, so it's easy to see why we tend not to want to feel it physically, but it's good to do that if we can. And the good news is that this is the hindrance that is uprooted first, the very first one to go. So are these hindrances, and why are they called hindrances? Well, they do hinder concentration and wisdom, but that is only when they're operating unchecked. It's important, actually, that the hindrances can be noticed with mindfulness, and while they're being noticed at that moment, they are not hindering. So if you are aware of ill will, what you have is awareness. You're not only having ill will, right? So I talked earlier about, I asked the question, what does it mean to be free from the hindrances? I would suggest it doesn't mean that they're entirely gone. It's more that we're free from their influence. That's the place to start, to be free from their influence, free from their hindering effect. As we get more familiar with the hindrances in our practice, they all start to look or feel the same. Using our image of a raindrop coalescing, all the hindrances feel like agitation, or they feel like a dispersing of energy that works against the coalescing of the raindrop. Or they all feel like the dulling of an otherwise clear view. That way a fine mist is harder to see through than a clear drop of water. So it's important to see the hindrances this way, because then we become less enamored with them. A lot of practice is that we are enamored with the hindrances. We're not actually willing to let go of them at some level. So, you know, we feel like they're cozy and normal. They feel like me. And then we believe that they're necessary and useful. It can be surprising to discover the degree of commitment that we have to our desire, ill will, sluggishness, agitation, and doubt. Okay, so let's turn now to... Let's turn back to our raindrop that we're gathering. So we have... Let's say we now have little raindrops, droplets, and they're beginning to form, and they're going to come together in our cloud into bigger drops. So if two little drops are coming toward each other without enough energy, they might evaporate before they connect. Or if they're really, really slow, they might kind of bounce off each other. The surface tension of the water will be stronger, and they'll just bounce. On the other hand, if they're coming too fast, they'll collide and splatter into just more little droplets. So we can see that there are some conditions. They have to meet with just the right energy if they're going to combine into a bigger drop. So in meditation practice, as the mind gets more settled, there's a need to balance the level of samadhi with the level of energy. So not all issues with energy are about the hindrances. They're not all about sloth and torpor or restlessness. They can be really actually deep practice issues. There's a story in the suttas about a monk named Sona, who was a very diligent practitioner. And he had a lot of energy and dedication and perseverance. That was kind of his way of being. And he did so much walking meditation that his feet began to bleed. And this was discouraging for him. And so he began to wonder if he should give up practice because he was trying so hard, but it wasn't fruitful. I mean, his feet were bleeding. He wasn't awakened. You can awaken with bleeding feet, by the way, but his feet were bleeding instead of awakening. So as a layperson before he ordained, he had been skillful at playing an instrument called the vina. And the Buddha used this to help teach him. So he has a little conversation with him. And he says, what do you think, Sona? When you were still a layperson, weren't you a good player of the vina? Well, yes. And when your vina strings were tuned too tight, was it resonant and playable? No. And when your vina strings were tuned too slack, was it resonant and playable? No. But when the vina strings were tuned neither too tight nor too slack, but fixed with an even tension, was it resonant and playable? Yes, it was. And so the Buddha says in the same way, Sona, when energy is too forceful, it leads to restlessness. And when energy is too slack, it leads to laziness. So, Sona, you should apply yourself to energy and serenity. Find a balance of the faculties and learn the pattern of this situation. So more subtle imbalances of energy are actually what lead to the hindrances. So when energy is too forceful, that's what creates the hindrance of restlessness. When energy is too slack, that's one of the ways that we can encounter sloth and torpor. And then Sona was asked to learn the pattern of this, meaning that he should investigate more carefully how energy works in his mind and body. And then balance that and go from there. And according to the sutta, he did that, and he did become an arahant. So it has a happy ending. So it's a little bit like this game of mind ball, right? We have to make effort, but it has to be balanced and relaxed effort. So there's another useful image used here also in the teachings. It's an image of a chariot, and in this case it represents something like the mind being drawn along the path. So the chariot is being drawn by horses, and the horses are in pairs. And one of the pairs is said, named to be energy and concentration, energy and samadhi. And so you can imagine that the first thing we want is for the horses to be somewhat equal in strength, right? If you have a big, strong, powerful horse and a little weak one, that's not going to work for pulling the chariot evenly. So you find two horses that are pretty balanced in order if they're going to be paired up to pull the chariot. But then in addition, once we have them equal, we would actually want them to be strong. We want them to be strong ones. We could pair two weak ones, and that would pull the chariot in a balanced way, but not as effectively as if they were strong, right? So the analogy here is that our level of samadhi is like the size of the raindrop, and the energy level is like the speed of the drops that are traveling. And so we have an analogy here for how we can gradually increase the size of the drops by tuning the conditions so that small drops can combine at first and get a little bit bigger. And then once they're bigger, then bigger drops can combine to get even bigger. And gradually we step up the energy and the samadhi together in a way that they're balanced. So we have a mind that has a lot of energy and a lot of concentration at the same time. So we have the energy balanced. We have mindfulness that we're including some degree of continuity of mindfulness. And then we have all those earlier factors that we discussed this week. Confidence, gladness, joy, tranquility, happiness. And when we have all of those kind of in a mix, then samadhi emerges naturally. These are the conditions for it. And we have fully formed raindrops. Our raindrop is gathering nicely into a smooth ball. So we can talk now then about the experience of samadhi. And it turns out that water is also a great metaphor for how samadhi is experienced. How are we going to recognize samadhi as it emerges in our mind and body? Some people experience going into concentration as going underwater. Things get quieter, stiller. There's that feeling of sinking down into the swimming pool, say. And then coming out of concentration can be like surfacing. And suddenly there's light and sound, more happening. And the sutas offer us a number of water-based images that relate to states of concentration. One of them is water. The water is a unifying agent that binds together a ball of bath powder or maybe flour. I don't know if we use bath powder anymore, but flour, say, for making dough into kind of a smooth state. And the analogy is like working breath energy through the body to be settled and connected. So it's a nice way that water is a connecting force in our system. And then another image is a very calm lake that has water welling up from an inner spring on the bottom of the lake. So it doesn't need rain. It doesn't need rivers coming in. It just has this underground spring bubbling up. And that can be like when the mind becomes internally settled and tranquil, such that it doesn't need outside conditions for its settledness, for its happiness, for its joy. It's generating that internally. And this is also something that begins to come as the mind gathers. Another image is a pond that has lotuses growing in it. And the understanding is that the lotuses grow up and bloom entirely under the water. There are lotuses that do it that way. And so you can imagine being one of those lotuses, and it's surrounded on all sides by cool, refreshing water. And the pond is very still. And there's a way that samadhi has this kind of feeling also of immersion. So the language says that we would allow the pleasure and good qualities of samadhi to drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there are no parts unpervaded by the pleasure and good qualities of samadhi. So it's clear that we're meant to soak. We're meant to soak as we develop all these qualities that we're talking about this week, maybe like standing out in the rain and just letting it soak us. So the sutas are unambiguous, that samadhi is beneficial and onward leading. And it's good to know that these start occurring on the path, even as we're moving toward having fuller experiences of samadhi. We definitely do not need a deep state of concentration to start feeling the benefits that come from samadhi. So many of us are already, maybe already experiencing some of these. I'll just name a few of them. And I'll start actually with one that is not named in the sutas. It's more of a Western way of saying it, which is that samadhi is very healing. Actually, this is probably the closest equivalent to what the Buddha offered in terms of emotional healing. It smooths out the rough spots in the mind, some of the rifts between the body and the mind. And if that were all it did, that would already be really good. But there's actually even more than that. And samadhi strongly supports insight. It's a huge support for insight. This is from the sutas. Without the samadhi that is peaceful, sublime, gained through tranquilization, and attained to unification, that one should enter and abide in full liberation. That cannot be. So that's pretty strong. It's a clear statement. It makes sense that samadhi is essential for awakening. It's the eighth step of the Eightfold Path, as we mentioned earlier. But to be clear, it's just that some kind of samadhi is essential, some kind of wise samadhi. Again, we don't need to experience really deep, really clear states of absorption or anything like that to start to have insights and to start to have the benefits from samadhi. So it strongly supports insight. And then also we find that samadhi reduces the attraction to sense pleasure. So what happens is we find a deeper form of pleasure and happiness. Once we feel the joy and happiness that don't come from sense pleasures, the appeal of coarser pleasures is greatly reduced. And so it's not that we won't enjoy them. It's that we won't as easily get attached to them. So we'll find, this is from the suttas, this is the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace. I say this kind of pleasure, I say of this kind of pleasure, that it should be pursued, that it should be cultivated, and that it should not be feared. How about that? The Buddha says that it's a kind of pleasure that should be pursued and cultivated. Who says Buddhism is against pleasure? But it has to be this kind of pleasure that we're talking about here, the joy and the happiness that emerge on the path. And then also samadhi fortifies the mind so that it will be able to have the deeper insights. Until we have strong enough equanimity and non-clinging, it can be unsettling if our perception starts changing, if our experience starts getting quite different. Some of you are reporting that your body feels different in meditation than you expect, or things are happening in the mind that are new for you. This is all very normal on the path. And samadhi provides kind of a ballast so that we're able to experience things that are unusual, kind of a sure foundation for the deeper experiences on the path. Richard Shankman, who is a teacher of samadhi practices, sums it up this way. The concepts of letting go and non-clinging are simple. Our conditioning and habits of mind are strong, though, and it is so easy for us to get caught over and over again in our daily lives. Understanding conditioning is a necessary first step, but it is not enough. We must find a way to recondition our minds, and ultimately free ourselves from conditioning altogether. It is through the power of a sustained, concentrated attention that the fruits of meditation practice are realized. Samadhi plays an essential role. So we can remember that samadhi is a resultant. As I said, we don't do it directly, exactly, but we can practice all the conditions. And the list that we're discussing this week is, I would venture to say, not quite linear. We've talked about them in a linear way, and the order is not arbitrary, but really they interact while they're being cultivated. So sometimes the later ones, which depend on the earlier ones, they feed back and strengthen the earlier ones. Like, for example, experiencing tranquility might allow confidence to grow, which then fuels another round of the sequence. So it may be that for some of you, faith and love of the Dharma are very prominent, and on this retreat your heart is gathering around this growing trust and love of the Dharma. Or perhaps there's a delight and joy that you haven't experienced before, that seems to come from within. It's very different from a kind of a Pollyanna approach, or deciding to have experiences of bliss because they're more spiritual. This kind of joy and delight are deep and authentic forms of joy that bubble up internally. Or maybe you're feeling the most settled that you've ever felt. Maybe it's the tranquility. Maybe it's even a little bit disconcerting to be this calm. You're realizing perhaps that there are many more channels of knowing and feeling available when the mind is calm. What parts of your heart and mind might not even be used in your life because you're always caught up in agitation and achievement and doing. When we settle we feel, oh, it's so much more sensitive. There's so much more here. Or perhaps you're touching a form of happiness that's not so dependent on how things are. Happiness amid pain. Happiness for no reason at all. Just coming from the heart of peace. So we're assembling all these conditions to have a good healthy rain. And when they all come together it's kind of like a gift. The samadhi comes almost like a gift. Like rain. And the thing about rainwater is that it runs down to the ocean. So these factors can unfold over many months or many years of practice. This week we're honing and strengthening all of them a little bit. And may it be fruitful. It's all fruitful. So thank you.
