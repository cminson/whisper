 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. This week we've been looking at seven ways of letting go. Often, maybe in our practice, we would pose a question like, how do I let go of impatience? Something like that. In such a case, then these different methods are useful actions to start practicing with. We let go by doing a certain practice without expectation, maybe without impatience. Then the letting go can come about. We don't really do the letting go, but there are things we have to do in order for it to come about. Sometimes it's enough just to see, just to notice if our mind is headed into dukkha or not. Sometimes what we see is that we need to actively restrain something. We're going too far or we're getting compulsive in some way. Over time, we'll feel less and less compulsion around that if we make the effort to restrain a little bit. It just becomes weaker and then someday it lets go. That's what we talked about so far. Today we have a pair. We have letting go by using and letting go by avoiding. Those might sound like they contrast quite significantly. They're even opposites. That's part of the art. This week, this series is called The Art of Letting Go. Part of the art is knowing which thing is going to be the best. Let's talk through each of these. What does it mean to let go by using? In the text, this refers mostly to the requisites. Those are the things that we need, like food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. As lay people, we may also need some kind of transportation, some kind of communication, these basics of life. These are the aspects of life that are not going away. Here we see clearly that letting go does not mean getting rid of. Letting go does not mean getting rid of. We're not going to stop eating. But we do need to develop, for example, a relationship with food that doesn't include craving and clinging. That doesn't include dukkha. The Buddha recommends that we explicitly practice with the aspects of life that we can't avoid using. As you might imagine, a lot of the energy in this one goes around food, the requisite that we often have the most attachment to. There are a lot of practices we can do to work with our relationship to eating. It's not always just that we're doing too much or we need to restrain, like the previous one. There can be all kinds of subtle things tied in with our relationship to food. We may have some aversion to having certain kinds of food that we should be having more of. Who knows? So don't go in with expectations. But here are some sort of popular ones. There is a practice of doing what's called the eight precepts for laypeople. And one of them is to not eat after the midday meal. So we would just have two meals that day. And in Asia, at least often, the people will do this on the full moon day and half moon day and sometimes even the quarter moon. So kind of once a week, but at least once a month, they would have a day where they just have the morning meal and then something in midday and then wait until the next dawn. And there's a way of letting go of our busyness with food when we do that, just to see what that's like. We may feel hunger, of course, and we can learn that that's okay. We can be with that for a few hours. And when we can do that with relative mental ease, which might take a little practice, then we find over time that we're less controlled by our appetite. We're less led around and our appetite is not as compulsive for us. So that's one possibility is to kind of play around with whether or not we're being controlled by her belly. And then there's also deliberately eating food that we think that we like or that we think that we dislike. And we all have foods like that where there's one where we just think, oh, yeah, I love that one. And then there's the other one is like, I haven't liked that one for 25 years, maybe my whole life, you know. And it's not a matter of having an allergy or anything. It's just, you know, we don't care for it. And so it can be interesting to deliberately eat each of those foods and really watch instead of just going with the like or the dislike, the kind of major feeling tone that comes with it, actually watch what's going on in the mind. Like notice where does that feeling arise from? How long does it last? You know, if I take a bite of something I don't like, is it just instantly and uniformly unpleasant for the entire time? And, you know, or is there like variations in that? When does it come on? Can I redirect my attention such that it's not really as problematic? And again, this is about developing a healthy relationship with different kinds of foods such that we're not as controlled and led around by the dukkah and, you know, and craving that arise with it. It's an interesting exercise. It won't hurt you, really. It's also interesting to get just in general very intimate with the process of eating. So, you know, normally eating is completely focused on loading the fork, getting it into the mouth. And then you get that first hit of what it tastes like and you chew on it for a while. And then as soon as that gets a little bit less interesting, you know, because the taste does fade, we're busy loading the fork again before we've even swallowed. And it's interesting to watch that process, like how is the mind choosing where to put the attention, you know, when the flavor fades out, very quickly the mind gets bored and moves on to something else. And, you know, we can notice that the texture changes. It's not as good once it gets all mushy. It's kind of not as appealing. And so then we're back to loading the fork. And if we get very intimate with that process, then we start to see it just as a process. It's a necessary process. We have to feed this body. But, you know, can we change our relationship to the different aspects of it, such that it's not so there's not so much pushing and pulling and little instances of the mind grabbing on and pushing away, because that's Dukkha, actually at a subtle level. So try it out. There are also things we can do around clothing, another area because clothing is related to our image. And that's an area where we have a lot of attachment. So we see that these requisites tie in to aspects of mind where we have a lot of clinging and craving and identification. So it can be interesting to deliberately wear unusual clothes. There's a class I teach about renunciation. And on the day that I talk about being aware of our identity, I often wear a dress to teach that class. And this is unusual clothing for me. I do own a couple, but they're not my regular wardrobe. And so it's kind of fun for me to put that on and see how it feels and see people's responses or non-responses. Try it out. I remember one time suggesting that someone who dresses rather fashionably as part of their practice to go out wearing old mismatched clothes and just see how it was to save the grocery store wearing something that they felt very uncomfortable in. I don't know if they did it or not, but it can be fun. So in general, we would, you know, there are also kind of wise reflections that monastics do around using things. We can do that too, just being aware of why and how we're using the requisites of life. Are they just supports for us to be practicing or are we bringing in extra craving and cleaning? And we can also use various non-material aspects of life. We would recommend it using conceit to overcome conceit, for example, which is something like skillful imitation. You know, we compare ourselves. That's what conceit is. It's a comparison. It's either better or even worse or even equal. And so we, but if you want to use this quality of mind in your practice, instead of just saying, OK, I'm going to try to not do any conceit, that's very difficult. So instead, we compare ourselves to someone that we admire. Compare yourself to someone who's more skilled in humility or unselfishness or generosity and then aim to become more like that. So we can use the self to overcome attachment to self in a sense. So there's a lot of good ways to use the parts of life that we're not going to be able to change immediately, at least. And then there's also avoiding the opposite. So this comes with a quote in the in one of the texts that says, what taints should be abandoned by avoiding? Here, a practitioner wisely reflecting avoids, this is ancient India, a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a cesspit, a sewer. So these are things that are actual physical dangers and that sort of common sense. We can avoid getting ourselves into dangerous or unhealthy situations that might get us agitated. But it also goes on to say that we should avoid associating with bad friends or behaving in ways that might harm our good standing in our community, as others might think ill of us then, in a sense. And maybe you think that doesn't sound very Dharma, Darmic, you know, thinking about how we appear socially. But it does matter in that if we don't think about it, we can end up being kind of enslaved to our relational life. Goodness knows people really go overboard on social media into avoiding looking bad and trying to look good. And there's a lot of do good around that. So we can be a little bit more wise about that and understand, okay, I don't need to impress everybody on Facebook, but it would be nice to associate with good friends and be in good standing in a community that I care about for the simple reason that we're nourished by that and we thrive when we're at ease with people who share our interests and values. So, someone about avoiding goes kind of deeply into things that are dangerous for us physically dangerous relationally dangerous. And it can even allow us to care for others if we do that carefully. But if we look, we see that we don't always avoid what we could, we run into things that we could have avoided. And sometimes we avoid for a while, and then we can use. So remember that our pair for today is using and avoiding. Until we have enough capacity of attention we might need to stay away from things or limit them. And then when we're stronger, we can go into them and learn to be free with them, and even learn from them. So, I remember a friend of mine went on a long meditation at IMS. And for what for the beginning part of the retreat she would come right at the end of the meal, and, you know, get her food right at the end so she didn't have to see anybody in line and then she would take it to her room to eat, which you're allowed to do there don't do that at IRC. After a while she you know first she was just avoiding she was just avoiding contact and she found that supportive, but at some point she didn't find it supportive anymore and she felt like it would be more supportive to go and be with the group and see the reactivity that came up in her mind. And so she started being able to use the conditions of the retreat in order to further her practice so it can change. I also have heard a story from Ajahn Amaro who said that he used to be very upset. He's a typha forest monk at a monastery here. Or I guess now he's in England, but this was when he was here, is that he used to get very upset if people misinterpreted him at meetings at his monastery. And so, you know, he would find that somebody misrepresented what he had said or had misunderstood it and interpreted it wrong. He would get angry about that and he'll go to great effort to be sure that everybody understood his views, and you'd have to talk with everybody to make sure that they really got it. And then he realized that he was just making a huge self out of being seen perfectly in everyone's eyes. So he stopped trying, he let people state his ideas incorrectly. He let people take credit for things he had suggested. And he felt what it was like to be seen as stupid or harsh when others interpreted his words that way. And he said it was a great lesson in emptiness. But he did that from a position within this monastery of having a good social standing, and from an internal space of having enough mindfulness and attention that he didn't get triggered by having these insults to his identity. So there are basically no taints, vexation or fever if you don't feel attached to yourself. So using and avoiding. There's a role for discernment and discovering when to do each one of those. They're different. And what is the criterion. The one that we talked about on Monday are wholesome states increasing and unwholesome states decreasing or are unwholesome states increasing and wholesome states decreasing. So check it out. Maybe we're starting to get a sense now of the art that's involved in letting go. So, that's it for today and we'll continue on. Thanks.
