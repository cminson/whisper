Saddhā (1 of 5):  Faith  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 16, 2020  
 
 
I’d like to give  five short talks on five different aspects of 
saddhā , usually translated into English as  ‘faith.’ 
Saddhā  doesn’t translate naturally into the English word 
‘faith.’  There are other choices people like. Some 
people don’t relate to , or are actually troubled by  the 
word ‘faith .’ I want to talk about five different aspects of 
saddhā  if I can use ‘faith’ provision ally. The five 
translations will be faith, confidence, conviction, trust, 
and then acceptance. These are progressive in a sense. 
As practice deepens, we go through these different 
stages of faith.   
 
The way that saddhā  is used in the teachings of the 
Buddh a is really a provisional faith. It is a faith that we 
believe in something enough to try it out for ourselves, 
to engage in the practice initially, to be inspired by 
something.  
 
Having something that inspires and gladdens us then 
motivates us to begin engaging in practice.  As we begin 
practicing and have some experience with practice, that 
can give birth to confidence – confidence in our ability to 
practice, confidence in the value of practicing. Now, part of the fuel for practicing is not in the inspiration that 
comes from the outside , but confidence that has begun 
growing inside.  
 
As we practice further, confidence gets transformed into 
conviction. Confidence may  be more provisional. But 
conviction is a certainty: “This works. I’m with this .”  
 
With time and more experience, th is conviction can lead 
to a more profound level of trust. We trust the practice. 
We trust the path. More than anything else, w e trust the 
possibilities of freedom that come with the practice.  
 
With that trust can come a particular form of acceptance  
– a deep acceptance of presence  – to be free , and to 
live in the world without clinging, resistance , greed, 
hate, or delusion. It i s a deep acceptance that , “This is 
right; this is the way to live. ” It is not always easy to 
accept. There are internal and social forces that give the 
impression that we have to worry, to be angry, to want 
to have things , and to be attached.   
 
These are t he five steps of saddhā : faith, confidence, 
conviction, trust, and acceptance.  
 
The first one , which  I call ‘faith,’ I like a lot. Faith, more 
than the other words, is heartfelt. I associate it with what 
we are dedicated to do wholeheartedly, bring ing our 
whole heart, our whole self into something we have faith in. Some people are troubled by the word ‘faith’ 
because it implies that we have to believe a creed. 
Sometimes in English the word ‘faith’ is used to imply 
having faith i n a set of teachings. This can be 
interpreted as blind faith, acceptance  that is  
unexamined, unreflective. But I find it very interesting 
that the word ‘believe ’ in English is a European word 
(maybe from a Germanic source) that originally meant 
to love something. It's what we love – as opposed to 
what we think now , or what we believe.  
 
Where did our love go? When we look at Buddhism and 
Buddhist practice, the faith that is evoked is not so 
much a belief in a creed , but rather a love for a 
possibility of a life not rooted in freedom and 
compassion,  but a life that is flowing from sources within 
of freedom and compassion.  
 
That kind of faith  – falling in love with something or 
valuing something  – can come in many ways. It can 
come from encountering Buddhist teachings , when 
those teachings really speak to us. For some people, 
the first time they hear Buddhist teachings, it seems like 
it’s the first time they have heard someone address 
suffering at its roots, and that offers some possibili ty of 
freedom  – of resolving the suffering. Some people feel a 
big, “Aha! Yes!” They are so delighted to have 
discovered these teachings because no one  before  in 
their life had taken this direct, honest look at the depth of suffering in th is world.  
 
Sometimes the inspiration, the sense of love , the 
delight, the heart’s attraction to this practice comes from 
meeting someone who embodies some of the qualities 
that seem right or resonate in some deep way. This 
speaks to us!  
 
When I was new to meditation  and met other 
practitioners, their way of being in the world was so 
inspiring to me. Some of what inspired me was a certain 
ordinariness , which  was extraordinary  – an ordinariness 
in which  there was freedom, ease, a deep acceptance , 
allowing this life. Rat her than resisting or fighting things, 
it was a kind of naturalness in what we do  – like life 
living through us.  
 
Sometimes people come to Buddhism, not through faith, 
but rather out of desperation. Their suffering is so great  
that nothing else has worked . So they think they ’ll try 
this, “There is the claim that this practice works . And 
people who do it seem to be happy or at peace. Nothing 
else makes sense to me , so I will try it. ” There’s not 
much faith in that kind of desperation. It’s almost like 
giving up. But then, at some point, that giving up gives 
birth to some kind of change, movement, letting go, and 
relaxation , which  is meaningful. And that gives rise to 
faith: “Oh, t his works.”  
 This happened to me. There was a time in my early 
years when I kind of crashed out , and reached rock 
bottom. I kind of just mostly gave up. Now, many years 
later, I can say that the giving up was so thorough that I 
let go of so much. Then, what fol lowed from that deep 
letting go was something I started to have faith in : “Oh, 
this is the path. This is important. This works. ” 
 
Then,  we can believe in that. The heart sings to it. The 
heart feels nourished , satisfied , or inspired by it.  
 
So, saddhā , as faith, is partly what we can be inspired 
by, what motivates us to begin our practice,  and to 
engage in our practice when everything else feels 
difficult. Hopefully over  time, there is something that 
resonates with our h eart’s capacity to love  – to feel an 
openheartedness about where we want to totally put 
ourselves  into something .  
 
I hope that people who are involved in Buddhist practice  
– whether in meditation , or the ethical aspects,  or the 
wisdom parts, or any part o f it – will reflect on what their 
heart has faith in , or what their heart believes in. What 
does your heart love? In that sense, what do you 
believe in?  
 
I love the expression , “What do you believe in ?” 
because we use that for people. We can say that we 
believe in people. “I really believe in you ” is a powerful statement. It means that we have confidence in 
somebody. We see value in who they are. We feel that 
their direction in life is a good one. We valu e it. So, to 
believe in someone is a wonderful expression  of faith.  
 
As you engage in Buddhist practice, I hope that you 
believe in yourself. I hope that you have faith in yourself. 
And I hope that that involves some love for yourself, 
some inspiration an d motivation to really show up for 
yourself, to really be present in some deeper way  – in 
some way in which faith  or awareness  is an upwelling 
from within  as much as it is a practice of mindfulness.  
 
May it be that you believe in yourself, that you have f aith 
in yourself. And may that be channeled into the moment 
to moment engagement in meditation, mindfulness, 
compassion, kindness – in all aspects of Buddhist 
practice.  
 
May faith be your companion , your friend , and your 
support as you go forth with the p ractice.  
 
Thank you all very much.
