 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. I'll start by arriving here in the body, connecting to how you are in this moment. What's here? It's kind of taking stock, taking inventory in a way, maybe checking in, scanning through the body and seeing is there tension, is there ease. And then scanning through the body, maybe starting with the head and face, checking in, is there tension and might it be able to be relaxed, understanding that relaxation is such a support for being aware, being present with our experience. Sometimes it is possible to incline towards relaxation just with the noticing, oh there's some tension here, maybe it can soften, maybe it can relax. But that kind of invitation, maybe, maybe it can soften rather than kind of a demand to soften, but just what's possible now, can there be some relaxation of the body, of the neck, of the shoulders, the arms and hands. Checking in to the chest and upper back, the whole upper torso, the ribcage, the muscles around the ribcage, maybe there can be some relaxation there, softening. Maybe there can be a softening across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back. Just becoming aware of those areas, perhaps there can be a natural inclination to soften. Maybe the hips can soften, maybe even inside the hip sockets, maybe that area can soften a little bit. The legs, the feet. Sometimes too there can be a softening inside, in the core of the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the area around the heart can soften and relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. Again, as an invitation, kind of dropping in the possibility and see what happens. This exploration of relaxation, of being aware of the body and seeing if there can be a softening, this is being aware and being mindful of experience. It also supports our capacity to be more naturally aware of just what's here. So now in this moment, just checking in, what's here? How is the body? Are there any obvious sensations in the body that the attention is kind of drawn to? Pressure, vibration, pulsing, tingling? Or maybe there's sound happening. Sound in your space, outside where you are, the sound of my voice. As too we can just be aware of. If we can connect to relaxation of body, relaxation of mind, it can support our capacity to be available in a non-reactive, non-judgmental way to whatever is happening. Some things may be pleasant, some things unpleasant. But just can there be a sense of connection, a little bit of curiosity? What's it like to be a human being with this experience of body, of mind? Maybe we can also be aware of what's happening in our minds, moods, emotions, perspectives, a sense of tension or ease, restlessness or saddledness, sleepiness or alertness. Again, it is possible to be aware even of sleepiness, even of restlessness. Can we explore this non-judgmental awareness? What's it like to be in this body and mind with restlessness or with sleepiness or with saddledness or with alertness? Thank you. Aware of experience in the present moment. This may be possible to just be in a kind of a flow of changing experience or the attention might gravitate towards one particular experience for a while, such as the breath or sound or a sense of the body sitting here. Aware of what is natural for the mind to be aware of in this moment, kind of natural for the mind to connect to. When we touch into this capacity for non-judgmental awareness, sometimes we may be kind of oriented towards what that awareness is knowing. Maybe it's aware, maybe there's awareness of some tension in the body or restlessness in the mind. And a kind of a broadening of the attention that might be interesting to check into is not just the awareness of whatever the mindfulness knows, but how does it affect the experience to know that you're aware? Sometimes when we know that we're aware of attention or restlessness, it can be kind of a settling. It's like, oh yeah, that's what's happening. So there can be some ease that's connected with it, kind of like recognizing what's the experience of being aware of something, even something challenging. Maybe we can taste a flavor of spaciousness, a little bit of ease or a blossoming of a reactivity, maybe some interest and a sense of energy, connection with experience. Being aware of experience. This is a wholesome quality. It's a beautiful quality and it brings along other beautiful qualities that begin to flower and grow while we practice. We can begin to taste the flavor of the delight of the interest of the energy connected with being here. Sometimes, sometimes we can touch into that. And sometimes what's more obvious is whatever is happening. And so just opening to how it is for you in this moment, aware of whatever is most natural for the mind to connect with in this moment. And knowing that the mind wanders, natural habit of mind. Just reconnecting with this quality of being aware when it returns. Awareness is back. What's here? What's obvious now? Thank you. Thank you.
