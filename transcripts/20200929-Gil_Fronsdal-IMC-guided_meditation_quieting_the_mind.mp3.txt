The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning. Good day, good afternoon, good evening.
And here we are. Just a little time to meditate.
And as an introduction to this meditation, I'd like to say that the focus,
especially within meditation, is not discovering, this is at least an early Buddhist meditation,
is not to discover who we are, but to discover what we're doing.
And in doing so, to discover what we don't need to do because it brings us suffering.
And so part of the reason to sit quietly and not do so much is to begin noticing much more carefully
than we usually do what we're actually doing.
Or what we're driven to do or want to do. So sitting quietly and not moving the body.
If you're brand new to meditation and never done it before, you might notice how much the body wants to move
and scratch itself or bolt or adjust itself, all kinds of things.
And then to learn for the body to be relaxed and at ease and not needing to move is a great blessing.
And the same thing with the mind. We sit down and we realize layers upon layers,
how compulsive the mind is to think, to want to do, to do things.
And nothing inherently wrong with that except that some of the things that the mind does bring suffering,
brings stress, brings distress.
And so start discovering what the mind is doing and to realize that another possibility
and that is that the mind doesn't have to do those things and the mind can get quieter and more peaceful
and let go of shed some of the activities of the mind that are not serving us at all.
And that opens the possibility of doing things in the mind that do serve us, that do benefit us and benefit the world.
So to discover what we're doing and that process also involves beginning to do very simple things that are more useful.
And one of those things to do is to be mindful.
And that's a kind of a doing, though in reference to how people usually are doing,
it can seem almost like you're not doing anything, just being receptive.
But it's a kind of a quiet thing of the mind, a silent listening of the mind, observing of the mind
that helps us to see what we're doing and what we might like to stop doing or let go of or allow to disappear.
So taking a meditation posture that allows your body to be both alert and also still.
And of course you can move a little bit during the meditation if that's important.
But the idea is to have a posture that relatively allows you to experience a physical stillness.
So to, on the exhale, to settle in, let go into some place within your body where you might feel more stability, more stillness,
as you exhale to relax your muscles of your body as a way of letting the body settle into more stillness.
Excuse me for my cough. More stillness.
And when the muscles are held or tense, that's a doing, it's an activity of the muscles.
To relax the muscles allows them to move to stillness, to less doing, maybe even to rest.
And to also relax the mind, the thinking activities, maybe by quieting the thinking or slowing it down,
maybe by slowing it down or quieting the thinking.
Maybe relaxing any mental tension or any tension around the forehead, temples, anything behind this forehead or within the skull.
There's an analogy that an active, agitated mind is like the waves, choppy waves on top of a lake.
And those, with time, those waves quiet down and the lake becomes still, flat, serene.
And in doing so, the surface becomes more see-through.
And someone standing on the shore can look down into the bottom of the lake and see the fish and the rocks and whatever's there.
Allow the mind to become quieter.
And perhaps that allows you to see, among other things, the impulses the mind has to do to act.
And maybe for these few minutes of meditation, you can trust that it's okay to do very, very little.
Trust, you know, so little you have to do mentally, figure out or think about or plan that it's safe and appropriate for these minutes to rest the mind for all things except just being aware of what is being mindful of breathing.
Maintaining a receptive awareness.
Not searching out for something, but allowing reality to show itself to you.
As if your job is to have the quiet, clear surface of the lake.
So what's in the lake will show itself to you.
In the body, in the mind, just here, mindful and perhaps being anchored, being connected to your breathing as a lifeline to the present moment.

If your mind is doing something, what would it be like to put that to rest, to relax?
Any extra doing beyond being mindful, being aware of what is.

And then as we come to the end of this sitting, I'd like to mention that one of the goals of Buddhist meditation is to not be overactive physically or mentally in such a way that there's no clarity of attention.
To not be overactive so we don't really know ourselves what we're doing clearly.
And not overactive so that we don't see and are attuned to the people around us in the world.
And in that way there's a little saying, be still and gaze upon all things kindly.
Be quiet and gaze upon all things kindly.
Just still enough, just quiet enough that we can be involved in the world in beneficial ways.
We know ourselves, we know the world, others, so that we have time and wherewithal to be in the world kindly, generously, friendly, maybe even happily.
And may it be that this practice we have of being mindful, this meditation practice today, will inspire us, motivate us to listen better, to pay more careful attention to others.
And to be more present for ourselves, that we can stay connected to our wellsprings of kindness, friendliness, generosity.
May it be that this practice that we do benefits the world through our kindness, our friendliness, our generosity, so that we live a life that expresses, may all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
