So perhaps I'll offer a slightly shorter reflection, guided reflection this evening. 
Just to remind you of the importance of relaxation. 
To set up the container for our practice. 
To point to the kind of three words or perspectives or tools, supports, maybe it's a good word, three supports for our practice no matter what kind of practice we're doing. 
Relax, receive and allow. 
Relaxation offers us a way in and is a condition that's very supportive for this very organic and natural capacity of mind we have to be aware of what's happening in the present moment. 
When the body and mind are relaxed very naturally, we are aware receiving what's happening. 
This receptivity doesn't take a lot of effort, it's more recognizing what's already happening. 
And yet if it's more comfortable for you to attune to a particular area of experience such as the breath, that's fine but see if there might be a way to explore an attunement to that area. 
And then receiving the experience, you attune to the breath. 
Just see how the breath wants to show up, how the breath wants to come to you. 
Receiving experience. 
If metapractice is your practice, if you're using the phrases and dropping in the phrases then see how those phrases are received in your system. 
Not trying to make anything happen but just seeing what's there already, receiving what's obvious. 
Or perhaps a more open awareness is more natural for you and you can just settle back and receive whatever is obvious. 
Relax and receive. 
And then exploring, allowing what is received to just be there without resistance or holding on. 
It's allowing what is already here, not fighting with what is already here, not being in conflict with what is already here. 
And if there is some resistance, maybe you can step back and know this thing is happening and there's resistance and maybe that can be allowed. 
It's allowing as a place of not being contentious with what's already here in the present moment. 
This non-contentiousness creates the conditions for not no response but a skillful response from wisdom, from compassion. 
And often, at least in our sitting practice, the wisdom response is to just open, open, open, open to what is here. 
Relax, receive and allow.
