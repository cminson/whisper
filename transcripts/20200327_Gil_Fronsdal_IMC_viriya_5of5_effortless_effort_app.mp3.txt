Viriya  (5 of 5) Effortless Effort  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 27, 2020  
 
 
I am continuing on the theme for this week : the energy , 
the effort factor of the Five Faculties . The last aspect of 
the effort faculty might be called “effortless effort. ” A 
time comes when what is carrying us in meditation or in 
our life is a very wholesome  and healthy  momentum, 
effort, engagement, aliveness, vitality. It doesn’t seem 
to be somethi ng we are making effort to do. In that 
sense , it is effortless from the viewpoint of our work  – 
but something is working.  
 
My analogy for this is from when I used to run a lot. 
When I began running, for the first fifty to hundred feet 
at least, signals wo uld come from my body basically 
saying , “Stop. Don’t do this. This is to o difficult. ” I just 
ran anyway , knowing that I didn’t have to listen to this. 
Some of it was that making that effort was just too 
unpleasant. But then, as I kept going and going, I wo uld 
get into the groove or the rhythm of running. And, at 
some point, it would feel like the running was effortless.  
 
The body was running. Running was running itself. It 
was a great joy. I’m sure I was expending a lot of calories, a lot of energy, but th e involvement, the 
harmony, the attunement, relaxing into it, the rhythm of 
it, was just effortless, as if it were happening on its own.  
 
I think a lot of activities can be that way. Maybe playing 
a sport or an instrument can feel that way , doing 
somethin g we enjoy or get really absorbed in doing. 
The same thing can happen in meditation when we give 
ourselves wholeheartedly to it, plac ing ourselves in the 
middle of our experience. “This is what we’re doing.” It’s 
not an easy task.  
 
Meditation is harder th an things that grab our interest , 
or are fascinating in and of themselves. But that is part 
of the benefit of meditation. We are discovering how to 
really be present and be here in a full, complete way 
without needing the extra help of fascinating things that 
bring us joy or satisfaction.  
 
Doing things that are dangerous can really engage us 
because there is just the right amount of danger.  But 
we’re being very simple and ordinary, working through 
all the different activities of  the mind  and heart  that get 
in the way of the full embodiment of just being here  in a 
simple way . Not chasing after our desires or running 
away from what we don’t want. Just here.  
 
It’s a difficult task , but to have that full embodiment in 
meditation , which is effortless effort,  seems like we’re just here. It  is a wonderful stage of meditation , and is 
satisfying  in and of itself. It creates a wonderful platform 
for deeper and deeper layers of letting go. If there’s 
something besides us that’s operating – if it’s effortless  
– then it begins coming clear that the ego, the self -
identity, the contraction around self, me being the 
agent, is not needed  as much. A nd we begin loosening 
up the tight grip that self has on us . This space of 
effortless effort can help  us relax and soften.  
 
The topic of effort this week has many perspectives. 
One interesting perspective is this ongoing process of 
letting go. With letting go , come benefits. Something 
arises. One could talk about what arises and comes into 
place in practi ce, but the end of the path in Buddhist 
practice is a very deep letting g o – release.  
 
It may be interesting to go back over these five days to 
see how each of these steps represents a kind of letting 
go. The initiating effort is letting go of something we are 
doing in order to start fresh , start new, here and  now. 
Even if we are just starting to meditate, we have to let 
go of some activities of the day  – stop looking at emails, 
for example .  
 
We let go of something in daily life  to sit down and  be 
here. Once we are here, the initiating effort is to let go 
of the stream of thinking we are caught up in that 
makes it impossible to really be present in a full way. Initiating effort is letting go of some degree of 
preoccupation.  
 
As we settle down  further, then the right endeavor 
aspect of effort comes when we can differentiate 
between what is healthy , wholesome,  and helpful to be 
involved in  and what is not. Then we let go of what is 
unhealthy and unwholesome. Even if there is not active 
pushing away  or active letting go, what we are letting go 
of is our clinging, our involvement. That may be 
enough. The thoughts might still be there , but we are 
holding them in a very broad mind and are not actually 
involved anymore. There’s a kind of letting go there .  
 
Then sometimes the wholesome things arise on their 
own, which get s to the third aspect of effort.  The third 
aspect is persistent effort  – persistent , relaxed effort. 
This is letting go of the things that come along that want 
to pull us out of the flow of the practice. It’s possible to 
notice a thought arise , and to be so attentive that you 
begin to see an interest in it , but the mind says , “No 
thank yo u.” And you stay in the flow of awareness.  
 
Another thought comes , and “No thank you. ” You stay 
in the flow of awareness. When I was really in the flow 
of awareness, at times I felt that a rubber band was 
attached to my thoughts. If I wandered off in my 
thoughts, the rubber band would get stretched , and 
then at some point, pull me right back into the present moment. And so it’s: “ Keep coming back, keep coming 
back ,” and this  involve s some form of letting go.  
 
And then this D harma energy starts to arise  – 
something else  starts  to carry us, to move through us. 
Then the letting go is of that interferes with that . Maybe 
letting go of the idea that I have to do it  – that it’s 
always up to me. Instead, we make space for 
something to move , and we let go of what crowds the 
space. We let go of the idea that I am in charge here. 
We a llow the Dharma energy to begin to move through  
us.  
 
Then, the effortless effort is the place where there can 
be a lot of letting go. Effortless effort is almost like a 
continuation of the Dharma energy that can arise.  
 
It can also be a place of equanimity, non -reactivity, non -
resistance, non -preference, non -attachment. We get a 
feeling for this equanimity and non -attachment that is 
very sensitive to the smallest , most su btle movement s 
of attachment. Allowing this to grow and flower involves 
even more letting go.  
 
At some point, the benefit of being in the stream of 
equanimity and effortless effort comes in the form of 
release  and letting go that  correspond to awakening i n 
Buddhism. It’s not something that we can do. We don’t 
say, “Now I’m going to be awake. Now I’m going to let go once and for all in a deep way. ”  
 
There has to be a lot of not -self, a lot of non -reactivity, a 
lot of not creating anything  – thinking about things, 
making a self , resisting anything – a lot of effortless 
effort, a lot of equanimity. A lot of letting go has brought 
us to th is point.  
 
An ancient analogy is that of a rope. Over time and 
weathering, the rope has gotten thinner and thinner , 
until only one little thread holds that rope together. A nd 
at some point that last thread just lets go. The last 
holding on of attachment lets go.  
 
Then effortless effort takes on a whole different quality. 
In a certain profound way , the psycho -physical system 
recognizes that nothing more needs to be done. No 
effort of a certain kind needs to be expended.  
 
In the effort to search for freedom, to move along a path 
to liberation  – we recognize a place within us where 
there is nothing to attain, nothing to do, nothing to be. 
There is a beautiful absence of so many things that 
crowd , limit, and propel us.  
 
We begin to recognize that within us is this  place of no 
effort. It’s a particular kind of place , which  is not 
lethargy, dullness, or inertia. No effort is needed. 
Nothing needs to be done. Nothing needs to be attained. Maybe initially it’s not a dramatic place , but it’s 
clear enough as a reference point. That too is a 
reference point to better and better recognize all the 
places where we still have work to do  – all the places 
where the practice still needs to unfold and grow.   
 
And t hen, we come back to initiating effort. We begin as 
beginners, starting over  – not trying to hold on to some 
greater or ideal state. We come back to  being a 
beginner again,  initiating effort – hopefully , the degree 
to which we let go  allows us to do that with greater 
equanimity, less self, greater ease, greater appreciation 
and joy at the very opportunity to make the effort to 
practice.  
 
We are very fortunate to have a practice, very fortunate 
to be able to make this effort.   
 
May it be that we can make this effort forever together , 
and find a wonderful way in which we all support this 
world to become a safer , happier , and freer  place for all 
beings.  
 
Thank you.  
 
 
Q & A  (14:15)  
 
For those of you who would like to stay on, I am happy to use the chat box to answer questions you have.  
 
Question: How much media do you consume about the 
virus?  
 
Answer: Actually I don’t do a lot. I may read two or three 
articles a day but I am certainl y not keeping up with how 
much would be useful to know. Maybe useful is not the 
right word. That I could know. I feel like I pick up plenty 
of what’s happening. I feel that I know enough to really 
be concerned and to have a lot of empathy and care for 
what  is going on in the world. I talk to people who are 
affected by all of the changes going on with the virus. 
It’s pretty dramatic what is happening all over the world. 
I am trying to find a balance between how much would 
be useful to know, both as a person , but also as a 
teacher who is responsive to a community of people 
who may be wanting some kind of relevant teaching at 
this time. Trying to find a balance with that,  versus the 
other activities I do  – a balance between the impact 
those have on me and how to stay balanced and not be 
consumed. I try to do the news in wise ways. I try to do 
it at times and places where it feels I can read the news 
in a balanced, relaxed way. I either take it in small 
dose s so that I can reflect on it and live with it , or I try to 
do it when my powers of reflection are strong.  
 
  
Question: Will we meet at 7 a.m. Pacific time this weekend?  
 
Answer: We are not going to meet Saturday and 
Sunday. My plan is to continue these 7  a.m. sittings and 
talks. We are doing a series now on the Five Faculties. 
We have covered the first two now. Next week I will talk 
about the five aspects of mindfulness.  
 
 
Question: Do we need to know the phase of effort at 
any given moment? If so, in what balanced way do we 
do that without getting caught up?  
 
Answer: That’s a great question. I think if your practice 
is sincere and you are really engaged and careful with 
devoted mindfulness  – making space, staying with the 
breath  – and you feel encouraged to do that, you don’t 
have to know where you are, how far you have gotten, 
measuring yourself. It will all unfold by itself. It will all 
reveal itself to you. There are some advantages 
sometimes to identifying where we are in practice 
because then we can o pen to that phase a little more 
fully, allow for it, appreciate it, value it. So there is value 
to it, and that’s why I am teaching this. But we have to 
be very careful not to try too hard , or spend a lot of time 
measuring ourselves. You want to be very pa tient with 
this practice. Perhaps if we had six days to do the effort, 
one of the efforts would have been patient effort.  
   
Question: What should I focus on when I am having a 
very difficult meditation session , and cannot quiet my 
mind or focus on the pre sent moment or breath at all?  
 
Answer: Yeah, that’s a common experience for all of us. 
What do we do then? There are a few things you could 
do. If the primary thing you want to do is keep 
developing mindfulness practice, you might just turn 
toward the very  difficulties you are having and let them 
be the focus of mindfulness. Not to let them be a 
distraction , but to let them become the meditation. Don’t 
try to quiet the mind , but do mindfulness of a noisy or 
busy mind. The breath does not have to be the subj ect 
of meditation. The present moment does. But now to be 
in the present moment with a busy agitated mind. 
Really feel the agitation. This is where mental noting 
can be helpful. The mind is out of control. You note, 
“Wow! This is a mind that is out of cont rol. Really 
active.” You can even say this gently to yourself until 
you pull yourself out of the entanglement with it. You 
step back and see, “Oh, this is what is happening.” 
What I do sometimes when my mind is really busy 
thinking and I can’t seem to sett le down, I’ll say to 
myself the word , ‘here.’ H -E-R-E. Just here. When I say 
‘here ,’ I open my awareness up to receive and 
recognize what is here. It’s very permissive, very 
allowing. I don’t have an agenda. Here. When  I’m so 
caught up in things, HERE open s things up just for a second. Then I’ll notice, “Oh, here is a mind that is out 
of control. Here is a mind that is troubled. ” And I’ll try in 
that moment to just stay and recognize it. I’m allowing 
myself to be the way I am , but stepping back and 
recogniz ing it. Here. And I’ll do it again. Here. I’ll to it 
repeatedly. Very permissive , but really recognizing what 
is there. After maybe five minutes of doing that, 
generally I begin to loosen the grip of what I’m thinking  
about . Then it begins to soften and re lax. Then I might 
start to focus on my breathing , because then I have the 
capacity to stay there and develop that.  
 
An interesting thing to do when the mind is out of 
control or having a lot of difficulty is to identify if there is 
an emotion fueling it all. Then do mindfulness of 
emotions with it. Really feel where it is in the body . I will 
talk about this in the meditation class coming up next 
week.  
 
 
Question: How to practice in the middle of the night 
when raw fear arises.  
 
Answer: Yes. It is easy to have raw fear, especially with 
what is happening in the world these days. Some 
people wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety 
and fear because the usual distractions and 
preoccupations of the day are quieted down. When we  
sleep, it seems we touch into some of the deeper layers of what is really going on for us. Fear is one. It’s not 
uncommon for people to wake up in the middle of the 
night and feel the fear. I have had that sometimes when 
I had concern for a particular rel ative who has 
challenges. I seem to wake up at 2. If I wake up at 2, I 
know there is a little layer of anxiety around the relative 
I’m thinking about. What to do? It depends a little on 
how strong it is. Raw fear is a strong term. One 
possibility is to sta rt mindfulness practice. It might be 
helpful to sit up in bed , or go to your meditation cushion. 
The intention of taking an upright posture rather than 
staying in bed gives a little bit of freedom, kind of like 
breaking the crust of the fear. You are empow ering 
yourself to sit there in a clear, conscious way. Then feel 
the fear. Unless it triggers more fear to feel the fear, 
allow yourself to feel afraid. It’s not a mistake to feel 
afraid. It’s uncomfortable , but if you’re only free when 
you’re comfortable,  then you are not really free. So 
what does it mean to be free while being afraid? Is that 
possible? Is it possible to someh ow step back from the 
fear enough so that you aren’t afraid , but there is fear 
here? If it’s you who is afraid , it’s hard to offer c are to 
the fear. But if you really see that fear is happening 
here, then you can bring care and kindness to it. You 
can offer safety to it. You don’t want to fix it, get rid of it, 
see it as wrong or as a problem. Just make space , and 
allow what is going o n. Allow yourself to begin 
experiencing the layers and dimensions of the fear, the 
beliefs operating, the memories being triggered, the feelings in the body, your relationship to fear, etc. Then, 
if none of that helps and the fear is really strong, do 
some thing that is really grounding. Go get some warm 
milk, have some food, maybe take a warm shower, 
sometimes journaling can help ground you. Distract 
yourself from it. Read a book. Do something to take you 
out of the grip of it. And, finally, please try to h old 
yourself with a lot of compassion these days. Lots of 
care, love, attention, respect. This is not an easy time 
we are going through , but it is a very important time for 
us to really have a chance to look at and work with and 
resolve some of the deeper spiritual, psychological 
issues that are part of the path to liberation , but seldom 
get stirred up this far. Someone on the path to liberation 
may see that this is where the practice is : now it’s time 
to really practice. Now I am ready to work with this fe ar. 
 
Thank you all for coming and being part of this. I hope 
this supports you , and I look forward to continuing on 
Monday .
