 I was speaking with someone recently who's been involved with Dharma practice, Buddhist practice for many years, and the person was commenting, he was commenting that how things turned out is completely different than what he thought it would be like when he began practicing. He said that he feels he has developed and that Buddhist practice has helped him quite a bit in maturing and developing. But the idea that he had at the beginning was more that there was, as he said, a grand goal to get to, and that once he got there to that goal, once he accomplished that goal, he'd then be able to coast. And he said it didn't turn out that way. And now he understands our practice, our Buddhist practice, our meditation practice, as more about how do we take care of what's in front of us wisely. How do we take care of, how do we wisely take care of what comes up in our life, in our daily life? So that's what I want to speak about, that's what I want to address somewhat this morning. The phrase that I've come to use to kind of represent that is continuous practice. How do we practice continuously? Not just at certain special moments, even though our meditation practice may be particularly helpful. Retreat may be particularly helpful. Certain states of mind may be particularly useful. But what do we do when we don't have those states of mind? Just a few moments ago, during meditation, someone tripped or something. So what is our meditative state sitting? And then what is our practice when we trip? What is it right then? How do we apply our practice mind? What is our practice mind at that time? And then when we say practice, we usually say practice realization. Because our understanding is that practice and realization are not two separate things. Like my friend who thought, oh, if I practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, and then I hit the jackpot, realization. Not like that. That as our practice arises, it already is the expression of realization. Our enlightenment is already expressed in our mind, in our moment to moment existence. So then, if that's the case, then our way is as Suzuki Roshi said when he said, like walking through a mist. He said, when you walk through a misty foggy, which we're very familiar with, where I'm from, Green Gulch Farm. Very foggy all the time. There was a lot of fog coming down Highway 280. So I had a very palpable experience of going through the mist, although I was in a big car. I'm now driving a very large Ford. It's a Ford Crown Victoria. It's a white Ford Crown Victoria. I received it. My father passed away almost a year ago, and that was the car that he had. And my sisters and I figured I could use a car. So I got that. And then subsequently I found out, everyone who I say it to, they say, oh, you got a cop car. And I command a great deal of respect on the road, because people think that I'm an undercover policeman. I'm undercover something else. I'm not a policeman. Anyway, I call it the boat, because it's very boat-like. So Suzuki Roshida said that practice is like walking through a fog, through a mist, that even without even knowing it, by the time you get to the end, you're soaked through. Without realizing it even. So it's like a mist, not a downpour, not a big storm, not a big dramatic moment, but something more subtle than that. Nevertheless, with consistent, continuous effort, it soaks through completely, so that you're completely all wet. Practice soaks through you. This is my sense of continuous practice. So that our practice mind, or in the traditional literature, it would be called bodhicitta. Bodhi means enlightenment, or awake. Citta is mind, thought. A bodhi is related to Buddha, which really just means awake, to wake up. The awakened one is the Buddha. And I often mention that we call the practice Buddhism. That's its Sanskrit word, but in English, we would just call it awakeism. That's our practice, awakeism, awakening upism. Something like that. So bodhicitta is often translated as the thought of enlightenment, or the spirit of enlightenment, the spirit of realization, the spirit of it, the feeling of it, moving toward it. So the mist, this bodhicitta penetrates, suffuses us. By our effort, meditative effort and precept effort and wisdom effort. My analogy is like when you steep a tea bag in tea. I always have to think it through, who's the tea bag and what's the hot water? So let's see, the tea bag is practice and the hot water is you or me. And after a while, if you steep it, if you leave the tea bag in there, the water becomes completely a cup of tea. It's no longer water. Like that. Do you get the feeling for what I'm saying? Okay, good. So one of the great ancestors in the Zen tradition is Dogen, Eihei Dogen, Dogen Zenji, Zenji means great teacher. He lived in Japan in the 13th century and was one of the main people credited with bringing Zen from China to Japan. And then the lineage goes from Dogen down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down to Suzuki Roshi. So this is, Dogen is a very significant teacher in the lineage that Gil and I both are part of. And I wanted to mention a couple of things that he wrote, that he said that bear on this point of continuous practice. Specifically, he addresses what is the field of our practice? When and where does practice realization come forth? Under what circumstances? He addresses this in a work entitled, Actualizing the Fundamental Point in Japanese, Genjō Kōan. So this is what we're talking about, actualizing the fundamental point. Someone asks Suzuki Roshi, what is the fundamental point? He said, that time anyway, he said, the fundamental point is to find out what is the fundamental point. They never pin these guys down. Slippery characters. So here's two sentences from actualizing the fundamental point by Dogen. Those who have great realization of delusion are Buddhas. Those who are greatly deluded about realization are sentient beings. So if you're not familiar with Dogen, this is classic Dogen. Here he takes something and he kind of turns it around in some way and comes out the other end and he was very literary. And if you get into it, some people I think are put off by it, but if you get into it, it's very beautiful actually in its symmetry. Those who have great realization of delusion are Buddhas. Those who are greatly deluded about realization are sentient beings. So there's three sets of two things. One is having realization of delusion or deluded about realization and then you have Buddhas and sentient beings. Do you see the structure of it? It takes a while. It's very condensed, very condensed feeling to it. So first point is, he says those who have great realization of delusion are Buddhas. Those who are greatly deluded about realization are sentient beings or ordinary people or you and me. So there are Buddhas and there are sentient beings. It looks like two separate things, but I don't think he meant that. So I could say from our modern psychological understanding, Western psychological understanding, we can understand that it's not like there is such a thing as a Buddha, there is such a thing as an ordinary person, but rather within us there is the Buddha, the Buddha in us, the tendency toward Buddhas in us or the ordinary person in us. You know, the inner child, well this is the inner Buddha, the inner ordinary person like that. More talking about it from that perspective. And I think, you know, who knows what he meant, but if the shoe, if the teaching fits, use it. So I think it's more that sense because my sense is so much that our practice is an activity. So sometimes we're Buddha and sometimes we're ordinary beings. Most of the time we're both. So again, those, so let's talk about the first one, the Buddhas, okay? The Buddhas in us, our Buddha understanding. This is the key point here. Those who have great realization of delusion are Buddhas. So what I believe that he's trying to say is that the realm of realization is the realm of delusion. One thing, not two different places, not our usual way of thinking about it. I'm going to get, I'm going to go away from this dirty old dusty old bad old realm of delusion and I'm going to enter the wonderful world of enlightenment and then everyone will be smiling and I'll be extremely intelligent and all kinds of wonderful things will happen at that point. No, no, no, no, no. We have great realization of delusion. We don't leave the field of delusion. Even for, we don't have to leave. We don't have to go somewhere else where things are a lot better than in this cruddy old place called my mind or called the United States of America or called the solar system. We don't have to go someplace else besides that. Some higher level of consciousness that's much better than this level of consciousness that we have right now, right now, right now, the level of consciousness that you have, that I have. It's there, it's that place where great realization occurs. That's what a Buddha is. That's what we understand when we resonate with Buddha in us. And that helps us understand the second sentence. Those who have great realization of delusion are Buddhas. Those who are greatly deluded about realization are ordinary persons. So there may be many interpretations of what Dogen might have meant about being greatly deluded about realization. But my sense is that the key is in the first part, to have realization of delusion as a Buddha, therefore, to be deluded about realization means that we think realization is something separate from, something away from, something distant from, like my friend, again, some grand goal in the distance that we're going to get to someday if we really behave properly. That's to be deluded about realization. That's our ordinary bifurcating, dividing, splitting up way. Those who have great realization of delusion are Buddhas. Those who are greatly deluded about realization are sentient beings. So I thought of an example of this, another friend, an older person, and it's getting more and more difficult for me to use that category. A friend of mine, he's 82, 83, and he just left for Tassahara a week ago to do the fall practice period at Tassahara, which my wife is leading. Anyway, that's his spirit. He didn't notice that he was too old to go to Tassahara for practice period. He forgot. Anyway, he lives up near Sebastopol, and he was telling me a few weeks ago or a month ago that he goes to a Whole Foods supermarket there in Sebastopol. The checkout person that he goes to, he always goes to the same checkout person, is a man who doesn't speak and doesn't hear a deaf and dumb person. And over a period of time, my friend Robert has really developed a warm relationship with this checkout guy. So the other day, he was in there, and he was getting, you know how they have in Whole Foods, you can get soup and you play linen and then they weigh it. Or something like that, and then they charge you accordingly. So the person before him took some soup and then took a spoonful of something else and put it in the soup. And my friend thought, oh, well, that's a good idea. I'll try that too. So he did that. But the thing that he took a spoonful of cost more than the soup. It's a little complicated. So he goes to his checkout guy and the checkout person is holding the container. And my friend says, soup weighs it, charges him. Or no, as he's doing it, so sort of as he was saying soup, the checkout man lifted the top and saw that there was this other thing in the soup. This is continuous practice. So anyway, he covered it up and just charged him according to the soup. But my friend really felt this deeply. So he wrote a letter to the checkout guy with a copy to the manager of the store. And in the letter, I think basically he said, you know, he explained what happened, the soup, this other stuff. And if this caused you any disturbance, I'm very sorry, signed Robert. So he gave the letter to the man who doesn't speak and doesn't hear. And then as he was reading the letter, the checkout guy went like that. He put his hand over his heart, you know, because he was touched by my friend's thorough application. Now why this is an example of continuous practice, I'm not exactly sure. But I believe it is. As I'm saying it now, I recognize that at least one aspect is, is that not infrequently, sometimes once in a while, once in a long while, or every other second, we put the more expensive stuff into the soup and say soup. We do that sort of thing, don't we? We make mistakes. I ride my bicycle to work and I love riding my bicycle to work. And from Green Gulch, I don't know if you know, you go over a big hill and you go down, it's very exciting in the morning when it's dark. So I have this, one of these super powerful bike lights, you know, because it's dark at, you know, 6, 6 30 in the morning. So I'm riding along and I'm going down this straightaway between Mill Valley and Sausalito. And this guy is coming from the other end and he says, as he's passing me by, you know, it's hard to communicate on bicycles because, you know, there's not much time. Turn your light down. And then he referred to a human orifice involved with the digestive system. Not the mouth. I turned it down. I didn't know. I didn't know there was a problem, you know. People all the time. I've never, anyway, it was a real surprise to me. But anyway, he felt really offended that I was blinding him with my bike light and let me know about it in no uncertain terms. So there are moments intentional, unintentional and semi intentional, intentional. When we turn the bike light up into someone's eyes and they don't like it. When we cheat going through the checkout counter. Small maybe, but big enough. This is not so, so continuous practice means we don't try, we don't lose those moments. Those are not lost. Those are not failure. Those are the field for our activity. Another section of the same work actualizing the fundamental point. Expands on this in a somewhat different way, but you'll see. It's a little bit longer. It's maybe five or six sentences. It goes like this. Enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water. The moon does not get wet. Nor is the water broken. Although it's light is wide and great. The moon is reflected even in a puddle an inch wide. The whole moon and the entire sky are reflected in dew drops on the grass. And even in one drop of water. Enlightenment does not divide you just as the moon does not break the water. And you cannot hinder enlightenment just as a dew drop does not hinder the moon in the sky. So this is about the relationship between, in the other quotation, between Buddha and sentient being. The Buddha side is the moon, enlightenment, realization. The sentient being side is the drop of water. Our ordinary mind. And what Dogin is saying is, again, the word that comes up for me is beautiful. It's a beautiful idea, a beautiful capturing of the way things are. He says the moon is completely in the water. It's completely in the drop of water without breaking it. It doesn't alter it, but it's completely permeates it. Realization completely permeates our ordinary mind without disturbing it in the least. Even in a puddle an inch wide. Though its light is wide and great, the moon is reflected even in a puddle an inch wide. The whole moon and the entire sky are in every damn little puddle there is. Even muddy puddles means the whole moon and the entire sky, realization, is completely in us. Even when we are a muddy puddle, even when our state of mind is a muddy puddle. Not just some special state of mind that we work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work, and then we get that state of mind. No, even in our current state of mind, our ordinary state of mind, the whole moon and the entire sky is already there without doing anything further. Another brief example of this is yet another friend. Not as old as the last one, but anyway. He has this issue called sleep apnea. Sleep apnea? As far as I understand what happens with sleep apnea, or at least his version of it is, that he's sleeping and then suddenly he'll wake up completely out of breath. He'll wake up like that. Terrible. A malady to have. You wake up terrified that you can't grasp your next breath. So we were talking about it and we were talking about sleep apnea, but we were also talking about when you won't take your next breath. Sleep apnea or no sleep apnea. When that happens. When there's an exhalation and no inhalation. And it immediately occurred to me, because he was saying, well, how do I prepare for such a moment? When it immediately occurred to me that the best way to take care of that moment is to take care of this moment. For all intents and purposes, there ain't no other than this one. That's why Dogen calls it actualizing the fundamental point. Or to turn it around in a Dogenesque way, we could say pointing to the fundamental actualization. The emphasis is on actualize. The emphasis is on the verb. The gift that keeps on giving. This is the verb that keeps on verbing. And we don't need to go off to the dusty realms of other lands. It's always just like they say, right underneath our feet. So that was what I wanted to say this morning in great respect of Dogen and Suzuki Roshi and the way that they have taught us. And I see there's still a few more minutes. And if you have some question or comment or thought, I'm interested to hear. Yes. That's a soup. Yeah. So if the checker had no for the dish, would he think that a friend would have had that same reaction if no one could know that he put soup over the became cupboard? Well, I think that it was, I think in that instance, it was because it became public that the phenomena was in as high relief as it was. But the spirit of what I'm saying has to do with practicing even when no one is looking. Because it's here, it's inside. Now sometimes that kind of public life is very helpful. I mean, sometimes it's just, you know, oh, you didn't follow the rules, you know, and it gets very strict and kind of we enter. You know, I often think, you know, that we're talking about Buddhism, but for many of us, the tradition in which we were raised was Judeo-Christian, you know, so we sometimes will use Buddhist concepts to support our secret Judeo-Christian ideas, like good and bad. And I was being, he was being bad when he did that. And, you know, that kind of thing. So I don't mean public in that way. But you know, in the style of practice that I'm involved in, there's a lot of public stuff. We meditate publicly, we take vows publicly with each other. This is very helpful. This is sangha. It's very useful to have it known in that way. And from a psychological perspective, a book that I was deeply captivated by and moved by was a book, some of you may know, called A General Theory of Love. Any of you have heard of that? A General Theory of Love written by some psychiatrists up at UCSF in San Francisco. And they speak about how necessary others are for our own regulation, even at the most fundamental levels like the blood flowing and, you know, that kind of thing. We completely operate, human beings, mammals, completely operate in the field of response to others. So response to others and in that sense, public activity is not just some little thing on the side. Very, very important and very, very useful. But in the spirit that I'm speaking about today, I'm talking about getting into all of the little dark corners where nobody knows about it, you think. And what do you do there? So, okay. Yes? So my question is, I get confused with the terms, the realization and actualization. Can you give sort of a definition, is that the same as enlightenment, is that the same as being awake or is it something else? Well, actualization, the way I like to think of actualization is making something actual. How do you make the potential real? How do you bring it into my, how do I make it real in my life so that it's operating in my life in an actual way? So actualizing the fundamental point is about that. Pointing to the fundamental actualization is how do I make this thing actually happen? You know, I use the word again. How do I make it actually happen now? Again, not just some special time. And you know, you don't need to worry about it, you know, the technical aspects of it are, they're interesting, but they're not the being thing. In what I was saying, in the quotes from Dogen, realization is roughly an equivalent of enlightenment. I think Suzuki Roshi's expression, big mind, is very useful as a way of understanding it. We have small mind, our specific mind, our, you know, what's happening that has to do with our entire history and our circumstances and white Ford Crowned Victorias and all kinds of other stuff, zillions of things like that. There's that and then there's big mind in which small mind occurs, in which small, it's, in which small mind, the big mind happened at the same time and the same place. You might say two perspectives on the same moment. One is a necessary perspective of discrimination and specificity and the other also necessary, but not as obvious, is the perspective of big, a big perspective, a wide perspective. Also flexible. I'm giving you more synonyms, I don't know if that makes things more complicated or less. So maybe just one more question. Yes. I just wanted to make a comment about obstructive sleep apnea, which all three of my kids have had and one found it absolutely terrifying as your friend did and the other two simply could not get enough sleep to function the next day in the world. And all three were treated by ear, nose and throat specialists who removed their tonsils and none of them have had any problems since. So for anyone here or for your friend. Well thank you, thank you very much for this great realization of delusion of sleep apnea. It's just a matter of getting rid of those tonsils. Okay, thank you.
