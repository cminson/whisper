The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
The Institute of Compassion and the University of Stanford has been there for several years.
And it takes us eight weeks.
This is a new format that I would like to try to offer you.
We are going to record the meditations and then something about the theory, let's say.
But I will cut the recording when we start talking.
What we are going to do here is not create something, we are going to learn something new.
But what we are really going to do is to cultivate, to rediscover that capacity that we have as human beings, to give and receive compassion.
We are going to start, more or less, it's eight weeks.
We are going to start this week by creating the bases and then we are going to move on.
The second week we are going to talk about benevolence and compassion for a loved one.
Then we are going to talk about compassion for ourselves, benevolence for ourselves.
The fifth week we are going to talk about the shared humanity.
The sixth week we are going to talk about compassion for others.
We are starting to expand our circle of compassion.
The seventh week is a beautiful week where we have an active practice of compassion.
For those who are familiar with it, it is basically the practice of Tonglen, which comes from Tibetan Buddhism.
The last week, the week eight is all, we integrate everything.
In our weeks we are not going to go out perfectly, we have made some bodhisattvas here.
Because it is a whole practice of life.
The last week we have just learned to rediscover ourselves, to understand, to open our hearts, to let go.
It is a whole practice of life.
But I hope there is an opportunity to get closer to curiosity with a lot of kindness.
And this is an adventure.
It is a journey of discovery.
And when we share, we share with the heart and listen to the heart.
What we discuss here, what we speak here, we want to have this space
that we sit in security, in tranquility.
What is shared here is left here.
What we learn here is shared with everyone.
But what is shared is left here.
This is our space.
To mature the ideas, to star against the walls, to discover our experience.
If it is possible, it would be ideal to come to the eight sessions.
Because it is like building a building.
We start by the base and we start to put a floor, and then the other floor, and the other one.
We are building one thing above the other.
So I'm going to invite you.
Let's start with a small meditation.
We will always have a meditation.
When we start to get closer to these concepts, meditation helps us to calm down the nervous system.
To sit in the mind, to get there.
And what this meditation intends, all this base that we are going to be creating,
is to get a little more aware of what happens in our mind, of how we feel.
It is so easy to let yourself be carried away by the automatic pilot, right?
So it is to start seeing those patterns of thought, those traps of thought,
how we feel, and learn to see our reactions, the things that suffocate us from those detonations.
And it is to start seeing them.
And the way we do these meditations, these meditations are based on Buddhism.
To cultivate compassion, we do not have to be Buddhists.
To meditate, we do not have to be Buddhists.
But Buddhism would not exist if there was no meditation.
So we do not have to worry about whether we are going to doctrine or not.
We are really going to use these tools in a very common way.
So let's start with a meditation to see how it goes.
The invitation I make is to bring curiosity.
Bring...
We arrive at the end of the day for many and the beginning of the day for others.
And we always bring all that luggage, all that equipment, that extra load.
So I invite you to imagine.
The image that comes to my mind is that I am arriving from the market loaded with packages.
And I carry everything that I cannot open the door.
I have to hit it with my foot to open it.
What I invite you to do is to arrive with all those packages, with all that weight.
And we put it here on the table, on the floor.
I take it out, I release everything.
And I feel it.
And I feel it here.
And I arrive.
The rest can stay there for a while.
It will not go anywhere.
Then we can resume all that, all that luggage that we bring, that we have from the day.
That is absolutely normal, stress, worry.
So what? It's okay, you're there, all that is there.
But I'm going to take a small retreat and I'm going to sit down and I'm going to carry it.
I invite you to find a posture in which you can relax, let go, loosen your body.
If you want to invite a little movement, softening, softening.
And if it is possible to close your eyes or lower your gaze,
simply arriving, arriving, inviting a little bit of intimacy,
of tranquility, of softening.
And if you realize, tension is always present.
Tension is always there.
There is nothing to do in particular to activate tension.
It is always there, accessible.
And the invitation is then to be more aware of what is happening at this moment here in this body, in this mind.
What is my experience?
Any experience.
I invite you to feel the body here, seated in this chair.
Connected to the planet in some way.
The invitation is to rest, to rest in the body.
There is nothing to do, nothing to change, nothing to fix.
We should not be anyone in particular, resting here in this body.
Receiving experience, whatever it is.
Or maybe leaving aside the judgements, what is good or what is bad.
Simply receiving what is here at this moment, what is alive, present.
We continue to download our packages.
We invite our critics, our judges to sit here and participate.
Thank you.
And it happens that, or when it happens that the mind turns around or gets hooked on something very interesting, or loses itself in the past or in the future.
It returns to the body and receives what is happening in the body.
Perhaps the sensations of the breathing, perhaps the sensations in the palms of the hand, of the hands.
Or perhaps the sensations in the feet, understanding the contact with the floor.
I invite you to ask questions and not necessarily looking for an answer,
but rather how, leaving, throwing a stone at the water and seeing the waves that form.
And listening, asking with the heart.
What do you want for yourself?
What do you expect to find in this life for you?
And what do you want for your loved ones?
What do you want for yourself?
What do you expect for the world?
Now you realize what happens inside you when you hear these questions.
Listening with the intelligence of your intuition, what happens in this being when I hear these questions.
What do you expect to find in this being when you hear these questions?
What do you expect from this being when you hear these questions?
Something that supports you, that sustains you and opens your eyes when the moment comes.
Hmm.
Okay.
