The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

What I want to talk about today is mindfulness as an intimate practice.
Mindfulness as an intimate practice.
Just that muffling into the mask reminded me if I fall into, you know, you can't really hear me because
my voice falls and it's muffled, wave your hand at me or something, and I'll come back to life.
So I'm going to read you, first of all, the first stanza of a poem.
Life has left her footprints on my forehead, but I have become a child again this morning.
The smile seen through leaves and flowers is back to smooth away the wrinkles.
As the rains wipe away footprints on the beach, again a cycle of birth and death begins.
Life has left her footprints on my forehead, but I have become a child again this morning.
The smile seen through leaves and flowers is back to smooth away the wrinkles.
As the rains wipe away footprints on the beach, again a cycle of birth and death begins.
This is the opening stanza to Thich Nhat Hanh's poem message from his book, Call Me By My Names,
My True Names, Call Me By My True Names, which is perhaps his most famous poem.
And I was struck by the first line, actually. It's the first poem in the book.
I opened the book and there it was. Life has left her footprints on my forehead.
In these times of uncertainty and troubling events and striving to do the right thing,
it's important to think of practice both as a meditation practice and as a life practice.
And what I want to talk about today is how mindfulness can be befriended in our lives,
to be incorporated into our lives in such a way that it doesn't become a task
or one more thing we have to do, that we don't pay so much attention to that technique
that we miss the joy of awakening in this moment as a child
with the footprints on our forehead erased by the flowers and the leaves that we see.
What we want, mindfulness is really a calling to awareness, bringing things into awareness.
How do we do that without making it another job that we have to do?
How do we become so used to awareness and how to notice what we notice
that it becomes just how we live our lives and not,
well, I have to remember what is the object of, I'm going to focus on my feet,
I'm going to focus on my walk, I have to stop doing what I'm doing to be mindful.
I want us to lose that feeling, to lose that imperative that to be mindful,
I have to stop what I'm doing, not that there isn't value in stopping.
The memories we carry of our experiences are stored in our bodies.
These are the footprints across our forehead.
All of the experiences that we have have somehow passed through our awareness
and have been registered somewhere, and we have neural patterns that are established.
The brain actually decides what to do with a set of conditions
long before we've had time to think about it.
It's truly just, it happens, not to mention our own mind habits
where we have a certain way of dealing with a set of conditions
where we actually have some choice about it.
What we fail to notice is that we have changed.
We have changed.
It's too late to be who we once were that all of these habits are braced on.
We've already changed.
In each moment, we are different than the moment before.
I've had this book of Thich Nhat Thanh's poetry for many years,
and this particular poem never caught my eye.
I periodically go through it and look for another poem.
That one never caught my eye until yesterday,
because I've been thinking about how to come to a realization that I am not who I once was.
I've said that to myself many times.
I've said that to people who've talked to me many times.
You're not who you used to be.
But to suddenly realize, I'm really different.
Someone this week that I've seen only over Zoom for the last year and a half, two years,
said, you know, I went to audio Dharma and there's a picture of you I didn't recognize you.
Your hair is longer, you just look different, your glasses are different.
It was the same person.
Imagine how much change there is that is not physical.
Our physical characteristics really don't change all that much.
I can look at a baby picture of my grandchildren, know immediately who it is,
and yet we don't allow for all of those same changes in how we show up in the moment.
And because I've repeated that phrase over and over again, how it just show up as you are,
it occurred to me that maybe you don't have a clue what I mean by that.
So I've been struggling with how do I talk about this that is not just my convenient words
that I use to talk about the way I experience mindfulness.
And the curious thing is yesterday I wrote a talk and I got about four-fifths of the way through it
and I realized it was almost identical to the talk I gave a month ago.
And I said, oops, because this topic is up for me.
So I started over again and I said, okay, I'm going to use this method.
And then I went to a concert last night and I threw all of it away.
So the concert I went to last night was Maria Snyder and her big band.
The concert was at Stanford. She's a jazz player, composer.
She's won seven Grammys, both classical and jazz. She's a really amazing woman.
And she had this 18-piece band. But before the concert there was an interview
and the interrogator said, well, so what is jazz?
And her answer just blew me away. She said, well, jazz is a conversation.
And the important thing is that it requires listeners, both the players
and the audience, the people listening to it, have to have a conversation.
It's a conversation. And I thought, yes, life is a conversation with our experience.
And mindfulness is how we listen.
So you've all been in a conversation where your mind is off forming a retort
and you don't even hear what the person is saying.
Or you're thinking, oh, I know what this person is going to say.
They said the same thing last time and you're not listening.
And the active listening is, in fact, mindfulness.
It is bringing yourself into the moment and saying, what's new in this moment?
What's different in this moment? What can I realize from this moment?
It's actually completely vibrant.
It isn't static in the sense that I'm just going to follow my breath.
When we do mindfulness in meditation, we follow our breath,
but we don't ask the breath to be a certain way.
We don't say the breath has to be deep.
The breath has to be shallow.
We notice how the breath is. That's the method we use.
And the same thing is true as we go through every experience of our lives.
We don't decide in advance what it's going to be or how it's going to be.
We say, oh, how is it? What is this experience?
What am I noticing here?
When I thought about that, the cycle of music that the band played
was from a double CD set they did, which had to do with the name of those data lords.
And on one CD, it was about the chaos and the control of data
and how involved we are in the technological world.
And the other one was sort of, oh, yes, and there are all these benefits to come out of it.
And so some of the music was difficult to hear. It was hard to hear.
And I thought, yeah, you know, sometimes as we're going through the day,
some things are difficult to hear, difficult to experience.
It's unpleasant. We call it unpleasant.
We could just as well call it too loud.
Sometimes our thoughts are too loud to be present for what's happening.
Our beliefs about who we are in the moment are too loud to just say,
oh, this is what's here now.
But if we think of it more as a conversation with our immediate experience,
it becomes less of something extra and burdensome.
It's just, it becomes more flowing, more natural.
Oh, this is what's happening.
So I'm going to pause for a moment so that I can raise your Nancy.
Your announcement was made.
Now, I wanted to get that out of the way so I didn't think about it anymore
because it was there, up, up.
Okay, so I'm going to let that go so that, you know, I'm already improvising the talk.
So let's at least, let's at least stay with the topic, right?
This is the listening that I'm talking about.
This is the, oh, this happened.
When we get too attached to knowing what's going to happen
or predicting what's going to happen,
we actually fail to notice what is happening.
One of the other oddities of this jazz band was that there was an accordion.
If you've never heard jazz accordion, it just sort of boggles the mind.
And she talked about that and said, you know, the reason I have an accordion
is they can play a high sustained note,
which usually the band depends on the trumpets to do,
but the trumpets run out of air.
And you can play that note on the accordion for days.
And I thought how interesting it was.
It was not losing sight of the intention by insisting,
well, I can't have a sustained high note because the band can't do it.
It turns out if you don't get too attached to the plan,
there may be another way to realize your intention.
This is, this is really crucial because a lot of the things,
the places that we get tied up is when we think,
I am, I'm going to be, let's take listening.
I'm going to be a good listener.
I'm going to just listen.
I'm going to hear everything you're saying.
And then something happens and all of a sudden we're thrown into a memory.
Oh, wait a minute. What was that about?
And the mind is off.
And then we, oh, no, no, I have to listen.
And we give up the opportunity to find what was the trigger that set me off
so that I can see that, so I can see what's happening here.
My attitude is to be present. My intention is to be present.
Is my attitude open enough that I'm present?
Or is it guarded attention that I have?
Am I just waiting?
Am I on the edge?
Or am I relaxed in my listening?
How tightly am I trying?
How much effort am I putting into this?
We call this wise effort because it isn't about how hard we try.
It's about perseverance.
We just keep, we just keep coming back to listen.
Oops, back to listen.
It isn't, I'm going to stay here no matter what.
It is noticing what has arisen and allowing that to be true.
Oh, this is here now.
It's not, I'm a bad listener.
Oh, look what was triggered.
How interesting.
This morning, I don't know for sure where this is going,
but I noticed it, so I'm going to bring it up.
So I put the spring on my finger.
Now, I have owned this ring for, I figured it out, 45 years.
It's a gift to me.
And most mornings, I just put it on and it's just,
my hand feels right with it on.
This morning, I put it on and I thought,
oh, this was actually a gift to me.
And suddenly, I recalled the person who gave me the gift.
And I wondered, how is that person now?
And I said, but it's just the ring.
And then I went back to the ring.
I saw the temptation to reminisce when it was given to me,
what it was like then.
But I recognized that I'm not, you know,
45 years ago person who first put this ring on a finger.
I'm this person who is now doing something else,
thinking something else, being present for something else.
And that memory, while it is imprinted on me,
doesn't have any reality in the present.
It's not palpable in the present.
The ring is, the ring is here.
The physical reality of the ring is here.
And I can just be here for that.
And I can enjoy it or not enjoy it,
or think about what it is, the inclusions
that I find so interesting in this piece of turquoise.
Okay, the value is in that, in my immediate reaction to what is here.
In remembering the other person,
it isn't about how I felt then, but how I feel now.
And to realize there's some affection,
even though the relationship is long gone.
You feel the affection now as something
that is an experience of this moment,
but doesn't define this moment,
doesn't require me to justify it.
The piece of affection does not have to have meaning,
doesn't have to fit into a scale or a story.
It just exists on its own.
It's coming to allow things to just exist on their own
without trying to fit it into some kind of pattern,
which is kind of a normal thing.
We want to make meaning out of everything.
We want to establish the relationships
between all our thoughts,
because it gives us a sense of solidity,
and it denies impermanence.
It denies that we are not who we once were.
So what we want to do is cultivate this ability
to have this conversation with our experience.
So how do we cultivate that?
What do I mean when I say cultivated?
How does it not become another practice?
How does it not become one more thing I have to do,
like metapractice or breath practice,
or any of the other things?
It's about using our awareness
as opposed to the mental formations of our experience.
So here's what I mean by that.
If I have a memory and I experience the memory,
the natural thing is to start saying,
let me choose something a little different.
Let's say I experience anxiety.
Anxiety is here.
And I can say, oh, I'm anxious,
and start listing the stories
and all the reasons for why I am anxious,
which of course only increases my anxiety.
Or I can say anxiety is here
and shift my awareness from what is anxiety
to how do I feel about that?
Now, you may think that being anxious
is the feeling in itself, and it is.
But when we shift our awareness around the corner
and say, yeah, but what do I think about that?
Then we notice something like,
well, I want it to go away.
Or we feel ourselves stepping back from it
or leaning into it.
And we notice that.
And in noticing that,
we are not tangled up in the story.
We're not feeding it.
We're not trying to control it.
We're not saying it's bad.
So noticing something that is unpleasant
that we wish was not true.
We can either start off on the story
about why we don't wish it to be true
or how we want to fix it,
or I'm not a good person.
Or we can say, that's shown up.
But what do I know about that?
How do I feel about that in this moment?
What am I aware of in this moment?
We become more adept
at noticing our attitude towards something
and less digging into the something.
Does that make any sense to you?
Let's see if I can think of it a good example for this.
So,
very often when we fall into self-criticism,
oh, I wish I hadn't done that,
or I shouldn't have done that,
we find ourselves falling into the middle
of the praise-blame spectrum.
There's a sutta describing the eight worldly winds,
and they go together,
and there is praise and blame,
gain and loss,
fame and disrepute,
and it's pain and the absence of pain.
I can't think right now what it's called.
It's okay.
That was in the talk I discarded yesterday.
But what I've been working with lately
is the praise-blame thing,
because it turns out a lot of the suffering
that we cause for ourselves
is because we try to establish blame
for something happening,
or we attribute it to something.
It's like that meaning cycle that you get on.
So, I find something happening,
and when I have to give responsibility for it,
I can ascribe it to myself,
or I can ascribe it to the other.
So, if I'm in a conversation with my experience,
I might say,
experience, you shouldn't be happening.
This is not what I intended,
and so I'm going to change that,
and then we're in a struggle with it.
But if we say, oh, that's happening,
that wasn't my intention,
how do I feel about that?
Something else happens.
It isn't that we're fixing it or making it go away,
but we're seeing it in a different way.
The awareness of it becomes slightly changed.
So, I'll give you a silly example.
In the way here, I had to come to a sudden stop
to keep from hitting a squirrel running across the road,
and my first thought was, oh, he made it.
My next thought was,
I'm so glad I was paying attention,
and then the next thought was,
oh, what a good mindfulness person you are,
and I laughed.
That was an accident.
It wasn't because I was mindful of the squirrel.
I happened to be driving looking for things,
but it wasn't to watch the mind switch into praise so quickly
from just, oh, thank God he made it.
I could laugh at that,
and it makes me then more aware
when I'm falling into praise and blame.
More often, we're aware of blame.
We blame the other, we blame ourselves.
So, one of the tasks that I'm engaged with all the time,
because the person I spend most of my time with is my husband,
is how the conversations between us go.
And so, I pay great attention
before I walk into his presence
of what's going on in my mind.
Where am I?
Because if I'm feeling very open and abueling
and easy and relaxed,
the conversation, no matter what he does,
usually goes well.
And if I'm feeling irritable or rushed or jagged,
the conversation has a great potential for running off the rails.
It has nothing to do with him
and everything to do with my attitude of mind.
So, when I notice that I'm irritable and jagged,
I say, okay, I got to be careful here.
I have to listen differently.
I have to remember that this is not about the other person.
And the calling to mind helps me with my intention,
which is kindness to my husband.
And then he'll do something that just reminds me
and the thought comes up, he always does that.
And I'll say, and you're very irritable.
And being aware of that
allows me not to make it his fault.
Or mine.
Irritability is here.
It's not that I'm unkind.
It is the very act of noticing it
that is the act of kindness.
We befriend ourselves when we use mindfulness
to see just this.
It isn't about whether something is good or bad.
We're so used to thinking about things as being good or bad
that we fall into the praise or blame cycle
without thinking about it automatically.
So, for example,
having redone this talk three times,
one thought that came up for me this morning was doubt.
Oh, dear, what am I going to be able,
I don't know what I'm going to say.
How is this going to work?
And when doubt arises, you can see it
and you can start listing all the ways
that you should have done something differently
or you should have started sooner
or I shouldn't be doing this at all.
And you see those thoughts come and go.
And you lose doubt to say,
oh, this is me wishing things for other than they were.
Wishing things for other than they are.
Am I leaning into doubt?
Am I pushing it away?
How is that?
Oh, doubt is here.
And then I recall all the times I've been full of doubt.
And I recall, this is just a conversation.
Some conversations go well,
some conversations do not.
And there is ease in the moment along with doubt.
And then my husband comes in and says, oh, you'll do great.
And I'm thinking, praise.
And at the same time, there's a voice saying,
you don't know that.
I don't know that.
Doubt is here.
And there's this interplay.
It is the interplay that can be watched.
Then judgment is missing
because you're just watching things flash in and out,
flash in and out, flash in and out.
So we use something like doubt,
which of course we all want to get rid of, right?
As a window to see through,
it's not a door.
It's a window to see through.
All of the hindrances are windows to see through.
To see, oh, this is what's happening now.
And we get in the habit, the habit of saying,
oh, this is who's showing up now, this person,
with all her gifts and flaws,
and the experience of being in the room with these people.
And the experience of, you know,
all of the things that came in with it.
I didn't tell you that I had a technology failure last night
after rewriting my talk for the third time
or adding notes to it, that I couldn't save it.
Actually, I could save it.
I just couldn't re-access it.
I couldn't get it on my iPad.
It just, what happened?
A system that works perfectly well, no longer works.
Mystery.
Fooling around with the technology and thinking,
well, okay, I found a workaround.
I emailed it to myself.
That seemed to work fine.
Who knew?
You know, the technology became a barrier
to my being able to talk to you.
What a ridiculous notion.
Of course, it was never a barrier.
But to see the window of how I'm approaching the problem,
the anxiety that arose, the uncertainty that arose,
the irritation at these systems.
So it reminded me of last night's concert.
There was this, there was a really noisy,
difficult to listen to piece.
But stunningly played.
You could just hear the musicianship
and the way it fit together.
And it was intended to be about AI
taking over and destroying humans.
So you can imagine it was cataclysmic.
And at the end of it, you were just exhausted.
And then she said, oh, and then there's this other piece
that she composed after going to a Buddhist garden in Kyoto.
And it was sweet and melodic and gorgeous,
just a gorgeous piece.
And watching the feeling of pushing back in your body
and the leaning into and the relaxing made me realize
the music was doing exactly what she intended.
That the audience became engaged in the music.
And that's what I want in my life, to be engaged in my life.
And to do that, I've come to think more about awareness
as my mindfulness tool and less about what I'm looking at.
Less about I should be paying attention to this thing
or in order to achieve the stillness of meditation
and the rest of my life, I should be equanimous.
But to welcome both equanimity and chaos
as ways to see how things are.
It's like this.
It's, oh, this is what's happening now.
Who I am today is both distinguished from and different.
It's of the past, but distinguished from the past.
All of our experiences bring us to this moment.
But we don't have to be the person who had those experiences.
We're the person who's having this experience.
We're here for this one.
So if I experienced something, someone says to me something
and I experienced shame.
What do I do with something like shame?
I see shame.
I feel it curdling.
I don't feel necessarily what I felt then,
but I feel what I feel now around shame.
And I say, ooh, that doesn't fit.
It doesn't fit.
Would I do that same thing again?
No, I would not do that same thing again.
Ah, I'm changed.
It's too late. I'm changed.
Shame has no place here.
Blame has no place here.
Praise has no place here.
I can feel joy and stop at joy.
I don't have to say, oh, and this means I'm a good person.
I can just stop there.
I can say, oh, that's that's what this experience is.
I don't have to put the experience in a chronological order
with everything that's happened in my life,
because frankly, I've missed most of the conditions of my life.
We can't be aware of all the conditions of our life any more
than we're aware of all the conditions just in this room.
Whatever my experience it is right now,
it is different from your experience
because your attitude of mind is not my attitude of mind.
Your experience of what it means to say,
it's like this is very different than mine.
Your experience is unique to you,
but not only unique to you, but unique to this moment.
Sometimes we think, well, if I had it to do over again,
I would do this and then this would be what came from it.
How do we know that?
We have no idea how a changed decision on something in the past
would unfold except in our imaginations.
Why burden ourselves with the past?
We tend to take our experiences and stuff them in a bag
and carry them around on our back to be pulled out
when conditions appear to be the same,
but conditions are never the same.
That bag just becomes something we're hauling around
for no particular good reason.
What we do want is to develop wisdom.
The wisdom that comes from experience that says,
oh, that feels terrible.
That is tense.
That causes me to curl up.
It causes me to curdle inside.
It causes me to lose the ability to speak.
My throat muscles get tight and I resolve not to go there again.
I resolve not to do that again.
Whatever the conditions are,
I return to my intention in the moment.
If my intention is to be kind,
I have a picture of what I think kindness is going to look like,
and then something else happens.
If I still return to my intention to be kind,
it just doesn't look like what I thought it was going to look like.
I was a scientist and businesswoman.
This happened all the time.
You'd put together a business plan,
you'd have a decision tree about when this happens,
then this happens,
and when this happens, you do this,
and we have a goal and a timeline,
and then a supplier falls through,
or the software fails,
or something happens.
You think you've built time into your plan,
but it's derailed.
It doesn't mean it's a failure.
You just start again and you say,
oh, okay, well, this could delay us,
or we could plan another way,
or it actually doesn't have to look this way.
It could look a different way and be good.
Good is useful to define what you mean when you say good.
I really try, very hard,
to substitute the word skillful for good,
because good has attached to it,
wanting, not wanting shame and blame,
praise and blame, gain and loss,
pain and the opposite of pain,
all of those things that cause us to be distracted from life.
And my intention is not to make my life look a certain way,
not to become a certain person,
but to be skillful right now with these conditions.
And to do that, I have to see clearly
that is how we develop wisdom.
It's not just a kind of hedonism of the moment.
It is through seeing clearly,
wisdom is formed.
Our ability to make skillful decisions
rests on our ability to see clearly.
To see clearly.
I'm so far from my talk, my computer is shut off.
So, life is a conversation,
and mindfulness is a way of listening.
To listen, to be aware of what's happening.
How can I interact with this experience?
By really listening, by really seeing,
whether I do it from listening or seeing or awareness,
it's being involved in this moment without urgency.
When I was leaving the house this morning,
I was conscious of rushing,
and I reminded myself that I only needed to move fast.
I didn't need to rush.
Rush implies there are going to be bad consequences
if I don't get there faster.
It's extra stuff, but just moving quickly,
efficiently moving.
I could feel myself relax as soon as I let go of the rush thought.
Just a moment of ease, but I was still moving quickly.
As I got in the elevator,
I clasped this cushion to my chest,
and I could feel my heart beating.
I could have paid attention to whether it was beating rapidly
or slowly, but what I noticed was how tender it was,
that it felt fragile.
I hugged it like I was hugging a little girl.
I hugged the cushion there and my poor, fragile heart,
and I softened a little more.
Now, it would have been possible to say,
okay, what does this rapid heartbeat mean?
This rapid heartbeat means I'm still rushing and I'm late,
and what time is it anyway?
But instead, I just felt the heart,
and allowed myself to be grateful that it was beating,
and not how it was beating.
It's arriving with a friendliness toward the moment.
A friendliness toward the moment.
I don't have to be guarded against my own experience.
I can just experience.
And in the safety of the elevator, of course,
I could be as tender with my little heart as nobody cared.
Nobody was there, it was just me and my heart.
That is the place of conversation with your experience.
Just this.
Everything does not have a life-or-death urgency attached to it,
but when we're on guard all the time,
on guard against our experience,
it begins to feel that way.
Just before we sat, I went out,
and I touched the two women who were signing us in,
and the three women, actually, and I got to hug them.
We all commented on the great joy of feeling.
I've lived my life on Zoom.
The last two years have been all Zoom, all the time, I think.
And the touch, the additional sensory input is so delicious.
And to just enjoy that, irrespective of all of the things
that we care about and worry about and are anxious about.
You know, the war in Ukraine is never far from my mind.
As soon as I start thinking,
what do I care about in this moment?
It comes up.
And each of us has a different experience of that.
For me, it is mostly about people's lives being destroyed.
And I think not only about...
I tried thinking about what would it be like
to have my apartment blown away.
I can't. I'm unable to imagine that.
I can think that it brings horror into my heart.
Horror, but I can't actually imagine what it would be like.
And the other day, I heard a talk by Michael McFall,
who was a former ambassador to Russia.
And he runs a World Studies Institute at Stanford now,
and they have had 300 Ukrainian students come through this,
all of whom went back to Ukraine to become involved in the government,
and they're all at risk, or worse.
And he talked to...
One of his former students is in the bunker with Zelensky,
and he talked to him just a few days ago,
and he talked to Zelensky a week ago.
And his experience when he thinks of the war in Ukraine
is much more personal and intimate than my experience,
which rests on memory and imagination.
Because I have not had that direct experience
of the people, the personal attachment to the people.
And that means his experience when he wakes up and thinks about Ukraine
is different than my experience, whatever else we may have in common.
That's true, so I've chosen a big thing for illustration,
but it's true no matter what, your experience of children,
how you experience children, how you experience family,
how you experience food.
All of the things of your experience
have been conditioned by what has come before,
but it does not determine your experience now.
It simply is a background for your experience now.
So to be aware of what's happening now
is to allow your awareness to just
come back to how are these memories,
how are these experiencing happening now?
Do I feel, how is it in my heart mind now?
Because that's how we set our conditions for the next moment.
Do I allow myself to feel the fragility of my heart without fear?
Or do I worry about what it could mean?
The friendliness of the moment allows us to be just with this.
So the trigger that had me going to Tich Nhat Hanh
wasn't in fact his recent death.
It was talking with a woman yesterday
who was celebrating the anniversary of her 38th year in this country.
She came, she's Vietnamese and she came,
she was one of the boat people,
and she was a babe in arms,
and her mother had, when the boat began leaking
and they couldn't pale the water out anymore,
her mother tied her and her brother to her waist
so that at least if they drowned their bodies would be together
and somebody might find them all together.
And she sees life, her life is extremely lucky.
She celebrates this day like a birthday.
Her experience of being a refugee,
she didn't have it as a child,
but she has it in her mother's memories
and she has it in here I am today and isn't this gorgeous?
This is what I wish for all of you.
Isn't life beautiful?
Whether it is painful or un-painful,
whether it is beautiful in happiness,
but I hear it, I hear it in all of its wisdom
and its noise and its softness and its sweetness,
and it's a great conversation.
Thank you for your attention.
So I've used up all the time,
but if somebody has any comment they'd like to make,
please use the microphone.
I think we made it.
Thank you all very much.
I wish you a wonderful day.
