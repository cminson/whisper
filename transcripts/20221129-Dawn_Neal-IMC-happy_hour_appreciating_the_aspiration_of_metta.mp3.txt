 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There we go. And I'm going to ask you if you haven't, and there's no reason you would have, to mute yourselves while we start the talk, just so people can come in uninterrupted, especially during the meditation. I'm about to just... Here we go. Okay. Technology. So, a warm welcome again. For those of you who we haven't met, my name is Dawn Neal, and I sub for a happy hour, know and then, sometimes often, sometimes not. And the topic I'd like to talk about tonight is something that applies to all of the heart qualities, all of the brahma viharas, and to kind of, more generally, the meditation practice itself, it's the heart quality of learning to love the aspiration to practice, learning to love the wish, to be kind, to be compassionate, to have joy, equanimity, freedom. And this came up for me as I was preparing another talk, and I remembered many years ago now when I was in Myanmar, I was ordained as a Buddhist nun there, temporarily, and was practicing intensive metta. And I remember the transition point of the practice, that it was the moment I learned to cultivate appreciation, care, love for the wish itself, regardless of how near or far it was, that kind of turbocharged the practice, it gave it a lot more energy, and almost this unending fountain of energy, this virtuous cycle that fed on itself, kind of like, if you're a gardener plumbing the mulch and the nitrogen-fixing plants back into the earth, that nourishes the plants even more, it's like that process. So I thought we would play with that tonight, a little bit in the meditation, I promise not to be too heavy-handed with it, but also wanted to share a poem just to kind of set the mood, this is very short, it's by the Persian poet and mystic Hafez, and he says, even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, you owe me, look what happens with love like that, it lights up the whole sky, look what happens with love like that, it lights up the whole sky, so that's the aspiration of metta, this radiant love that requires nothing in return, and we humans usually experience kindness, love in other ways. So the invitation tonight is to give yourself permission to shower your own heart, to give you an aspiration for this wish with the same kind of care that you would offer a dear person, offer anyone else, and to feed that inspiration, that aspiration, that wish and nourish it, because it will sustain you if you do. So, settling back into a comfortable posture, I'm going to turn off the ability to unmute for now, just in case we have later rivals wrestling about, and at the same time invite you to turn off anything that buzzes, beeps, blurts, slacks, anything like that, so that you're not distracted unnecessarily. If you like to turn off your camera or turn away from the screen, if that's more comfortable for you, that's totally fine. I'll stay like this. So, starting out by finding a comfortable way to be in your body, see me rocking back and forth and forward and back. It can be helpful sometimes to move almost like a pendulum and find your weight centered over your sitz bones, your spine more or less straight as it's comfortable, and finding a place of ease, ease in the posture, relaxation. Starting with kindness for the body. Then, tuning in, maybe closing your eyes and tuning in to the felt sense of your body. From the tip of your head to the soles of your feet. Noticing whatever this body is like right now, no special way required. Noticing the contact of air on your skin. Gravity waiting, rooting the body to the earth. Whether it's on the feet and the hip point, the buttocks, the back, however you're sitting or being. Allowing yourself to be held, held by the surface beneath you. Noticing the inner body. The quality of the breath. Any energy or vibration pulsing or tingling throughout the whole body. Any energetic movements of thoughts, emotions, attitudes swirling about in the mind. And that's okay, acknowledging all of that. Just as it wants to be right now. And then inviting. May this body relax. Perhaps breathing out any excess tension in the upper. And then may this heart and mind relax. Soften. Allowing, encouraging awareness, mindfulness to come to the forefront in a kind and gentle way. Other thoughts, sensations can be there. But really bringing this present moment. Sensations of breathing or any other object, anchor of meditation that you know works for you to be in the foreground, inviting that to fill most of receptive awareness. Saddling the attention, perhaps on the sensations of the body breathing of the belly, chest, or the whole body of the breath, radiant through the torso and even further. Resting, resting the heart, the attention, and this soothing sensation of the moment, breath or otherwise. And tuning in to the heart. Tuning in to the wish, whatever wish is there tonight, today, for this meditation session. Feeling that wish in your heart and body. Perhaps it's the wish to be happy, to be kind, whatever it is. Feeling that wish. And with each breath, maybe on the out breath, sending appreciation to the wish and to the wisher. Thinking of the virtues, the good qualities of this aspiration. Perhaps imagining softly, just fusing through the heart. Or it can feel more distant. Even just softly wishful like wishing from a falling star. May this wish be realized. With each breath, nourishing that goodness. Feeling any sensations in the body, especially at the heart center. So you focus, settle on this wish, this goodness. Breathing. And now calling to mind, a benefactor or an easy person being. Could be a friend, an animal, a spiritual figure of some kind. Of this world or north. And offering them your good wishes. Fueled by this aspiration, perhaps. Imagine it like radiating that light outward. As if they were sitting nearby, or their presence is somehow within range. Or perhaps imagining it like a gesture. The hand or the arm or the face. And offering. Be mindful to use words to focus these intentions. Please feel free to use your own in your own language. And I'll offer words that work for me based on the classical teachings. Shorter phrases tend to build momentum. Longer phases inspire contemplation. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy and heal. May you be peaceful. May you be free. And if you are seeing these, or your own words, or no words at all, the encouragement is to allow a rhythm to develop, perhaps with the breath, or attention or sound. Be safe. Be happy. Be healing. Be peaceful. Be free. And if you are seeing these, or you are seeing these, please feel free to use your own words. Be safe. Be healthy. And if you are seeing these, please feel free to use your own words. Be safe. Be healthy. Be safe. Be healthy. Be healthy. Be healthy. Be healthy. Be healthy. Be healthy. Be healthy. Checking in and seeing how it feels to be offering these good wishes in your own heart. Noticing any sensations, feelings there, but kindness. And inviting this other one, if they aren't already, be returning these good wishes back towards you in whatever form that might take. Perhaps receiving them now and then on an in-breath, an offering on an out-breath, whatever rhythm works for you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now, perhaps with this being still in your presence, including each other in your good wishes, kindness, radiating out, rippling out further beyond just the two of you, expanding outwards to others, the weak ties, perhaps, or the neighbors, or casual social friends, rippling out to a level, to others who matter in little ways, perhaps barely noticed ways. May you be safe. Happy. Healthy. May you be peaceful. Pre. Pre. And strengthening the wish. Sending appreciation and kindness to those beings in your life, to whom you feel grateful and appreciative, kind already, including them, near or far, human or not, as well as these folks on the periphery, radiating in all directions, like starlight, sunlight, or even a radiant warmth. Thank you. Noticing the sensations and feelings, being nourished by whatever's happening, at least by the intention and perhaps also by the joy of the generosity of kindness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now allowing the light to radiate out further, the ripples to radiate out further, including perhaps some who you don't find so easy, and allowing them too to benefit, this radiant aspiration, this wish of kindness. You see, happy, healthy, peaceful, useful, and free. Thank you. Thank you. And now simply radiating these intentions of goodness, kindness, and ophesence. beneficence in all directions, allowing that light, that warmth, to pervade, spread everywhere above and below all directions, that needing to have particular objects, although anything that comes up is welcome to bask in it. Thank you. And now in the last moment or two of this meditation, the invitation is to again gather this netta, this intention, and use them, send them to the aspiration, the wish for kindness itself. Appreciating, radiating through into this beautiful intention. And then letting go of any phrases or special needs to radiate or anything else and just being, being with, soaking in whatever's present right now. So let's begin. Thank you all for the sincerity of your practice. This has become the custom these evenings, these days when I teach happy hour. The invitation is to spend a few moments before we leave the silence of meditation, sending kindness to your sangha mates, your happy hour practitioners. The ones on the screen here, the ones who couldn't make it tonight, to those who may listen later, sending kindness. Send it to the names and the tiles, the video for people who have it on, your eyes closed and just hold them in your heart. Knowing as you send these wishes, people are also sending them to you. Thank you for that. And we have a few minutes for any reflections anyone wants to offer. Can you chat or just raise your, I think maybe raise your hand. I mean still have more than one screen, people. Any comments, reflections, any questions, conclusions, complaints, also welcome. Yes, Neil, hi. At the start, you said something about giving gratitude to the intention. Yes. Could you explain more, I don't know, it felt weird. You're probably not the only one who thought it felt weird. So I think the exact word was appreciation, actually not gratitude. So this is an intentional nourishment of a mental quality. It's appreciating the goodness of wishing well itself. And this is one technique you can use to strengthen that quality. So to put it in neurological terms, I can't remember the name of the scientist who said this, neurons that fire together, wire together. So one of the most powerful ways of increasing the wiring is positive attention, positive regard. So turning the wish of appreciation back onto itself and actually cultivating it by appreciating it for what it is, no matter how good or bad the meditation goes, is a really powerful way to start to strengthen it. Does that make sense? Yes. Yes, that was very helpful. Thank you. Thank you for the question. I'm sure you're not the only one who had it. Anybody else? Questions? Team. Hi. Thank you, Dawn. I just wondered, could we like shortcut that? Just say like, appreciate ourselves for practicing this and wanting this. Is that accurate or is that not quite right? You absolutely can do that too. Some people find it easier to appreciate their intentions than to appreciate themselves. So either one works. I think I even include the included the language, the wish and the wisher. And the wisher is you, right? Or any of us. So you can certainly appreciate yourself for it. And you can appreciate like the fact that you're doing it, right? Both of those. Thank you. Thank you for the clarification. Just an invitation to tune into your body, your heart and notice whatever's arising just from the little exchanges we've had so far. Noticing that. And noticing the response, as I say the next words, which is this is the time and happy hour where we have optional breakout rooms. For many people, it's their favorite part. For some people, it's not their cup of tea. You're welcome to stay in the main room quietly and continue to meditate if you prefer to do that. I just want to encourage you to connect with each other and maybe talk about how the intention or wish to cultivate kindness, to cultivate metta, to do this practice, how it has supported you or what you do to support it. We can talk about anything else you want that's related, but that prompts suggestion in case you want an idea. And I'm going to start the rooms. I will be shifting you around a little bit because it always seems to end up that somebody ends up in a room by themselves. So be patient and I'll see you in six or seven minutes roughly. Enjoy. you you Yeah, welcome back everyone. Welcome back as you're popping back in. Hi. So I'm curious any topics from the conversation any of you would like to share or share how that was for you anything you discovered, maybe, yes, I So I was back home for Thanksgiving, and my three hardest people are there, and I spent 10 days there and for almost all of COVID there was frustration and resentment built up and built up and it was almost like walking on eggshells previously and then this time I've been working on them a lot in these practices. This time it had shifted and I don't know if it was just this energy of doing this or like I was being more aware of their love languages and opportunities to show it if they're at the access service or like, you know, like rubbing backs or, you know, just hot big deep hugs but it like could feel everybody's energy and the love was like warmed up again and back and ways that I hadn't felt in like years. And so it felt. Yeah, at this moment in time it could, you know, all the changing things I don't expect permanence but I'm very grateful for. Yeah, for what it got to be. So, thank you. Very beautiful. Thank you. And, yeah, it's, it's mysterious I'll just share that both from a contemporary science point of view, and from the ancient texts. There's scientific data that shows that show that people who practice this practice tend to experience better social connection and better relationships. And they don't necessarily understand the exact mechanism for it, but it is, I would say it's the energy you're putting out tends to evoke something different right. Beautiful that is. Lovely to hear. Thank you for sharing it. Anybody else. Came up in the conversation. Your own mind and your own heart through practice. Yes Diana. I was sitting, it feeling so quiet at the end. And then in my group of two. I just was reflecting how wonderful it was that I felt so quiet after this. After this meditation this talk, where upon I just kept me happening about how quiet I felt, and I couldn't stop talking about a wonderful this quiet was. And then I got. So, there's something about the quiet to that. I mean, it was, I felt really settled and whatever. I just felt so good. And then I started sharing with my roommate about things and all kinds of things, but I was just feeling at the end, I'll go back to being quiet for a second, just feeling settled at the end, quiet, very quiet, and I probably may not have even needed a group I could have just been just really content with that so with that I'll be quiet. Thank you so much for. And two, like, beautiful that you weren't so attached to the quiet, but right, but that's part of what this practice can confer to as a certain kind of flexibility of not needing to hold on to a certain state, and being willing to share it, and for some of us, not all learning to be comfortable and stay in that quiet can take a while, because it's not most people's natural way of being. Both of those things that you require it and that you were talking about So we are right at the top of the hour. And one minute to. I just want to offer my appreciation to each of you. Thank you so much for dedicating this time to this practice. And the beautiful effects that has on your own heart, whether you're seeing them or not and the ripple effects that has among those you come into contact with. It's really quite something that a group of people are dedicated to doing this. So maybe the benefits of our practice ripple through our lives and hearts, and out into the lives that we touch out into the lives that they touch and out further and further ripples of goodness of kindness. All beings everywhere, without exception, be safe, happy, healed, and free. Very good to be with you. Thank you, Don. Night all. Thank you, Don. Thank you. Thank you, Don. Good night, Barbara.
