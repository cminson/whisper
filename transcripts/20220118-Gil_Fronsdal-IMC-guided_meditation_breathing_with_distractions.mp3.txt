 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So greetings from Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City. And I delight in seeing all the good mornings, the greetings on the chat. And today especially stands out all the locations, the places that you're greeting from. So thank you for being here. Those of you who are both present now, it's YouTube and those maybe who will listen later. So the craft of meditation, of mindfulness. And it begins this journey we're on with the mindfulness of breathing. And so I'm taking some time with it because it lays the foundation for what follows. And also because this is the first time we'll go through the so-called refrain, where it lists the insights that come with well-developed practice. And so I want to go through that a little bit slower than we will do later. But for now I want to go back to these steps to the breathing. A little bit of shorthand. The first is to know your breathing, know that you are breathing, but then also to know the experience of breathing, to recognize it, to have a recognition of the sensations, the characteristics, the qualities of the breath, where you're breathing, what moves, what the sensations are. And this is not a probing, but rather it's a very simple recognition of what is obvious. And as we stay grounded and become more centered on the breathing, what becomes more obvious becomes more subtle. And we start seeing more detail to what's going on. And then the instructions are as we do this, as we center ourselves on the rhythm of breathing, the sensations of breathing, to experience the whole body. And what I'd like to emphasize today about this whole body aspect is that our emotional life and the life of thoughts and distractions all have an embodied quality or a root or association. And this is often, thoughts and emotions often can distract us from being with the breathing. But these instructions to breathe in and experience the whole body, breathe out and experience the whole body, can be inclusive of the very things that make it difficult to be present, the things that keep us distracted or caught up. And the way to do that is to recognize what makes it difficult to be present, the distracted mind or maybe strong emotions or maybe discomfort in the body, pain. And then when we experience the whole body, experience that as well. And you might just experience it as something mental or something emotional. But you're experiencing with this rhythm of breathing in, experiencing the whole body, breathing out, experiencing the whole body. And so the center of gravity is breathing and experiencing the body. The center of gravity is not the distracted thoughts, the concerns we have. And it's not the emotions we have. Emotions are important, but for the purposes of meditation, we don't have to make them the center. They're included in the experience of the whole body. And it has this wonderful thing of being able to move in and out, move through whatever is challenging for being present and including it as part of being present. Rather than letting it be something that keeps pulling us away, we assimilate it. We coordinate ourselves with it. We let it cooperate with the efforts to be here. So breathing in, experiencing the whole body as we breathe in, and including how the experience of breathing might go through or accompany the thing that makes it difficult. And it's particularly useful if what makes it difficult to be present has a physical association, a physical manifestation. So if there's a lot of emotions, chances are there's some place in the body where those emotions are centered or most expressed. Or if there's a lot of thinking, there might be some kind of tension somewhere in the body associated with all that thinking. In the furrow and the eyebrows or behind the forehead or in the jaws or all kinds of places. And then at some point, the last step of this beginning exercise is to relax. Relax the bodily constructs. We do this all, we take our time with each one. There's no hurry through them. But one of the ways to really get centered is to be inclusive of the very thing that makes it difficult in this way that I'm talking about. So to begin, to assume a posture that gives you some sense of being inclusive, that includes all of who you are. For some people that means to kind of sit upright and alert, maybe a little bit tall, a little bit chest open. And to lower your gaze. And as you lower your gaze to turn your attention inward to how your body feels now. And then if it's comfortable, gently closing your eyes. And maybe that allows you to feel your body more fully. And then taking a few long, slow, deep breaths, three quarters full, perhaps. And as you breathe in deeply and exhale more fully, imagine that you're including everything within the scope, the range of that deep inhale. Relaxing everything on the exhale. A little bit imagining that your attention can flow out to include everything as you breathe in. Everything as you breathe out. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And wherever there is some tension or holding, wherever there is some compelling emotion. As you breathe in, feel that place. As you exhale, relax that place. Perhaps each time you inhale aware of a different place in your body. And the exhale, relaxing that place. In a sense, folding everything into the breathing. And then centering yourself more on the breathing. And now getting to know your breathing better. Curious about the sensations. Curious about how breathing occurs now. Sensations that come into play. The rhythm of it, the nature of your breathing. Long or short, shallow or deep. In the chest or in the belly. Feeling where there might be holding in the breathing. Whatever is there, just know it simply. Without worry, but evaluating it. Just letting it be and know it as it is. trafficking. Requesting the next movement. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Maybe as if awareness spreads through your body as you breathe in. Maybe as if awareness spreads through your body as you breathe in. Breathing out, experiencing the whole body. Maybe as if the awareness moves back through the body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. If anything, it distracts you from breathing. And as you breathe in and experience the whole body, experience the nature, the quality, the distraction itself, the movements of the mind, the body, the emotions. Breathe in and let the awareness spread and touch the very place where you're distracted. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. And then breathing in, relaxing the bodily formations. Breathing out, relaxing the holding and tension contractions of your body. By breathing in and experiencing the whole body, it lets you know, feel where it's possible to become quieter, more tranquil. Maybe spreading a tranquility of body through the body. Relaxation and tranquility that touches everything, including what is difficult. Including what is difficult. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing in, experiencing the whole body. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, perhaps letting your breathing, breathing in, experiencing the whole world. Imagine that your awareness spreads from the breathing as you breathe in, out into the whole world, out beyond yourself, beyond the place you're living. And then as you exhale, that awareness returns here to you. And the scope of your care expands outward with that expanding awareness. And then it takes circles of care out into the world. And then it returns to you on the exhale, centering you, connecting you, settling you here, with this rhythm of sending your care, your love, compassion out into the world as you inhale. As your chest expands, belly expands, as your lungs fill, so your care, so your care expands outward. And as you exhale, it all returns back here, centered here on you. May all beings be happy. May you be happy. May all beings be safe. May you be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May you be peaceful. May all beings be free. May you be free. May you be free. Breathing in and breathing out, may we hold each other in mutual kind regard. Thank you.
