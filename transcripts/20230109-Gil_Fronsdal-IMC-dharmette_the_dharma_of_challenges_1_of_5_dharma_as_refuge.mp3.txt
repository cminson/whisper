 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So most of these mornings that have come down to IMC for the last three years, technology has mostly worked nicely. Sometimes it's been the challenges. And it's mostly working today. The standard of what works and doesn't work is, you know, is, you know, optional, what we consider the standard. But, you know, I'm sorry that I feel a bit late and here we are at IRC. And there's also there's some wonderful coincidence that we were a little more challenged. We were challenged and we received some help here at IRC and other places with Kevin sitting up to Zoom. Thank you. Because what I want to talk about are challenges. And our lives are full of challenges. And I think I'd like to do that for a while now. And this is a teaching's morning teachings here. Last year I went through. Then was not upon a satya last year. And then the year before that I did Satya Patana. And there's a way in which those often the teachings of the Dharma, can easily kind of just give the presentation that is just an easy thing to do. Just some of the classic models of the path of practice that the Buddha gives doesn't really say anything about difficulties. You sit down and just go through concentration states and things just unfold very nicely. But in fact, for most people, maybe all people, this practice that we do in the life we live has challenges, lots of challenges. The Buddha has this wonderful kind of metaphor for the human suffering. He said that all the tears that you have shed in all your many lifetimes is greater than all the water in all the oceans. So that's a powerful statement about the nature of this life of ours, the challenges, the suffering that this, the losses, the griefs, so much goes on in this life that's difficult. And the Dharma practice has been designed in order to meet that, to work with it, to heal it, to move through it, to discover freedom in the midst of this difficult world. And so I would like for a while now to talk about the Dharma practice in addressing the challenges we have. And if I can do this well, I think I'd like to do this a little bit like a progression, that building a foundation for really looking at what is most difficult in our lives and what's challenging in our hearts. Because I think most people carry in their hearts deep challenges that sometimes are buried for a long time, sometimes are very well known. And to become really free in this Dharma practice is not to override those or to push those aside, but that he is to discover freedom in all free everything within us. And it's a lifetime journey, but it's a wonderful journey to be on. So last week I talked about five different meanings of Dharma. Dharma as relatedness, Dharma as action, Dharma as truth, Dharma as teachings, and Dharma as transformation. And I'd like to use those same categories of the Dharma to talk more generally, to talk in an introductory fashion this week about working with challenges. And so for today, it's the topic of Dharma as relatedness, that Dharma points to not so much to things, not too much to the suffering as a suffering, but rather always asking the question, what is the relationship here? How are we relating to it? How is it related to us? The first Dharma talk I gave on an insight retreat when I was still in training to be a teacher was a Dharma talk about the importance of looking at our relationship that we have to our experience, rather than fixing experience, rather than focusing on the experiences from the issue, to really take into account how we relate to it. And sometimes I've said that there's only ever two things. There's what's happening and how we relate to what's happening. But for today, I want to say there are three things. There's what's happening. There's how we relate to it. And then what is it that supports us to relate to it? What do we go to for support so that we can relate to things in an effective way, in a useful way, a healing way, a beneficial way? But this idea of relatedness, how are we relating to this? So if you have some challenge in your life, it's easy to get pulled into the dynamics of the challenge and the relationships and the issues and what has to happen and what the concerns. But we can also step back and say, how am I relating to this challenge? And if we do that, we find out that we might be relating to it with fear. And the fear is different in the challenge. But if we don't see that, then the fear kind of gets entangled with the challenge and it's separable from it. That makes it very much more difficult to deal with because there are these two things going on. There's whatever the challenge is. And then there's the fear. And then where do you put your attention? You deal with the issue. You deal with your fear. So, for example, maybe not a great example, something very silly, not silly, but simple is if you're out driving, you have a flat tire and you're able to pull over safely inside the road. And so the challenge is how to get the tire repaired. But if there's fear that you can't do it, you'll be stuck here, no one will help you, then the practical question of what to do with the tire has not become entangled with the fear we have towards it. And the fear might be reasonable to have, but there are two different things. And so to ask yourself the question, what's the relationship I have to the flat tire? The relationship is fear. Is that the most useful relationship to have? Is there another relationship that's more useful to have? Maybe a better relationship is pulling out your phone and calling for help or something. But when you answer the question, what is my relationship to it? Then you have a chance to question, is this the relationship I want to be acting on? Is this what takes predominance? Or is there another relationship that might be more useful? If instead of being afraid, maybe I should be mindful. Maybe this is the time in my mindfulness practice really comes to bear to really be mindful and present for the fear. So that I stay balanced in the fear rather than losing my balance with it. So the question is, what is the relationship to the challenge? It can reveal a lot and can begin to tease apart the challenge from how we're experiencing what we're doing with it. And not a few times, large life challenges are made much more difficult because of how we're relating to it. And sometimes we relate to things wonderfully. Sometimes there's a sense of being counter-phobic. We step towards the difficulties we have. We're curious. We say, well, let's find out what's happening here. Let me use this challenge as a place to understand myself better, to learn how to be more patient, to learn how to be more compassionate, to learn how to be more wise or discerning or less caught. And so then we're bringing the relationship of practice to it. So how am I relating to this and point ourselves back to how I want to relate to it is I want to take it on as practice. And then the practice I trust. So then in the Dharma practice we talk about then going for refuge. So there's a third thing. There's what's happening, how I'm relating to it. And then what is it that we want to support us in it? What's relating to us? And the Dharma, in a sense, is available as a support. And one of the clearest ways of that is the practice. The practice supports us. The practice has a relationship to us, which maybe is a little bit counterintuitive because I can feel like I'm the one who's practicing. I'm the one who's applying myself. And that's true. But when you apply yourself in practice, the practice then responds. Something inside responds to honesty, to truth, to presence, to care, to compassion. That we bring as we practice, something responds. And that responsivity is something that's coming, that's going to support us. And there are times in life when we can't figure out what we can do for ourselves. Everything seems so difficult, so hard. And that's a time when Buddhists sometimes will go for refuge, will go for the support of the Dharma. And it kind of can take the shape of, this is hard. I'm not sure I can manage this, but I trust the practice. I trust the Dharma. And so I'm going to go for refuge to it. I'm going to rely on it. And it doesn't mean that we become passive. It means that we still offer our practice to it. But we're not caught in the frozen by, I don't know how to do it, or I don't know what's supposed to happen, or this seems impossible. We trust those new largers, holding us. It's not always obvious what that larger Dharma support will be. Sometimes there's many, many different things depending on the circumstances. But it's phenomenal that for me in my life, how often I've been challenged, where I didn't know what to do, didn't know what to say. And I took refuge in the practice. I took refuge in mindfulness to show up and be present. So much so, that one of the greatest gifts for me of doing this mindfulness practice, inside practice, is the phenomenal trust that I have in mindfulness practice itself. I trust the practice more than my own mind's ability to understand something, or to figure things out, or to solve all the problems. But I'll totally do my best. But mindfulness means I'll show up and stay present. I'll stay with it and try to be honest, try to feel and be present and recognize what's happening. Stay in the present moment with this. Really, take it in what's happening. Don't turn away from what's happening. But also don't attack what's happening. Don't shut down. Don't despair. Don't collapse. The Dharma says, show up. And trusting it, trusting the mindfulness. And so to say, the relatedness as part of the Dharma practice, we're in relationship. We're in relationship to ourselves, relationship to our challenges, relationship to the wider world. And it's in relationship to us. And something like the Dharma, the Buddha-Dharma-Sana, or that's language you don't care for, the mindfulness practices itself, there's a reciprocity there where we offer ourselves to the practice, and the practice supports us. And it's a very fortunate thing here because it was all up to our own abilities, our own intelligence. It'd probably be impossible for most of us to really work with some of the huge challenges of life and death that this human life brings us. The degree of loss, betrayal, that we go through in this life, it can be huge. And so how to practice with it. So how do we, so what's our relationship to it? And what do we go for, for support, so we can relate to us and support us? So that's this word of the world of relatedness. And it's a protection against getting kind of solidified or frozen in the notion, it's all up to me, it's all happening to me, it's all about me. It's all about them, what they're doing. There's something bigger going on here that belongs to the world of relatedness, relatedness that we all live in. So if you have a challenge today, whether it's small or large, even if it's small, don't overlook it. Even if it's so small that you can just kind of bypass it and not think about it. But if you have some challenges today, ask yourself the question, how are you relating to it? That's not really part of the challenge. But what's the relationship to it? And even if the challenge is internal to yourself, how are you relating to it? What are the beliefs? What are the attitudes? What are the desires that are coming to play in relationship to it? The emotions? And then is there something that you can, that will support you? It's relating to you. Maybe the practice of mindfulness, maybe the Dharma, maybe this Earth, something else that supports you that makes it easier for you to go through it, because you're not doing it alone. You have the support of Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. So I call upon all of this for myself today, a little bit because I felt a little bit confused sitting down here making all this work, but I trusted that the Dharma here and we'd find our way. So here we are. So thank you. We'll see if we can make it a little bit nicer to easier tomorrow. And if not, go to this again. And then Wednesday, I'll be back at IMC. Thank you all.
