The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I enjoyed talking with a couple of you today.
And I feel a lot of love and sweetness and kindness and goodness.
So I think that's who we are.
Who we aren't are all of the selves that come and go and come and go and come and go,
that identify with, I don't know, whatever we identify with successes or failures or people's praise or people's criticisms
or a lot to do with other people, comparisons, these selves, these identities.
That we grasp onto or that we have aversion toward push away.
But we really, in that regard, we are impermanent. Everything about us is completely impermanent.
Changing, changing, every, you can't even say every microsecond we're changing,
because a microsecond can be divided into an infinite regress of more and more and more microseconds.
So we can't really grasp an identity in time, because I don't know if this makes sense to you, but time's not graspable.
This moment's not graspable. This moment didn't have a beginning.
This moment doesn't have an end. It doesn't have a middle.
So there can't be a self that we can grasp in time.
Another way to look at this is that what everything is, what you are is, I mean we look pretty solid and real,
but if we put ourselves, if someone put us under a microscope, a super-powered microscope, it would just appear particles.
We are particles. And the particles, this is by the way in Buddhist Abhidharma thousands and thousands of years ago, teachings,
but now science is saying the same thing that the Abhidharma said is we're just particles. And you can't even find the particle.
When the particles looked at under a super-powerful microscope, the particle itself is made of an infinite regress of subatomic, subatomic, subatomic particles.
And the particles themselves, whatever there is, is mostly space. Anything that you find is 99.99999% space.
So we have these very solid identities with somebody who hurts our feelings and me, or someone praises us, me.
But when we examine, when we analyze in this kind of scientific or these ancient teachings way, we see there is no me.
That's a relief to me. It's kind of a relief. There is no me.
No me to suffer about. No me to get exalted, joyous about.
We can't stop all the me's from happening in our minds.
We can take them with some wisdom. We can take them a lot less seriously.
Those thoughts that are going through the mind are some chemical thing, some kind of...
So these are the three characteristics. We are no self. There is no self.
Everything is impermanent. Everything is changing.
And we suffer because we grab on to me.
And the me keeps changing. As you know, you wake up with a certain me, and you have your coffee, and it's a different me.
You have breakfast, talk to a friend. All kinds of me's keep happening all through the day, different me's.
They change all day long.
But certainly we exist, right? We are here. We are really here.
And what does that mean? What doesn't change? Awareness doesn't change.
We are always awake. Are you awake right now? Are you aware right now?
The light is on. We don't have to turn on the light.
The light is always on.
There might be a lot of obscurations to the light.
There might be like...
I've heard this thing like over the light bulb is like different cutouts or something.
Anyhow, it shines. It looks like this or that. It could look scary.
It could look heavenly or whatever. But still, it's just the light.
I didn't express that very well. Maybe you get the idea.
So the light of our being is essential, who we are.
And Buddha's last words were, be the light. Simply be the light. Be a lamp unto yourself.
And other essential qualities that don't ever seem to change or that we want to be happy.
I asked the question when we started today, what do you want?
We want to be home. We want to come home. We want to exist in some kind of truth.
And this wanting to be happy, it can take a lot of superficial manifestations like...
But underneath all the concepts about what will make me happy is this essential longing or desire to have some well-being, to be peaceful.
It's why we meditate. It's why we do spiritual practice. It's like why we came today to be with each other.
It's in everything we do. It's in why I crossed my legs a little happier that way.
That will be our guide, what we do next. It's in every breath we take. It's love, essential love.
So it really helps to recognize this in ourselves, recognize our goodness, our love that's with us 24-7.
It's as much a part of us as our beating hearts every moment of every day wanting to be happy, love, wanting our loved ones to be happy.
And awareness. You could say, we are loving awareness.
Okay, thank you.
