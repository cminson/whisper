 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Great. So, let's settle in and begin by arriving and meditating together. I'll give some light guidance to help us arrive, settle, really arrive. And, yeah, we'll take it from there together. How does that sound? Yeah, great. So, let's begin. Begin again and again, each moment, each moment a new beginning, each moment a new arrival. Arriving, arriving here in this body, in this moment in time. Fresh, new, full of possibilities, this moment. And the same way that if we have a cup with stale, cold tea in it, we have to throw it out to make room for fresh, new, warm tea, if there's stale thoughts, regurgitations. Let's release them, just for this period. Release them now. Ah, making room for fresh stability, goodness. Feeling this body, our sit bones, the cushion or the chair. If you're sitting on the chair, your feet on the floor, if you're on the cushion, your legs touching the earth. Hands on your lap, all these touch points, which we can always come back to, these touch points. Resting, resting in this body, resting in this space that surrounds the body, resting. And including everything, including the sounds, they're not distractions, they're just sounds. They're just sounds. Let your heart relax, release in the midst of all this, the body breathing, pulsating, alive. The sounds, the energy in the room and the quiet, the silence between all the busyness outside and inside. Tune the frequency of your radio as if you had a radio internally. Tune it to the calm, the channel of the calm. There is this calm in between everything else, all the noise, all the chatter in the mind, all the chatter inside, outside. Yes, those are there too. All the news and this and that, but tune in right now. Tune into the silence between the noise that holds all the noise, holds it all. Let the breath, the sensations of the breath in the body guide you. Connecting to the breath in the body, relaxing, relax, relax the body. Receive the breath, not tightly but spaciously. Oh dear breath, enjoying the breath, enjoying the breath. Oh dear breath, enjoying the breath. And if the tuning of the attention drifts, if it drifts like an old radio that drifts to other frequencies of thought and plans and worries, a return, re-engage again and again this moment with the breath, with the silence that holds it all. Permeate everything internally, it's there, you know it's there. Trust that it's here, it's already here. Thank you. Enjoy this breath. Can I enjoy this breath? How can I find a way to rest? Collect myself, gather, gather myself. The entirety of the length of the in-breath. Cozy, sweet, spacious. And bend the out-breath. This practice is not about forcing. It's about learning, finding ways for joy, contentment, enjoyment and there is plenty. Right here, relax and receive. Find a miracle this body is alive and breathing. Go When the mind, the heart is content where it is, it doesn't want to drift anywhere. See how you can bring an ease to the body, relax the body if the body is tight. Tune into the joy, the delight of just quietly sitting and breathing. It's not a forcing, it's finding the delight, the contentment that keeps us here. It's not about forcing. It's not about forcing. It's not about forcing. Letting go, letting go of thoughts, not now, not now, thank you. Back another time, not now. Just this breath. Just here. Remember what you want. Can I slow down enough? Can I slow down and fall in love with the breath? For just a moment. May not even know what it means but can I be curious? What does it mean to fall in love with the breath? For just a moment. With Valentine's Day coming up next week, make the breath your Valentine right now. Appreciating, honoring, loving, delighting in the breath. With Valentine's Day coming up next week, make the breath your Valentine right now. With Valentine's Day coming up next week, make the breath your Valentine right now. Can you make yourself this body your Valentine, not another? This being who is you? Whose care is entrusted to you? This being works so hard. You know there are challenges through and through. Appreciating, honoring, loving. With every breath, this dear being who is doing their best, just this breath in this body. With kindness, with metta, being your own beloved other, not another. COSTA And as we bring this sitting to a close, appreciating that you showed up, that you did your best without any self-judgment for what arose or did not arise, you showed up, you did your best. Trust that you have planted seeds for goodness, calm wholesomeness, kindness, and let go of the rest. And trusting in this goodness, together we all share this co-created goodness. We offer it, we offer it to the world. May my goodness, may my attempts, may my engagement serve my own awakening, my own ease and freedom from suffering, my own happiness as well as everybody else's in the world. May all beings everywhere be happy, may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you for your practice.
