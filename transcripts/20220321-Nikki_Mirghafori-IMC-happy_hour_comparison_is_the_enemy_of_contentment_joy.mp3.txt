The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, hello and welcome everyone to Happy Hour. Lovely to be with you. So many
different time zones joining us in this moment in time. So for today's
practice, I'd like to invite us to consider this quote that I heard earlier.
And I don't know who's attributed to actually I didn't get the chance to search
but here it is. Comparison is the enemy of contentment. Comparison is the enemy of
contentment. So it's such a profound statement and I want to unpack it a
little bit and also maybe add some more to it. There are so many different ways
that perhaps comparison shows up, can show up in our lives. And I just as I
said that I just I remembered Gail has this teaching where where he comes with
an artificial flower or something holds it up and says you know here's a flower
and then oh yes here's here's a similar one that just came through. Theodore
Roosevelt's a comparison is the enemy of joy. I like that too. That's a good one.
Comparison is the enemy of joy. Yeah joy and contentment both. So I'll talk about
both. How's that? This is great. Thanks for sending that to me Steve. Great. So
Gail has this teaching where he shows up with and or the flower sometimes and
the sense of oh yeah the flower the flower is perfect in and of itself. The
flower is perfect in and of itself and then brings up another one like a
taller one or you know and then a shorter one and then there's a sense of
like the mind wants to compare or this is bigger small or not good enough
whereas in and of itself it's perfect as of itself given the causes and
conditions of this flower. So comparison can show up in different ways.
Sometimes we compare experiences like oh this soup I'm having right now. No this
soup this this restaurant you know this group I'm having at this restaurant. Oh
this other soup was better and you're always seeking in your mind the perfect
soup the best tasting soup. So you're never satisfied because oh yeah the one
that you had which actually you're misremembering the taste of it maybe
you're remembering to be better than it actually was because I don't know you
were hungry or you were with the I don't know with the group of friends so the
soup tasted really good but that soup was the best soup this just not good
enough the one I'm having right now or as a restaurant or making it at home like
oh it's just like not good enough not good enough so there's a sense of
depletion there's a sense of lack of contentment or lack of joy lack of
appreciation instead of appreciating what is appreciating what is here what
is right now all the possibilities in this soup in this moment in this amazing
soup that this is showing up just as it is and sometimes that soup is us in
terms of comparison we compare ourselves oh that other person who is I don't know
taller and more famous or more successful or has more friends or more
likes on Facebook I don't know just I'm being silly but but use your own
imagination you know has published more written more I don't know is more this
xx comparing ourselves to some other hypothetical person so some other
person whereas each and one of each one of us has unique occasions unique
opportunities unique obstacles unique challenges and in Buddhism unique
causes and conditions we all have a unique cause and conditions so to say oh
well I wasn't born as this other person I mean they are who they are and I am
what I am so how can I how can I be inspired so instead of comparison I
want to bring in the concept of inspiration how can I be inspired to be
the most ethical most kind most giving person I can be to fulfill my potential
and to remember that life isn't about getting we think it's about getting life
really isn't about getting it's about giving it's about giving to others our
life the best way we can live and satisfy to the best way we can fulfill
our potential is to become a gift it become a gift not just to ourselves but
to become a gift unto the world so let that be your measure of of contentment
measure of joy or measure of aspiration is what I want to bring in tonight so
comparison is the enemy of joy as Peter Roosevelt Roosevelt said or as I
misremembered it comparison is the enemy of contentment and again so many
different dimensions of this both in our experiences and also with with things
with events with friends with just experiences in life if we're comparing
always and the other dimension is whether we're comparing ourselves this
person who is me to some idealized version the wrong way of really framing
it I mean if we are bringing comparison maybe it's a way of aspiration oh how
can I be how can I be the the best the kindest I don't know just a sense of
values really thinking of the values not in the way of again getting but giving
so that's the frame I want to set up tonight for our practice and with the
guided meditation tonight as always we'll start by setting settling in the
body with the breath then I'll bring some invitations some invitations and
settling in the moment and just a set of can settle settling into contentment
and joy in the present moment some gentle invitations so that's the plan for
tonight all right let's let's sit together friends so so arriving arriving in
our seat
arriving here in this moment in time in this moment that has never been and
will never be like this experienced through this mind through this heart of
ours the unique mind and heart
landing landing embracing as if we're opening our arms wide wide wide
opening the arms of our hearts wide wide wide
to embrace fully embrace the world as it shows up right now in this body in
this moment this just this not comparing just relishing even if there is
discomfort present and the body or mind can we open up to this evanescent
impermanent
moment in time
and then letting the body relax letting the body land means release here
you
releasing thoughts that arise it's okay thoughts will arise smilingly releasing
them in this moment just returning the awareness of the breath the body this
moment in time expansively letting the body feet to feel to appreciate being
connected to the ground to the earth
just this breath not comparing this breath to the previous one or vying for
the next one just this breath this perfection of this breath right here
this moment fresh amazing miraculous never left before such an odd to even
have awareness to be alive so amazing to be alive of consciousness of this
breath these sensations
you
you
you
just this breath amazing miracle of this breath in this moment the entirety of
the breath
you breathed in breathed out
you you the miracle of this breath reverberating through the whole body
softening relaxing every out breath every in breath and lightening and
liveening and live bringing more energy and more light
you
you
you
you
you
you
now is it possible as we're sitting being breathed to open up to gentle
appreciation gentle appreciation for whatever is arising in the sphere of
experience right now most prominently the breath sensations of the body sense of
aliveness maybe any pleasantness in the body maybe there's pleasantness
associated with the breath being breathed gently swaying
maybe the mind realized this moment is actually pretty good
maybe there's more contentment available in this moment more joy than I
realized if I just open up there was gently not pushing just opening up to
the possibility appreciating the joys that delights pleasantnesses comforts
even if coexisting with this coverage
overall spaciousness that's here
the mind here not in the past or future just here
just gently enjoying the breath
you
And if there's a part of your mind,
your heart, that's negating, that's fighting against this moment. It's okay. Include that part.
Include that part. Don't throw it away, shut it out, fix silence. That part is included also.
If there is any, no part left out. No part left out.
And as we expand, opening up to appreciation,
in this moment, whatever is arising, pleasant or unpleasant included, appreciating just as it is.
Can we open up also, expanding from this moment in time,
expanding temporarily, not with our thoughts, not thinking, but the possibility of all the causes
and conditions that have brought us to this moment in our lives. So many of them gifts,
good fortune, we consider in our earthly terms some of them challenges.
All of which uniquely, all these occasions, so many that perhaps are neutral, just the zeitgeist
we're born in, parents, upbringing, culture, random coincidences, all these causes and
conditions, so many events that have made this a unique being that is me possible in this moment.
Product of so many causes and conditions, not independent of them. How unlikely was it,
is it that we're even born? That this being who is us should even be here?
Can we appreciate the mystery, the intertwined, the interbeing, interconnected mystery of our
existence? Let there not be a comparison with other amazing mysteries of existence, other
beings with their causes and conditions. Appreciating them, wow, all these miracles, all these points
of light. And this is mine, this light, this light of mine. How can I be the brightest
I can be? Not comparing to others, but aspiring to shine brightly for the sake of myself and
the sake of others, to give, to give my light, my warmth, my goodness, and this brief flash
of lightning that is my life on the cosmic scale. To aspire, aspire, not compare, but
aspire to shine brightly according to whatever my values, the goodness of my values, my north
stars. Let that be the measure of the brightness of my light, my goodness, shining in the world.
Just being embodied, not thinking, just being embodied, letting yourself be breathed, letting
these reflections be breathed in and out, without so much thought, but dropped into the
body, resonating. Maybe only a residue remains, just being breathed.
Buddha said, be a light unto yourself, be a light unto yourself, be a light unto
yourself. Can we be a light? Can we be a light unto ourselves and others?
Making the measure of giving, making giving the measure of our success, not getting, shining
our light, shining our light of goodness. May it be metta, gladness, goodwill for others,
generosity, kindness, compassion, gladness, joy, letting our joy shine brightly for the
sake of ourselves and the world. What a beautiful gift to give to ourselves and others, our joy,
our contentment. And for the last moments of this practice period,
honoring, appreciating ourselves for having showed up. If any judgments are arising for
what happened or did not happen, can we be kind? Can we be generous to ourselves for having
done our best, given all the causes and conditions? It's like this, it had to be like this, or
it would have been different. Appreciating ourselves and the gifts of causes and conditions
of being here now, together practicing and sangha, and offering the light of our goodness
to all beings everywhere. May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be sane, be happy, have
health and ease. May all beings be free. Thank you everyone, thank you for your practice.
So we have some time for any reflections that might have come up, any questions, comments,
aha moments, complaints. It's all welcome. Why did you notice this practice tonight around
the theme of comparison is the enemy of joy slash contentment, both internally and externally.
Hi. I'm outside and there's a lot of wildlife where I am. There's a lot of bird life. And
I was kind of feeling into, like I could hear the bees and the birds. And yeah, just kind
of feeling how like they each have their own kind of unique song and call and they don't,
you know, it's like the bee knows what it needs to do, it knows what its work is and
it doesn't. You know, I saw in me one that was like, it was like a bunch of animals and
it was like, you know, an elephant doesn't try to be a dolphin or something like that.
Yeah, so like, it's kind of a sense of relief that comes with that kind of self-acceptance
is what I was feeling.
Lovely, beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing that. It's, oh, it touches me so deeply, your
experience and the metaphors that have come to you. Why did you say an elephant doesn't
try to be a, I forget the animals, but one animal doesn't try to be an elephant doesn't
try to be a bird. It's just that radical self-acceptance. Absolutely. And appreciating the bird you
are or the frog you are or whatever, lovely or the puppy, it just, so that radical self-acceptance
of, yeah, beautiful. Thank you, Radha. Lovely, lovely. Thank you. Lovely. Yeah, Claire, please.
Thank you. I think there's a lot of noise in the background.
It's strange. Yeah, I'm not hearing it because I've got a headset on. Maybe if I take the
headset off, does that help? Yeah, there's a lot of echo. I can't hear you, of course,
but that's okay. That's why I wear the headset. Anyway, the two things that came to mind,
first of all, I'm sure you know this, but not everybody knows. I haven't loved a lot
of church music. What's going on? Are you hearing some kind of other voice? Yeah. I don't know
if there's anything else going on here. It's so weird. I haven't heard a sound yet. I'm
going to shut down and come back in. Okay. I don't know what's going on. Okay. All right.
Thanks, Claire. Yeah, so any other reflections, any other before we go to groups and practice
together? You can also type in chat. If you type only to me, I won't read your name, so
we'll be private. Just read your reflection. If you type it to everyone, I'll read your
name and your reflection. Yeah, such beautiful reflection so far. Love that. Yeah, beautiful.
Here's another one. After a particularly mindless incident yesterday, mortifying and very upsetting,
the idea that given causes and conditions, it could not have been otherwise soothing.
It's difficult to accept such a self if one doesn't feel deserving of it, but I'm working
on that as well. Yeah. Thank you for that reflection. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So many causes
and conditions and such a combination, right? And this is, I think, the beauty of the dependent
origination, which is one way to see the causes and conditions. Actually, cause and conditions
is the superset of dependent origination teaching, which is, you know, so many cause and conditions
coming together, giving rise and accepting that if things could have been different,
they would have been just brings freedom. And of course, one of those, and usually actually
people ask at this time, well, so how about volition? Well, yes, volition is one of those
cause and conditions that we put in place. And we make it more likely that we behave
more mindfully or more kindly, you know, it's all of those are set into place. It's not
like everything is on our shoulders. I will behave this way. It's all causes and conditions.
Another reflection may we all have people in our lives to acknowledge and celebrate our
special gifts and skills along with us. Yes, may it be so. So I'd like to invite us now
to turn to practice together and started to give more invitation, more instructions as
to how to be in small groups, as people have said, it brings more of a sense of safety.
So let me just say a couple of words about groups before I set them up. So, so you'll
be in about in groups of roughly size three, depending on where the chips fall could be
two to four. And the invitation is that what you have practiced now silently with your
eyes closed. Here are these wayfarers like you, these travelers. Now you get to connect
if you wish. It's a very sacred, beautiful opportunity to connect. It's not just go talk
amongst yourselves, people's is, oh, yes, honoring, honoring yourself, honoring each
other just for a few minutes, and sharing as little or as much as you wish about your
practice and holding witness. That's a big part of it. It's about giving. It's not
about impressing, not about educating. It's about offering, if you wish, what has come
up for you as to support you and others as a gift to hold present, to hold presents
for them. Also, witness them see their beauty just as one reflections that see their special
gifts, special cause and conditions to see that. So this is really the opportunity of
the groups. And please speak from your own experience, not comment or manage or other
people's experience asking questions, but not serving as a facilitator either just staying
with your own experience and honoring others. And maybe they offer their silence. Maybe
that's what they need to offer tonight. And that's okay too. And you can start with alphabetically,
if you wish. And maybe we'll do spiral. So each person will say in nugget instead of
doing a long monologue, which is sometimes we do, just share one nugget, one thought
of what came up. If you have like five nuggets, just share one. The other person makes person
in the alphabet first name will share another nugget if they wish or they say pass. And
then the next person and then we'll come to you just go around a few times this way. It's
called creating, going around to see what happens. So, so I will create the breakout
rooms now with here we go. Okay, so in here we go. Okay, I'm going to open them. Take
care of yourselves and each other in kindness. Here we go.
Come back everyone. The rooms are closed. Everybody's back. We've got just a couple
of minutes for any reflections. I see two hands just shut up. Okay, Richard, what's
up?
I understand what you say by comparison and sense of like I used to be better or other
people have more than me, that kind of thing. There's also the kind of reframing of there
are a lot of people have a lot of people have it a lot worse than me. And, and, or there
are a lot of people in my boat right now, which is a really powerful.
There's a lot of people in my what right now?
In my boat. I mean, who share the same whatever the services, you know, that really sort of
like, depersonalizes things.
Right, right. Yeah, yeah. So, so your question is what about that is, yeah, yeah. So it
really depends. It depends how the spirit in which that is taken. Because sometimes
if we just get into the comparison game, it could go like, Oh, gosh, like, wow. Lucky me,
I'm not I'm not them. Right. Sometimes it can be pity. Sometimes it can be like, not
very helpful. You just, just don't go there. But what you're saying is slightly different
the sense of common humanity. Oh, kind of opening the heart. So I'm not quite sure if
that's comparison. It's just a little bit of appreciating the challenges that other
people have. So maybe that's how I would put it a little bit. Yeah. Thanks, Richard. Excellent
question. Neil, please.
So how do you like enjoy physical pain? Right, which yeah, very, I mean, you know, be grateful
for the current moment if it is dominated by physical pain. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's
a very good question. So I think the crux of it is this, it's the dominant dominated
or perceiving it to be dominated. I think pain can sometimes limit our minds and having
had plenty of pain can limit our mind to think that that's the only thing there is that the
experience is dominated by pain. So what I'm inviting you and I was inviting you gently
to open up to and a little bit here, this again, this meditation and quite focus on
it primarily, but that there is so much more present, the pain can be here also, but there
could be so much more present. So appreciating the monopoly of everything there is. So that's
what I'm going to invite you when there is pain present in the body, back pain, intense
pain, see if there is more, there is more spaciousness around it that can hold it all
so that the mind doesn't get tied around just just that. That's my invitation for you to
explore, Neil. Thank you. Thank you. And this is our last, I think we're out of time. Okay,
quick, if you can make this quick. Just curious about how to work things out with comparison
minds. Because I think that I am just like so many comparison mind about instead of appreciating
the process of where I am at my in this time. And I'm just comparing the other person, oh,
he will be here and here and here. It just makes me suffer. Yeah. So it's good that you
see that comparison is making you suffer. And the question is like, how do I work with
it? I think part of what I shared all evening or not all evening, but this hour is about
ways to just not go there, bring the mind back, bring the mind back. And if your mind
is really used to comparison getting into that game, it's going to be like mindfulness
like come back, sweetie, come back mind. Just don't go there, sweetie. Consider the perspective
of causal conditions. So it just has to be reoriented, reoriented, reoriented, until
it becomes the the proclivity of your mind. So not even in a meditation, just in real
life, in real life. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So dear all, thank you so much for your practice for cultivating your heart, your mind for
your own sake and the sake of all beings everywhere. May all beings be well. May all beings be
free. Thank you. And now I stop.
