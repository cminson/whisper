So just a small note of normalizing experience. The first day of retreat tends not to taste like freedom.
Just as a FYI.
Yeah, it is no joke often.
And as we were just sitting, I remembered this nine years ago and was a junior teacher teaching a big retreat in the desert with Jack Cornfield and it was a huge hall and sitting up front.
I think it was the first retreat I ever ever did, you know, is teaching and and so I'm sitting in the front and as a big group of 150 odd people, and it was hot that year.
And for whatever reason, we decided to forgo the air conditioning and we were just like, all right, we're gonna, we're just gonna be a quantumist with it and I remember the first day I'm sitting up there, and I'm just like, all right, Matthew.
Just, just don't fall asleep. You know, it's too many people out there. And so you're supposed to be dignified. Come on.
And not only did I fail in that aspiration not to fall asleep, I like over and over the course of that day like crumbled almost into like a fetal position, drooling kind of level of sleep that was the situation.
And so all that is to say, if it was like that or even better than that, all good.
Yeah, it's like the idea of freedom is different than the practice of freedom.
The idea of freedom is like, there's something out there, and then the then distinguished from that thing out there is this whole situation. Yeah.
And there's not that much that feels free. And the idea of freedom says like well, let's just have this kind of grand intention to be free and then we're going to like get there somehow.
The distinction between how we feel and the grandness of that vision that just this chasm and actually reinforces the sense of alienation actually compounds the sense of confusion, suffering.
That's the idea of freedom.
The practice of freedom is not some grand aspiration to be totally free of dukkha in this moment.
The idea of freedom is to look for any way any small subtle way that I might be more free in this moment any small way in which I've mistaken the doors of dukkha for walls.
Yeah, any way in which I feel like just hermetically sealed in this like bubble of suffering.
No way out.
The practice of freedom is just to just to like run our fingers along the inside of that bubble of suffering gently like looking for the seam.
In every bubble there's a seam somewhere.
And we just like patiently run our fingers along the inside of that bubble.
Maybe we put down the grand aspirations of may I be completely free of suffering right now. That's just compounds Sakaya Diti compounds the sense of self compounds the sense of being persecuted by dukkha.
That's just compounds the sense of real doubt.
And that doubt runs, it runs deep, it runs deep there's a little part of us that that always suspects that we are the exception to the Buddha's rule.
You know, yeah, they talk about freedom but they haven't seen this.
Or maybe this is, maybe this is another kind of con of some kind.
That doubt runs, runs deep.
So, we don't look for the kind of grand explosion, the idea of freedom, we're just like, okay, is it possible to be a little bit more free in this moment.
Is it possible to be a little bit more free.
Sometimes that looks like we're like, you know, in first gear, driving up a very steep hill.
And a little bit more free is just to say like, okay, this is what it is today. This is the first day. This is what it is.
And other times the gesture of freedom will look different.
But we just keep looking, yeah, where the wall of dukkha becomes the door.
We just gently, gently press.
And sometimes freedom accrues in a more dramatic way where we know 100%.
Wow, I don't know where that came from but I dropped something.
That's beautiful.
But I would say more, more of the freedom on this path comes in indetectable ways.
Yeah, we don't even notice it while it's happening.
We just make this subtle gesture, this subtle practice of freedom.
And then at some point we look back and there's a recognition of like, oh, I don't even know when it stopped, but I don't quite suffer in the same way I used to.
Suzuki Roshi said it's the difference between getting wet in a rainstorm and getting wet walking through the mist.
And he said when you get wet walking through the mist, it's very hard to dry out.
So, yeah, may we, yeah, no, may we not be free from suffering.
May we be a tiny bit freer.
And may that door swing wider and wider open.
It's good to be with you.
Thank you for your practice.
Yeah, yeah, I feel that we don't just like sometimes joke that's like not how that's not just our attempt to get off the phone, you know, say thank you for your practice, it's like, it's real.
Yeah, I feel it.
We are all, we inter penetrate.
And so, yeah, we're in each other's minds.
We have impact each other.
And I'm, I'm grateful for your practice.
So,
it's time to rest.
Please, please rest and fear.
If energy may be your practice or find some way of keeping some continuity.
Yeah, well, we'll keep going, keep going in the morning.
Thank you.
