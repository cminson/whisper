Samādhi (5 of 5)  Equanimity as the Fruit 
Drops   
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on April 10 , 2020  
 
 
Good morning again. I‘m very happy to be here with 
you. The theme is samādhi. Today’s talk  is the last of a 
five-part series , part of a longer series  on the Five 
Faculties. Next week, w e’ll talk about  wisdom,  the last of 
the faculties . I’m starting a retreat tomorrow , so I’ll  
include the retreatants  in these talks . And because of 
the retreat, I’ll be giving  another  talk on Sunday morning 
at seven . Those  of you  who want to listen this weekend  
are welcome to come. Perhaps Sunday’s talk will be 
more of a general introduction to th is theme  that we’ve 
been  doing.  
 
So, samādhi . I like to think of samādhi as being our 
birthright. It’s closer to a natural state than how most 
people live. I suppose everything we are is a natural 
state, but samādhi  is a natural state  in the sense of 
being  outside of our artifice . It’s outside  of the ways we  
interfere,  get attached , make things more complicated 
or more contracted than they need to be. Samādhi 
happens when we relax all our artifice , all the artificial 
ways of constructing , being , protecting , pushing away , and holding on. We simply  settle into a very relaxed , 
deep,  attentive  way of being.  The process of settling 
and discovering a natural state of being has a path . It’s 
an unfolding that comes  from ordinary life for many of 
us. That path has been the journey of this  past week.  
 
Monday ’s talk  was the  about the  process of  initiating  
concentration  – the beginning of th e process  that we do 
over and over again. We center ourselves in our 
experience and let go into it. We let go of the things that 
take us away and keep us scattered and distracted . We 
can then begin to have  the experience of an 
undistracted  mind, an undis tracted  body and mind. 
Once we begin the process, we have the capacity to 
feel what it’s like to be centered, to feel h ere, connected  
and focused . We may still wander off a lot , but we have 
a foundation to begin working with.  
 
Then , we have initial and sustained application of our 
attention, an engagement of ourselves with the 
experience. I liken this to pushing a scooter. We push 
off, and then we coast for a while until we need to push 
for momentum again. We apply ourselves . Connect to 
our experience . Then, we sustain ourselves  with the 
experie nce over time. We ride the scooter,  coast ing 
along, trying to stay present. And o f course , at this 
stage, we’ll wander off . That’s  ok. Don’t fight it . Don’t be 
upset  with it . Just come back , give yourself another 
push on the mindfulness scooter , and move along  some  more .  
 
As we begin to stay more and more in the present 
moment in a concentrated way, the  amount of  time we 
can sustain concentration builds  – from a few seconds , 
to many seconds , to minute s, to longer. At some point , 
the movement of being present and coming back 
supports the mind’s ability to become collected, to 
gather together , to become unified. All of who we are 
becomes included or held , open ing to this experience of 
samādhi. The idea of gathering together is a classic 
image , but that  image  might imply grabbing hold of 
something and pulling it in.  
 
Sometimes , I think of the unif ication of samādhi as a 
continuous opening up of awareness , so that it 
becomes broader and broader. Then, e verything works 
within that awareness  in a harmonious way. I like th is 
sense of awareness becoming more open  for many 
reasons. One of the reasons  is that this sense  of 
opening goes along with the idea that samādhi  is a gift. 
We have to allow something to move through us. We 
have to allow ourselves to be changed  by the practice of 
mindfulness and concentration. I f we’re always on top of 
it, waiting for something to happen – like a cat at a 
mouse’s door, we’re interfering. We have to settle back 
and allow  something to occur.  
 
One of the things that  begins  happen ing in this flow, this unification, this continuity of  practice, is that there are 
wellsprings  of well -being,  good feeling,  niceness, 
pleasantness,  joy, and happiness.  Sometimes  in 
meditation,  this joy can be quite strong  – like rapture or 
euphoria. But e ventually , joy moves to a very deep, 
sublime, peaceful  kind of  happiness and contentment. 
As we become more content and happ ier in this state of 
being , it can feel more like a natural state  – more 
natural than anything else. Rather than leaving the real 
world, we’re  actually entering the real world. This is a 
way of  being really  integra l – the integrity of being  
prese nt.  
 
This brings us  to today ’s topic . Classically , in Buddhism, 
the movement is for  concentration practice  to bring us to 
a state of peace or equanimity . It brings us  a deep , 
abiding , sense of evenness , openness , presence,  and 
peace with what ever’s  happening. Rather than 
concentration moving into some kind of rapture, it goes 
beyond that into a state of deep equa nimity. The value 
of that movement is  that we’re  not trying to develop 
samādhi for its own sake.  
 
In Buddhist practice , samādhi is a foundation for seeing 
things as they are. That ’s one of the goals of 
mindfulness, of concentration, of the liberating path of 
Buddhism . That goal is  to see things as they are , to 
really be able to connect , to have a  deep insight , a deep 
discernment , a deep recognition , not only  of what’s  happening , but how it’s happening . We can see  how 
we’re  attached and how we’re  free – see the deep 
underlying processes  of direct experience  upon which 
we build our experience. It’s like going down to the 
foundations and seeing what’s  really going on. To do 
that takes a lot of settle dness, a deep settle dness , and 
an openness .  
 
I liken this wonderful peacefulness, this settle dness, this 
equanimity , to an open hand. We’ve  released the fist of 
the mind, the reaching out of the hand,  the wanting, the 
resisting or pushing, or closing up. The hand of the mind 
of aw areness is opened up and flat so that it can hold 
things.  
 
This experience of opening is like  the ripening of an 
apple on an apple tree. There’s  a way of harvesting an 
apple. If you  really  want to know when it’s ripe, you 
don’t pull it off the branch. You gently hold up your hand 
so that it’s taking just a little  bit of the  weight of the 
apple. If the apple  comes loose by itself, then it’s ripe. 
You’re not pulling it. It’s on the edge of th e separation of 
the apple stem from the branch. It’s just about fully ripe, 
and y ou’re  there to catch it , just as it releases.  
 
The idea is to have  a mind that ’s not trying to grab  or 
hold onto , to pull away or push . We allow things to be  
just as they are , with the right kind of  equanimity and  
peacefulness. Just being  with it allows something in the mind to release, to let go in a deep way. Then , with the 
deep letting go that samādhi supports, we have the fruit. 
We’ve experience d the fruit of practice.  
 
That fruit, like an apple, has many wonderful seeds.  And 
even though t here has to be letting go for the apple to 
come free from the tree , if you focus  only on letting go, 
you might miss the wonderful seeds of goodness that 
have always been inside you. You’re  the fruit that ’s had 
a chance to germinate  so a whole new plant can grow. 
A beautiful tree can grow from you. The fruit  that you’ve 
harvested, that ’s ripened, that you’ve received , can 
grow and become many , many apple tre es. These trees 
bear fruit that you can give to other people, give in  
support  of others .  
 
So, to feel, to experience, to smell, to sense – as 
concentration deepens – how it moves toward greater 
and greater letting go, greater and greater s ettling and 
harmonizing, and toward peace, Where’s  the peace , the 
quiet, the stillness  that allows the fruit to fall from the 
tree?  
 
Thank  you. 
 
 
For those of you who would like to stay longer, I can 
take a few questions on this topic of samādhi, or 
questions  about  something else. I  can well  imagine  that there ’ll be more questions than I can answer. I’ll try to 
answer  the two or three  that come in first . 
 
Q1: “What readings would you suggest for further study 
of samādhi”? 
 
GF: I don’t mean to be flip , but I feel  sincerely  that the 
best way to study samādhi is in the book that’s  in you. 
You’re the book to read. Part of what we’re  trying to do 
in mindfulness and concentration practice is  to really 
learn to be present and see what is going on. We learn 
to discern what’s  healthy and what’s  not healthy, what’s  
wise and not wise, what produces more stress and what 
produces more ease an d peace. As we get wiser about 
this, that’s  the book we study. That’s  the topic for next 
week, the faculty  of wisdom.  
 
Q2: “Sometimes when I center on the breath, it leads to 
awareness of a physical trauma I experienced many 
years ago. It helps to shift a wareness to sound and 
other things. Can you comment ”? 
 
GF: That’s really wise. If it seems that it’s really too 
much to be with the sensations , experience and 
emotions  of the trauma, then y es, do something else 
like sound.  It’s very good.  Sometimes , just staying and 
being with traumatic experiences makes it worse . If the 
trauma’s really strong,  it can be retraumatizing. So, you 
have to be very wise and careful with it. There are  some  trauma therapists who are really skilled at working with  
this.  
 
In mindfulness practice, a lot of the practice  is being in 
the body. As we cultivate bod ily awareness, over time, 
the body becomes a strong and stable container to feel 
some of the very difficult emotions embedded there 
from past experience. In addition to  hearing sound s, 
sometimes it’s useful to  spread  the attention  more 
widely  in the body. Find a place in the body where 
there’s  some stability or groundedness , a sense of 
safety and confidence. If there’s  such a place in the 
body, that’s  part of building up the body’s capacity to be 
with the difficult things  that can exist .  
 
It can also be useful  not to see this legacy of trauma  – 
this legacy we feel as we’re being present – as a 
mistake or a problem. We don’t want to rea ct more 
against it. See it as a healthy part of the  process of  
practice , part of a  freeing  that goes on .  
 
One way  to do this is : when these difficult  experiences, 
sensations, emotions  come up, imagine that your 
mindfulness is a soft cotton ball. Gently , come close and 
touch  the places that are really difficult . Just one or two 
touches  to recognize and acknowledge it. 
Acknowledgement is so important. Then , pull away . Pull 
away as far as  you need to get re-balanced . Pull away  
as far as you need  to feel like you can go back into sounds. When you feel balanced again, you m ight bring 
the cotton ball back to touch  it again . Over time , you’ll  
feel safer and more secure, more capable of allowing 
this deeper process of unfolding to happen.  
 
Q3: “How do you know if you have samādhi”? 
 
GF: There are different kinds  of samādhi , so it can be 
hard to know. But you know you have samādhi  if you’re  
really in the present moment . You feel very connected 
to what’s  happening in the present. You feel that you’re  
really wholehearted and settled. It feels easy and 
natural just to be with experience. There’s no forcing, no 
tightness, no pressure , no strain . There’s  a relaxed and 
open feeling and you’re  really there  – experiencing  it 
almost receptively.  You’re just b eing with it, receiving it, 
being settled and relaxed around the experience,  being  
with the experience.  You’re  able to do that more 
continuously , through time.  
 
Thank you  all very much. I’m delighted to be with you  
and be able to share this.  I look forward to seeing some 
of you on Sunday. And on  Monday , we’ll start the faculty 
of wisdom.
