 Well, it's a wonderful sight to see you all here. Thank you. And I'm quite confident that if a moment you could see all the people online, I would think it was equally wonderful to see your faces. Are you still clicking somehow? Okay. So, I did set myself up for trouble today. Just telling you what the topic was going to be and how everything before it was setting up for this talk. So hopefully it won't disappoint you, but it might. Because from one point of view, it's not going to give you anything. You're not going to get anything from this talk. But hopefully by the time the talk is over, you'll be grateful that maybe you didn't get anything. It's like, wow, that's cool. So there was a time with the Buddha, there was a monk who came to the Buddha and said, you haven't demonstrated, manifested any miracles since I was ordained. Get on with it. Kind of the story, the Buddha said something like, did I promise you that if you ordained that I would show you miracles? No. That's not what I'm about here. We're about the ending of suffering. Sometime later, maybe shortly thereafter, the story goes on that the monk disrobed, left the order because he was disappointed in the Buddha. And he went into town and he would go around telling everyone, this Buddha, he doesn't have the ability to do any miracles, nothing miraculous. All he teaches is the end of suffering. And so the word came back to the Buddha about how he was being maligned in town. And the Buddha said, he thinks he's maligning me, but he doesn't know, he's actually praising me. This is really significant, the ending of suffering. If you do go to a block party and after the retreat and your neighbors on the block are great religious scholars of different religions, they've been involved in the religion for years and they're curious about this Buddhism stuff. They say, what did you get from this Buddhism stuff? The ending of suffering. And the neighbors go, oh. Because they get communion with God, oneness with the cosmos, all kinds of wonderful, amazing things. And we Buddhists, what do we get? Not much. The end of suffering. But this idea of end of suffering can seem like in some ways it's a very simple idea. It's so simple that it can be overlooked, how significant it is and how powerful it is, how life-changing it is. And often Buddhists want to have their religion have great things, so it works at the block parties. Or people just want ultimate things, Buddhist practitioners, and they want their ultimate enlightenment, ultimate this and that. And I can be up here, I can give a profound discourse on the liberative, functioning, and manifestations of emptiness. Wouldn't that be great? What is he talking about? But what we're looking for here is something ordinary, really ordinary. It's to see in a new way. And it's often helpful when we engage in this Buddhist practice to start with really ordinary examples that everyone can understand and relate to, because that's really the basis. We're not really talking about something that is meant to be difficult to understand or somehow supernatural or something. We're just taking something ordinary and learning to apply it in all areas of our life. That's what makes it ultimate. But it's not like some strange mystical thing that we're doing. It's really ordinary. So for example, we have here on this property a plant called poison oak. And some of you who might not be from this part of the continent might not know about poison oak. So maybe you're on a walk with one of the resident volunteers, maybe after the retreat is over before it started. And you're talking and you see this beautiful plant with red. This time of year, some of them, if they have leaves, they're red leaves. Wow, that's beautiful red, three little leaves. And so you tell the resident, I think that... Could I pick that so I could have it in my room? And you begin going towards it and pick it because this beautiful little... And the resident volunteer says, well, that's poison oak. A lot of people, if they touch it, they get this bad rash. It can be really uncomfortable. And so in your wisdom, then you don't pick it up. Now if you picked it up first and then the resident volunteer says, oh, by the way, you're holding poison oak. Has a poison that'll make your skin itch quite a bit. You better be not only... And now you might have it on your fingers, you might spread it. If you touch any other parts of your body. So if you're wise, then at that point you drop it. And you're very careful with your hands until you really get it clean. You don't touch anything else. If something's gonna harm you, you don't pick it up. If something is harming you, you let go of it. That's Buddhism. There's not much else that we're doing here. We could put it in wonderful, great, fantastic sounding philosophies and doctrines to build this up. But that's mostly it. Has a little bit nuances, little bit things follow from that. And that's what I'll talk about today. Is it still clicking? Hmm. I go like this. I don't know. It might be the glasses. I'm not sure what's making the sound. But when you move, I hear it. Oh. I often forget my glasses here if I leave them in the table. Thank you. So, um. So this seeing in a new way, if you go on this process, this journey of practice that we've been describing on this retreat, it allows you to see in a little different way. So say that you can maybe follow along in your imagination, maybe with reference to some time in your life where you're approximated, something we were talking about here. Some highest quality process of feeling tranquil, really peaceful. Feeling contented, that sense of well-being. Feeling at home and satisfied and content and peaceful. And perhaps that's a degree of unification, just like you felt like you're really at home here in your body, in the time, the place. You really feel like settled. You're not really thinking about other times and other places. You're just here. Sometimes to make it really ordinary as an example. I've had situations like that after taking a nap in the afternoon. And where the danger of the nap is that when I wake up, I don't want to get out of bed. It's just so content, so happy. I'm happy just to look at the dust and the dancing and the ray of light coming in through the window. Wow. So peaceful, so nice. So imagine that you're here at the retreat where you are and that you are pretty peaceful, subtle, quiet, in a way. All the work of the retreat, the days. Remember how in the first day you're tired, struggle with your mind, different kind of challenges you had just to be here and show up and work with. And maybe at some point in the course of the retreat you actually became pretty calm or settled in a way that you hadn't been when you came. And then in the great wisdom of us teachers, maybe because we're checking a little bit of news and important things, and we discover that there's been a release of a major blockbuster movie that's promising to be a huge cultural phenomena. The world will never be the same after this amazing thing, and you should probably know about it. And it's a wonderful action movie with a lot of humor. A little bit raunchy. But it's still a cultural... This is like... This is like... And we have to tell you about it. Not only that, but the trailer is really good. So we're going to put the... We have a little laptop in the... Or the monitor in the walking hall. And so we're going to show you the trailer with all the sound. And you've just been sitting there so peaceful, so calm. Finally, maybe you have some thoughts, but they're wispy and quiet. You're hardly involved in them. You feel content. You're finally not craving whatever it was you're hoping for or afraid of, anxious about that you're anxious about. You just hear and you hear this proposal that we're going to go watch this trailer. And you say to yourself, no, thank you. I'm not going to go into the walking hall. I'm just going to sit here and be quiet. I'm not going to pick that one up. That's poison oak. No, thanks. So you have a different reference point. There might be other times in your life where someone comes along with the same enthusiasm about this major cultural event and all this stuff. And you're like, oh, quiet, wait. Let's go see it. But you're in a different state of mind here, different reference point. And in fact, to go see the trailer is a loss. You'd really lose something that is really valuable that you... Some people never had the kind of quality of attention and presence that they had here in the retreat. At a recent retreat, we had someone say that in her whole life, she had never felt as safe as she felt for the seven days she was here. That's phenomenal. So you don't want to lose that quickly. And so to some degree, and that's just the degrees, maybe there's a new reference point for you today or tomorrow for what you want to pick up or what you want to drop. It could be that you're relatively quiet and you start thinking about maybe even doing it all along. After every lunch, you analyze the recipes, how they made it, you're going to make it at home. And by the sixth day, say, I don't think I want to do that anymore. But you see the food thoughts coming up and you say, no, thank you. And you settle back again into your more quieter place. There might be certain thoughts that you have that you see them coming when they first arise and you say, no, thank you. There are others that come up strongly, you see them arise and you say, no, thank you, and they grab you by the nose. You're not going to let you go. But there are times where you can feel, you know, oh, I don't need to do that. No, thank you. And so this capacity to see the arising of clinging, arising of picking up, arising of involvement and getting caught in things, the ability to see that changes depending on the state of our state of being. And this process of practice that we're doing here is a process of changing our state enough so we have a radical different perspective to see how this works within us. We may be quiet enough that we can see ways in which clinging, grasping, resisting work that we can very seldom see in our life. Not only that, but we see where the moment of choice is where we can say, no, thank you. Or the moment of choice where we can say, no, thank you to being angry or upset or resisting, which is just other forms of clinging. And so we start seeing, so if you've already picked something up, then you might know more about that you've picked it up than you ever have before. The reference point of some degree of calm that we experience on retreat or peace or subtleness or happiness or freedom, different people, different things at different times. But the degree to which we experience it here gives us a new vantage point, a reference point for seeing how we lose that, how we get caught up and lost in all these things. So that when you go home and your friends say there's a new trailer for a big blockbuster movie, let's go see it. Let's go see the movie. You might say no after the retreat, but you might also say, okay, if it's important for you, I'll go. But you'll know, I'm going to be careful here. I'm not going to rush. I'm not going to get caught up in my usual way of thinking about movies and having smart responses about the movies when it's over. I'm just going to be willing just to go along and just take it in and see what comes and be more peaceful. Because I know, I didn't know that before. I didn't know before I did the retreat how entangled and caught up I am in these kinds of daily life kind of events. And now I can see it more because I know how peaceful I can become. And so we take this reference point seriously. And we can know the loss in the quality of life, the loss in our well-being, the loss in wisdom and care and love that happens when we get caught up and entangled. And so we might start learning how to, if we're picked it up, drop it. If we haven't picked it up, we learn we don't have to pick it up. Leave it alone. All kinds of thoughts, ideas, feelings, all kinds of things will arise and we can let it be. It's much easier to do if we can see just the beginning of how something appears. When the thought first begins, that initial beginning of it, if we can really see it before we're caught in it, then it begins having a life of its own. It's actually a much more opportune time to say, okay, thank you. Just leave it alone. Let it just be an arising thing that floats away. Arising thing I don't get involved in. It's much harder once we're caught in it. And so one of the things that happens on retreat like this, as the mindfulness gets stronger and stronger, we start staying more and more in the present moment. Mindfulness is more established here and now. And it isn't just because we want to be in the here and now, but because it's in the here and now, we can see when something first appears. And then we have more choice. And if we're pretty calm and settled, we don't have a lot of things happening all at once. And so what does come stands out more in clarity. And so you can be more wise about what you pick up, what you get involved in, and what you settle back into a better state of being than the state of being where you're caught. So as we get more and as the practice goes deeper in a sense, or over the months and years that we do it, it's the same principle as don't pick up the poison oak. That's that ordinary. Or if you picked it up, let it go. And if you've caused harm, just clean it up before you go touch anybody else. But what we see and what we're working with and what we engage in becomes deeper and deeper, more and more at the root operating principles of what drives our life. And one of those root operating principles that really grabs a lot of people, doesn't grab people, many people picked up this piece of, picked this up long ago in heaven let go. And so what we learn to see, and there's many things like this, but what we learn to see as we practice, we see the places that we're still holding on. Because we feel the tension, we feel the pressure, we feel the suffering of it. And so sometimes in practice just seeing it until it thaws. I love the language of thawing because that way we're not so responsible. Thinking, I have thoughts up to me, how to where's the little button I push so I just let go of it. But we bring care and love and attention to something that it thaws, it relaxes. And so we're starting to let go of more and more of these things that are chronically held. One of the things that's chronically held for most people, I don't want to speak for you, the individual we're here, but probably a good percentage of you, it has to do with me, myself and mine. It has to do with ideas about who I am, identities that we hold on to, identities we want to, how we want other people to see us. And some of those ways in which we define ourselves are given to us by others. And we have to cope with it. I want to give you a little example of how quickly and easily I took on one of these identities and it shaped me for about 10 years or so. For me, it was inconsequential, but it didn't mean emotionally inconsequential. Was in seventh grade, it was an art class, and I just got interested in drawing my hand. And I noticed I had so many little lines in my hand, so I should draw the lines too. So I was drawing little lines in my hand, with pencil, whatever it was. So the teacher came over to me and looked over my shoulder and said, Gil, you have no artistic ability. I never thought I needed to, or it was never in my mind. There's nothing I cared about. So I heard that, but she was the authority. So I happily took on the definition that I have no artistic ability. There was no, I didn't suffer, I didn't feel bad, I didn't feel embarrassed. It's just like, okay, this is the way it is. Until I went to college and my freshman roommate was kind of like a born again artist. And by the end of the year, by the third quarter of the school year, he had managed to get me into an art class. It turned out I had some artistic ability. And I took a number of art classes and had a blast. I really loved doing it. So that was nice end to the story. But this idea that identity, that definition was handed to me by someone who I thought knew what she was talking about. So some of them are taken on from others. Some of them we assign to ourselves. And some of them, all kinds of things. And so some of them we want to project onto the world. Some of them we don't want to lose. Some of them we don't want people to know them. Know this about ourselves. We hide parts of ourselves because we feel like we'll be rejected if we let people know this part of who we are. Some people develop all kinds of ideas, big ideas about what the true self is. And so they feel very reassured if they have the authentic self, the true self, the essence self, the soul. This is what it really is. These are all from Buddhist point of view, no problem unless you're clinging to any of it. And as the mind gets quieter, more concentrated, more still, one of the functions of that is kind of like inner house cleaning. Because you'll start seeing where the clinging is. Oh, look at that. They're clinging, clinging. And there's some ultimate things to cling to. Like you know, I... What are these Buddhists? What are they talking about? There's no self. I have a self. And then we get into a wonderful philosophical debate. Is there, isn't there, what's going on here? What's the Buddhist teachings? And these kind of... I've been in enough conversations like this to be bored by them. But what's interesting in practice is to watch and see the clinging to these ideas of self, the clinging to the stories. It can be very, very subtle, but eventually we see them. The Buddha was interested in the clinging to these ideas, the attachment to them, including the attachment to the idea that there is no self. That's just as much clinging as clinging to there is a self. So what's the alternative? In terms of self, who knows, but in terms of where the Buddha is, the alternative is not to cling to anything. Let go. So as the mind gets quieter and we see the arising and passing of things, see things coming and going, it's harder than as we see these things to attribute a self to them or appropriate them as a part of who I am, because we see that as soon as we appropriate, as soon as we hold on to them or define them that way or define ourselves this way, we're entangled, we're caught, we're involved, we're losing our peace. It can be so bad that it's almost as good as watching the trailer for an action movie, because people get so spinning out on these kinds of ideas. But just to see the arising and passing and see how we start attributing self, define the self, we make this subtle little movement, that's mine, that's my pain, that's my sadness, that's my happiness, that's my samadhi. And we see that little bit of, like this is mine, is actually stressful. It's a little bit of teeny bit of poison oak. But we see it so clearly that at some point the mind lets go, attributing mind to anything, attributing me to anything, attributing self to anything. And so things just arise and pass, rise and pass. Have you ever been at maybe like the beach, a nice quiet peaceful day at the beach, and you watch the waves coming up along the sand, coming and going, coming and going, washing up on the sand, and the water recedes and some of the water sinks into the sand, and it comes and goes, and I don't know about you, but I could spend a long time just watching it, the coming and the going. So when the mind is really still, peaceful, all the comings and goings of life in the moment can be that, just like watching the waves come and go. You make the waves me, you make the wave self, you don't get involved with waves, me, myself and mine. That's my Pacific Ocean, and everyone should know it. It's just coming and going. And so there's a lot of peace that arises. There's freedom, there's a release of the suffering, the stress that comes from any kind of holding on, tightening, clinging. Now when we get down to this topic of self, and not attributing self, not making self around anything, we're talking about something very deep inside, very profound, that is at the root of some of the deepest emotions we have, deepest sense of being alive, how we participate in this world, it's not just a little bit of poison, no cure on property of IRC. This is something profound that we're beginning to tap into and touch into. So much so that some people get really afraid at this point, because they see that the conditioned nature of self or the provisional nature of self, or they see this selfing that I'm doing, it doesn't really serve me anymore. But I should really let go of it. I came to a point like that in my practice. I saw how much selfing I was living in and projecting and holding onto, and I had no idea how to let go of it. I felt like I knew I had to let go of it, or that was a task or practice. And I really felt like I was sitting at an abyss, on the edge of an abyss, and I felt like oh, I would fall into this terrible abyss. And I don't know, I was afraid. And then I went to my second trip to practice in Asia, and I decided that I needed to help to let go, I needed to do a ritual. So the ritual I did was crossing the international dateline in the plain. And I don't know if they announced the dateline crossing or not, but I don't remember, but I kind of had in my mind, when I cross that dateline, that's going to be like, Mark, that real change of letting go of this attachment to self. And nothing really happened crossing the dateline. But I kind of set something in motion. And a year and a half later, when I flew back, I remembered that ritual I had done, that little thing. And I looked inside, and I saw, wow, somehow over the year and a half of that little, I practiced what I felt like I had to let go of, wasn't there anymore. It was remarkable. So I didn't, again, it wasn't a big bang experience, like see it all go, but somehow it's thought, emptied out. So this is the way of seeing in a new way. To see our experience from a perspective, from a vantage point, where we can see that clinging doesn't serve us. And then to let go. And the happier we are, the more tranquil we are, the more settled we are, the better vantage point we have for seeing this in some deep way. So when the Buddha gave a Dharma talk, I talked about this beginning, he would prepare the audience for giving people the special teachings, the teaching special for the Buddhas. And he'd prepare them by giving a Dharma talk that helped their minds get ready, receptive, free of the hindrances, elated and confident. And so it must have been a pretty engaging Dharma talk. They probably were kind of sitting on the edge of their seat, kind of like, you know, they really pulled into, they probably got concentrated in the Dharma talk. They were really right there. And perhaps being so absorbed in the Dharma talk, I imagine, that their mind was actually concentrated and very still. It was ripe. It was ready and receptive for something. And what it was ready and receptive for was to see what I'm talking about here. Their Dharma eye was ready to be opened and to see how significant it is to understand the arising of suffering and the ceasing of suffering. To see suffering being all the different permutations of clinging, resisting that we have. And so he would, the Buddha taught, the text goes, then the Buddha taught the teaching special to the Buddhas. He taught suffering, the arising of suffering, the ceasing of suffering and the path. So this is kind of like the Four Noble Truths. Suffering, the arising of suffering, the ceasing of suffering and the way to the ceasing of the suffering. And so he was pointing to them, to this experience of being so present that they saw the significance of why insight into the arising of suffering is so powerful. I'm suffering. There it comes. I just started clinging to whatever it might be. It was innocent enough to go, want to pick the poison oak, but then you're so attached to how beautiful those red leaves are. And with that attachment, suffering, you weren't suffering before, but you really wanted, but maybe if I get a glove. I'll take one of the dishwashing gloves. Then I'll be safe. And so that's this way, but if you're really attentive, you can see this, you see the suffering there, the arising of that suffering comes together with the arising of clinging. So their audience were listening and their state of mind was such that they could just almost watch it in their own mind as he was speaking. They could see there is the arising. And if I don't do anything about it, there is the ceasing. But now comes the fourth part, which is the path. And this is really fascinating and important part of all this. So this is a little bit how the Buddha analyzed his own awakening when he was awakened. So imagine that you kind of followed along well enough in this talk and you really appreciate it. Yes, when you're really peaceful and calm, settled, happy, not distracted, really present, but yes, you can watch the arising of a thought and the tendency to want to get involved with it and you're like, oh, you step back, you don't pick it up. That's subtle, even with a thought or some attachment, some desire arises and you're like, oh, you don't get involved. And then you wonder, how can I live this way? How can I live so that I don't get caught in all the caughtness that I usually do? From the perspective of this experience of peace and seeing the arising and passing of things and not getting involved, from that perspective, how can I live my life so that I'm free in my life, so I don't get caught in my life, so I don't suffer in my life? So you think, well, first thing, I think I'd be useful if I stay close to this experience, close to the present moment, so I can see the arising and passing, I can see when things appear. Or if I can't see it to remember that in fact things are appearing and disappearing all the time, I don't see it because I get caught up in my thoughts, I get caught up in my ideas of permanence. But it's a good thing to remember that things are actually much more coming and going than my thinking mind realizes. That's a good perspective that brings me close to this place where I know about freedom. What else would be helpful? Well, I think that it would be good if I lived my life based on intentions that were not fueled by the clinging. What is it that has no clinging in it? In this regard, the Buddhists did realize that the absence of cruelty, cruelty has clinging, absence of it doesn't, the absence of ill will, the absence of greed. So that's interesting. So that would be a good intention to live by. Let me live, have the intention to live without cruelty, without the ill will, and without greed. So that would probably help this process. What else would help? Well, you know, this is interesting how greed seems to be an ill will, seems to have clinging part of it. I think that I see now that whenever I lied in the past, there was clinging in the lies. In fact, when I lied, then I clung even more to other things to defend it or something. So I think that I need to stop the lying if I want to live from this place. So I think being honest and truthful, that would support this thing. And then also, you know, when I used to go around killing people and stealing from them, now that I think about it, there was some clinging there. So I think that if I want to come from this place in my life, I think I have to give up this killing thing. That was not a good thing for me anymore. Sexual misconduct, going around and doing terrible things to people sexually. It's kind of overrated. Now I realize. So I think I'll let go. What about how the work I do, the lifestyle I live? I think that when I look at it, I see that whenever I'm involved in some kind of harming, I think I'm probably clinging to something. So let me try to find a lifestyle that I can live where there's no clinging part of the lifestyle. And then I'm learning about my mind. And I can see that whenever I start having greed, hatred, and delusion, they're definitely clinging. How much if I kind of start doing some house cleaning in there? And maybe not, you know, I'll say, no thank you to those things. Don't pick them up. Let go of them. But then the amazing thing is to discover, wait a minute, there is loving kindness. There's generosity. There's wisdom that seems to be bubbling up in this place that has no clinging as part of it. Wow. What's this about? And the more I seem to kind of let go into this place, the more compassion there seems to be. The more love there seems to be, the more generosity and kindness and wisdom and equanimity. Well, those are good things. I think that this is the very thing that they were talking about. About developing states of mind that help you to see clearly joy, gladness, tranquility, happiness, samadhi. I think those are possible without clinging to them. They seem to be supportive. In fact, they seem to kind of bubble up. In fact, it seems like when I really see the arising and ceasing of things, there's a very interesting thing that seems to be going on there. In the ceasing of one thing and the rising of the next, there's an absence, there's a gap in the clinging. It's empty of clinging. And in that emptiness, there seems to be the appearing of something. What is that? Strange, I don't know what it is. But it seems to be kindness. It seems to be love. It seems to be compassion. When you reflect more, what else would support this kind of peace, a place that I discovered? Well I think I have to be mindful. That's the key. I have to be present. If I'm not going to be present, how can I see all this? I have to learn to really stay close in so I can really be here, to see how it all operates, see how the magic is done so I can not be fooled by the magician. Anything else? Well, I was pretty... I had some samadhi. That really helped. So I think I'll keep working on the samadhi thing. Mindfulness and concentration. So what I just did, some of you probably know, I just went through the eightfold path. What I was trying to do was to demonstrate how the eightfold path is not necessarily something you have to do, but it can also be a manifestation of how a person would live if they were in this settled, peaceful place. A person who doesn't cling in the non-clinging would automatically fulfill the eightfold path. It doesn't... so it becomes a manifestation. Eightfold path is a manifestation of what it's like to be a freedom in Buddhism. What it's like to discover this deep letting go of clinging. The eightfold path is also a practice that we do, but it's a practice that's bringing us into harmony with the goal of freedom. We're practicing, we're enacting freedom in practicing the eightfold path. We're kind of acting our way, behaving our way, get closer and closer to until a time comes when it's really a manifestation of our freedom, manifestation of emptiness. Deliberative functioning of emptiness. So then I want to go back briefly before we end and emphasize again that I'm hoping that all the things I've said, most of the things I've said, have very ordinary corollaries, very ordinary examples. And that you can find them for yourself. And any state of mind you're in, there's probably some way to cling even more. And so no matter what your state of mind is, maybe you can have just enough presence of mind to recognize that extra that's not needed. And then you don't pick it up, you let it go, you put it down. But then you appreciate that very fact, appreciate that it came and it went. It's the nature of coming and going. When the Buddha gave this teaching to people who are ready and receptive, teaching special to the Buddha, after he taught them the arising, the ceasing of suffering in the path, the text says, their Dharma eye opened and they exclaimed, they kind of celebrated out loud. Everything that arises ceases. So even in the most complicated states of mind, to see that something arises, and then even in then, letting it go, letting it cease, that seeing is something phenomenally important. And even though we don't see it all the time, it's a source of faith, a source of inspiration, a source of wisdom, to know that at the root, at the base, things are just coming and going, arising and passing. And the way that I get cut up in my stories, the way I get cut up in my ideas, my clinging, it's very hard for me to always see it. But in fact, that's the nature of this world we live in. And because of that, it's possible to be free. One of the happy times I had when I was doing this practice in Burma was I saw this potential in doing mindfulness. And I saw that there was a lot of happiness that came from this potential, seeing arising and passing, and then not clinging, letting go there. And I thought about, wow, I can be mindful like this in theory. I can be mindful in this way in all circumstances in life. I didn't think I could do it yet. But I, oh, mindfulness is possible to bring to everything. And then I became really happy. That, wow, liberation is possible everywhere in every situation. To really have an experience at a desk, everything is coming and going. No need to cling to any of it. Let it come, let it go. It's safe to do that because when things cease, suffering, clinging cease, you're still left with the arising, the appearance of the Eightfold Path. You're not left with anything except the space within which beautiful, wholesome qualities can manifest for you, can show up for you for how you live your life. So in that sense, I hope I don't leave you with anything, this talk. I hope I took it all away. So that there's space in your heart, in your mind for you to see clearly and space for something to arise, to be there that is independent of your clinging and independent of any and all ideas of self. To be even independent of any ideas of meaning and purpose, independent of any ideas of grand philosophies. What is it? This manifestation, the liberative manifestation of emptiness. So as I was sitting here, just these moments, quiet. There was a thought that arose. I wonder if they understood me. And that thought arose and I just let it go. It ceased. There was a time in my life where that thought would have arose and it would have gotten stuck somewhere. I have two more minutes, I'll try to make up for it and say more. Or something. But that thought arose, it passed. No particular waves in the mind, nothing to pick up, nothing to let go of, just it rose and it passed. May you appreciate all the arising and passing of things and maybe for the next while on this retreat, maybe attune yourself more than you would otherwise with those parts of your experience which are appearing and disappearing. Sounds, sensations of the body, thoughts, feelings, emotions. And those that linger and stay, it might be that if you look more carefully through the magnifying glass on them, you might discover that they're made up of a lot of small arising and passings. Anyways, just kind of relax, be at the beach, watch the waves come and go. See if you can be aware of the rising and passing of things and see what difference it makes and how it might teach you something about non-clinging. Thank you.
