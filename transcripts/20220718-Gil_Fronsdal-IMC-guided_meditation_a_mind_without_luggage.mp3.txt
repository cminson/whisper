 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So warm greetings on this Monday. And I hope you had a nice weekend and happy to be here, starting the day with all of you, the week with you. And this idea of starting, we mark this day Monday as a start, and it's a little bit arbitrary of course, too, in this scheme of natural world to call this a Monday. But we call it a Monday, we call it the beginning of the week, we treat it as the start of returning to something, some people to work. And this points to the conventional nature of things like Monday and beginning and the contextual nature of it, things exist somehow in context to other decisions, other ideas that we have formed. And when we come to meditate, we often bring many things with us. Many of our ideas, our associations, our memories, our expectations, our, you know, it goes on and on, our stories, stories about meditation, stories about what's happening, stories in the world. And it's kind of similar to not just carrying a backpack with us, not just carrying, you know, suitcases of luggage, but some of us carry cargo ships full of along with us into the present moment. And we sit down and it's a cargo ship full of ideas and of ourselves, who we are, what our abilities are, what we're doing, what should happen, what happened yesterday, what's going to happen tomorrow, reviewing the past. I mean, the amount of things we bring both consciously and subconsciously is huge. And so what are the things we do in meditation, are we allowed to do or that meditation supports? You know, we know it's the entry into the present moment, coming to dwell in strong present moment awareness. We're really here just for this moment. But the process of doing that is to involves a process of unloading, at least temporarily, all this luggage we carry, all this cargo we carry with us. And so when we sit down to meditate and take the posture and maybe take a few deep breaths and exhale to let go, you might think of it as having a posture that allows your, kind of like an umbrella, to allow all the cargo to just kind of wash off, maybe. Or you come here to be an empty ship. Or as you exhale, you're letting it all kind of fall away. And seeing how little cargo you need to have to just be here. And it's good to respect the cargo, not to feel discouraged about it, not bring in more cargo just because there's cargo. And if you come with a lot of the past, the future thoughts, then you could maybe see it as a present moment experience. Don't be seduced into the way that the cargo suggests the past, the future, commentary, just present moment experience. So assuming this confident upright posture, whether you're lying down or whatever way you're sitting, you need to just so there's some confidence in the body, embodied confidence. So just let your gaze, gently, gently close your eyes. And then as a way of letting go temporarily, it's not a betrayal of anything, but letting go temporarily of your thoughts of past, future, other places. By taking a few long, slow, deep exhales, long inhales and then long exhale. And as you do so, soften, relax your shoulders. Soften, relax your belly. And letting your breathing return to normal. And on the exhale, continue to relax. The more tense the body is, the more likely we'll drift off in thought. Generally, if the body is relaxed, the more likely you are to be present. As you exhale, maybe relaxing the face, softening around the eyes, the forehead. And if there's energy or tightness, pressure around thinking in the mind, on the exhale, perhaps you can soften that energy, that tightness. And do that three or four times, each time, not very ambitious about how much you relax, but each time a teeny bit more. And then to put aside your cargo for the purposes of being present here, the simplicity of here. You don't need to have suitcases and cargo ships that you bring along, thoughts, ideas, memories, expectations. Breathe with what is here directly in the moment, in meditation. Breathe with it and let everything else recede into the background just here, breathing, sensing, knowing the moment. Breathe with it. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. And if you have a lot of luggage with you, know it clearly. This is luggage. This is what I'm carrying with me into the present moment. This is what I'm carrying with me into the present moment. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, to consider what it's like to shake hands with someone or give someone a hug. And your hands are busy holding the suitcases and luggage and all the stuff. It doesn't work so much to help others to hug them, to shake their hands. We have to put things down. And so at the end of the sitting, to imagine what you would put down, to be present with others in friendship and kindness, with love and compassion. What do you need to put down? There would be the equivalent of being generously, lovingly open, empty handed. Generously open minded, empty minded in a certain way. May it be that the way we put down our luggage in meditation shows us a way of being with the world, being with others, so that it's easier for us to care for others, easier for us to be concerned with the welfare and happiness of ourselves and others. May it be that we walk into the world empty enough of cargo that we can be a conveyor of care. May we bring to this world happiness, safety, peace and freedom. May all beings be happy. Thank you.
