Greetings friends, greetings.
Wherever in the world you are, good morning, good afternoon, good evening.
I'm joining us this morning from Mountain View, California, unceded Oloni land.
And lovely to see all the greetings and hellos in chat as we join each other to practice.
So we've been exploring, we've been practicing this week with, with, um,
cultivating compassion and the way classically it's done.
It is expanded in concentric circles, starting with ourselves,
and then benefactor friends, neutral person, the person we have challenges with,
and the last category is all beings.
So today we have arrived at the last, at the final category.
And this category, category of all beings, um,
is a beautiful one, is basically compassion.
360 degrees, it includes everyone, everything and everyone, including yourself,
includes all the other categories.
It's basically a heart that is expanded, a heart that is expanded in, in its capacity to be kind,
to be compassionate when meeting challenges.
So, so without further ado, oh yes, and one more thing I want to say.
There are different ways, there are different ways that this last category,
there are many different ways that it is cultivated and, and there's not,
with all these practices, there are so many different ways to the temple,
and we will choose one way for our practice today.
So not the only way.
Okay, so with that, let's arrive.
Ah, let's arrive.
Our body, with awareness, with kindness, compassion,
if there are any challenges in this moment, in this body,
to meet them with care, to soften around them, soften into them,
let the breath move around them.
Letting the breath be breathed,
received in your abdomen,
and in your whole body, calming, soothing,
centering.
Feeling this entire body.
Feeling this entire body.
Breathing.
With a sense of care, softness, goodwill,
or the body, or this being who's me.
Imagining that the breath was perhaps moving in and out of the center of your chest,
what's called the heart center,
associated with a place of emotions.
Imagining that the breath is coming in and out of the chest.
And it enlivens as we feel the breath there, it enlivens
a sense of kindness, care.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, hello again. Seems like I got disconnected from the internet.
So I'm going to give a moment for hopefully the...
You see, yeah, seems like folks are coming back.
Okay. Well, conditions are like this right now.
Challenges. This is a great lesson to practice.
This is a great opportunity to practice compassion for the difficulties.
Here I was happily guiding in meditation on my own,
and here you were struggling, and oh, we're disconnected. What happened?
So, oh, yes, instead of coming up with, in our minds,
cases to have compassion 360 degrees, here is an example.
There are so many different ways our minds can react.
So many different ways our minds can react.
And of course, compassion is available. Oh, this is difficult. This is difficult to be cut off in the middle of this meditation,
in the middle of our community time, and compassion for the challenges,
and keeping our equanimity, keeping our stability.
So let's begin again. Let's begin again.
Let's begin again. Every moment a new beginning. Every moment a new beginning.
Every moment a new beginning. So I think I have a sense that the connection was lost pretty early on.
So we're exploring today. We're practicing compassion 360 degrees for all beings everywhere, including ourselves.
So let's begin again. Each moment a new arrival, each moment a new beginning.
Let's arrive in our bodies.
Let's settle.
Feeling our breath.
And feeling this body settling. Feeling this body settling.
With kindness. With kindness towards.
Kindness towards itself.
And kindness towards others. Kindness towards circumstances.
Compassion towards oneself, other circumstances.
Things are challenging in this human life.
Surprises, change. Things don't always work as we expect them to.
Can we have a sense of stability in feeling our feet on the earth, our set bones on the cushion?
And breathing, breathing.
And having kindness, compassion for this being who is me, this body who is me.
If it felt confused or uncertain or frustrated or if there are any challenges in the body, pain.
Or other emotions connecting with the stability of kindness, the stability of care.
Perhaps imagining that there is this bright light, bright orb of light.
In your chest, in your body, it shines this golden yellow light of care.
This golden yellow light of soothing kindness, compassion.
At whatever, whomever this light comes in contact with, it brings peace, it brings ease.
Notice that this light in your chest first and foremost shines through your body.
Touching your whole body, all the areas of your body with this soothing, compassionate light.
And then it shines out.
If there were a, perhaps imagining a curtain around you.
If the curtain was opened, curtain 360 degrees for this practice, this way of exploring it, the curtain was opened in front of you.
You acknowledge this compassionate light streaming, streaming to all the beings that are in front of you.
It's not so much an effortful shining, but this light shines on its own.
The ends of the earth and beyond, letting your light shine.
As if the curtain now around you's opened up further and the area to your right, all the beings to your right hand side.
All humans, all animals, two-legged, birds, the swings, all fish, insects.
All sentient beings.
May they all be well, may they be free from challenges, suffering, may they have resources they need.
They meet difficulties in opening the curtain to the back, feeling, oh, feeling this light energy of goodwill, kindness, or mating behind you.
All the beings.
May they be free from sorrow behind me, all the beings behind me.
Spreading goodwill, compassion, not just in front of you but behind you.
And now to the left side, imagining the curtain.
Opening further, disappearing, all the beings to your left.
All the beings to my left, may they be well.
May they be free from sorrow, may they have all the resources they need.
Be well and happy.
I'm feeling also this light shining above.
All the beings above me, all the birds, all being seen and unseen.
All the beings below me, through the earth, all the insects.
On the other side, beyond.
All the beings, all around me, 360 degrees.
This light of compassion shining out, and it's not a forced shining.
You relax into it, just relax and let your light shine.
Acknowledging, witnessing this light of compassion shining, touching your own body first,
witnessing this body of yours that shines out of your heart.
Imagining that this light when it touches, any being, any person, any animal,
planet earth, it brings ease, it brings goodness, healing,
your care, your compassion, flowing with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
By doing this practice, it's okay to imagine or to see with your heart, your mind's eye.
Different beings, different categories of beings.
So babies, may they be free from challenges, from suffering, may they be well.
May all older adults have ease, free from sorrow and suffering.
May all people, may all adults in the middle, may all have ease, freedom from stress, may they have everything they need to live happily.
May all birds, all birds everywhere, may they be free from sorrow, challenges, pain.
May all four-legged animals,
have ease,
and have freedom from pain.
And continue as you wish, your own categories, slowly, gently, not to get overwhelmed.
May all beings everywhere, be free from suffering, be free from sorrow, have ease in the midst of their challenges.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Knowledgeing that all the beings who have been practicing during this past week, not just yourself,
included in all beings, to bring to mind your dear friend or benefactor, as well as the neutral person, as well as the person you're having challenges with.
All of them, all of us, all of us beings, not this planet and beyond, all of us,
have peace and ease in the midst of our challenges, be free from sorrow and suffering.
You must be happy and have ease.
May the goodness of my practice, our co-created goodness, need be a cause and condition for freedom of all beings everywhere, including myself.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
Now as we transition the recordings, if you'd like to put a word about what's arising for you in this moment from this practice of cultivating compassion for all beings everywhere, you are welcome to.
