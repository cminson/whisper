With this talk, we come to the fifth of the five talks on 
the Second Noble Truth , part of a four week series on 
the Four Noble Truths . The primary reference point for 
many of the interpretations of the Four Noble Truths , as 
they have come down to us through  the ages, is what 
appears in what ’s called the Buddha ’s first sermon. 
Some of the popular interpretations don ’t really take in 
all that i s said there about the Second Noble Truth . 
They often  stop and say that craving, thirst  – taṇhā in 
Pāli – is the cause , condition , source, or origin of 
suffering . That is a useful interpretation. Having that 
idea can help people investigate their lives effectively ,  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 2 - and see where craving or strong desire causes 
limitations, challenges , and distress.  
 
This idea that craving i s the cause is one way of making 
logical sense of: “The noble truth of the arising of 
suffering is that craving. ” We just stop there , “Ok, 
craving. ” but how is it that craving caus es the arising of 
suffering? Well it must be the source . It must be the 
origin.  
 
However, as I said yesterday, the full explanation is that 
it’s that craving that leads to rebirth, or literally re-
becoming. But what the text is explaining is not the 
source, the origin, or the cause of all suffering that 
humans  have  – but the original  cause. In a previous 
lifetime, there was a craving for rebirth. You don ’t get 
born into the world of suffering unless you crave to be 
born again.  
 
In this interpretation, the idea is to become free of 
rebirth by becoming free of that craving for rebirth. This 
idea of the Four Noble Truths almost certainly didn ’t 
come from the Buddha in the way it ’s been formulated . 
It probably was composed about  100 y ears after his life  
– perhaps  at a time when the idea of rebirth became 
increasingly important in Buddhism in a way that 
doesn ’t really represent how important it was in the  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 3 - earliest teachings . But still, it gives us this wonderful 
interpretation: that cra ving is the cause of suffering.  
 
Sometimes that ’s very useful. At other times , that 
interpretation gets in the way. It leads to too much 
analysis and trying to figure things out. In some of the 
other interpretations  – conditionality, and especially 
incons tancy , and  seeing what’s there – suggests  that 
the noble truth of the arising of suffering is simply the 
arising  – how it appears.  
 
There’s  something about seeing something appear, 
where there ’s space, and a recognition that there can 
even be a sense of independence from it. It ’s there . I’m 
here. We’re not the same thing. This i s the beginning of 
a process of becoming freer of suffering . So in a sense, 
rather than solving suffering, and figuring it out, we 
learn to have a different relationship to suffering, by 
seeing it as arising and ceasing, coming and going.  
 
The explanation that craving gives rise to rebirth 
actually continues. There ’s a second half of it, which I 
would like to refer to today , and offe r an interpretation, 
which may  be a nice segue into what we will do next 
week. As I said yesterday, reading Bhikkhu Bodhi ’s 
translation, we see that  he uses the word ‘origin ’ for 
samudaya , the Pali word that means ‘arising .’ He 
translates  it as ‘origin .’ And now we understand why he  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 4 - does that: because it ’s this original  craving that gives 
rise to birth.  
Now this , bhikkhus , is the noble truth of the origin of 
suffering. It is craving that leads to renewed 
existence, accompanied by delight and lust,  
seeking delight, here and there.  
 
This craving is accompanied by delight and lust. I think 
the idea in the ancient world is that this original craving 
leads to rebirth. That fundamental drive to be reborn is 
a lusting or wanting of pleasure , or delighting in the 
world. We want more of it. That’s one of the 
fundamental concerns of early Buddhism  – not 
delighting and relishing in that desire for the world , 
which just keeps us going in the cycles of rebirth. It 
goes on and says :  
That is craving for sensual pleasures, craving for 
existence, cravin g for extermination.  
 
Bhikkhu Bodhi has this big word ‘extermination ,’ which 
sound s a bit dangerous or even  violent. The Pali word s 
for existence and extermination are bhava  and abhava . 
Bhava  means becoming. This word is a bit difficult in 
English . Many people translate  it as ‘existence ,’ but it 
really means “ becoming, coming into being. ” One 
reason th is is important is that ‘existence ’ can seem a 
bit static , whereas  ‘becoming ’ is a constantly dynamic 
process of coming into being. Th is is what we  are  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 5 - constantly doing  – participating in a continuous  process 
of coming into being.  
 
Abhava  is not -being, not -becoming  – not having that 
process continue  – this ending , the not -becoming, not 
exactly not existing, but no longer contributing to this 
becoming.  
 
The idea of rebirth  gives a  framework for this 
interpretation , when it says that there ’s a craving for 
sensual pleasure. The desire for pleasure goe s really 
deep in  human beings  – maybe deeper than most 
people realize. Some people are a bit put off by the 
emphasis in early Buddhis m on being trapped or caught 
by sensual pleasures , and  seeing the craving for 
sensual pleasures as a problem.  
 
But sensual pleasure means any movement towards 
comfort, or towards any kind of pleasure  – not just the 
more dramatic ones such as  epicurean  pleasures of  
enjoying food , or sex , or whatever it might be. Many of 
the small ways that many people live their lives are 
oriented around making themselves more comfortable  – 
for example , how we sit in a chair or at a table . Or we 
might pay more for  food than we absolutely have to  
because w e want  more pleasure from it. We might buy 
more  clothes than we need, because  we get pleasure 
from them.   
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 6 -  
The idea of receiving pleasure from experience is 
deeply ingrained in human nature. It’s one of those 
things that people crave , and in craving, they can suffer . 
They  feel frustrated, upset, or driven.  
 
The next two  ideas  of becoming and not -becoming  are 
sometimes  translate d as identity  – forming an identity of 
who we are – creating an identity of , “I am this ,” or 
creating a sense of , “I’m not that. ” Not to be that  is kind 
of a non -identification of something. This may be 
expressed in simple ways. The choice of clothes that 
people wear sometimes has to do with forming an 
identity, becoming something for other pe ople. For 
example, some people are very happy to have logos of 
their college or high school on their sweatshirt . And they 
assume that identity . They become a person from that 
school, or their sports team, or their favorite company.  
 
Other people have the o pposite tendency , and I fall in 
this camp . They don’t want to become. They  have a 
tendency towards  abhava , non -becoming . I really don ’t 
want to wear any anything that has a logo on it, and it ’s 
very rare that you’ll ever see me do this. I ’m not 
particularly proud of this, but it ’s a bit like, “I don ’t want 
to be . I don ’t want to be. ” So that ’s my thing.  
  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 7 - The idea of wanting to be reborn can be the desire for 
becoming  – to exist again. The paradox here is that the 
craving for non -becoming, non -existing  – because it  is 
craving  – is also a cause to being reborn. In other 
words, a person doesn ’t want to be reborn so strongly 
that it  become s a craving  not to be reborn. And that 
very craving is what gets them reborn, because craving  
is such a strong dr ive and push.  
 
In my teachings and in my practice, it ’s very rare that I 
make much reference to rebirth . It is not an important 
part of what I want to teach or of my own practice. But 
here I offer you what is in the traditional texts , so that 
you understand the full range of these Four Noble 
Truths and all the different interpretations of them .  
 
I am partial to the interpretation of rebirth , or of 
becoming and non -becoming, as not about being 
reborn one lifetime after another  – but about being 
reborn moment -by-moment. We have a constant 
movement of craving for pleasure or avoiding 
displeasure  – a movement of beco ming something, 
identifying as something, assuming an identity, being 
someone, or asserting ourselves as being someone. Or 
it may be the opposite : not wanting to be , hiding , 
shutting down , or avoiding something . For human 
beings, this constant becoming and  non-becoming, 
identifying and then dis -identifying, can be an incessant  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 8 - form of suffering  – of ongoing manufacturing, 
constructing, concern, preoccupation.  
 
This doesn ’t have to be. We don ’t have to live with 
incessant preoccupation, craving, or for some people 
even  addiction to pleasure  – or an addiction to identity, 
to self, to being someone, to having a clearly 
constructed sense of self that we present to the world , 
or a clearly construct ed sense  or idea of what we don ’t 
want to present to the world , and that we hide from. 
 
When we learn to sit still in meditation  – and that ’s why I 
did this meditation today on the stillness of the mind  – 
we see that when the mind moves, it ’s often because  it 
wants and doesn ’t want . It wants becoming or doesn ’t 
want becoming. Even not wanting or non -becoming is 
to be trapped in the cycles of becoming, of craving , of 
suffering. An interesting question , which  I’ll leave you 
with today, is: “If becoming is a s ource of suffering, and 
the opposite, non -becoming , is a source of suffering, 
what ’s the solution? ”  
 
If non -becoming just creates more becoming, more on -
going creation , what is the third option? That ’s why I 
think Bhikkhu Bodhi ’s translation of existence and 
extermination is a little bit difficult to work with. But 
anyway, what  is the alternative to existing and 
exterminating, or ending? Is there a third option? That  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 9 - will be the topic for the third of the Four Noble Truths 
next week.  
 
 
[Announce ment]  
I’m very much appreciating all of you who are joining  in 
and saying hello. I think some of you are starting to feel 
a sense of community , just from the chat box here. I 
thought that perhaps next week at the end of our Friday 
session , for those of you  who would like to, we could 
switch to a zoom meeting . I’ll post the zoom account, 
maybe in the chat box, so it ’s not discoverable by the 
rest of the world. We’ll  have a little global town meeting 
to talk about things , or ask questions. We can also do 
some  breakout group s, where in some random way , 
you have a chance to meet some of the other 
participants , and see the value is of coming together a 
little bit more fully as a community.  
 
 
[Q & A]  
And now if any of you would like to stay on, I ’ll try to 
take ma ybe 15 minutes or so if you have any questions .  
 
Q: Could you please clarify if there ’s a difference 
between abhava  and vibhava ?  
  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 10 - A: Oh yeah , vibhava ! You know, it ’s possible I was 
wrong about the Pali. It  could be that  it’s bhava  and 
vibhava  in this particular text. I don ’t really know if 
there ’s a difference. Vi may be a more emphatic kind of 
a. Maybe vi has more to do with craving for not existing. 
So maybe that ’s why Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it as 
‘extermination .’ I’ll look into it. I think many years ago, I 
researched this . So thank you for bringing it up.  
 
 
Q: Have you written about the Four Noble Truths , as 
you discussed them today, in any of your books?  
 
A: No, not in any of my books. I ’ve written some drafts 
of scholarly articles on this topic. Some of what you 
heard from me this week is a relatively new idea that 
I’ve come up with over the last ten years , doing some 
in-depth research into the sutta s. I’ve done draft s of 
what I hope to be serious scholarly articles clearly 
laying out how this is the case in the sutta s.  
 
It seems that this interpretation about the Four Noble 
Truths as insight into inconstancy has been overlooked . 
But n ow that I see it, it ’s like this o pen secret in the 
texts. Hundreds and hundreds of times they talk about 
the importance of seeing X, the arising of X, the ceasing 
of X, and the practice leading to the cessation of X. 
And, it ’s clearly synonymous with seeing appearance  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 11 - and disappearance, t he rising and passing of things  – 
seeing inconstancy. This is really held out to be the 
liberating insight.  
 
And because the Four Noble Truths had been the 
predominant way of understanding the central 
teachings of Buddhism, th is ha s been projected back on 
the earliest text s and – because of this projection back 
of later interpretations – we’ve actually missed seeing 
the real liberating insight emphasized in th ose early 
texts. I ’ve laid this out very carefully, but it ’s not really 
ready to share because I need to work on it more. And 
a Dharma teacher doesn ’t have much time for that. 
When I have some more time, I ’ll do it.  
 
 
Q: The idea that craving for non -becoming create s 
becoming makes me giggle. I struggle not to move 
because I ’m more us ed to moving meditation with yoga. 
This is helpful.  
A: I’m so glad . 
 
 
Q: I like the lighting.  
A: I figured out how to create a little barrier for it. If you 
noticed earlier, I was almost blinded by it.  
 
  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 12 - Q: I hear aspects of dependent origination in this talk of 
the Second Noble Truth , specifically links eight and 
eleven. Can you comment on the relationship of these 
two teachings?  
 
A: Yes, this is one of the reasons why some people 
have the conditionality in terpretation of the Second 
Noble Truth , because it ’s very similar to what goes on in 
the twelvefold sequence of the dependent arising of 
suffering. In this, there has to be sense  contact first . 
That sense contact is a condition for there being either 
pleasure or pain, comfort or discomfort. That pleasure 
or pain is the condition for the arising of craving  – what 
we’re talking about  in the Second Noble Truth.  So 
without some kind of pleasure , pain, or discomfort, 
there won ’t be craving. That craving is a condition for 
clinging. Craving is one thing , and then when it gets 
translated into doing something about it, it  become s 
clinging, holding on. And that leads to becoming 
(bhava ), and bhava  leads to birth . Then  birth leads to 
sickness, old age, grief, lam entation, pain, distress, and 
so forth.  
 
So they are  very closely connected. In fact, I said the 
Buddha has only five different interpretations of the 
Four Noble Truths , in basically three different 
categories. One of them defines the Second Noble 
Truth as the twelvefold sequence of dependent arising .  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 13 - The whole thing  – all twelve  links, not just the end of it  – 
is the arising of suffering. And then the Third Noble 
Truth is the reverse of dependent arising . It’s what I call 
the twelvefold sequence of dependent cessation. So the 
Second and Third Noble Truth s are clearly connected to 
the teachings of dependent arising.  
 
 
Q: Inconstancy is also translated as impermanence. 
Question mark?  
 
A: Yes, the most common transl ation  in English of 
anicca , is ‘impermanence. ’ The issue around 
translating it as impermanence, is that many people will 
interpret that to mean that something exists now, but it ’s 
not going to always exist. It ’s impermanent , so sooner 
or later, it ’s no longer go ing to  exist. The day is 
impermanent because by night it ’ll be gone. Mountains 
are impermanent, because in a few hundred million 
years, some of these mountains will have washed 
away. The sun is impermanent, because in a few billion 
years, it  will disappear.  
 
But what the Buddha  is talking about is how things 
appear and disappear. And he uses  a lot of different  
Pali  words, which  are synonyms of appearing and 
disappearing, coming and going, arising and passing . 
So it’s really clear that this is what he means  – the  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 14 - ongoing inconstancy of things. This means that things 
don’t have to disappear and end once and for all. So , 
days are inconstant . They come and go . And they ’ll 
come and go as long as the sun is in the sky. The 
fundamental, liberating ins ight is this arising and 
passing , so probably ‘inconstancy ’ works better. And 
nicca – what ’s being negated with the a in anicca – 
actually means ‘constancy. ’ So it makes sense to 
translate it that way.  
 
 
Q: Yesterday, did you say that craving refers more to 
rebirth than to worldly craving?  
 
A: Yes, I said that yesterday in relationship to a very 
particular teaching about the Four Noble Truths – it’s 
one of the interpretations. And that interpretation is 
solidified, in a sense, in a text usually referred to as the 
Buddha ’s first sermon. I ’m certain the Buddha had a 
first teaching, but that this particular text is his first 
teaching is very unlikely.  
 
One of the reasons it ’s unlikely is that this text teaches 
parts of the teachings about the Four Noble Truths  that 
are quite inspiring.  I’ll talk about later this in the series. 
Some people see it that was very important. If the 
Buddha  said it in his very first teaching, and if it was 
important, you ’d think that he would say it again later.   
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 15 -  
In fact, the teachings in the suttas  are very repetitive. 
The Buddha  teaches things over and over again, 
exactly the same way, or uses the same words in 
different ways, or in the same ways. And so if this 
teaching  was really his first , and important, you ’d expect 
it would reappear. But it hardly ever appears again in 
the suttas  – maybe in one or two other places, in 
passing. So chances are this represents a later 
interpolation into the suttas . Not everything attrib uted to 
the Buddha is likely to have been his teachings.  
 
This idea that the Second Noble Truth involves the 
craving that leads to rebirth is not exactly an 
interpretation, although that ’s what it  has become. For 
the early text s, it’s an application or an elaboration, that 
when someone becomes fully awakened as a Buddha, 
the traditional idea is that then they will not be reborn. 
And the reason they ’re not being reborn is because this 
specific craving that leads to rebirth has ended.  
 
This idea is not really referring to ordinary , worldly  
craving. For those of us interested in how we suffer 
day-to-day, these other interpretations of the Four 
Noble Truths are much more useful  – rather than being 
fixated on this idea of the rebirth, and the craving leads 
to rebirth.  
  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai  Edits: JAS -mg - 16 - So my friends, thank you . I appreciate all these 
questions.  
 
Is it impossible to not be becoming? The question is , 
“How are we becoming? ” Isn’t it impossible to not be 
becoming? Well, that ’s the cliffhanger that is ending this 
talk today . Next week, we ’ll talk about the alternative to 
becoming and not -becoming as we talk about the Third 
Noble Truth .  
 
So thank you so much , everyone . I look forward to our 
time next week , and to setting up the  zoom for Friday.
