So welcome.
I will maybe lightly guide us in this sit till the top of the hour
and then offer some reflections.
So yeah, welcome to you who are here.
Welcome to folks online.
And happy to be practicing together.
So let's settle in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So landing in your body.
Thank you.
Maybe a sense of connecting to all the practice you've done in your life.
Your own lineage of goodness.
Just using these gentle reflections as a way of settling your body.
Thank you.

Maybe it feels natural to gather the attention around your breathing.
Just the natural rhythm of your own breath.

When we highlight the sensations of breathing with attention,
we essentially relegate everything else to a relevance.

And so settling in on the breathing is not a function so much of focusing,
but rather letting go.
Letting go of the million ways we could imagine this moment getting better.
