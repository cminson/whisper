 What is your mood this morning? Let's check in. Is there a tiredness? Note as tiredness. Is there clarity? Note as clarity. Is there satisfaction? Notice satisfaction. Notice satisfaction. Notice satisfaction. Notice satisfaction. This is a practice called noting or labeling. It's a useful practice in particular for dealing with challenging or difficult emotions or mental states. So begin with a mental state or an emotional state you're aware of right now. And for simplicity I'll just say emotional state but if yours is mental then that's where you stay. And as I lead you in this meditation at any point in which there's a lot of confusion, spaciness, not spaciousness but spaciness, irritation, confusion, and just go back to your anchor point which is a posture point or a breath point that you've been returning to all these days. And then join when you can or just stay there. This is not a meditation to push through. This is a meditation that is a way to provide a container to be with and practice with difficult emotion or mental states. So begin by again accessing an emotion that you're having. Whichever one comes up at the end of my sentence is probably the one you're having. So just trust that that is the one. And however it's coming up just let it come up the way it does. And we'll begin by noting or labeling with just one word, one descriptor of the emotion. Let's say it's sadness and you just noted with a lightness of mind say five, ten percent of your mind just like touching it. So we talked about touch, receive, convey. So you're just kind of like tapping at it in a steady beat. It's really important that the beat is steady like a metronome is keeping the beat or that you're tapping at this emotion or mental state. Right? And a steady beat. So for instance, my beat is sadness, sadness, sadness. Yours could be whatever pace and it's important to keep the same steady beats if you feel yourself pushing. And if speeds up then you take your foot off the accelerator, so to speak, and just ease back into the beat that's calming, that's steady. That helps you to stay with in a way that is grounding. That's with equanimity. That's what the beat helps with. It's really important that it's just one word so that it helps to identify and not take you off in the enmeshment of the story and the thought. Not that those are wrong, it's just we're working with it in a way that supports just what this is right here and right now. And as you note with your beat, if another descriptor come up, then go ahead and note that again in the same beat. One word. Now as you're doing that, you really want to try to open up your field of awareness. We started with the beat in a way like one pointed concentration, right? Just on it, on it, on it. Now you're still touching it and you're aware that it's in a big field, a wide field of awareness. You open up your focus, you leave it in, you note it in a wide field of awareness. Sometimes the volume kind of goes down and that's okay. And if you do go off in spaciness and it's not an overwhelm kind of spaciness, then just turn up the volume just a little bit to keep you with the beat. And at the same time that it's wide open, spacious, allowing field of awareness. And this is not something to rush through. Just let each descriptor of your emotion or mental state just review itself to you.. And now in this field of awareness, see if you can perceive a pattern. For instance, perhaps sadness has now switched to frustration and then to anger. If there isn't a pattern, it's not wrong. Just if there's a pattern, then you note the pattern or you're aware of the pattern. I want you to bring your attention to a body point. And again, at the end of my sentence, wherever it lands in the body, see if you can just trust that that's where it's associated right now. For instance, mine is right in the middle of my chest. So now you're noting the sensation, the physical sensation of the quality at the location. For instance, mine is heavy, heavy, heavy. I'm not saying chest, chest, chest. That's the descriptor of the body, but not the sensation. So it's important that it's the sensation at that place. And again, one word, perhaps it's squeezing. If there's a direction, you can use one word for the direction. Down, down, down. And again, if it starts to feel really overwhelming, then you first try to turn down the volume, slow the beat, or go back to your home spot, the anchor that you've been going back to the whole time. Otherwise, you're noting in the same beat the quality of the sensation at the location, how it feels, sensation-wide, bodily. And then it's the same. Perhaps it reveals a different, perhaps, perhaps like heavy becomes full or solid. And now you note temperature, actual physical temperature. So it's pretty limited for most of us. Perhaps it's right now for me, it's warm, warm, warm. Perhaps it's hot, cold, cool. If you have a number, that's a thought. If you say, hot like the sun, that's a thinking. So go back to just one word of the sensation that's there. And at any point that one of these descriptors I'm pointing towards, or as I'm leading you through, you're not quite sure what the temperature is. But it's important to keep the beat so you can just make a sound there to keep the beat. Like I happen to like, nah, nah, nah. Whatever your sound is, just to help you stay until it reveals itself to you. So remember, it's still in that wide field of awareness to receive, to let the temperature reveal itself to you, not to make a temperature or force a temperature. And if you feel yourself doing that, just ease back. Open up the field of awareness. And now what are other qualities of sensations there? Perhaps there's tingling, perhaps now there's expansion. Any other descriptor that describes the sensation right there in that spot. Okay. If it feels overwhelming, go back to the temperature. Or take a deep breath and try again and again if it's overwhelming. Just keep going back to the last thing. I'm leading you through to give you a sense and then there'll be silence as you practice it and move at your own pace. And it's always good to know that when you advance to the next one, if it's hard to stay with it, sometimes this means it's not quite ready to go there yet. So the last, just go back to the last step. And again, at any point it just becomes way overwhelming or confusing. You just go back to your basic anchor point of a posture point or breath point. So now from the body location, you're going to go back to that emotional or mental state that you started with. Just take yourself back there and use three beats on that. So I'm going back to sadness, sadness, sadness. And then I open up and is there another emotion that's the stronger one at this point or a different one? It might not be and it could be. There's no right, there's no wrong. These are just movements to be able to work with difficult emotion or thoughts. And when it's overwhelming, because the emotion and thoughts are very a mesh in a story often, which again doesn't make it bad. It just has its own cycle that's hard to disengage from so that it might be revealing a difference to it or something new or a more depth or subtlety. So to be able to move it to a body point and then go back up to the emotion or the mental quality. So this is a way to be able to stay with what emotion or mental quality you're having in a way that supports being with it, but not to be overwhelmed by it. So now we'll have silence as you move at your own pace. And each time you move to a different, let it be intentional with a sense of equanimity, a supeca, in the midst of the steadiness. This is something that evenness, the valence-ness of emotion and mental field of awareness. So this is an investigative, a deeper scene of the pasana, exploration. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So Dogen says to go forth and experience the mirrored things is delusion. That the mirrored things come forth and reveal themselves is awakening. Let your emotions, your mental, your physical state even, reveal themselves to you. Let the mirrored things internally and externally be a revelation for you. Allow them to show themselves as they are in you open and receptive. You're noting it, but you're noting it in a way that is accepting and allowing in a wide open field. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. So let's move on. Oopeka or equanimity be a balance of heart and mind. Also could mean in the mist of and is actually a result of mindfulness. So today a bit by like opening yourself up to the spaces between the beat. The beat helps you to just touch and then there's space between the sustaining the receiving that the married things convey themselves to you. So
