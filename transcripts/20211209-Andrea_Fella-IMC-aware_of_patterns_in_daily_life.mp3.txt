The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
My first in-person retreat since March of 2020. Yes, it was good. And I just came
away really appreciating so much how simple the practice can be in a
retreat and in-person retreat like that. It just feels so much like I keep
saying the same things over and over. You know, be aware, notice what's
happening and offering some encouragement that that's actually what
creates the conditions for the deeper learning and freedom to happen.
This simple, simple, simply described practice of meeting experience, of
being with our experience. The more we can do that in a kind of a continuous
way, the more moment after moment we're aware of what's happening in our
experience, the more we see about how our minds get caught and the more we see
about ways that our mind can let go. And it's not easy. It's not easy. It takes a
lot of courage and patience and a lot of...
Letting go of our judgments about ourselves. You know, letting go of the
idea that having something come up over and over again is somehow a problem.
You know, somehow it's my fault that it's coming up over and over again.
Just beginning to allow for the deep, deep patterns of conditioning that tumble
on in our hearts and minds and that, of course, these patterns come up over and
over again. That's something we start to actually appreciate and see clearly
just how deeply conditioned these habits and patterns are, the ways
that we react. And often that's where we struggle. Those are places where we
struggle in our practice, where habits and patterns come up, old conditioning
around frustration and confusion and anger and fear and judgment. And
noticing those, as we notice those with mindfulness, we begin to see how painful
it is to feel them. When we're actually mindful of our reactive habits and
patterns, we feel what they do to us. We feel the tension. We feel the
constriction. We feel the ache. We notice how our mind is not able to stay balanced
or how it's kind of whipped around or whirled around. It's not able to be
stable. And that's not a mistake that we see that because that's what's been
happening to us and we haven't really seen it. We haven't known it. We haven't
recognized it because we've been more involved in believing something about
that emotion, that frustration, for instance. If I only can, you know, figure
this thing out, then I'll be okay. And so we're not really feeling into what it's
like to be frustrated. We're not feeling into what it's like to be afraid or
angry or confused. We are afraid or angry or confused and we're acting out of
that energy. And so we're not really noticing it. And when we do notice it, the
fact that it doesn't feel good, it's not a mistake. It's actually that that
actually is part of how our minds begin to learn. We feel into the suffering of
those patterns. And our human system, our human system does not want to
suffer. Our human organism kind of wants to orient towards well-being, towards
ease, towards some measure of peace and happiness. And so when we're actually
feeling into the struggles, our system begins to kind of look at ways to let go
of those struggles. And we also begin to experience, sometimes we begin
to experience what happens when a pattern ends while we're experiencing it. We see
that a frustration can end without the thing we're frustrating about ever
changing. And we feel the difference there. We feel the movement in the
direction of well-being. And so all of this we can explore in our meditation
through bringing mindfulness to how we are. And we practice a lot in the
sitting meditation, walking meditation, informal, informal meditation practice.
And yet it's also possible to be exploring these struggles, these habits
and patterns right in the midst of our daily lives. And this is what I'd like
to take some time to talk about this evening, how maybe we can work with this
in daily life. It's kind of a different feeling. When we're
doing sitting meditation or we're on retreat, it's like we don't have much
else to do. I mean our whole on retreat in particular, what our
job is is to be mindful. We might have a yogi job, we have to wash
dishes or something. But there's not a lot of other things taking our needing
to take our mental energy as is the case in our daily lives. And so often at the
end of retreat this question does come up, well how do I do this in my daily
life? Can I take this home? And the answer is yes. It feels different and
certainly the sitting practice is incredibly useful. But I know from my
own practice that there's a way that the practice in daily life can have its
own flavor, its own character, and not necessarily have the same kind of feeling
as the sitting practice. And so I'd like to talk a little bit about that. You know
my own practice actually began with daily life practice. I didn't know how to
meditate. I had never sat, well I had tried sitting down to meditate in
college a few times, but hadn't done it in a long time. But I was interested in
understanding what was happening for me in my mind. I was miserable, I was so
unhappy, I was angry, I was lonely, all kinds of really challenging emotions. But
the anger was probably the strongest thing and it was kind of ruling my life.
And so a friend sent me a book about mindfulness and it talked a little bit
about you know meditation. But it also talked about just being aware of what
you were feeling. And so that's where I started my practice with the idea that
maybe I can be aware when anger happens. And I did that for a couple of months.
That was my main practice. And I'll tell you I learned a lot. I had never had a
single meditation instruction. I'd read a few books but you know nobody telling
me what it's, what is it like? How do you pay attention to emotions? I didn't have
anybody to teach me that. I didn't know about attending to the body, letting go
of the thoughts and you know noticing the sensations in the body. The very first
time I became aware of anger it was kind of like, oh my gosh I'm aware and I'm
angry and oh wow this is painful. That's about what I was aware of. And I didn't
know what to do with it. I didn't know how to hold it. But what the next thing I
said to myself was, well I don't know what to do with this. I guess I'll go back
to work. Because I had been, I had been working and the anger had come up and
had been so strong actually that I was actually kind of frozen in front of my
computer. I was, I was just like frozen in front of the computer and the mind was
in this rage. And I had, I had chosen this emotion of anger as something that I
wanted to learn about. And I was really interested in learning about it and I
think in retrospect that's key. If you would like to explore and I would like
to encourage potentially if you have something, some, some habit or pattern of
mind that is sticky for you in your daily life, something that's coming up
kind of repeatedly. And you're really interested in learning about it with
mindfulness. Not interest, not, not the interest in learning about it in terms of
like, you know, what was all the history associated with it. Some of that
actually comes up. Some of that we, we get to see as we, as we open to these
habits and patterns. But, but, but mostly just interested in learning how it is to
be that, to have that emotion arising in human experience. That's what, that's
what we're interested in. Just that kind of interest. What is it like? Now the,
the benefit of that is that when we do get interested in an experience like
that, it, it has a transformative power. And for myself over the course of
several months of having that commitment, I took that, that was my, that was kind
of my mindfulness project for the first two or three months of my practice. I had
several of them. This wasn't the only one that I was doing in daily life, but, but
this was, this was one of the big ones. And I'd say it was one of the ones that
had the most transfer, that created the most transformation over that course of
two or three months to just be willing to look at that pattern. I thought I was
really interested in understanding it and potentially interested in having some
ease around it. You know, that, that I was interested to, to the book that I
read that encouraged me to do this implied or infer, I inferred from this
that if I did this, that it might help my, my mind to let go of the anger. I had no
idea how it would work. No clue how turning and looking at the anger would
help it to go away. I only thought it would make it worse. But that very first
moment, that very first thing that I noticed when I was in that rage and I
woke up, I had told myself, okay, I'm just gonna know that I'm angry when I'm
angry. And that was what I recognized as like, wow, I'm angry and I know it, it
hurts, I have no idea what to do with this. I guess I go back to work. In
retrospect, again, like looking back on this experience, that was a really
important moment because in that moment, I could go back to work. I didn't notice
that in the moment, how important that was. But I had been frozen within a rage,
like not even in the room with my computer. I was somewhere else entirely in, in a
rage and had been for quite some time in my mind. And that waking up into it
broke the cycle of that escalating pattern of thinking. And I could set it
aside at that point and go back to work. That, that's a big deal sometimes,
especially with some of these habits and patterns. Some of them are, are a little
bit more low-key. And I'll talk a little bit in a little while. If I have time,
I'll talk about a second example, which was a much kind of more low-key or
lower-level emotion. That the anger was a good one to pick because it's almost
like I had to wake up into it in order to come out of it. Because I was in all of
this rage. You know, it was like, it was at that level that as soon as I got into
the anger, it would just escalate and I would just be in a rage. And I, I had to
kind of wake up in the middle of it in order, in order to go on with my life.
And so it happened at some point that while I was noticing, or while I was
angry, I would wake up and know that I was angry. And so that's where I began, is
just noticing that. And you know, for the first little while, I think actually that
first time of noticing the rage, that was probably the last time that it got that
bad. Because subsequently, I began noticing just that, oh, here's the anger
again. Okay, yep, I guess, yep, that's, yep, that doesn't feel good. And I guess I
get on with my day. That's how I worked with that pattern. It wasn't like I
stopped what I was doing and said, okay, you know, I'm having a conversation, I
need to go off and like sit down and be aware of it. It's like just enough to
know, wow, this is the experience. It hurts. And I think in some ways, because I
didn't know how to attend, you know, to be mindful of it, it was kind of like, well,
I don't know what to do with this. I guess I could just go on with my day. But I
think that actually ended up being really helpful in daily life to just have
the mindfulness connect in a brief way with whatever that habit or pattern was.
Know the experience there in just the most global way. And so just like that,
yep, I'm aware and it hurts or I'm aware and there's, you know, this, this kind of
churning in my mind, just whatever was obvious. And then go on with my day. Over
the course of a couple of months of doing that, the anger, the habit of the
anger or I think, I think in retrospect, what I noticed is that because the
mindfulness was waking up with the anger and I had that kind of as a resolve. It's
like, I want to know when I'm angry. I want to be aware of it. And because the
mindfulness was connecting with the anger, it began getting familiar with what
it was like. It was, it feels to me in thinking back on it that the mindfulness
kind of became attuned to the experience of anger and started waking up
sooner and sooner and sooner in the process. So that the pattern didn't
have as much chance to escalate. And so what I was experiencing was, you know,
much more low level anger, you know, just kind of like, Oh, yeah, there's, there's
that movement towards anger. Okay. And, and yep. And I just get on with things so
that the, the, the recognition of the mindfulness, you know, having that
commitment of yes, I'm going to be aware of this, allowed the mindfulness to
connect with that pattern much more early in the process. So it was hugely
transformative for me over the course of a couple of months. I really, I feel like
it gave me my life back. This simple practice and not even knowing much about
how to pay attention to the body or, you know, noticing thoughts of the mind or
any of that. But just I'm aware that I'm angry while I'm angry. And yep, I go on
with my day. And so even this really, really simple kind of mindfulness in
daily life around a habit or pattern can be really powerful, really powerful.
Another example that around the same time, and all of this was before I even
ever started sitting in sitting meditation. I think it was, I think it was about
three months into the process of observing these emotional patterns in my
daily life before I decided, wow, this stuff is really useful. You know, I began
to, I began to, to recognize how valuable it was to be aware of my emotions in my
daily life. And I had been reading the book, the book I was given, the friend
gave me this book was Every Day Zen by Joe Gobeck. And, and she used the phrase
which we all use now that as a teacher, I use this all the time, our meditation
practice, our practice. And I was like, why did she call it practice? What is that
about? Why doesn't she just say my meditation? And, and, and then about three
months into this process of seeing how valuable the meditation was, it, I
remembered that this, that she'd called this sitting in meditation practice. And
I thought, oh, maybe that's why people sit in meditation. You practice it so that
it's easier to do in daily life. So that's why I started sitting is because I
thought it would help me to be more capable of meeting what was happening in
my daily life. So another, another kind of emotion that I was curious about
around this time was, was loneliness. And I was in the Peace Corps at this point.
This whole thing happened when I was in the Peace Corps. And my partner had
broken up with me. That was what the anger was about. And I was lonely at night.
You know, this, this partner wasn't living in the same country I was. But, you
know, when, when my partner broke up with me, I started feeling really lonely
when I went to bed at night. And, you know, that was no big surprise. You know, it's
like, yep, you know, it's like this reminder, I am alone, you know, I'm, I'm
never going to, you know, have another partner or ever in my life or, you know,
whatever the mind was doing. But, but so I was just, I just began noticing this
routine kind of arising of loneliness every night. And so I thought, well, let's
look at that. Let's see what happens if I look at that. You know, I'll just notice
that when that happens every day. It was pretty regular. It was pretty easy to
notice because it happened every night. So I began getting curious about it. Okay,
I wasn't like to feel lonely. What happens there? And after a few nights of this,
and some of you've heard this story before, I'm sure, after a few nights of
noticing this loneliness, I began noticing, you know, every night when I went
to bed, I picked up my little alarm clock and I, I said it, you know, to wake me up
in the morning. And one night I noticed that the loneliness arose and it felt so
connected with looking at that alarm clock. I was like, that's weird. What does it
have to do with like setting it? Why does loneliness have to do with the alarm
clock? And I didn't know, but I just was like, well, that's interesting. And, you
know, set the alarm clock down, noticed the loneliness and went to bed, you know,
just kept on with my day. And so the next few nights, I began noticing that it
was connected with the alarm clock, you know, that something about the alarm
clock was somehow connected with the fact that the loneliness came up. And then
one night, and I don't know how long this took, maybe a week or two, you know,
before I saw this, one night when I picked up the alarm clock, I noticed a
thought in my mind about being with my ex-partner in Disneyland and we were in
Tomorrowland looking up at a marquee that had a digital clock on it. And so
there was like, I saw that there was a connection between the digital clock
that I was looking at and the memory. So there was a link, you know, kind of a
condition to link between those two. And I also saw in that moment that the
loneliness was kind of a response to that memory. You know, the loneliness was
about, was about like the mind, what the mind did with that memory was, oh, I was
so happy when we could go to Disneyland and we had so much fun in Disneyland and
I'll never have anybody to go to Disneyland with ever again and I'm never
gonna have fun ever again. That's what the mind was kind of doing with this.
And so the loneliness was created in response to that memory. Now, that was
all pretty amazing to me that I saw all of that, you know, that I could see, you
know, what happened in the mind that that, you know, loneliness came up. But the
more amazing thing was the next night when I went to bed. I picked up the alarm
clock and I remembered that I had remembered all of this or noticed all
of this happening. And the loneliness did not come up. Now, I didn't try to make the
loneliness not come up. It just didn't come up. It was like having seen the link
or the connection between the memory and all of those tumbling thoughts and the
loneliness. It's like having seen that, the mind had somehow let it go. It's like
it had decoupled the memory from the loneliness. And I don't know how that
happened so much, but I just know that it happened. The next night, the
regular going to bed and being lonely every night ended with that experience.
And so that, again, was another kind of big like, wow, this stuff is really useful.
Look at what we can see. Look at what can be seen here with just simple like
notice trying to just be with just be with this stuff and how powerful it was
and how freeing it was. So the the main encouragement here is like in terms of
something challenging for you, have a kind of interest or some courage to be
curious about it in your daily life right in the midst of your daily life. To go
about it with a kind of an intention. I want to be aware when
that thing happens. So for me, when that anger happens, I want to be
aware. Let's notice every night the loneliness, you know, let me just see
what's happening. And just the lightest of touch, just whatever is obvious in
that moment. Each time noticing, you might get some slightly different
perspective on the experience. You might also begin to notice it getting weaker
over time, kind of more gradually getting weaker over time. Or you might notice
something like I did that with the loneliness that something is revealed
that kind of breaks the link or breaks the hook for the mind to get caught in
that particular pattern. No, I'm not saying I didn't get lonely ever again.
That's not what I'm saying. But that particular loneliness about, you know,
going to bed at night at that time of my life, that ended. So just a kind of
encouragement to perhaps choose a pattern for yourself. Set this kind of
intention to be aware. And in the lightest of ways, notice what you notice and get
on with your day. See what happens if you do that over the course of three or
four weeks. What happens to the pattern? Don't have an expectation that something's
going to happen in that first moment. But just over the course of several weeks
of doing this, what happens to the pattern? I've done this kind of practice a lot
in my daily life. And I've learned so much. And I think there's a lot of, a lot
more capacity we have to do this kind of exploration. I think sometimes we get a
little caught up in all the instructions in the meditation. You know, how to be
mindful, what to do. And in this, you know, when I first started, I knew very
little and learned so much with that very little knowledge. So it's almost like
forget all the instructions and just, like, just notice like, oh yeah, I'm
angry or oh, I'm frustrated. Okay, yep. Oh, it hurts or whatever. Whatever's
obvious. And then keep going and be willing to do that over the course of
several weeks and see what you learn. You keep that commitment, that kind of
resolve to keep looking at it. You will learn something. You will. Because
mindfulness works that way.
