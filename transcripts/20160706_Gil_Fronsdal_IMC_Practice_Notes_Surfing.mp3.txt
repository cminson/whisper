An interesting image for being mindful is that of surfing. 
Sometimes swimming in the ocean , being in the water is 
great – comfortable, nice , wonderful . Sometimes it is not  
– it’s cold , or there are  dangerous things waiting for you 
under the surface. But if you’re up on a surfboard, then 
you can stay dry and  warm and safe.  And if you’re a 
good surfer  and you catch a wave , you’re definitely 
intimate with the  wave and the ocean. You’re  
connected, present and fully there , but you’re also not in 
the water. You ’re out of the water , but really intimate , 
involved  and very attentive . And you’re balanced . But if 
you’re not paying attention , you’ll probably fall in.  
 
In the same way , with mindfulness, we’re surfing on our 
experience , and this becomes particularly poignant 
when we have strong reactions to what is happening 
around us. There  may be challenging things happening , 
and we have a lot of thoughts and emotions that come 
up. Generally , when that happens, human beings fall 
into the water – meaning that we somehow get involved  
or in the midst of the emotions we have or the thoughts 
we have , and we’re  swimming in them . We’re i n the 
water , and it washes over us . Sometimes , if you’re in the soup of your stuff , and the wave breaks over you , 
you get drenched. You have to wait a while before  that 
wave passes , and then you can surface again.  
 
But the idea is to be mindful that you’re surfing on your 
experience. You’re not avoiding it – there’s still an 
intimacy and connectedness to it, an attunement to 
what’s happening . But you’re not in the soup; you’re not 
in the water.  Your awareness, your powers of 
observation, your powers of interest and curiosity are 
strong enough that you’re not in the experience , but 
you’re clearly seeing it and are present , and in that  clear 
awareness , if you’re really cruising or able to be more 
continuous with the experience of being present for 
what’s happening, present for the strong e motions that 
are coming , present for seeing the mind spinning in 
thoughts . But to really see it , to be really cognizant of it, 
awake to the fact that it is happening , like, “Yeah , I’m 
filled with anger , despair ,” or whatever it might be. “I 
have these thou ghts spinning and pulling me around ” – 
to see it really clearly , and then to surf on it. You can’t 
push the waves away or stop them , but you can ride the  
wave. And  it can be  quite sweet , quite wonderful , when 
you’re able to pull yourself out of the water , out of  your 
soup  enough that t he awareness is there , but you’re 
riding on it ; you’re  cruising or surfing.  
 
What’s nice about this surfing analogy is that , as far as I 
can tell, it’s very, very rare that a surfer doesn’t end up falling back into the water. Maybe there’s some way of 
surfing right up to the dock and jumping off, or surfing 
right up to the really shallow part to jump onto  the land. 
Maybe that happens occasionally , but I don’t know if 
I’ve ever seen that. Surfers sooner or later fall in . So, 
sooner or later, you’ll probably fall back in.  and that’s 
normal . I don’ think surfers complain too much about 
falling back into the water . That’s where they live . That’s 
part of the deal . But then they get back on ; they get 
back on the surfboard.  
 
And so  you’ll fall in . But get back on the mindful board , 
and paddle to get enough momentum going , and then 
catch the wave. Then you’ll probably have fun.  
 
 Thank you .
