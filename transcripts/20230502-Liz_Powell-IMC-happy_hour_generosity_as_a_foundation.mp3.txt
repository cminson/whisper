 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome everyone. Welcome to Happy Hour. And thank you, Neil, for being here and for posting information in the chat about our Google group. And I will send Neil tonight a quote that I'm going to read. And there are often very interesting ways to stay connected, things from class. So I'm delighted to see all of you this evening and to have this opportunity to practice together. And I thought I'd start with a few reflections, something that was inspiring to me this week. And then we'll do a lightly guided meditation. So this week I was inspired by something I was reading again, written by Ajahn Suchito. He wrote a book about the 10 perfections, which are known in the ancient Pali language as the Parami. And his book, the Parami, Crossing the Floods, is an amazing book. So the thing that he wrote that I was interested in particularly is as follows. The first two perfections, generosity and morality, arouse the heart and create a sense of empathy with other beings. We are willing to share with other beings and are concerned for their welfare. We don't want to harm or hurt others. Through these Parami, we get in touch with our own affective mind heart with what wounds and numbs it as well as what makes it feel right, true and steady. So this last sentence is such a good description for what we're cultivating during happy hour. I'm going to read that last little bit again. We get in touch with our own affective mind heart with what wounds and numbs it as well as what makes it feel right, true and steady. These phrases that we often say as part of the happy hour meditations, phrases of loving kindness, phrases of compassion, sympathetic joy or equanimity, these four movements or developments of heart and mind that are cultivated are intended to develop a heart mind that feels healthy, that has good intentions towards ourselves and others. We aspire probably, many of us, to feel more stable, to be more steady and to embody integrity in that our hearts and minds are integrated, they match one another and that our actions match our highest values. It's a process, it's a long process of cultivation for many of us. It takes plenty of time and patience to cultivate. So these practices embody and express generosity. It's good to remember that. Having thoughts of loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity to other people is a generous act. Even when, sometimes when we begin this practice, it's primarily just thoughts, we're just thinking something that we're sending. At first, maybe we want to want to feel kind. We aspire to become more kind, more compassionate. Even when we can tell our hearts not quite in it yet, that's okay. We're often at first still recovering from what numbs and wounds the heart and mind. We have a lifetime of experience with that. The practice may first show us that our hearts and minds have been numbed out or are wounded in some way and some of these ways we know about already and some we don't even yet recognize. We're still, you know, it's in the background, we don't know it yet. So it's a generous act just to show up here and try this practice. I like what Gil Fronstall says, maybe we're freeing other people in our lives from us. That always makes me chuckle. From the ways we're defending against old wounds or overly identified with fixed ideas about who we are, what we want or don't want, those things can sometimes make us challenging for other people and challenging for ourselves as well. So in addition to supporting each other here by practicing together, including when we have time after the meditation for discussion in the breakout groups and in the large group, this practice offers something or this way of practicing together offers something different from other interactions we have, maybe at work or at home. We're here, many of us, to elevate our humanity, really to touch what is precious in the human being. Maybe even we could call it sacred between human beings. This connection through our humanity. So it's a generous act. Whether or not we yet feel the emotional resonance of it, it's a generous act whether or not we take action on anything specific, although many of us will and do. The more we're present just here with what's happening right now in the heart, mind and body as we say these phrases of kindness or compassion or equanimity or joy, appreciative joy, the more we move towards seeing what's really here, what's really coming up, the more we move away from numbness, from harm that's been done in the past towards clarity, towards a greater capacity for our own and for others' welfare. So we already probably know how good it feels when someone is generous to us, when they've been kind, when they've been caring, when they've even seen us or heard us. And what we get to do here is grow that ability to offer that to these hearts of ours, to these minds and also to the rest of humanity, all people included, all beings included. So with that, we'll turn to our meditation. As you settle into a supportive way of sitting for yourself, perhaps beginning by noticing any effect this short sharing I did has had on you, receiving any words or ideas, especially anything that brought up thoughts or feelings in you that help you recognize what's up for you right now. Even seeing if you were just waiting for the relief of doing a meditation. Sometimes at the end of the day we don't have space for any more words. So how are you doing right now? Having any stress, any state of mind, including any times that you felt a need to tune out or when and if your empathy feels sort of dried up or you can't take in anything else. There's so much going on in your life, in your mind, in your heart that you can't take in any more about heart, about empathy or about the welfare of other people or beings. So generosity and kindness start right here with really being with how you are. It doesn't have to look good or feel great. It might, but it also might feel painful or you wish things were different. How is this body? How are your thoughts? How are your emotions or feelings? Or if there's numbness, being with that numbness, noticing it. We human beings go through a lot in a day or in a month or in a lifetime. You're sitting here with how things are right now and with the sum total, the net effect of all of that. As it is in this moment, so perhaps allowing a mental picture or a physical sensation of what you've been moving through as it affects you in this very moment. Being generous with yourself, allowing yourself to take stock, to take time with how things are. It may be felt simply as a physical sensation or there may be thoughts and emotions. Or perhaps what you're noticing is how available you are right now. After practicing sincerely for the length of time you've devoted to it, you might feel an openness of heart, a resonance and availability for yourself and for other beings. Whatever is most obvious or present in your body, heart and mind, noticing which of these inclinations of mind that I'll say aloud resonate the most or offer something to what is present in you right now. And they're familiar phrases that allow them to land and see which one or ones resonate. May you be well. May you be safe and free from harm. May you be happy. May you be at ease. May you be free from stress and suffering. Completely free. May you continue to enjoy the happiness of an open heart. May you have some balance with the ups and downs, all the things that are happening in your life. And giving yourself a moment to allow any other wish to bubble up. You don't have to think too hard about this but maybe there's some aspiration or reason you practice or an inclination you'd like to embody to integrate into your being. You can send yourself that wish. May I be whatever it is. May I embody something you wish to invite in. And as we continue for a while in silence, repeating whatever our most resonant phrases that want to grow in you. May I be well. May I be safe and free from harm. May I be happy. May I be at ease or with ease. May I be free from stress and suffering. May I continue to enjoy an openness of heart, a happiness for others. May I embody whatever quality you'd like to invite. And as we continue to do so, we are going to come back to the phrases as a very quiet whisper in the mind again and again. Thank you. Amen. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you are welcome to continue offering these same wishes for the rest of our meditation. Or if someone else is coming to mind for whom you'd like to cultivate these qualities, to whom you'd like to be generous and offer these wishes, feel free to begin saying these same phrases for them, offering what you'd like for yourself to them as well. And it's fine to pick someone for whom it's easy to send kind wishes. As we send kind wishes, notice if you're wanting the other person to change. And the difference between that and just sending wishes for them to receive kindness and compassion in their life. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So this virtue of generosity, the first two virtues of generosity and morality were so important that the Buddha is said to have taught them first or felt that they had to be cultivated before you could make any other kind of growth in the practice. And one of the teachings that's really wonderful is to appreciate any generous acts you do or any generosity you feel before you do something while you're doing it and after you're doing it. And please don't underestimate it. Maybe if you think back, you can remember someone in your life who did some really small thing that was generous towards you that had absolutely nothing to do with money. You know, it might have been a kind word or seeing you when you needed to be seen anything. And perhaps as we spend time this evening in breakout groups, you can share at least one thing that happened in your life where you felt that someone had been kind or generous to you and it made a big difference for you. As we go into these breakout groups of about three people each, the invitation is to share one thing at a time and to not comment or offer advice or opinions to the other people in your group, but rather to listen wholeheartedly to what each person is sharing and go one at a time and then listen also to what's coming up in your own heart and mind. Very important. And then the other invitation is please keep what is said in the group's confidential, even when we come back to the large group to share. Please don't share what was said, identifying it by a person. You can always share about how something affects you. So with that, we'll go into breakout rooms for 10 minutes and then we'll have time to come back and be together in the large group. Enjoy it. Thank you.
