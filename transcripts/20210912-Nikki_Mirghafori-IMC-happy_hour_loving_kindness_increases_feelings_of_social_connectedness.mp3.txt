 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. I'll ask you to confirm. So, hello. Hello, everyone. Hello and welcome to this edition of Happy Hour. So, for those of us who have been practicing metta, loving kindness for a while, we know, we trust, we have a sense of the shift and changes that happen over time when we practice, both for ourselves, the way we relate to others. And there have also been studies on loving kindness practice, research studies, psychological studies, etc., etc. And sometimes it's kind of nice to see things that we already know. Again, verified, oh, yeah, we know this already, and yet here it is. It's kind of fun. You know, we don't necessarily need validation from science, and yet it's kind of fun when both come through. And as a scientist myself, you know, there are times that anyway, that's a much longer conversation that we'll get into that. But just to say, so something I want to bring in tonight is a study that was done in 2008, and it has a pretty cool title. So the title is loving kindness meditation increases social connectedness, increases social connectedness. And it's a study done by Hutchison, Sepala and Groats, published in Emotion, various places. Basically, let's just say a few words since I brought it in, they brought people into the lab, they had them do a short loving kindness meditation. And then they measured the sense of, you know, their, their sense of friendliness or connection towards others towards strangers. And so, so, so one sentence that they have at the end, which I particularly like, especially at the time of COVID, at the time of many of us being socially isolated, all of us having less social connections than we did a couple years ago. The sentence says the results suggest that this easily implemented technique may help to increase positive social emotions and decrease social isolation. And yet this is what we know already we know that when we practice metta when we practice loving kindness for ourselves for others. Even if we don't see our loved ones. There is a sense of being connected to ourselves being connected to others being connected to life. There's a sense of connection. Because again, we know, again from other studies and our own experience that when we imagine something that is a way of doing a particular exercise, actually there's some more recent research that shows that if you imagine doing, for example, some weight training, actually your muscles get slightly more toned. So you have to be weight lifting those weights. So, so this act of bringing something to our imagination, whether it's physical exercise which amazingly actually changes the structure of our body or physical muscles, and not so different in terms of our psychology for imagining in our hearts in our minds, being connected with others wishing them well wishing them well wishing them well. There is a sense of connection we feel less lonely. We feel less alone. So, and the opposite way, if we don't practice or if there's a sense of lack of metta lack of goodwill, or say ill well towards ourselves ill will towards others. You might have noticed, there is more sense of alienation, we feel more alienated from ourselves. We feel more alienated from others, as if we don't belong as if there's a sense of social fabric gets disconnected when there's a sense of ill will. So, so we know this already, we know, we know this and I bring this, this one study for example as a way to remind us to remind us remind us of what we already know in a different way. We're coming together practicing in the Sangha with a happy hour Sangha, and also there is a sense of social connection of coming together in Sangha, whether on zoom or YouTube. We can practice loving kindness tonight. We can practice loving connection, that it actually fosters in the way of well being, both ourselves and the way we show up for others. So, so that is the setup for tonight. Let's get started in our form of practice. Keep to land in your body to arrive. To settle, to connect, to invite your heart, your mind, your awareness, to connect with this body with yourself. Hello, body. Hello breath. We are loving ourselves, greeting the sensations of this moment's experience, inviting the body to relax, to let go of any tightness or tension. Nothing needed in this moment, nothing to do, nowhere to go. Just relaxing all the muscles. Receiving. Taking refuge in this moment. Unwriting thoughts to be put down. Thank you. Not now. Thank you. Thank you. Relating each in breath, the entirety of the out breath, settling, arriving, landing one breath at a time. Thank you. Thank you. Spending a few more minutes to just arrive and settle with the breath and the body. Thank you. Thank you. And let's begin our metta practice by extending good will to this being who is me. Greeting this person who might be tired, might be distracted, and had ups and downs today, which we intimately know their challenges. Meeting with friendliness, with kindness. Wishing well for the being who is me, myself. May I meet this moment with ease. May I have ease in my life. As an expression of our metta, good will. Thank you. Thank you. May I meet this moment with ease. May my life unfold with ease. May I hold myself with friendliness and good will. May I love and accept myself just as I am. May I love and accept myself just as I am. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I invite you to experiment with putting the palm of your hand in the middle of your chest, your proverbial heart center, just to connect with yourself, connecting the physicality of your palm, with your chest, just connecting with this person, this being who's you, holding yourself. May I love and accept myself just as I am. Experiment, see what happens. To connect with yourself physically, not just with words. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I want to thank you for your relationship with them. A child or a pet is okay. Bring them to your mind's eye, into your heart space. May you meet moments of your life with ease. May you have ease. I wish you well. Whatever phrases work for you, or without phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy, dear one. May you have ease. See if you can include yourself, it's easy for you to continue to include this being who is you in this good will. May both of us, may both of us have ease. Love and cherish ourselves just as we are. May we have happiness and well-being, both of us, myself, and your dear, easy being. Imagining both of you perhaps being together, sitting together. Sometimes your awareness might shift more towards them, sometimes more towards you, sometimes equally, including both of you in your loving kindness. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It was okay. It's okay. not need to scold myself, be more generous. Nice, nice. Thank you for sharing that, Eric. And I know it's actually very significant is, you know, that Metta is also a concentration practice, is a shamatha practice, you know that. And also that you're, if you're, you know, you might be practicing anapanasati, mindfulness of the breath, as your practice, concentration practice. So you know, you already know this, but so that you hear it again, if you don't scold yourself there, also the mind will settle and become absorbed and settled and calm much more quickly. So this practice of Metta can be really helpful with mindfulness of the breath practice also. So yes, beautiful that you've discovered you are not scolding yourself. Yay, that is very significant. Thank you for that. Jamie, please. Well, Nikki, first off, I just want to thank you for your saying that I accept myself and love myself just as I am. That was just such a wonderful thing to say to myself. I mean, it was just like gift. Thank you. And I just wonder if you have any comments on sex and sexual energy as part of meditation and I'll tell you why. I thought about my dear one today was a friend who's who's kind of recently revisited and redefined her sexual orientation. And as I thought about her, I my wish for her, I said, may you have sex that makes you feel more alive, more connected to your partner and more joyous. And after saying that to her, I thought I want that. And it was really easy to extend to other friends and people I know into the whole world because I thought everyone will be better with that. And I have to admit I have like I become aware of my own sexual energy, sometimes during meditation it's just not a topic I've ever heard discussed in my still budding practice. So I wonder if you have any suggestions or response to that. Yeah, thank you for bringing that in. Very important. So with respect to this particular sexual energy is such a big topic, but I'll keep my comment in this case, specific to what you asked and what you came what came up for you regarding your friend and your wish. And it felt really genuine and joyous that you're wishing them well given the transition. Yeah, may you have well being in this area of your life that must have been confusing and challenging for you, dear friend. And then, and then, oh, I may I have that too and may so many people have that. Yeah, so, so, in the way that I'm hearing that and also us being lay people. To me the way it sounds to me it feels like a wish of well being, may you have wholesome well being experience that brings you joy. That's how I'm hearing it. So, yay, beautiful. And now, bringing a little bit of historical context. These practices, most of the practices that are taught are taught to monastics and monastics are celibate. So, sexuality and sexual energy is something that they renounce renounce when they enter monastic life, which is not the case for our us lay people. So, and so, just to put the historical context in a traditional you would not see or hear this like that but, you know, it would be kind of funny for monks to be wishing that for themselves or others it's like feels right in, given that again they've given the renounce it and yet, given that we are lay people and the spirit with which you shared this Jamie it feels like a goodwill wish may you have happiness in different areas of your life you know the way we wish may you be happy, one may you have happiness in this sexual area of your life with with partnership so sounds good to me if that brings you joy this is there's a way of way for you to express your goodwill, then it feels wholesome to me in this context. Thank you for bringing for bringing that up. Thank you. Thank you. And we have a reflection from Don the research is really interesting I feel disconnected at times. So good to hear about this as a means to feel more connected. Thanks for sharing this, you are very welcome. And in fact, I will share the link in the chat when you come back. So, so given that today's theme is about connection and interconnection, especially if you are on zoom and these are the times that you think okay we're going to do some more groups bye bye. And if you can stay, given that it is about connection interconnection challenge yourself, gently, gently to stay to stay, see what happens if you have connection, especially if there have been any moments of lack of connection or loneliness, throughout your day see what happens if you stay you don't have to say anything brilliant just show up and just be silent, but just show up in the small group that's my invitation. And if you absolutely have to go because of a commitment. No judgment but please don't jump off just out of fear of connecting with other human beings. So with that, we're going to turn our attention now into small groups and practicing together with the groups of maybe three or four, and feel free to share anything you like about your practice. So let's start with 15 seconds of silent meta for yourself or each other. And the rooms are created, and I'm going to open them up. And here you go, take care of yourselves take care of each other. Okay. Welcome back everyone the rooms are closed. So we have just a couple of minutes for any reflections. Oh, and also post the information about the study pilot please. Okay, so on. So yesterday I was walking alone in Berkeley in a residential neighborhood, and a man came up to me and basically harassed me tried to touch me like sort of like walked after me. And I did, you know my usual defensive practices that most women know how to do in those situations. And I was feeling connected to this man in some way and just like my heart was breaking for his loneliness and his lack of connection like how diluted must he be that that's his only way that he even knows how to reach out to people, or like is trying to get some people. And it. Yeah, and it just, it broke my heart in like a really sort of lovely and scary way to feel connected to him. Thank you violet. I feel so touched and I see others are too by who by sharing your practice. It's, it's amazing right. It's amazing and of course you did what was appropriate to the defensive at the time and yet not to carry that as resentment and hatred. Oh, to feel a sense of compassion for this person who must be so isolated and disconnected. Just really speaks to the beauty and transformation of your heart. Thank you violet. Thank you so much for sharing this. What a beautiful note to end on. What a beautiful note to end on tonight. Thank you, Violet. Thank you everyone. Thank you everyone for your practice and Jerry says kindness and vulnerability in the small group was so nurturing for us. Beautiful. And earlier Deborah had talked about stealth metta, which we have talked about before and this at happy hour which is walking down the street and just sharing metta, giving metta for others and feeling a sense of connection with everyone. So thank you all. Thank you for showing up. Thank you for practicing for your own sake and the sake of everyone who's life yours touches directly or indirectly. May we all be free from hatred from ill will. May we all feel connected to ourselves and to this beautiful mysterious web of humanity may all beings be well may all beings be free. Thanks everyone.
