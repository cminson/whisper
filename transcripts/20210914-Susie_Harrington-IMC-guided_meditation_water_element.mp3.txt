 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, friends. Welcome once again. And this morning we're going to continue with this exploration of the elements. And yesterday we started with the Earth element. And today I want to continue with water element. And I have a quote, a sort of transitional quote for us from a Native American elder who was at Standing Rock. And unfortunately I don't know their name, but this is what they said. In the beginning there was first stone, then there was water. When the two came together they created a sacred sound. That sound is the life energy. So, spoke about Earth yesterday, this being made up of the mineral, of the dust, of the substance of the Earth. But clearly, if we were just Earth we would just be piles of dust, piles of dirt. Nothing, nothing much could happen with that. And it's the water. It's, you know, you take dirt and you add water and now you've got something malleable, something that can hold together, that has cohesion, that can, has a fluidity potential to it. No longer brittle. And this is us. We're this mix of the elements, and profoundly so the Earth and the water. And when we work with the elements, as I spoke with about some yesterday, we're using them to break down this story of separation and isolation, this story of I, me and mine. And we do that working with the elements in a number of ways, and I just wanted to name those before we move into the guided meditation. That part of what we're doing is changing the conceptual story that we carry around. We are all living by stories. We have stories that we tell ourselves and we tell each other in our mind. And many of these stories are centered around I, me and mine. And as we practice with the elements, we are inviting a change in this story, in this conceptual story. We're also, when we work with the elements, feeling. We're bypassing the story altogether at times. We're feeling directly through the other sense gates besides the thinking one. We're feeling into the body and sensing the element of Earth and today the element of water as we feel it and know it through our sensory perception. And I've added in sound today because I have a little waterfall behind me. So we can feel the water element in us directly. And this is part of what we do when we are practicing with the water element. And then we also play with the element metaphorically or poetically sort of bridging this gap from the story into the body, into the experience of it. So you'll hear in the guided meditations of the elements that we go back and forth at times we do touch into the conceptual, trying to change the story that we're carrying. And then at other times we're just feeling directly in the body and sometimes just touching, sort of like sparking a different way of seeing and knowing. So I wanted to start with the poetic. This is a poem from Rosemary Wachula-Tromer called The Great Beyond. And once again the invitation to see beyond the self, the way water knows itself, not only as river and lake, but also as fern, as cloud, as cat. Forgive me for believing I end with this skin, these ideas, these imaginings. Sometimes I forget to choose vastness, forget to know the self as cliff, as mataki, as crumb. How is it I so often miss the invitation? How is it I overlook that I am lemon, asteroid, wren? So let's do a little remembering. So go ahead and find your meditation posture. Settle in, feel your contact with the ground. Sense through the body, relaxing, opening. Letting your eyes close if you're comfortable with that. And as you relax you might just start to notice that there are places where there might be a kind of rigidity or a frozenness. And as you relax them, there's a softening. In that relaxing you're connecting with the water in that part of the body, allowing it to come into its more fluid nature, not holding it, freezing it in place, but instead opening it. Feel your legs in contact with the ground. Notice how they are, that's how they're affected by both the pull of gravity and what they have contact with, the way that they're formed. Pooling, soft. You can start to sense the water, the wateriness inside your body. Letting the water drop towards the ground. Feel this play of the earth element in the water as you feel the area of the hips and the lower belly. Letting the lower belly soften. You might notice its viscous, malleable nature softening towards the earth. You can feel the earth element in your spine and in the uprightness. And then letting the softness of the belly, of the shoulders pulling down. This is internal lubrication, dropping down towards the ground. And yet it stays cohesive. Nothing's going to turn into just a puddle. Held together and yet soft. Notice that the movement of breath in your chest and in your belly is made possible by this flexible and yet cohesive combination of water with the earth. As you breathe, the water element allows the expanding of breath. Coming up into the area of the mouth and throat. And here you can feel the water element directly. You get a little taste, quite literally, of the inside of your body, this wateriness that is all through us. Coming up to your eyes. Even if your eyes are closed, you can notice that your eyes have very slight movements and your eyeballs rest in their bath of water. And you might even notice in spite of the hardness of our skull, the felt rigidity, that inside you might even sense that your brain is resting, letting it soften and rest in its fluid bath. Letting yourself feel this fluidity in the body, perhaps you can sense in places the pulse of the blood moving through your veins, our internal irrigation system. All this wateriness here in us, coming from the water you have drunk, coming with the juiciness of fruit that you've eaten. This water with the heat rises into the sky, travels through the sky in clouds, rains down, flows in streams, underground. And somewhere comes to surface and comes to you. And as you drink it, you're just a temporary location of this water. It's passing through you. We're like a little eddy in this flow of the river of water. It whirls in this corner and then it flows back out. Evaporation through our skin, through our breath, through our pee. You too are part of the hydrological cycle. The water is simply coming in for a time passing back out. You might just let yourself feel, hopefully you have some idea where your water comes from. And let yourself sense that water falling down through some reservoir, flowing through you, back out again. This endless sharing of the water. And so easy when it comes in to think that it's me, I, mine. But it's simply water passing through. No inside, no outside, just water. When we as fish first decided to walk on land, we brought the ocean with us inside. The saltiness of our blood is the saltiness of the ocean. We carry the ocean with us and we rejuvenate it and refresh it each glass of water we drink. We like every other creature, we're water creatures. Let yourself feel in the little micromovements, even as you sit still, the little micromovements of the body, of the breath. You can feel the fluidity. Notice if any part of your body becomes rigid, holding, that there's some contradiction in that to our natural fluid state. And then it softens again in its true nature of water, of softness, cohesive and yet fluid. South of the Mojave emerged up. Simply water flowing through. No inside, no outside. Not yours. Feeling the softness. The cohesive yet fluid nature of the body. Notice the little micro-movement. The movement of the ribs and the breath and the belly. Feel your own wateriness. And share this wateriness with all the other living beings. With the rivers and the oceans. And share this wateriness with all the other living beings. With all the other living beings. Let yourself also feel this blessing of the water. This aliveness that it carries. Every cell in your body touched by water. Nourished, allowed to move and change. Allowing it to do its work. The quietability of your skin. The lubrication in your joints. Feel the blessings of water. Feel you sol............ Feel the softness, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the breath. Feel the softness, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the breath. Feel the softness, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the breath. Feel the softness, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the breath. Feel the softness, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the breath. Feel the softness, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the breath. Feel the softness, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the fluidity of the body as it continues to soften the micro movements, the fluidity of the body as it
