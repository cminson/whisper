 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Oh, great. So welcome, welcome everyone. It's lovely to be with you, lovely to feel your presence from various places in the world. So for tonight, for today's, in this moment's happy hour, I wanted to invite us to engage with metta, with metta for the body. Metta for the body can be quite a powerful practice engaging with metta, with well, appreciation, kindness for this body that we call ours. And yet it's not exactly ours. It's made up of so many causes and conditions that have made it so. And we can't, it's not exactly ours. And what I mean by that is that we don't completely have control over it. We can't say, okay, stop digesting now or heal faster or don't get sick or whatever it is. You know, we have limited control over this body. There's some, you know, we take care of it. We hopefully appreciate it. We tend to it. And yet it's above and beyond. We take it to be ours and yet it's above and beyond. So might be helpful sometimes within our meditation, as I perhaps will, will guide and suggest tonight is to see this body, this hardworking, amazing, miraculous body that breathes and digests and heals itself. When we get a paper cut, we wouldn't know how to do it. But we consider it perhaps sometimes as a, not just as a friend, as a friend, maybe sometimes having a hard time. It's doing, they're doing their best and they're having a hard time. They're having challenges, perhaps. And also as a beloved other, as a beloved other. I'll say more about that through the meditation. So, so I think that's all I want to say. I don't want to say more. There be more that will become, yeah, there would be more through the meditation that I will share. So let's just, just practice together. Let's do it. So, so I'd like to invite you all to arrive, settle in your bodies. Arriving here in this body in this moment. Arriving with this body, this friend, who's been working so hard trying, support you, the immune system has been working so hard all day, keeping the pathogens out, out of its kingdom. Your heart, your muscle, your spleen, kidneys, all these amazing parts of the body. The tissue, the blood flowing, the bones. All these functions, this amazing body has managed to perform today. Breathing, seeing, hearing, still doing that, hearing, sitting. Speaking earlier, making words, cognizing, reading. Maybe sometimes we expect even more, just more. Oh gosh, your back is hurting to your body. Expecting more, more and more, what if we set it all down, set it all down. Let the body rest right now, it's okay sweetheart. It's just okay to be, to just be, to rest and be, and feel appreciated. Thank you. Thank you. And letting the body to relax, soften, just be. Letting the breath be soothing, comforting, nourishing this body. Let's go through the body with appreciation, with metta. We won't cover all the functions and all the miracle, miracles that this body is. Let the body be relaxed, soft, receiving, receiving appreciation, receiving being seen, lucid, self- Starting from the top of the head. We love our head, the top of the head. Actually let's start with the hair just as it is. Short, long, thin, brittle, bald, non-existent. Can we love it just as it is? Appreciate. This miracle of nature grows, regenerates. Or not. And then the brain, however it functions, fast, long, creative, appreciating loving it just as it is. We often associate our mind in the West with our brain. Not a one-to-one mapping at all. But if you do, perhaps chastise yourself or a wandering mind, can you love, can you love the functioning of this amazing, miraculous piece of machinery? Love your body, your brain just as it is. Thank you. Letting go of wanting more are different in this moment. Seeing it all back, the wanting more different leader. But right now, see what it feels like if you just let it go. If you let it go. Just love what is. Appreciate, deeply appreciate what is. Appreciating your eyes, a function of seeing. Whether they're getting weaker, they've gotten weaker, or they're sharp or not. Whether they're healthy or challenged. Loving these eyes just as they are. Wishing them well, sense of good will. As if they were a beloved other. As if they were just amazing gifts, as bodies endowed with. Moving down your nose. Last time, a st Your mouth tongue tasting Your teeth whether they're challenged, working Your well needs support still Appreciating what is What is how new Maybe you had Some food earlier today you were able to taste It amazing or smell it amazing It hears the function of the ears, hearing. Appreciating such a gift it is, and how your life would be different if it weren't here. Whether hearing the ears are challenged, working well, the function isn't. The receding doesn't matter, or not here at all, still loving. What is, what is. Moving down, your heart, your lungs. Breathing, breathing area, hearing, extracting oxygen, spreading it through the body, through the blood. Amazing. Thank you. So much that is working in your body, even if they're challenges. Wishing your heart well, wishing your lungs well, as if with a beloved other. Thank you. Your stomach. Liver, kidneys. Your microbiome. All these organisms that help you survive. We have a sense of appreciation, mitta, kindness, gratitude for this body. Thank you. Arms and hands. You've done so much today. I do. I usually take you for granted, but not in this moment. May you be well. Thank you. Kidneys, grown area, sit bones. Ah. So many amazing functions. Thank you, body. Your legs, knees, lower legs and feet, movement, ambulation, walking, jogging, running, maybe. Balancing. As much as it's available. Reaching legs, feet, loving and wishing well, that's good will for this body that is nature. It's born, it's from nature, it's nature. Appreciation for this body, my body as a whole. Both the parts and the totality. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we love and appreciate this body. Just as it is. Thank you for having meta, kindness, good will for the body, as a stepping stone for having meta for ourselves. May we wish ourselves well as being who is me. May I be safe, happy, healthy. May I have ease. May I be well. Thank you. And as we bring this practice period to a close. May I be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease. May I be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease. May all beings, including myself, be free. Thank you for your practice. So what we did tonight with turning our appreciation, our love, our meta towards the body, really appreciating, not taking for granted the various functions. Of course, there's so many, many more functions. And that is a way of appreciating because sometimes again we have this attitude about the body when it's challenging or it's aging or sagging in a way of not liking it or hating it or as if it's letting us down this body as if it's personal. And if we just completely turn that around into appreciation, into just love and appreciation for all these amazing functions. What actually works, what has been working, profound, instead of turning into what's not working and what is a challenge and what's the problem. And this sense of appreciation, love, gratitude, metta for the body is a way in, is a way in for metta for ourselves, which many folks find it difficult having good will for ourselves. But we start with the body, kind of it's like a side door, we enter through the side door. Because maybe it's easier to have appreciation for our eyes. Oh yeah, I can see. Yeah, maybe I need glasses now. But yeah, it still works pretty amazing. Then as a doorway for metta for ourselves. So, changing the settings in the chat, if you have any reflections that you like to share in chat to everyone or it's private, you can just type to me and I'll read your reflection but not your name. You can also raise your zoom hand if you'd like to share and aha moment or a challenge or a question. One of you says my body. Thanks you Nikki. Your body is welcome. What reflections you like to share for your own benefit and benefit of others. I don't think you can see me I had to change devices and I think I'm just a picture on the screen, but I wanted to share because this is a topic that's been very important in my life. I have two family members who are severely disabled in accidents through no fault of their own, and have managed to not only survive but live very happy productive lives. But they taught me to always be grateful for what I have. Because I am, I still ride a bike and I'm not young, I don't even stretch. And I'm still an active cyclist. And I'm so grateful that I have been given this wonderful body that works very well for me. But I work hard to take you good care of it also. So I like your topic very much. Because it ran very close to things that are important to me. Thank you Claire. Thank you so much and especially for also bringing in, but not just your own relationship but also the relatives who have had very challenging bodies who have been very challenged in their function but they have, they have been living very full lives. Yeah. Beautiful. Great. Thank you for that Claire. Yeah, any other reflections or questions or complaints or anything so I'll walk on before we turn turn to small groups. Neil says, it's better. Thanks for asking wait, that's probably what was that for me that might have been for someone else. Okay, no problem. Oh no, that was a direct message also nevermind it was in public. I hope you're a bit I'm glad it's better, Neil whatever it is, is better. Okay, you're raising your hand now. Yeah, so. Yeah, I really enjoyed this meditation someone asked me I had a bad headache last night I missed class. They asked me how I was doing. Yeah, it was just, you know, it. The concept that, you know, whatever is not working well, you know, is really doing its best, anyhow. You know, even if it's feeling miserable, you know I've been having a lot of back problems in the past. Right, too long. You know, but thinking, thinking, Oh, I hate my back is really just so terrible. Right, it's just right and you know this thought of thinking, gee you know my back's doing its best and you know you know I wish it could do better it wishes it can do better to what can I do to help it. You know, just makes life, you know, so much, you know, more pleasant. So right right and this, you know, I've had thoughts like that and this meditation seemed to really foster those it was, it was really quite lovely. Beautiful. Thank you so much, Neil. Well said, it's yeah exactly I couldn't, couldn't say it better. Yeah. Thank you. And then glad your headache is better. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. One of you asks how to offer meta to those we hate. Well, meta is a gradual practice. So, so we see it, it goes through concentric circle so you start with, with someone that's easy for you to have metaphor, and then yourself, that's more challenging so someone who was easy than yourself. And then someone who is neutral. Someone you don't either like but it's like you know very little about. Maybe someone, you know, barista at a coffee shop, etc. And then after you do the neutral category then that becomes a stand in that it becomes easier than to move to people you dislike because it's kind of a gradual so you can kind of just jump into doing meta for those uses so so I suggested the person who asked that question, do a little more gradual cultivation and they're actually a recorded guided meditations on audio Dharma, that's not the theme tonight for offering methods to those who are challenging we don't say that those we hate but those we have challenges with. So please look at audio Dharma.org and search under meta for for those we have challenges with. And you will find many guided meditations that will support you. Another person asks how is meta for the body related to reflection on repulsiveness of the body. I'll say very briefly. So, there are practices of a suba in poly a suba a suba so it's translated as repulsiveness but that's not a very helpful translation actually. It's kind of it's the not attractiveness not because we often, you know, look at the body or body of others usually it's like oh it's attractive and their sexual energy and especially when it's inappropriate. So that practice really is a way for us to to bring wisdom that oh it's just a body is just, oh yeah, just functional is just a functional body, you know that leg that oh yeah, what a beautiful is just a functional body is just walking. And then there is more to it when you actually start to see if there's again more desire and more if there's a lot of desire then you start to see that. Oh yeah, it's, you know, the leg is made of skin and sinews and flesh and blood you start to see it as its functionality in order to actually see to kind of cure yourself of this infatuation you might be having with with someone's body. So, it's a very wholesome way it's not just so that you start hating your body or other people's body it's a very skillful very clever actually set of practices which I have practiced, actually, and offering method to the body is a sense of appreciation for the functionality of the body it's it's again it's not falling in love with its beauty it's not that so actually the these two practices go together quite well. And I can say a lot more I can picture on this for hours but time is limited and the time actually has come for us to to transition to small groups the person who asked that question I hope that clarified it for you a little bit. And it was helpful. So. Welcome. So, yeah, like to invite us to engage in small groups with with fellow practitioners and something actually I was listening to this this interview was an NPR about this, yeah was the about the Harvard adult study that has gone on since 1930s. So it's almost like 90 years anyway, and some scientists scientists have written a new book about what is the biggest measure of of of hell or healthy happy life. And it turns out to be surprise surprise relationships relationships so here in the happy hour we have the opportunity for relationships in this next section to just relate to have a conversation with another couple of fellow practitioners in the space so I encourage you to engage. And the reflection for the small groups tonight is, is the relationship to the body, how can we, you know, how can you how do you how can you how do you aspire to have a meta filled relationship, especially with a part of your body. That might be challenged, that might be challenged, how can you love and support instead of hating it and disliking it and pushing it, etc. As Neil beautifully said it is doing its best. So, as always invited to maybe share reflection, and then maybe also hold space maybe when your turn comes you say pass and then the next person says something and then the next person says something and then it comes your turn so each nugget let it be short, so that there's time and space for everyone to share something. Then again if your turn comes you can say pass and, and the next time comes to you maybe there's something you want to share. So, so with that, be kind to yourself. So, let's, let's dedicate the marriage and close on honoring the your time. I'll stay a couple minutes after after our cacophonous goodbye on zoom if there are any reflections or questions you'd like to share so. So thank you all again for your practice for for cultivating your heart for your own sake, the sake of all beings everywhere, may all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone, be well, see you on Friday.
