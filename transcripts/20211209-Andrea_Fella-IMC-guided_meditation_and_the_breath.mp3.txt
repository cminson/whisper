Dance in whatever way is simple.
Dance in whatever way is simple.
Just beginning by arriving with yourself.
Sensing into your body. How's your body?
In a general way.
Is there tension or ease, agitation or calm?
And no judgment about what's here.
Just really kind of taking stock or just acknowledging for yourself this is what's here.
This is where we begin our mindfulness practice by acknowledging honestly with ourselves what's here.
And sometimes when we do that acknowledging, we acknowledge, oh, this is how things are right now.
It's almost as if some part of us was waiting for that attention and is happy to be seen.
For not judging how we are, it can be a kind of a coming home to, oh, right, this is what's here.
This is how I am right now.
I'm a very awareness of that.
Can create a kind of space or a little container sometimes that allows whatever is here.
Whether it's a little bit of a struggle or a calmness and ease.
It just allows it to be with just this recognition this is how it is and allowing quality in the mind.
That allowing quality being a flavor of kindness for ourselves.
That we are being honest with ourselves in this moment and allowing ourselves to be.
And as we connect to how we are without judgment about how we are.
It may be possible to allow there to be some relaxation of body if you notice some tension in the body somewhere.
Just a gentle inclination or invitation.
Maybe there can be a softening of tension in the body.
Maybe the face can soften the head, the neck, the shoulders.
Maybe there can be a softening.
Any arms, the hands soften.
Chest and upper back.
Perhaps there can also be a softening there.
Just relax.
Maybe there can be a relaxation around the rib cage allowing the breath to just flow in a little bit of a relaxed way.
Maybe the stomach, the abdomen can relax.
Let it soften and hang forward a little bit.
We often hold tension there kind of subconsciously.
Maybe just consciously letting it release forward.
Maybe the back, the hips, the legs and the feet can relax.
Maybe there can also be a softening inside the body.
Maybe the inside of the throat can relax.
Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can relax.
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax.
All those organs inside of our body.
A softening in that inner area.
Maybe too, there can be a letting go of tightness in the mind, mental tension that might be thinking about the past or the future, worried or concerned about something.
Maybe there can be a little bit of softening of that.
Just setting aside for now.
Maybe worries or concerns.
Sometimes it can be helpful to just say, I'll be back.
I'll be back to you just for now.
I'm going to relax and be with just what's here in the moment.
I'll be back.
Turning now towards just how your body is having relaxed a bit.
Taking in the experience of body now.
Perhaps exploring or noticing if there's a slightly different experience now, having spent some time connecting with yourself, allowing experience and relaxing.
How is it now?
Aware of the body.
Perhaps a broader sense of the body.
Breathing or maybe specific sensations if there's something obvious, like the pressure of your hands or feet, your hips against the chair or wherever you're sitting.
Or maybe the sensations of breathing.
Breathing at the nostrils, perhaps sensations there or inside the throat.
Or the movement of your chest or abdomen with the in breath and the out breath.
Exploring a very relaxed and receptive kind of meeting of experience.
What does it mean to receive the breath rather than looking for it or looking at it?
Letting the breath come to you and allowing the body to show you how it feels the breath rather than you trying to figure it out.
Relaxing and receiving sensations of breathing.
Aware of the sensations of breathing.
This aware quality, we can notice it in a simple way, just knowing that we're breathing.
Breathing in, can you know that you're breathing in?
Breathing out, can you know that you're breathing out?
Simple, simple receiving of those sensations of breathing in and breathing out.
As we connect with this simple experience like the breath, it enlivens this capacity we have for awareness.
It's like it lights it up.
And as we notice the breath, we might also notice other things happening at the same time.
We don't have to try to push them away or try to not experience those.
And so for instance, you may have been hearing my voice while you were noticing the breath at the same time.
You're hearing and the breath.
You may notice other sensations in the body while there's the breath coming and going.
Body sensations and the breath.
Nor we might be aware of a mood or an emotion happening while we're breathing, breathing with the emotion.
Feeling and the breath.
One of my teachers, Tanisaru Biku, uses a beautiful image around connecting to the breath and how that awareness can illuminate other things.
He says we might have a candle in the middle of a room and we could look at the candle and be interested in the candle itself.
Or we could be interested in the light of the candle that lights up the whole room, revealing other things in the room other than the candle.
The awareness of the breath can be like that, a gentle light connection.
Breathing in, breathing out.
And aware of other body sensations, sounds, emotions, even thoughts sometimes.
And the breath in this way using the connection with the breath to open us up to the broader field of what's happening in our experience.
And the breath.
