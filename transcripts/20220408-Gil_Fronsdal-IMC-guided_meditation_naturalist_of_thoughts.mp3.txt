 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Welcome to the last meditation on the Senspheres. So hello and welcome to our last meditation on the Senspheres. The word Dharma is sometimes equated with the English word nature to see the Dharma as a sea nature, to see what's natural in this world of ours. Meditation makes us a little bit naturalist, where we are looking and understanding what the nature of this life is like, especially the nature of ourselves and our mind. A naturalist has the ability to see what's happening without disturbing what's happening, without interfering with it, and without holding on to the branches of the stream as we go down the canoe. We can just flow along with the natural flow. So one of the most natural things for human beings is to have thoughts. And it's possible to just know that there's a thought that appears, and there's a kind of a marvel with the arising of individual thought sometimes, because it just seems to appear out of nowhere. Just sit quietly and a new thought arises. And so in this exercise on the senses, six senses, there is thoughts, and then there's the reception of that thought in the mind. The mind knows it, that there's a thought. And then there's the fetter, the entanglement, the not. There's the way we get involved in that thought. And one of the ways we see that is when a thought becomes thinking. A thought is a relatively brief phrase or sentence or image that we have. And then we get involved in it. We pick it up, we respond to it, we add to it. And then pretty soon we're kind of lost in a whole train of thoughts. It might take a long time before we come out of it and know that we're even present. And so it's possible just to sit quietly and be aware of the thought when it arises. And then, distinct from that, know how we get involved in it. Know the pull into it, the reaction to it, the horror to it, the judgments of it. All the secondary things that go on that involve some kind of being caught in it. But if we're able to be a naturalist of thoughts, of thought-ing, it can be very relaxing if we don't assign meaning to a thought or value to a thought. We don't define ourselves by the thought. I'm having this kind of thought, therefore I'm a wonderful person. I'm having this kind of thought and I'm a terrible person. It's just a thought. This idea of just a thought, just thinking. And this is one of the places where I think it's valuable to add the word just in the label, in the recognition of thinking, just a thought. It's just thinking. And just like a map is not the location that the map represents, so a thought is not the thing that it usually represents. It's just a thought. And to settle back and be able to just see the arising of thoughts and then see if we lean into them or pull away from them or get caught in them. And that's seeing the knot, the entanglement. So assuming a dignified meditation posture, and part of the value of being careful with your posture is that the more you can be embodied in your posture, the less energy there is to pour into thinking. The more you can really be careful and embodied in your posture, the more that's a grounding here in the present moment. It's like an anchor that keeps you from drifting off. And then lower your gaze about 45 degrees. Relax the focus of your eyes so you're not looking at anything in particular. And then gently close your eyes. And settle in, relax with your body. Gently, calmly, take some deeper breaths, fuller breaths. And as you exhale, relax, settle in. And letting your breathing return to normal. And it's really invaluable to relax when you meditate, to have an upright posture or a clear posture, intentional posture. And then to relax within that posture. You might relax the muscles of your face as you exhale. And as you get more and more familiar with your face this way, you might become more and more aware of the subtle emotions, the subtle muscles that can be relaxed, soften, released. Over time, there's more and more awareness of muscles maybe you never even knew you had. On the exhale, relaxing the shoulders. And going to the belly, on the exhale, softening the belly. In the exhale, release your body, weight of your body, into whatever is supporting it, cushion, chair. And then some global way of relaxing the whole body. If you're bracing yourself against life, soften as you exhale. And then relaxing the thinking mind. On the exhale, softening tension or pressure, contraction, associated with thinking. Alarming any agitation associated with thinking...... And then take a few moments here to be aware of thoughts arising. Turn your attention, allow yourself to think and know the thoughts that arise. You don't necessarily have to know the content of the thoughts, just the event of thinking. And as you do so, are you involved in your thinking or can you just observe them from a distance? Observing them as natural phenomena. No need to judge or define yourself by your thoughts. The thoughts just arise appear. Sooner or later they disappear.... Are you involved in your thinking? What does that involvement feel like? Like a glue, like a strong gravitational pull? Strong interest. Worrying about something....... The alternative to entanglement is to simply observe it as a naturalist. It's nature for the mind to produce thoughts. There's no need for you to get involved in your thoughts. Go back to your breathing. Breathe with it all............................................................... Thinking caring or generous thoughts about them. With a light feeling, not a duty or heavy, just lightly positive, good feelings and thoughts about them. And this is not just letting your stream of thinking be random and without any agency on your part. And time to time, it's nice to choose what you think about and think about goodwill and friendliness to yourself, to others. And this way, maybe keep close by as we go through the day. The friendliness, the goodwill, the care that comes from the wish, the wishes. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. The Friendless The Friendless Thank you.
