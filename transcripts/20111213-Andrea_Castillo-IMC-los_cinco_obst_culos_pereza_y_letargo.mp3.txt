The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
When you listen to this quote, think specifically about the topic of the hour, which is laziness and laziness.
When someone is dedicated to the most advanced training, he needs to pay attention to three things.
Concentration, energy effort and equanimity.
By giving regular attention to each of these areas, our mind will be malleable, usable and lucid,
and well-concentrated to triumph over obstacles.
This quote mentions the energy effort, which is a key ingredient in the Vipassana or introspective meditation practice.
It is essential to know how to regulate our energy to achieve, as this quote says, a concentrated, lucid and malleable mind
that can alleviate obstacles.
What we are going to do today is first investigate laziness and laziness,
then learn to recognize the presence and differentiate it from laziness,
because sometimes these two things confuse us.
And finally, we are going to consider and practice techniques on how to stimulate our energy.
As we saw last week, the order in which obstacles appear has its own wisdom.
The first obstacle we saw two weeks ago is sensual desire.
This is the central part of our lives, and that is why it appears in the first place, in several of the Buddhist teachings.
The second obstacle, which is the bad will, forms the opposite pole of the first,
because with the first, with the sensual desire, we want something, with the bad will, we are rejecting something.
Now, it is interesting to see which place has the third obstacle.
When we are accustomed to the constant stimulus of wanting something and rejecting something,
when there is the absence of these two poles, what happens?
We are defeated.
Let's see an example, because I think the examples help a little to explain what I mean.
Imagine that they are in a very wonderful reception,
and they are invited to be served in a magnificent buffet.
They go through the long tables and serve everything they want.
They choose what they want, they leave aside what they don't want.
They sit down to eat, they enjoy the food, they finish their food,
although there are still some delicious desserts and if they want more, there is no more space.
Okay, they liked it.
How do you think we feel at that moment, after having had this opportunity to give pleasure to all our desires,
at least in the field of food?
On the one hand, of course, for having eaten a lot, we are going to feel a little...
that is normal, we are going to feel a little loose.
But in addition to that, it is interesting to see that many times we focus on this as a burden,
because for some moments there is no desire.
It is subtle.
If you have never felt it, don't worry.
Observe it from time to time.
When you feel a little like a disaffined violin,
I like to think like an instrument that is disaffined,
if you have the idea of, I'm hungry,
for a while I'm going to eat like you're a little excited,
but if you don't even have that desire, suddenly you feel like you're half lost.
It is important to just realize that, not to criticize ourselves.
It is very important that the more we get to know each other,
the more we see our vulnerabilities and imperfections,
more compassion and love, bondage or friendship, we risk.
It is typical in this situation that I described,
after a situation where all our desires were fulfilled,
between this nightmare, the dreaminess, the laziness and laziness.
Again, if we go back to the example, if we are on vacation,
there is no problem, after this coma, we take a nap and that's it.
But if this state arises in meditation,
then that is where we want to try to manipulate our energy in some way
to see if we can cultivate or make the energy arise.
Because in the moment that we let ourselves go back to the laziness,
what happens is that our mind is already clear at that moment.
And of course it is not alert.
Similarly, we can see something that is interesting in how the perceptions
within Buddhist teachings are described.
It is said that when we perceive something,
normally they have three characteristics or flavors, we can say.
Either it is pleasant or unpleasant or neutral.
The pleasant and the unpleasant have an energetic charge.
Any pleasant or unpleasant experience somehow has energy within us.
When it is neutral, there is where it becomes a little annoying,
because there is where we get bored, lazy, etc.
Now what happens is that most of us are quite addicted to this feeling of energy,
of wanting something, of rejecting something.
Pereza and lethargy are physically manifested as an absence of vitality.
In the body it feels heavy, lethargic, crumpled or even weak.
With lethargy it is very difficult to maintain a right position.
You have to make a special effort to maintain a good posture.
It is also characterized by a lack of mental energy.
The mind can be clouded, crumpled, or as it is said, also crumpled, easily distracted.
And the challenge is that it is very difficult for us to change the state.
As we are under energy, it is difficult for us to get out of this vicious circle.
There is a small advantage, which has to be mentioned in this lethargic state.
When we are in this state, the mind moves very slowly.
The advantage is that we have a little more possibility of seeing what is happening in the mind.
The challenge of when we are anxious, which is what we will see after the holidays,
is that it moves faster or very fast, and then it is difficult to have clarity.
We can imagine that being under energy and lethargy is like walking in a swamp,
or if we remember the metaphor of Buddhist teachings,
that it is like a container with water with algae, that the water is thick with algae.
When this obstacle is strong, we do not even have the clarity to realize that we are under this obstacle.
It is highly recommended that during meditation, when the laziness and lethargy arise,
we do not say, I am going to stop and I am going to do something else.
We have to take advantage of studying it.
I am aware that I have a little bit of anxiety now.
Let's see how my body feels. Let's see what attitude I bring to this experience.
Of course, it is not something that we are very happy about.
We would like to have very pleasant experiences when we are meditating,
but we have to accept them, we have to observe them.
As we said, let's see how to differentiate if we are tired or if we are weak.
If we are tired, it is very simple. What we need to do is to rest.
However, if we are not tired, what we need to do is to access our energy.
The difference between being tired and being under the influence of laziness and lethargy
is that when you are tired, there is no energy.
As you realize, as a pile, the pile is finished.
When we are weak or there is laziness and lethargy, we are not accessing our energy.
But we are not accessing it. In some way, energetically, we close our body.
Let's see some of the methods that are recommended.
When one has laziness and lethargy, when one is meditating,
as some of us have already practiced, it is to first bring energy to our posture.
It is to be very, very aware that even if it is a little, we have let the body fall.
We have to bring energy.
The other is to open your eyes. You can start by looking like a meter ahead on the floor.
If you are still tired, raise your gaze and focus on the light.
Looking at the light can also help a lot.
Lower the body temperature. You can take off a sweater or something that is a little less warm.
Increase the frequency of the mental notes.
If you are noticing that your mind is slowly thinking here and there, then make an effort.
Not only thinking, but also changing. Thinking about how they are, how they feel, the sensation in the abdomen, the tension in the shoulders.
It is something that one day we try to do it in pairs.
It is an interesting exercise that one hears, the other is describing those mental notes.
It gives a very good concentration when one practices this.
The other exercise is to breathe deeply. I do not know how they felt it.
To breathe deeply, very slowly, hold the air as much as possible and then let go.
How did you feel it? Did you feel any change?
Yes.
Yes, if you go through it. Yes, there is nothing more to this green.
That makes you feel it.
I think that when you do the change of breathing in some way, as it is done again to fall where one is,
and the more frequent you do it, the more energy you generate.
And little by little, there is a moment when you no longer need to get to that, because you have achieved it, with the constancy of having been doing the frequencies.
The first part I did not understand you well, tell me again.
Yes, with the constancy. If once I fell in that state,
to start breathing and then let go slowly, slowly, with that constancy,
it ends up generating like an energy, like the body is energized and that constancy.
Now tell me, did you feel more that the energy was given to have focused the mind on something,
or because physically, when breathing in that way, something changed?
I think when breathing physically in that way.
I do not know, maybe it opens our lungs or something happens, but yes, it is to breathe in that way.
And as it is at that moment thinking about what it is doing,
it also returns to how one grabs itself again, to be aware that one is meditating.
It is like an extra tool.
That is the thing of having several tools and knowing in each meditation what tool you need.
That is the trick.
But yes, it gives energy.
It takes away the concentration and also the burden.
Ok, perfect. Pablo, how did you feel it?
She described it very well.
But it helped me a lot with the anxiety.
Ah, how good. To let the breath...
The exhalation?
The exhalation slowly.
In that I felt an almost immediate change.
Wow, very good, very good.
The other, obviously as she described it, also had the same effect.
But the other, to exhale slowly,
created a change in my consciousness about my body reacting,
lowering the rhythm.
Very good.
The concentration of the breath, of exhalation,
with the sensation of the body, it was just one.
And that is the interesting thing about studying these obstacles,
especially not all of us,
to see in which we have our speciality.
Each of us, we tend to each other.
And for example, with the level of energy,
it is very interesting to study.
If you meditate at different hours of the day,
how do you change your energy at different hours of the day?
And then you start as a good chemist,
to change it, to adjust it through the breathing,
through your posture, through the exercises you do with concentration.
Evelia, how did you feel?
I felt relaxed.
How good. Did it make you difficult to do the long inhalation
and then to sustain it?
No.
Oh, how good.
It did not cause anxiety to stop the air, perfect.
I felt it.
Because sometimes it can be.
I felt relaxed.
Stupid.
Alfredo, you have another microphone there,
if you want, so that you don't have to...
Do you know where it is?
If it is not here, it is the other one.
There it is.
And if you tell us how you felt it.
I also felt more relaxed when I stopped breathing.
I felt more relaxed.
I discovered something that worked for me.
Oh, good.
Stupid.
Stupid.
Another thing?
Well, the following tactics that I am going to give you are more drastic.
That already implies stopping.
When one is sitting, meditating,
there is a master from Thailand, Ajahn Chah,
a very famous one who said,
you are meditating and head once,
and head twice,
and head again.
The third time, you stop and meditate.
So there is no trick,
you just stop very straight,
with your feet very stable,
a little separated,
your hands go forward or back.
And...
You can sometimes experiment,
standing with your eyes closed,
because one feels that the balance is a little unstable,
but there you experiment.
And the other possibility is walking,
walking meditation.
I know, Pablo, you have done it,
we haven't done it with you.
You have done it?
No.
No?
Ok, so we have to do it with Alfredo,
neither.
One day we will try.
In short, what you are going to do is walk a short distance,
let's say from those chairs over here,
I don't know, 2 or 3 meters,
you go and walk very slowly,
paying a lot of attention,
if it is possible without the shoes
so that you can feel all the articulation of the foot,
and it is meditation and movement.
Ok.
Now, let's say that you have tried all these exercises
and all these tactics and you are still tired.
So you want to say that you are going to have a party,
that you are tired.
There is not a recipe that serves for everything, obviously.
That every situation we have to pay attention to and see what the ideal is at this moment.
Now, although it may seem a little complicated to remember
to do all these things,
it is not.
The main thing is that if you try something
and you start to feel that the energy flows,
that the mind is alert, that there is greater clarity,
then you are on the right path.
You don't have to worry about anything else,
you don't have to do any more tactics, nothing.
There it is.
That is what we are looking for.
There is no problem.
Now,
among all of us,
we just said what we can do
when we are meditating so that the energy arises.
Now, what is it that we can do when we are in our daily life?
Among all, for example,
what do you do when you feel low in energy
and you have to do something
and you are looking for a way of...
I'm going to say get a Pete's coffee here.
Starbucks.
Well,
in addition to the coffee
or the black tea,
it is great to do exercise.
Whatever it is,
I highly recommend it.
Find the way that your body, specifically, likes to do exercise,
but doing exercise is great.
Dance, walk in nature,
work with the earth,
even if you don't have a garden,
a few plants,
sing, play a musical instrument,
help someone,
play with the children.
Anyway, we could continue with a huge list.
You have to look for each one
that is the type of activity,
that is constructive
and that will give us something of energy.
I think the most wonderful technique
and obviously that will bring more difference in our lives
is if we have a noble and significant goal in our lives,
simply remembering this is what I want to do,
it brings you energy.
A huge reason
for the emergence of pereza and lethargy
is this lack of meaning in our lives.
So,
as I said a while ago,
when we are under the influence of pereza or lethargy,
it doesn't mean that we don't have energy,
it simply means that we are not able
to access this energy that is there.
With a change of attitude,
here in the mind,
you can change quickly and rapidly.
I give you an example
that is very clear to children.
It is an example that Gil uses a lot.
Imagine that they are in the supermarket
with two little children.
They are making their purchases
and the children are like,
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm bored,
and they say,
would you like to go and buy an ice cream?
Boom!
The child suddenly is happy
and full of energy,
like magic,
it gave itself a change.
And with us it is the same,
just that it doesn't look so clear.
The question is a little more sophisticated,
but it is the same.
So, what happens?
The mind says,
this is boring,
this has nothing to do with me,
therefore,
I give up.
And at the moment,
the energy circuit is off
in our body.
In other words, the level of energy
depends on an evaluation.
Nothing is then inherently boring.
Yes, I explain.
It is a judgment,
a mental activity
that we have put to something
that says, this is boring.
And what is interesting about it
is that it is very common
that what we find boring
is something that has nothing to do with us.
Notice that if someone is washing us,
if someone is throwing a pirope at you,
it is guaranteed that you will be
totally present
and nothing is caught on you.
Even when someone is criticizing you,
it is the same.
It is very important for us to know
why someone is thinking badly of us.
But when there is something
that has nothing to do with us,
with our self-image,
it is common that then we find boring.
It happens to us all.
We do not recriminate.
It is only something that is very human.
In trade,
we know very well this weak human being.
And I do not know if you know that Motorola
created a new term
called micro-boredom,
micro-boring.
I mean, they have studied very well
that we have these moments of boredom
and therefore they are going to sell us a product.
This is mobile technology.
This is the iPhone.
This is the Blackberry.
Some toy for you to entertain yourself
while you are waiting to pay in the supermarket,
while you are waiting for the bus to arrive
or the train to leave.
So,
we are aware that
in reality there is no boring moment.
Boring means
that I am not paying attention
to what is happening at the moment.
I think it is also beneficial
to be aware of what activities
cause or promote
laziness and laziness.
For example,
if each one thinks
in your life
what causes you
laziness,
I give you an idea, for example,
to eat excessively,
to drink alcohol.
What else?
Exactly.
Drugs can cause you to fall.
Of course, there is everything,
but there are drugs that make you fall
into a terrible stupor.
Exactly.
Television.
Prove how you feel
after watching television.
The energy of the train,
but it is below.
How about sailing
through the network,
through long periods,
also.
It makes you very fragmented
and at the same time you are like a zombie.
And that also takes away
the energy.
Sociological conversations,
also.
Sleeping in excess.
An interesting experiment is
when, if one falls
into laziness and laziness,
it is to stop sleeping
everything one needs for several days.
And see what happens.
Because many times
what happens, as we will see later,
is that there is something different below.
It is true that many times
what happens is that we are tired
because there are many people
who have crazy hours
and can't sleep enough.
And we see that very clearly
in retreats.
Yes, Sara knows.
It is tremendous.
It is as if you are adjusting
your body to be calm
without moving and meditating.
And you have to sleep at the beginning
because you bring the accumulated fatigue.
But once you fall asleep,
you begin to refine
the energy little by little.
Now, besides activities
that take us away,
that steal our energy,
there are also mental states
that promote this state.
This can be mental states
like desalination,
decay, resistance.
When we feel sorry for ourselves,
any idea of futility,
or when
everything we all think is useless,
no matter how important it is,
when we don't know
how important it is,
when we tell ourselves
stories of rotissants,
like, no, I can't do this,
this is too difficult for me,
this is too dangerous, etc.
So in these cases,
full attention is key
to help us
to see,
when this state begins to arise,
I don't give it,
I don't feed it, I don't give it time.
The quality of the thoughts,
I think, is also
very important.
For example,
when there is
very little energy
and we are meditating,
we can remember
that we all have
a limited time
in this life.
And if we see
our experience of this point of view,
many things
tend to appear
very important.
So,
do you remember last week
we talked about
the term in Pali
of the obstacle,
which is called
nivarana
to cover something.
So all obstacles
are covering something,
something that is below
that we don't want to face.
It is very common,
as I mentioned previously,
that under that lethargy
under that lethargy
there is
a frustration
or an impotence
or an incapacity
or lack of self-esteem.
So it is very useful to ask
when we are below
some of the obstacles
what is what I don't want to face
or feel at the moment.
A very common tactic
to not face
is something difficult in meditation
that I mentioned, is to sleep.
And if this happens constantly,
if I feel meditative
I am sleeping
and I stop sleeping
enough at night,
then you have to start
observing with a lot of tension
what is below.
So let's see
a complete example
of how this happens
when we hide something
below the lethargy
Let's say
I feel meditative
and I perceive that I feel
lazy and lethargic.
So I don't like to feel like that
I would prefer to feel alert
and with a lot of energy.
But as I have learned
to accept
my experience
I offer it
acceptance
and I investigate what is below
this lazy state.
I discover that
below this lazy state
there is a state of impotence
in me.
Let's say that there is a situation
in my work
that is unfair
but I don't see a way
to change it.
So I feel impotent.
It happens that when I live
this impotence situation
when I feel meditative
and there are no distractions
this arises
but there is something in me
that doesn't want to look at it.
This impotence
starts to arise
and there is something in me that says
I don't want to look at it.
It is too uncomfortable
to see this impotence.
My body helps me
and I sleep
or it simply does
to me
that I don't realize
what is happening to me.
When this
happens time after time
and we realize as I said
that something has to be done
about it
here is where
the concept of blood
that I have not talked about
before
is a tremendously important part
for our practice.
The term of blood
means community
those of us who are here
form a blood
and it is a group
of people
who have something in common
we have something in common
we are here
with the effort to come
that it is dark
that it is cold
that we are tired
but we made the effort
and here we are
because each one of us
is looking to live
the most obviously possible
so the nice thing about
being in community
with people
with whom we share this
in common
is that when we have
the idea that everything is fine
that normally
is how it is expected
that we are fine
it is customary
especially in this culture
that automatically you say
I'm fine
in reality nobody wants you to say
how are you
this cost me work in this culture
but that's how it is
automatically you say
I'm fine
so
it is
the most wonderful to meet
with a community
that you can really tell
how you feel and show
your vulnerable part
so I advise you a lot
that if something
that is not
that is not
that is not working well in meditation
look for someone
who has confidence
who feels that there is a certain wisdom
and share it and talk about it
at the moment that I start
and this I have seen a lot
in my own experience
that I start to share
with someone a weakness
now you realize that something
chemical changes
the fact that it comes out of my body
that it comes out of my mind
is much lighter
I no longer take it so seriously
and when I return to meditation
I have the courage
to investigate it
I no longer sleep
I already have what
the courage is needed
the strength
the value of facing
and that's where
it starts to give
this is something
if it is that you have not
experimented
that you can experiment
because the most beautiful thing
is that when you start to investigate
it gives a change
in our attitude
and at the moment that there is a change
in our attitude
there are still options
for our life
that you had never seen before
and you open your own path
it is very interesting
now you realize
that it is like
leaving a leaf
in a current
that simply
the stream takes the leaf
here and there
when you are not aware of
what is happening to you
compare it with a boat
that is leaving the water
that is the difference
then
the following
if I try to give you
the example from the beginning
to the end
if it is clear
or there are questions
because in itself it is as if the
meoyo of the present day
if nothing is left in your mind
more than this
it is worth having come
it was clear
if the complete path
since I feel to meditate
I do it
I start
to investigate it
I accept it
etc
yes?
there are no questions
the problem is that sometimes
you are not willing to listen
you accept it
the answer
but if you pass the microphone
tell us a little more
about the answer
what happens is
I like to spend a lot of time
alone
because I have time
to do it
and when I start to observe
and investigate
there are moments that I see
but I do not want to try
then I start to cook
or I look
to go out with a friend
to drink coffee
and perhaps in that way
out under other terms
and there are other times that yes
I ask
I see it
I touch it
and I accept it
but that is the work
thank you Pablo
because that is very valuable
what you said
we are not always able
to enter
to the ceiling
or to the basement
and clean
and achieve
mental hygiene
sometimes you have to give us
a little bit of poverty
right now I can not
right now I sleep
sometimes that is the right thing
to go to sleep for a while
or go for a walk
or spend a good time with a friend
but when there is
with affection
let's see
now
where I can
advance here a little
there we go
conception you believe
I have experienced
and I realized
that as I said
sometimes you do not want to accept it
because you are afraid that you will feel
or pain
that it was a deeper feeling
but
when I already
I saw it
I analyze it
I realized
that
that makes my attitude
change
and
I realized that
my voice has changed
when
I have been
working on
something
I know that my voice and my attitude
has changed
sometimes
it has cost me a lot of work
and when I do not touch
something in me
sometimes I am working
sometimes I leave it one day
as well as
today I am not going to drink
you can come
I am going to
take it back
yes, yes, yes
that's right
perfect
thank you
I have
maybe not so related
with what we are talking about right now
but I have a little doubt about
ok
if many times when you said that the first class
was something that we said
and the second class
was something that we want to live between
that one wants something
and then he rejects it
because he generated
an emotion in the fact that he did not get it
so
because I fall a lot in that
lethargy
so
if you say that it is because of
lack of
an objective
but sometimes
an objective also generates
this anxiety
or generate
so right now it has been like
ok
it is assumed that the more calm I am
I should have better control
and not fall in a lethargy
and not fall in a laziness
because
because it is not necessarily something that I want
an objective
I will have to
always keep up
but my nature has to start
to change and go down
and be in a state of tranquility
although you have nothing
in that instant to achieve
so my confusion is
that if one does not
have an objective
falls
in an anxiety or in a lethargy
but it also has to look
like a tranquility that not all the time
has to be looking for something to grab
to grab energy and continue ahead
that is
it is difficult to ask
it is like a duality
look, let's see it little by little
this
when I said an objective
I did not mean
much
to gain something for myself
for myself but you should have an ideal
something
that
I know that it is going to be a
contribution
that gives me an ideal
it is like
giving your gift to the world
the knowledge
of this way I know that I can
give the best that I have
in me
and that is different
you understand me to say
my objective is
to buy a car
that is another thing
with both
if you use it wrong
you can fall
into the desire
to be out of balance
I mean, physically I show you
I am wanting to get something
simply
you know
let's say for me
the ideal would be
to be a social worker
and help
orphan children
let's say
this is my ideal
I know that this way I can
and I am doing it
in a wise way
without
involving my ego
and wanting to push
and press
and putting myself under stress
but doing things
in a wise way
I mean, if you can have
an objective
without being under
pressure
anxiety
was there any other part
of your question?
if I get a
answer
I will answer something else
because the other half
of the question was
that when you have nothing
to reach
or you reach a level
too calm
you can also fall into the desire
to be too
I am sitting here
and I feel that calmness
could fall into a delay
very good, very good
that is something
subtle
that state of
complacency
that is good to mention
complacency
is in itself a very positive state
if I sit
and meditate
and everything in me
there is a state of complacency
it is very good
however
if I am
in this comfort
for a while between insomnia
and what happened
that this state has already become an obstacle
subtle if you want
but it has already left me
the clarity
has already left me
very good point, how good
you mentioned it
what is it
to share something with you about the first question
because it is something
that usually happens to everyone
but what happens in this
energy management
when you have an ideal
that is what they teach us
in this culture
you have to have a goal
you have to achieve everything
is to push
when you discover that
that makes you feel alive
you are fighting against that
but it is something that you let yourself carry
and very few of us
have the opportunity
to find that
because we are always pushing
so for me
I can no longer
I just let myself carry
that energy
and that also removes a lot of anxiety
wonderful
and the Etare
and the
Eresa
are the result of not having that
that fluidity
that fluidity
once I discover
what really fascinates me
what is my mission in this life
actually
there is very little space
for the delay
when there are no things to do
then I enjoy that
I have nothing to do
and it is very difficult to find that
because
when I talk to other people
that is
including my children
including my family
but I do not know how
to share and transmit that
because they have to discover
each one has to record
of course there is no recipe
I think
I put it in words
it was like three key words that he said
that
it is summarized
and more what you told me
of delay
and all the more not to fall
to get involved
of complacency
perfect
yes, wonderful
thank you Pablo
well
to finish I read
the quote with which we begin
again
I hope you can listen
in a way
a little more complete
after having heard
all this material
when someone is dedicated
to training more in high school
you need to pay attention
to three things
concentration
the energy effort
and the equanimity
when giving regular attention
to each one of these areas
our mind will be malleable
and well concentrated
on the obstacles.
