 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello to everyone, and I'm here in the meditation hall at the Insight Retreat Center. And I'm very lucky to have eight, nine people here, some of the residents and some of the people who've been part of this program that came down to teach for a couple of days. I feel very fortunate to be here. I miss Patacara. I said I would be able to be with her these two days, but the technology doesn't work so well in the Patacara Hall. So this works much better here. At some point in my meditation practice on retreat, I learned an interesting technique. And I had an image that went along with it. So the image would kind of come up when I use this technique kind of the back of the mind. And that was that the image was that of a horse that had escaped from its corral or something, or they need to come back to the barn or something. And so a rider would go to another horse and go out to find the first one and then would ride up right next to it. Kind of almost, you know, running together. And then the new horse with the rider would gently make a big curve, big turn, 180 degrees around. And the stray horse would then just follow along and come back to the barn. And so that image was how I worked with some of the thinking that would come up for me. I would start thinking about something. And rather than being opposed to it or rather than being troubled by it, it was just a horse that had kind of gone off. And I would come along and imagine myself kind of coming up next to it and just letting it continue to think and letting it kind of just keep going. But then I would kind of, you know, over a few seconds, I would kind of turn it around and kind of bring it the whole thing back to being grounded and centered here in my body, back in my breathing. And that was such a harmonious way of working with my distracted thought that, you know, it's been something I've done ever since. It's been quite wonderful to do. It's very different than how I was when I was in a new meditator when it was a little bit of a war between me and my thinking, you know, like, this is terrible that it's happening. Or it was a little bit of a whack-a-mole kind of exercise where I was kind of pounded out of existence somehow that I was thinking. But it's harmonious way of just coming around and just kind of bringing it back. And one of the arts of that was that was it coming up next to the horse next to the thinking and all that was coming up next to someplace in the body that was either that was associated with thinking that was somehow pleasant or somehow felt like the right place to be or the place where it felt like I'm connected to this event of thinking. And so there was not just so I was little I was I was stepping away from the content of my thoughts. But I wasn't stepping away from thinking that could continue. But I shift the orientation from the thinking of the content to something it felt right to me it felt kind of occasionally kind of cozy sometimes a little bit pleasant enjoyable, bright, sometimes a sense of aliveness and vitality that was kind of cozy or connected in my body. So this idea of learning to shift the attention, not from one thing to another, but shifting attention within what's happening to some aspect of what's happening that feels like a better place to be centered. And so we're not projecting anything or letting go of something necessarily, but we are shifting the perspective or shifting that how we're aware of it. And one of the important places around thinking where it's so easy to come to the content, or if there's a lot of emotions. It's so easy to somehow also be involved in the thinking the meaning that memories the projections into the future of what this emotions about. But even there is a place that feels like a good place for attention to being in relationship to the emotion. Some places feels right, feels alive in a very good way, feels pleasant and enjoyable. Same thing with pain, not to reject the pain, not to kind of fight it, but it is some kind of harmonious way of being present for it, but by not necessarily being with what's most difficult about the pain, but something that feels like a rightness to it. And they kind of be with that. With pain sometimes for me, and I'm not saying it should be for other people, this is a way of kind of working with the pain and the horse kind of is what feels often the most right thing to do is to sit in the middle of where it's most painful. And there's something about sitting there that changes the nature of the pain for me, where just okay now I can be here. But if I'm not there the center of it, then, then it's a, then I'm still kind of thinking about the reactive mind kind of has a fear rain. So this is what I'd like to suggest for today that if you sit here and meditation, and, and something arises that takes you away from being present for your breathing present here, not to fight it or even like oh but, but think of it as a horse. It's a way you ride up next to it to accompany it with the place where you're up against it, when it is something that feels right about the composite the whole experience of whatever it is. And that you can feel that has a rightness of pleasantness, aliveness in that experience that supports you to bring the horse back home, back into the body back in here, and present. So, taking a comfortable alert posture. And then closing the eyes. Taking a few moments to feel experience how you are right now. Allowing it all to be there. Where could you send to yourself, that feels most right, or the most pleasant. The most sense of being alive in a nice way, balanced way. Maybe on the exhale, relaxing around that spot. Maybe centered on that spot, taking a few long slow deep breaths. Letting the breathing return to your mind. Where is it in connection to breathing, where it feels most right to center the attention. Where in the breathing does it feel most pleasant. The most alive, most clear. And then no matter what happens during the meditation, ask yourself that question. Given what's happening. Where's the, where in the, all the different parts, aspects of the experience. Where is it most pleasant, alive, right, to be aware of it. The body and the feelings, emotions, mind states. Where it feels like it's most right to feel. There's a gentle turning to be more fully here, coming home here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of this sitting. We are going to take a moment to make that we are multifaceted, many different components of what makes up our personal experience in any given moment. Components of kind of how we are. The meditation practice is one of the practices that shifts that from being stuck, maybe in the thoughts, ideas, concerns, to being somehow energized in an agitated way, to being able to focus on how we can feel grounded and centered and embodied, maybe a little bit more connected to our hearts, more centered here. And you have more fluidity to be able to move between the component parts of ourselves. Now the end, maybe to move the attention to the heart center, to the place within your body where you feel compassion, care, love, kindness, sometimes felt as a tenderness, sometimes a warmth, sometimes as a kind of inner strength. Breathe with that heart center. And to gaze out upon the world from your kindness, your love, to end the meditation with directly establishing a connection with the meditation and goodwill for the world around us. Good will for the people we know, we don't know. People for whom it's easy to love and people who it's not so easy. To have a basic goodwill, to extend that goodwill intentionally, purposefully, choicefully with words that are something like, may all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful, may all beings be free. Thank you.
