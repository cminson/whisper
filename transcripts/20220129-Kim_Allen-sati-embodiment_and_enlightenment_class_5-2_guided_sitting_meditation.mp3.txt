 Okay, great. So now we will begin with some meditation. So, finding a posture where you'll be able to sit. And I just wanted to say a few words at the beginning, which is that we'll be sitting, mostly sitting in this sitting with some guidance, but maybe just for 25 or 30 minutes. And then I'm going to ring the bell just one time to kind of reorient our attention, bring us back to listening. And then I will give some instructions in standing meditation toward the end of this period. And we'll do that together for a little while. Of course, this is if you're not able to stand for some reason, it's fine to continue. But I would invite if you can to try the standing meditation. And we'll do that together at the end of the sit. Okay, so coming into the sitting posture, and bringing your attention inward, closing the eyes, if that's comfortable for you. And just sensing the uprightness of the body in the sitting posture. Connecting first with the place where you're sitting. So your seat against the cushion or the chair or the bench. Or if you're lying down with whatever you're lying on that contact point. And sensing the stability of this posture. Feeling how you're supported securely. And allowing the body to find some balance. Perhaps even rocking back and forth a little bit or forward and back just to find that middle point. Where it doesn't take so much effort to be sitting. We might imagine the body rising off the place where it's sitting as a sea plant rises off the sea floor, floating upward, anchored below. Allowing the arms to float like the fronds of the plant. And float on the spine. Finding some ease throughout the body. Softening the muscles of the face, the expression on the base. The muscles of the forehead, around the mouth, the jaw. Softening the eyes in the eye sockets. Down into the shoulders. Letting the shoulders drop naturally. Softening the belly. And releasing any sense of tension or bracing in the arms and legs. the mind. Connecting with your sincerity of practice. You've brought yourself here to do this practice. That sense of sincerity can help keep the attention in the present. So as the body settles a bit, it's natural that we can feel the breath. The wind element. Perhaps at first we feel it essentially as the in and out breathing sensations as the air enters the lungs. Blows out of the lungs. We may also sense a little more subtly some energy flowing through the body with each breath. Is there a way that the breath informs how we feel in our arms or our legs or our head? There may be many small sensations throughout the body. Focusing flickers of heat. Movements. Some are pleasant and some are unpleasant. Some are just flickers and some persist longer. Moving into this level of sensation in the body. However it is at this moment. This direct experience is different from a conceptual understanding of the body. No need for ideas like knee or back. Touching the sensations as they appear. Mtek Solnik. So allowing yourself to have new experiences of the body. As we rest in this awareness of sensation, we may broaden our relationship with the body. We may feel very intimate with the body, having dropped the veil of our concepts. So close, spotty. And sometimes with the intimacy, there can come a feeling of also unfamiliarity. What is the body? What is this? And we sense the interrelationship of body and mind, different but not separable. So close, spotty. you you let the mind gather around the sensations of the body and presenting any feelings of peace or happiness that are emerging and allow them to come into the foreground and if they're small or subtle. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
