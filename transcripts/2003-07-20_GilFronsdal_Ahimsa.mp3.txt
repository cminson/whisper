 So, the idea of Ahimsa is, most of us nowadays, if we know the term at all, we know of it coming from Gandhi. Gandhi was the great exponent of Ahimsa, nonviolence or non-harming in India in the last century. And he inspired many people, many, many people. Martin Luther King just one of them, partly because of Mahatma Gandhi. There are now, in different universities around the country, there are peace departments. There are departments that actually focus on this topic of peace and nonviolence. It's become kind of an academic discipline of sorts. It's become respectable thing to explore. And the idea of Ahimsa goes back into ancient India. It's not something that just comes from Buddhism. It's kind of in the milieu of ancient Indian religions. And Buddhism had a particular slant, a particular take on it. But Ahimsa is very important in the teachings of the Buddha, the principle, the idea of living a life which is non-harming. And it's so important that it could be considered to be not only foundational, really foundational central, and all else comes from it. It's like the root virtue when all other virtues kind of grow on that initial virtue. But also it's a wonderful way of seeing how the end result of practice, if there is one in a sense of an awakening or the culmination of practice, resonates with the state of mind which is devoted towards non-harming. So there's kind of a resonance or kind of a parallel between the attempt, the efforts to live a life that's not harming with the goal of practice itself. The enlightened person is one who lives a life at peace, that has non-harming as one of the central expressions of how that person lives their lives. And I think of the peace, the freedom that can come in the mind from practice is a kind of freedom that comes when there's no more conflict, no conflict at all. We don't feel like we're in conflict with others and we don't feel like we're in conflict with ourselves. So there's kind of, you know, all conflict is settled and that's where the peace is. And the external manifestation of that is, you know, non-harming towards others. So I want to read a couple of quotes from the Buddha about this topic. And what you'll see is that there are two, at least two ways of looking at this idea of Ahimsa. One is that it's a principle and a principle is not necessarily something that you can live up to all the time, but it's a principle you try to live by. It's like a guiding light or guiding star. You look at that and you know that's where you have to walk in that direction. So you have this principle of non-harming and that's kind of the orientation that you're trying to direct your life on this idea of non-harming. And the question for us today is why is it so important for the Buddha? Why would the Buddha lay this down as being one of the primary, the primary, central principles upon which he placed the spiritual life? So that's one, the principle. The other is that it's a rule in the form of, for example, not killing. And the rule is particularly strong for monastics. And there's no excommunication in Buddhism in a sense, but the closest thing to it is that if a person is a monastic among a nun, there's four different things that that person can do. It's laid out. All these rules have to live, rules of their order they have to live by. And the first four of those rules, if any one of those rules is violated, then automatically, without any ruling by the Vatican or anybody else, just automatically that person is no longer a monastic. And the person can no longer be monastic in this lifetime. So it's very serious for monastic to break these rules. And one of these three rules is not to kill. It's kind of almost absolute in the sense that there's no, in Theravada monasticism. And this is what this is rule number three of these first four rules. Should any monk intentionally deprive a human being of life or search for an assassin for him or her, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die, thus, my good man, what use is this wretched and miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life. Or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite someone to die. He's also defeated and no longer in communion. So that's a very interesting statement. It's kind of packed with all kinds of implications. So you cannot kill anyone. That's absolute. And you can't find someone else to do the work for you. That's just as bad, an assassin. And you cannot praise the advantages of death. And this is usually, this is many ways of understanding this. But one way that is interpreted is that the Buddhist monastics are not allowed to encourage euthanasia. They might allow someone to die, naturally not intervene with all kinds of medical apparatus to keep them alive, but to actually encourage people or advise people, anybody that you're so sick now, things are so dire, I think you're better off just doing it medically since it's suicide or something like that. That is complete no-no for monastics. And is this a principle or is it a rule? Is it an expression of this principle of non-harming? Is it a training rule by which the monastics live their life by? Is it because monastics are not supposed to in any kind of way compromise themselves internally or externally around this principle of being harmless, living a life which is harmless? Lesser rules for monastics, they're not as serious. They require confession and things like that, but you don't get kicked out of the order. One of them is, should any monk knowingly deprive an animal of life, it is to be confessed. So you're not allowed to kill animals. You're also not allowed to harm plants. And it goes to this extreme, should any monk knowingly make use of water with living beings in it, it is to be confessed. So you can't even drink water, like there's an insect or something. So you find in ancient India at least that monastics would carry around these filters, cloth filters, and they'd filter the water before they drank it or so that whatever animals were in it would come out and they wouldn't have to kill even the animals in the water. And the problem with this of course is that now in the modern world we realize that every little drop of saliva has a billion little creatures in it. And so the idea of not killing animals becomes almost impossible or impossible. But this movement to live a life of harmlessness. And then another rule, it also requires confession, even lesser rule, emphasizing the importance of harmlessness. Should any monk purposefully provoke anxiety in another monk thinking this way, even for just a moment, he will have no peace. If doing it for just this reason and no other, it is to be confessed. So you're not allowed to intentionally do something that provokes anxiety in someone else. There might be reason to, you know, you might say something that causes anxiety, but you can't want to do that. You're not trying to. There's a movement of cruelty or ill will in your mind that you're trying to express. And here is another, this is not exactly, it's kind of an explanation of this rule of not killing for monastics that is, this is instructions given to every new monk. A monk who has been admitted to the order should not deprive a living being of life, even if it is only a black and white ant. Any monk who purposely deprives a human life, even to extent of causing an abortion, is not a contemplative, not a son of the Buddha. Just as a solid block of stone broken in two cannot be joined together again, in the same way a monk who has purposely deprived a human being of life is not a contemplative, is not a son of the Buddha or daughter of the Buddha. You are not to do this for the rest of your life. That's the instruction, at least the rest of your life that you ordained. And here the extension is to the extent of causing an abortion. So certainly a monastic cannot perform an abortion, nor can they advise someone to do an abortion. Now that raises all kinds of questions and controversy and anxiety in a lot of people, this issue of abortion. It's very interesting that we have abortion as a major theme for our location here at IMC. If you drive by our center on a Thursday or Friday morning between 9 and 11 maybe, you're in for quite a sight because there's anti-abortion protesters lining up around the corner here because Planned Parenthood is across the street. So does this mean that Buddhism is against abortion? It's a little bit hard to extrapolate from that, but what it literally says is a person's monastic, a monastic person cannot be engaged in that kind of activity. How does that apply then to lay people? And this is my suggestion, is that how to extrapolate from, well say this, the Buddha did not have a lot to say about lay ethics. It's kind of like this, that the impression I get from the suttas is that Buddha didn't feel that it was his place to go around preaching to people and telling people how they should live their life and what they should do. He didn't go around kind of making these blanket statements, you know, thou shalt live this way or whatever. He was mostly interested in talking to people who came to him and asked them questions about how they should live their lives. And the people who were ordained as monks or nuns, they were very clearly kind of putting themselves under his direction in a very complete way for the purposes of attaining liberation in this lifetime. And so a lot of the way of life, a lot of the rules, the way monastics live, was to create the proper foundation, the proper conditions, so they can live a life that is most conducive towards attaining liberation in this lifetime. So for someone, so another way of understanding this is that for people who are quite serious in their spiritual practice, it's imperative to try to live a harmless life. So here lay people, so the Buddha didn't say a lot about lay people, they can live their life the way they want. And but if the layperson comes to the Buddha and says, you know, this is how I want to take refuge in the Buddha, I want to be protected by the teachings of the Buddha, I want to kind of align myself by those teachings, but they're not really interested in liberation, then the Buddha would lay, okay, in that case, if you want to take the refuges, then you have to live by the five precepts. But if a layperson is as serious about attaining liberation as a monastic, then I think there's a higher threshold of ethics that the person needs to live by. And what I've seen in some lay people who practice is that that threshold of their ethical life slowly increases over years. It's not necessarily something you have to kind of automatically assume you have to do live up to, but rather as a person's practice deepens, there seems to be almost a natural inclination or wish or inspiration to live a more ethical life. And so it kind of goes, you know, hand in hand as a practice deepens, a person is aspired to live a more ethical life. So it's not a burden necessarily, you don't feel like you're in conflict with yourself or struggling in too much of a dramatic way. I was a little boy, told me recently, I was back East visiting people and a boy told me, oh, in my uncle's house, they kill insects. But in our household, we carry them outside. And he was very happy with that. It was lovely that some kid would say that, going up with the idea that, you know, our household, we don't kill, we take care of things outside. So why is it, do you think, that the Buddha would put such a premium on non-harming and the extension of non-harming, not killing? So not killing is an absolute rule. And in fact, for the lay people, those who take the five precepts, it says, for the purposes of training, there's not an absolute commandment. But if you're interested in spiritual training that the Buddha offers for that purpose, do not kill. And there's no exception to that, according to the Buddha. A lot of people will have exceptions for themselves. And a lot of Buddhists will have exceptions to themselves in various ways. I mean, one may be very unsatisfying exception. If we give one example, I think it's in, maybe in Nepal. So Buddhists are not supposed to kill, but they would, you know, farmers, local people would kill their sheep in order to have meat for the table and stuff. And so they had a system where sometimes where they would have this wall compound, the wall, it was kind of a small area where the wall was quite high. And they would, people, a few people would gather around outside with stones, they'd throw stones over the wall and on top of the sheep. So they've never, so you never could know who was killing him. Because, you know, you weren't actually trying to kill, you were throwing your stone over, and one of the stones would kill. But, you know, maybe it wasn't yours, yours, it was, you know, your neighbors. So it's very unsatisfying, right? A more satisfying one also from Nepal is the, if you go, you go to Nepal, you can actually see, I think still today, when I was there, you can see sheep things, sacramentally sacrificed, you know, just on the street there, because as part of Hindu ritual tradition, and you have these big stones, and they slit the throat, and the blood's all over, and it's kind of gory. And apparently they have this festival in Nepal, that big kind of affair, but part of this festival is everyone slaughters a sheep. But there's also the Newaris, or population of Buddhists in Kathmandu. And so they participate in this annual festival. But what they do is they, and they really gruesome about this, and they do it on their doorstep in front of their house, they get a big hatchet and knife, and then they get a watermelon, and they slaughter the watermelon. And so all the red and all the juice kind of drips out on the steps. And that's the way they participate in this kind of, you know, national thing. So that was very nice. So what do you think? What are your reflections now? And why do you, what are your thoughts about why non-harming is such a central principle in Buddhism, teachings of the Buddha, and why non-killing should be bumped up, not just to be a principle, but also to be kind of a very, very heavy rule for the monastics? Yes. I'm just out of curiosity. I seem to remember a sutra which I wanted to use very well in pain, said he was going to use the knife, and his fellow monastics said, oh no, I don't think you should do that. But he did, and the Buddha thought he said it was a ball of white books. Yeah, there is, there seems to, I don't know, I don't understand this too well, but there seems to be one little minor exception, where suicide is not like a condone, but allowed. And this is, that monk was, had already finished his practice. He was fully enlightened, and he, being, and being so sick, and in that situation it was, you know, I guess this euthanasia was okay. But no one is supposed to encourage him to do that. Yes? If animals have been very seriously promoted by some other cause, and this is probably the root of A, and then is it the worst equality of the animals that would have been sort of disturbed out of bounds? It would be for monastic. And then the question is, you know, how do you extrapolate that to a layperson? The rule is not to kill. And this is where there's a very interesting contrast between kind of the early Buddhist teachings, and what still continues in Theravāda and Buddhism, and what developed in the Mahayana. And the early Buddhist tradition tended to be quite strict about this rule, that, you know, no killing no matter what. In the Mahayana, there rose the idea that because of compassionate concern for the other person, there might be situations where it's for the welfare of the other, or some kind of, provide some welfare for the world to be involved in breaking a precept like this. And it isn't that it's, it isn't that the precept is suspended, however the person understands that there's a greater good being created, perhaps by something like that. And so it takes more extreme forms, for example, if that they talk about in some of the Mahayana texts, that if there's some really terrible despot who is, you know, killing people left and right and causing a lot of damage, then is it, can, if a monk has access to that despot, do they have, is it okay to kill them? And the Mahayana would, some people, some, some, some, that's not universal in the Mahayana even, but you find some Mahayana thinkers would say, oh, in that situation, out of compassion for all the people that's going to be saved, because that despot is killed, they can't kill any more people, you know, that it's, you should kill that person. But the consequence of that for the monastic is that monk or nun will, you know, according to traditional kind of mythology of rebirths, that person will be, will be reborn in hell for a while. So there are consequences of that. So you don't mitigate the consequences of those kinds of actions. So, so that's something, you know, that's a very interesting issue that you raise then, this divide in the Buddhist tradition between those people who see these rules as being absolute, and those people who are mitigate the rules and their principles, because of some powerful concern of compassion. The word Ahimsa, as Ahimsa means to injure or to harm, and Ah means not. But often in Pali, when there's a negative with Ah in front of it, it has a different connotation than our English, where you, where just the absence of, the absence of harming and not harming. It often implies the positive corollary, the positive virtue. So that it said that Ahimsa is often equated with compassion. The expression of Ahimsa is compassion. It's not doing nothing. So then the question is, you know, what, what, what, what, how do we live our life? What motivations do we have? If, if compassion is primary principle, and this is a big, big debate in Buddhism. Yes. I just wonder, listening to it about not harming and not killing, how does that relate to the diet in terms of being a vegetarian or not being a vegetarian? So the issue of diet and vegetarian, again, there's also a divide in, in Buddhism around this topic. In, in the, in the Pali tradition where the Buddha was teaching to the Buddha, he had a cousin named Devadatta, who was kind of considered to be a bad person, kind of evil Devadatta. And he did things like he tried to kill the Buddha, for example, various times. And he was a monk and he was trying to kind of basically wanted to kind of power play. He wanted to take over the order, kind of bump his cousin aside, or his uncle aside or something, and take over. And, and he had various strategies for doing that. But one of the strategies was he, he thought, Oh, what I'm going to, I'm going to ordain strict your rules and the Buddha has ordained for the monks. And if people see that I'm much pure than the Buddha, and then all the disciples of the Buddha and all the way followers will come over to me because I'm, I'm, I'm pure. And one of the rules he tried to instigate was the idea that no eating of meat, much more pure teaching of non-harm, non-harming. What the Buddha said about it for the monastics, he didn't say much as far as I know, or at all for lay people. But what he said for monastics is he said, monastics are not allowed to eat meat. If the animal, if they know the animal was killed for their sake. But you can imagine these monastics are going around India with their bowls and they can only eat what's offered to them. And people don't even know they're coming down, you know, because they're wandering around. And people are cooking the food they're cooking in their own homes. And so people are cooking meat and they don't work, you know, cooking the meat for the monastic, but the monastic happens to walk down the street. I said, Oh, wait a minute. Let me, let me share with you some of my family's food that I have in my table here. And so they plopped the food in the bowl and some of that food is the meat. So they're supposed to eat whatever is offered to them unless that meat is knowingly been killed for them. When you get to places like later in India, after the early tradition, there were some Buddhist orders that then ruled that the monastic should be, should be vegetarian. And some of that then traveled into China. And you find in China and Japan, and even in China, Korea and Japan, that there's a very strict rule about not eating meat. In Japan, Japanese monastery we're trained in, there was never any meat cooked in the monastery, but the monks were not vegetarian. So what happened there was sometimes the monastery was given cooked food because the monks would go out into the community and people would offer food and bring the cooked food back. And if there was meat, we would eat that meat. And then once we had a backpack, not backpack, a hiking trip up into the mountains away from the monastery. And then we had a barbecue because we weren't, because we weren't, you know, at the monastery anymore. So the rules didn't apply. And Chinese monks tend to be much stricter about this, you know, no meat. When I was in the monastery in Burma, I, they served a lot of pork and, you know, in bowls and, you know, covered with oil. Everything was in oil, lots of oil. And anyways, all this pork. And most of the Westerners didn't eat the meat there. Most, you know, most of the Western practitioners at Ice and Counternasia were vegetarian. And some of them stopped being vegetarian because it was so hard to get proper nourishment unless you ate something besides just rice. And there's all this pork being served. And there's a huge monastery. Sometimes there are 5,000 people there, but there were, you know, hundreds of monks and nuns. And so I went to the abbot one day and tried to explain to him the economics of supply and demand. And, you know, the monastery, some layperson in the monastery would go out into the market to the butchers and buy all this pork and bring it back and then cook it there and serve. So the monks weren't involved in buying it, but I said, look, you know, you guys buy so many pounds of pork that probably, you know, the people in the market, they're planning for you coming to buy. And so if you didn't, if they, if you weren't going to buy, if you were vegetarian, probably fewer pigs would be killed because there wouldn't be such a big demand because you're, you know, you're a big source of the demand here. And maybe I didn't explain it very well, but he couldn't, he didn't have a clue what I was talking about. Yes. So, on the other hand, if you kill a person, you're depriving them of the opportunity, perhaps depriving them of the opportunity to be liberated in this lifetime or after a time of exile. Yeah. And that's certainly one of the reasons to, to, to oppose capital punishment is because you deny the person that opportunity for some radical transformation. And the issue of Bushido and the Samurois and that whole thing, I mean, in addition to that, there were in Japan monks, kind of a category of monks that were warriors, were fighters. And often they would be sometimes they'd fight other, other monasteries and, and do various things. And, and you find, you know, you find different, different Asian Buddhist countries, you find occasionally this phenomenon of warrior monks. And you find in Thailand in the 1970s, 60s, famous monk who said that, you know, to kill a communist was not breaking the precept. And so you find, you know, all kinds of, Sri Lanka also, you find some, you know, so you mean, so what you find is, you know, a difference between, for example, principle and teachings and how it's understood and applied by different people. And generally Buddhists overall, I think, have been a peaceful lot compared to what some other examples we can think of in religions. But, but you shouldn't idealize Buddhism too greatly, because there are, you know, currents in Buddhism that haven't been as dedicated to pieces. I think the Buddha was emphasizing. Some people would say that kind of the warrior monk model or the Bushido Samuroi model is a perversion of the teachings of Buddhism. And are they really enlightened? Do they have some experience of enlightenment? Maybe, maybe they have something, maybe they have some kind of an initial first stage of enlightenment before they really transform and purify completely. But more likely, I think what happened to the kind of Zen inspired Bushido and kind of movement was that they developed powerful concentration. And that powerful concentration sometimes is mistaken for enlightenment. But there isn't a really deep transformation that happens. And with that concentration, one of the dangers of having a very strong concentrated state, and then is yoked with idealism or arrogance or conceit, is that a lot of damage can be done because a person is so confident in themselves. It's interesting to note that the reason for that is so much of the practice of nonviolence and dailama. Because before Buddhism went to Tibet, it was a very violent culture, a very warring culture. And it sort of just wasn't working. And the other example of no king, Ashoka, who was a warrior king. He finally got discussed with the cult thing and gave it up. Yes. As a lay practitioner, I have a lot of conflict with this issue. And it has to do only with boundaries of my household and my garden. Once I get outside of that, I have no problem at all trying with great intention not to kill. But in that confines, I do have conflicts with it, and I don't know what to do. I do everything I can to try to make my home not hospitable to ants and to spiders. That's sort of my issue, maybe gophers in the garden. But I don't have a good way inside of me with this issue. So I'm in conflict with that. Good. Do you have a question? It was a nice report. I appreciated it. It's very common when talks are given on the first precept of not killing. People ask about, you know, a lot of people are supportive of the idea in some ways. And one of the places people struggle with is the immediacy of their life, because most of you here I don't think are involved in killing other people and neighbors and things. And so that's not really so relevant, and you're not butchers. But it comes to play around our house, like you said, the insects and gophers and things. And my own attitude towards answering those kinds of questions is to say that I'm very, very appreciative of people who have the concern to be engaged in these questions. So aren't you aren't just kind of blowing off, I'm just killed the gopher or killed the insects, but it really engages. Is there an alternative? Is there some other way of doing it and exploring really working with that and concerned with that? And I really encourage people to kind of keep that kind of line of inquiry going and don't just take the lazy way out. But, you know, what you're going to decide to do? I don't know. I know sometimes I've weighed for myself, I've weighed the consequences in both directions. And sometimes it seems to be a greater loss. You know, if termites destroy my house, and I'm supposed to be there, you know, take care, you know, creating a healthy environment for my kids to grow up in, you know, maybe I'm destroying something else. So I'll try everything I can to try to find alternative ways. So where I live now, we have a lot of ants that come periodically. And when we first moved there, I was kind of much more concerned about ants and oh no, there's ants are there. And we mostly I would sweep them up and take them outside. And but I didn't feel so good about that, because, you know, if you sweep them outside away from where they come from, it's kind of like, isn't it kind of like death for an ant? Because if they're not part of their little colony, and they're off on their own, it's like, you know, it's kind of like, that's it, right? So, you know, it's kind of, it's kind of not such a it seems like not ideal. So we do all things, you know, keep try to keep everything clean. And, you know, everything try to do everything and try various things to keep them at bay. And it works pretty well. But what we come to mostly is, is we do all those things, so it's not too bad. And then we just live with them. It's okay to have ants in the you should ants in the kitchen floor, if you ants in the counter, and they're kind of going exploring a little bit here and there. And it doesn't seem to be a problem. You know, why should you know, why shouldn't they have rights to the house as much as I do? You know, they can't, you shouldn't invite all their friends. But you know, so so that we have this coexistence going on. What? We don't have termites, as far as I know. So don't have to face that. Oh, so your answer to your question. So coexisting with them is a good thing. Yes. Not if you really want to get rid of them, you know, the worst thing you can do is kill their nest. So I wanted to relate to you a story from this middle length discourses of the Buddha. It's in Discourse 8. And I'll try to be brief about it. There is a monk goes to the Buddha and says something like this that someone who is relatively new to their practice, who doesn't have very deep practice yet, could it be that they have in very short-term, could it be that they've liberated themselves from wrong view? And the Buddha says, well, if it doesn't say yes or no, he says, they could have if they have learned, if they can see with insight, if they see directly the empirical evidence upon which we build our world views from. If you look at that empirical evidence and really see it with insight, then that person would be free from all kinds of wrong views. And the idea behind the story is that this monk was concerned about new meditators who had a certain level of attainment, but hadn't really gone very deep in their practice. But because of certain kind of initial kind of level of attainment, had gotten conceded and thought that they had really attained a lot. They were really hot stuff. So he goes to the Buddha and says, these guys are really as hot as they're supposed to be. And the Buddha doesn't say yes or no. He says, if they have insight, then they're as hot as they say they are. If they have insight, then they're done with that to be done. And so the concern is that people have overestimated their attainment. So that's just kind of an introduction to it. And then the Buddha seems to continue the discussion, taking it in a new direction. And he goes on and says, oh, there are other people who overestimate the value of their attainment. And then he goes through and he lists all the eight jhanas, all the eight absorptions, which are very important in the teachings of the Buddha, attaining these levels of deep concentration. So he's not going to, he's not fulfilling their importance, but he's pointing that a person can easily get wrong conclusion based on these. They can over overestimate their attainments, their value of these experiences. And he defines each of these eight deep concentrations practices as providing a person with pleasant abiding here and now. And that's not to be knocked. So being at ease, being happy, being at peace in the here and now. But learning how to be deeply at peace here and now as a function of concentration does not involve a transformation of our inner core of who we are, the inner tendencies, inner workings of who we are. And there's no refinement or polishing of the character or changing this. And then, so then the Buddha says, well, this itself does not provide with this transformation. And then he goes through and he shows, this is how transformation occurs. And he goes through 44, I'm not going to read all of them. This is how transformation should be practiced by you. Others will be cruel. We shall not be cruel here. Thus transformation should be practiced. And the word for cruel is Ahimsa. And so maybe a better translation would be non-harming. Cruel being any kind of attempt to harm anybody else, any motivation. Then, but then it goes on to say, others will kill living beings. We shall abstain from killing living beings here. This is transformation. And then he goes through a whole bunch of things and he thinks like others will be envious. Others will be fraudulent. Others will be deceitful. Others will be resentful. Others will be difficult to admonish. Others will be negligent. Others will be lazy. And we here don't do that. We train ourselves. We incline ourselves. We work on ourselves. We do the difficult practice of trying to change this aspect of who we are. And the first one is listed is Ahimsa. And the commentary says that's because everything else, all the other virtues follow on the foundations of being harmless. And so to tie these two together, that it's one thing to attain some level of calm or peace or ease or even insight in meditation practice itself. It's a whole other aspect of practice is to use that as a foundation. To look at our lives and see where can we incline our lives to a transformation. To change our character, to refine ourselves. The word that I'm translating is transformation. In Thai, it's translated as polish. To polish a person. To polish one's character or something. So to actually take something on and work on oneself. And not just rely on meditation as this magic stone that's going to magically transform you into a more enlightened, freer person. But you actually engage in certain virtues, certain principles. And you grapple with them. You work with them. You incline your mind in that direction. And the last thing I'll say is that the state of mind that is inclined not to harm. The state of mind that is motivated by non-harming is a very, very peaceful state of mind. And I would argue, or my experience is that almost a peaceful, it's very, very deeply satisfying. It's a very closely related to the most deep satisfaction the person can have when they're centered at home at peace with themselves. So one of the reasons for the practice of non-harming, for the virtue of the principle of non-harming, is to support and enhance the possibility of us individually discovering this very deep level of peace and satisfaction as we live our lives. So I hope that you have some sense of how the mindfulness practice can help in this regard to use the meditation practice both for insight, but also as a foundation from which to then study more carefully some of these questions. And for example, answer to your question, when are you going to cross the line and get some kind of poison, for example. And I bet that you'd answer that question differently depending on whether you came out of meditation or whether you had spent this really frantic day at the DMV and nothing works and long lines and it's hot and you come home and oh my god, you know, the decisions we make, the moral decisions we make is very much conditioned by the state of our mind to begin with. And so if you cultivate a really good state of mind, you probably find yourself making different decisions than if you make decisions, you know, when you're angry and things like that. So thank you all very much.
