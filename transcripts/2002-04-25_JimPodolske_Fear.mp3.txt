 The first talk that I gave last fall was about Gil had given me some direction as to what he wanted, he thought I might want to talk about, which was what brought me to practice and what supports me in continuing to practice. And this time he didn't say anything, so I had to come up with, I had to look at what is it that I thought I had some familiarity with, with respect to the Dharma that I felt like I could talk about. And after some reflection on this, what I decided was, what I am most familiar with is ignorance and fear. So tonight we are going to talk about ignorance and fear. And I realize that this talk then really is kind of an extension of my first talk about what is it that brought me to practice and what's kind of at the core of my practice now is still dealing with ignorance and fear. Let's see. So one of the first questions that comes up is, well, what is ignorance? Sometimes we think of ignorance as just not knowing, you know, there's so many things in this world to know about, how to use Windows 98 or, you know, who won the baseball game yesterday, sports statistics, all of those things. But what's been helpful for me is to kind of mispronounce the word and instead of saying ignorance, saying ignorance. What is it that's being ignored, not being looked at? One of the descriptions that I've heard over the last few years by some Dharma teacher was talking about ignorance as kind of a mental strategy for avoiding what's unpleasant or uncomfortable, unwanted, unacceptable or threatening. And what then occurred to me was, well, so what's wrong with that? You know, wouldn't it be nice to have a comfortable life? You know, why look at things that make you uncomfortable or feel threatened? Isn't that maybe a path to less suffering? So I decided to see what the Buddha had to say about this, and I went on the Access to Insight website, where you can search by words. And there's a Pali word, which I'm not sure I know how to pronounce, is avijja, A-V-I-J-J-A, which is sometimes translated as unawareness or ignorance or obscured awareness or delusion about the nature of the mind. So one way to look at ignorance is, what is it that we're not bringing awareness to? Let's see. It turns out that ignorance actually has its own sutta as well. I didn't know this. It's the avijja sutta as part of the samyutta-nakaya sutta. And I wanted to read a little bit from that, because I think it helps me to look at, well, why not ignorance? It seems like a lot of people try that one. So this is something that the Buddha taught to his followers, and I'll read to you this. I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savati in Jetta's Grove and at Appindica's monastery. Then he addressed the monks. Monks. Yes, Lord, the monks responded. The Blessed One said, monks, ignorance is the leader in the attainment of unskillful qualities, followed by lack of conscience and lack of concern. In an unknowledgeable person, immersed in ignorance, wrong views arise. In one of wrong views, wrong resolve arises. In one of wrong resolve, wrong speech. In one of wrong speech, wrong action. In one of wrong action, wrong livelihood. In one of wrong livelihood, wrong effort. In one of wrong effort, wrong mindfulness. In one of wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration arises. clear knowing is the leader in the attainment of skillful qualities followed by conscience and concern. In a knowledgeable person, immersed in clear knowing, right view arises. In one of right view, right resolve arises. In one of right resolve, right speech. In one of right speech, right action. In one of right action, right livelihood. In one of right livelihood, right effort. In one of right effort, right mindfulness. In one of right mindfulness, right concentration arises. So, in this pseudo we see that ignorance is going the wrong way on the eightfold path. It's leading us away from the eight facets of the path that the Buddha described. And clear knowing is what's described as leading us in the right direction on the eightfold path. Let's see. So, a little bit more that I found here. What is ignorance. What is ignorance. And what is ignorance. With the cessation of the taints, there is the cessation of ignorance. The way leading to the cessation of ignorance is just the noble eightfold path. And then finally, there's the 12 steps of dependent origination. I don't know if any of you have heard of that. This is kind of a more detailed look at how suffering arises. And sometimes it's said that the Four Noble Truth is sort of a condensation of the 12 steps of dependent origination into a form that's a little bit easier to remember. But in the description of dependent origination, the very first link in that chain is ignorance. And it says, from ignorance as a requisite condition comes mental fabrications. From mental fabrications comes consciousness. And it goes on. And at the very end, from birth as a requisite condition, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play, such as the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering. So ignorance really lies at the root of suffering, of dukkha. And therefore, it's a very, as I started to look a little deeper into the suttas, I realized that ignorance is kind of like really at the core of Buddhist teachings, that that's really something that drives this whole process. And so how do we deal with ignorance? Well, the teaching that has been brought to the West is the teaching of mindfulness meditation, where we train our minds, we train ourselves to sit and be still and let the mind settle down and let the body settle down, and then let those things that are being held out of our awareness, that we habitually deflect our awareness from or dull our awareness to, let those arise and just be seen. For me, the retreat experience, going to long retreats, is very useful in this regard, that you can get very settled and things can appear that wouldn't normally appear in your day-to-day life with all its activity. But you don't have to do that for everything. For me, the kind of a signpost of there being something that I'm ignoring that seems to cut through even the day-to-day chatter is fear. As I've looked back on my life, or at least this particular lifetime, I'm not sure about previous lifetimes, but in this lifetime, since my earliest memory, I can see that I've spent a lot of time trying to come to grips with fear, being left at nursery school at the age of three and feeling abandoned and feeling in this kind of unknown environment. As I got older, I'd go to kindergarten and be confronted by playground bullies who had taught me and hold the doors of the school closed so I couldn't get in. And over the years, the sources of the fear changed. As I got into high school, there was the fear of fitting in socially and dating and going to college, concerns about grades and later about career. And now as I approach middle age, or well, actually as I am middle aged, concerns about retirement, financial security, loneliness, old age, sickness and death are all there. They're all conditions that will from time to time trigger this experience that I call fear. When I was younger, the fear would often manifest itself as, well, when I was very young, the fear would manifest itself as wanting to run away, to just get away from whatever the object was or whatever the conditions were that were causing this unpleasant experience to arise. And then later I found that even if I didn't leave physically, that I would run away psychologically, that I would leave. And quite often there would be a paralysis, kind of a physical paralysis and also kind of a mental paralysis. There would be a lot of energy in the body and yet very little action addressing what was happening in the present. And likewise with the mind, a lot of the activity was going off into thinking about what was going to happen in the future and getting very caught up in what all of this meant would mean in the future and having very little presence of being what was happening right then. So there was kind of a running away from the present moment. And there was also kind of a positive feedback mechanism in this that as a certain amount of fear would arise, there would be fear of fear, fear of, oh, this is coming again. And that would sort of feed back on itself until this whole experience felt very solid, very real, very unchangeable. Like this was it, this was really reality. And I went through quite a bit of my life with that experience of fear. It changed somewhat as I got a little bit older and my marriage was ending. I got into psychotherapy and it helped very much to have somebody to talk to and start to make a movement towards examining what is this all about, what's going on here. However, I still brought to that experience kind of an expectation that with enough therapy, with enough talking about it, these conditions would never arise again, that I would just be completely free of fear. I'd never have to deal with these conditions arising. And after five years I left somewhat disappointed that it still showed up. And eventually it was really fear that brought me to this practice about four years ago. And about three years ago I was on a long retreat, my first long retreat at Vajrapani and there was a teacher there, John Travis, who teaches at Spirit Rock and is a long time friend of Gil's. And he gave a Dharma talk about fear, he called it the river of fear that runs through the middle of our experience or the middle of our land. And everybody arranges their life, arranges the way they work so that they don't have to turn, so they don't have to face that river. Everybody has lived in caves or built their houses with the doors facing a different direction. And all of this energy goes into not looking at fear. And his suggestion was that what we need to do is very, very simple. It's just simply turning from looking away to turning and facing the fear. Nothing else has to be done. We don't have to run towards it or conquer it or bargain with it or anything else. It's just a matter of simply bringing one's attention to that experience. And I was quite moved by that Dharma talk. It really started something in motion for me of seeing that I could change my relationship to this reoccurring experience. And so what I'd find is that I would start to bring investigation. Quite often about four in the morning I would wake up with the body just raging and the mind raging. And knowing that there was nothing to be done except to pay attention. So I'd go into lying meditation, raising my knees up and just breathing and paying attention to the energy as it flowed through my body. The sensations in the abdomen, quite often there'd be contraction. There might be some pulsation, twitching. Sometimes a difficulty breathing, kind of a moderate contraction in the upper chest. In my head I would notice contraction and pulsing, heat. And what I discovered was, as I just paid attention to these things passing, that it wasn't solid. That it wasn't a solid unchanging experience. That it was actually changing all the time. And that as I brought attention to it, it seemed to pass reasonably quickly. And the thoughts, if I paid attention to what was going on in the mind, quite often it was planning for what was I going to do later in the day, what was going to happen. Things that quite honestly I had no clue to. One of the things that I've seen is that as much aversion and dislike as I have for that experience, I realized I also have some great attachment to fear. In some ways it's sort of, when it felt very solid, it felt like in some ways it helped define who I was. And there's a poem that I want to read by Spirit Rock teacher Robert Hall about this. It's entitled, Our Friend Neurosis. Neurosis bites at your heels, a reminder that fear is the lifestyle for you. Never forget, you could be abandoned at any moment. That little pain in your belly is going to require surgery. Everything you've worked for will be meaningless when everybody finds out about your chocolate binges. Maybe your mother did it. Could be the first grade teacher who made you empty the waste baskets. Every time someone smiles warmly, some muscle deep in your throat contracts with apprehension. Neurosis is so strong, how could we live without it? No drama makes for boring days. So there's also that part of it too, that I found that I had come to have a certain reliance on fear to motivate me. That I'd just kind of float through life and ignore things and then fear would, you know, I'd suddenly realize, oh my God, I've got the 48 hour notice and they're going to turn off the gas. And so fear would arise and it would move me to action. So investigation, mindfulness, meditation and some contemplation practice is very helpful to start to look at for the things that we ignore and for me particularly fear. But I've also found that sometimes it takes more than that. There's another practice that was brought to the West by the Vipassana teachers and that is loving kindness meditation or Metta. And I was curious how many of you have had some experience with Metta or loving kindness practice? Okay, quite a few. Well, for those of you who haven't, mindfulness practice is a realistic practice. It's really looking at what is happening at any given moment. And not trying to make it any different or not trying to put any spin on it, just really being present for what's happening now. Loving kindness practice is a little different. It's an idealistic practice in that it's a practice to cultivate certain qualities of the heart and mind, certain acceptance, certain kindness, certain openness and compassion for oneself, for one's beneficiary. One's benefactors, one's friends, people that are kind of neutral, difficult people and all beings. So that's sort of the basic instruction for loving kindness to really cultivate an openness and an acceptance of the heart. And what's proved particularly helpful for me was an article that I read by Ajahn Sumedho fairly recently about bringing loving kindness for those parts of oneself that are most unacceptable. Those moods, those thoughts, those feelings, those experiences, those mind states, those habitual patterns that we just can't stand about ourselves. And the way it was described and has been very helpful for me is that when we're unwilling to look at some aspect of our experience, some meanness of heart that we might have, some fear, some pettiness, that until we look at it, it's going to keep crying for attention. And until we can hold it in our awareness without aversion, and not necessarily promoting it or trying to build it up, but to just let it be seen and seen through, it will never be released. I used to think that I was being held prisoner by fear, but what I recognized is that really I'm the one that was holding fear prisoner by not looking at it. And if I can just allow it to be and allow it to be seen, that it wants to liberate, it wants to be let go of. And that has been kind of a radical shift in the way that I've seen fear. And so it's allowed me to be more accepting and more aware of what lies underneath the fear. The sense of vulnerability, perhaps the sense of loneliness, just a sense of uncertainty about what's to come next. And I found that it's really brought a certain lightness in starting to let go of some of the fear that I've been carrying around and labeling me or mine. So I want to end with a very short reading from this book called The Places That Scare You by Pema Chodron. It's actually a short paragraph by another writer, Charlotte Joko Beck. The secret of life that we are all looking for is just this, to develop through sitting and daily life practice the power and courage to return to that which we have spent a lifetime hiding from, to rest in the bodily experience of the present moment, even if it is a feeling of being humiliated, of failing, of abandonment, of unfairness. So that's what I have to say. And I'd be very interested in hearing from some of you about your experience with ignorance and fear and what you found to be helpful in dealing with it and unhelpful, what's been skillful and unskillful. Or if you have any questions, I'd welcome those as well. For me what was a change in my life was when somebody said to me, well, sure, you're afraid to do it anyways, and I just kind of took that as my, just something that I follow, and I find that about all the time, you're a fear of himself, something I don't want to do, something I'm really uncomfortable doing. And then just being able to just be, you know, do what I need to do anyways, you know, that was a really helpful reminder for me. Thank you. Yes? I appreciate your reminder to consider facing fear as you want to run away. And I notice in particular issues in my life where I fear now, I have a tendency to want to make a decision, have a conviction of some kind to hide from fear. So this is this way, I won't do this anymore, I won't go to that place that scares me, or I will fear, fearful of a particular friendship that might be at. So there's a tendency certainly to self protect, but also to be convinced that I will self protect for the next month and will not interact or something to that extent. And I can see that chaos in my mind right back and forth when I try to move on to a concept of some conviction about things. And I think sometimes resting in that uncertainty is a lot more comfortable. It's a need for discomfort, there's some sense of serenity. It's a truth. I think that's part of your experience. Thank you. That's one of the things that Pema Chodron talks about in her book is developing an ability to stay with the uncertainty and not contract around views or emotions. Yes? A couple of friends I appreciate hearing about the topic of fear because often I felt that most people are not aware of walking around without fear. It's wrong to be afraid. So it's really having an out of the old way to hear about it. And I guess the other thing is that when you talk about it, you kind of have an unlikely to tell a nurse, you kind of hand it to your running and it's a big part of your experience. And it's sometimes feels like it's a force to be reckoned with that you have to grapple with it. And so my feeling is not that you're really powerful, you're maybe using power, it's what I think of it. And if you let go, it's not powerful anymore. So that's all I'm looking for. Thank you. Yes, Audrey? When I'm feeling fear or any other unpleasant experience to the degree where I may be paralyzed, to the degree I'm able to act on this situation, I just experience it in my body and find it. I'm kind of describing to myself, I'm hanging out with it. And without thinking about the story, and that it dissipates and leaves me to clear different things I need to do. Thanks. Also reminded me, I talked with a woman who's a therapist in our Sangha and she talked about something that's sometimes labeled as optimal fear. I'm not quite sure that's quite right, but that there is that energy that comes up that we label as fear. And if it's at a level that isn't paralyzing, it can often be quite energizing in helping us kind of move forward and deal with whatever's going on. She described how sometimes people have trouble with public speaking and so they'll take certain kinds of drugs that inhibit that response. And quite often their talks fall kind of flat because there isn't that energy in the body to project and to bring the alertness to the mind. So there's also something very beneficial to that physiological reaction that we have. I was curious that you've known the aspect of anger because many a time the fear ends up in anger, either directly at ourselves or out to the rest of the world. So I was wondering, I'm trying to understand why you stopped that fear. Oh, well, I only had 45 minutes. And I think I'm even in more denial about anger than I am about fear. For me, most anger ends up frozen as resentment, so it's still got a ways to thaw. But thank you for that comment. I'm just thinking, speaking for myself, that's great. So it ends up in anger and then it's very imminent. What do you do with it? So you see underneath the anger then is fear? Well, as long as it goes back to the universe, about some expectation about myself or the blindness, it's a good concept. So driving on the freeway, getting cut off by somebody, you get upset about it because of the fact that you were like, I would never do that. So why am I assuming that I'm not a person who says that to me? So there's expectations, which you consider, I have reasons for it, I don't stick with it. So I just feel like, ah, some fundamental wrong views that I have lead to that. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Oh, Jim. I really appreciate you sharing your images of what was on the playground and stuff. I think that was probably the first place in my life where I really had the gut feeling that something's not right and some people don't like me and I'm not safe. It was really the first time I think I really experienced you at a gut level. And I thought about times that I got into scrapes and things that ended up turning out the way I wanted them to. And so since then, the worst thing in the world for me is to have a conflict. And so I wonder what your thoughts are about that because there's a bad side to conflict, but then turning my back on conflict is a challenge too. I'm wondering what you're thinking about the good uses of fear as well as the, how can you kind of balance out good uses and not good uses? Well, I think for me that, as I said earlier, I think the value of fear for me is that it's kind of a wake-up call. What is it that I'm not willing to look at? Can I see what's underneath fear? What assumptions am I living my life by that every time I have a conflict this is going to result in hurt feelings, lost relationships? You know, so for me it's mostly been kind of a red light flashing, that there's something to be looked at deeper, more closely here. And it may not, just as with anger, it's probably wise not to always act during the state of fear, you know, to react out of that place, but to, to let it point to there being something that wants attention. So I'm not sure if that's helpful or not. Yeah, yeah, because there are some things that it's good to be afraid of. Right. Yes, Lynn? Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question.

I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question.

I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. You're all okay. I mean, I could have certainly somewhat better than others, but nothing I couldn't live with. And actually not knowing or not addressing the issue was certainly much more painful than any of the results could possibly be. And I found it to be just such an unusual finding, you know, that I'm kind of glad that I've kind of worked with you. It's been helpful. Thank you. Yeah, it reminded me of something that Eugene Cash had talked about, I think last Monday, perhaps. He was talking about anger, and he talked about how if you really stay with anger and move and work all the way through it, that you reach clarity. And he said that with fear, if you can stay with it and see it and see through it, what you get to is trust and faith. And so I was reminded that when Lynn was talking about facing a fearful situation instead of just seeing the fear of cultivating some trust that whatever happens will be workable, that you'll be able to work with whatever happens. Yeah, Jill. You know, that's so interesting because I have a real close connection to fear and trust. One of the things that I actually like about fear is that it's always kind of a reason to trust and to let go. Normally, if I get in a situation where I'm afraid it's lack of control, it's like things are out of control. It's not predictable. I don't know what's happening. And there's a point where I generally accept it. I recognize that that's true. I am not control. It is out of control. And there is that point. And what he gets replaced with is a trust that the universe will work out, and I'm going to be okay regardless of what the outcome is. Kind of like what you were talking about. It's like I can live with any of these outcomes. I've never heard them related before, and that is definitely...it definitely does come with the things that go over that fear. It's present somehow. Great. Thank you. I think someone is kind of offside. Go ahead, Ann. I don't know. Just try to control things so much. One of the things that you expect things to occur to turn out a certain way, and the interesting I heard, you'd be less likely to be fearful because you can still present an attribute to the way you expect it to be. So sometimes I just feel like you should use someone to control it as a secret. I think more faith, things that we tell the number man, what I wish for, it would go. And then you could always find options. Only if things don't turn out at the end, the way it's supposed to do. So you just don't do so much, you know, that you are overwhelmed about things, about, you know, freedom. See what is happening at the same time, you don't know what to do. So you just sometimes as you need to take a little more, I have felt like I'm just being more confident that this is going to turn out fine. Just in the corner that you have more calmness and confidence in yourself. You know, you feel like, what am I going to do? And at least it is happening, you know, how much the trauma is happening. It's just, you just feel more comfortable to yourself. Thank you. I don't know what you think. You know, some parents, when that's just about maybe being the magic speaker for the first time ever, I felt the fear coming up. I never felt before, I was very cautious and very outgoing and I know how to do everything. I can make things happen. I'm a superwoman. And certainly, as you take a second look at the fear coming up, it just starts to start, you know, it's just cold and very cold for you. It's the first time ever, experienced that, so still very, very, very uncomfortable for you. It's too quickly overwhelmed by things and I don't know why you have that feeling, where is it going to come from? And it's just like suddenly it just comes like that and you're just wondering, where is it going to come from? Did anybody tell you that this is the fear? I felt like only once and I never felt like again, I just don't understand, there's a fear coming from, what is it created for? Okay, what am I afraid of? So I hope that if I can communicate a little more, that I can use more gravity, more awareness, I'm afraid of it. Well, it sounded like wonderful questions. Another question. The experience of non-self in relation to fear, have you had an experience of non-self in your work with, in your working with fear? Hmm. Well, I'm not sure that I could say that I have. I think, I think related to that has been, when I think of, when I talked about fear, ignorance earlier, as dealing with things that feel threatening, quite often, quite often what it is that evokes fear for me is, what's threatening my sense of who I think I am. You know, that something that's going to happen that's going to break the illusion that I'm this certain way, or that people see me this certain way. And so, some of the facing of the fear is just the, is just willing to, or seeing that I have no choice but to let go of some of the, some of the things that I cling to as defining who I am. How did you have that experience of non-self? Yeah. Actually, when I think about it, this was something that I thought about talking about earlier, but I hadn't. This was before I was practicing. I had been married for ten years, and one day my wife asked me to sit down and she said, you know, I really need to talk to you. I don't want to be in this marriage anymore. And it was like, wow. And she said it very compassionately. It wasn't out of a sense of, it wasn't spiteful, you know, it was, I mean, she ended up crying, it was very difficult for both of us. And what I found myself most contracted around was, what are people going to think of me that I'm getting divorced? You know, it wasn't, I wasn't thinking about what's going to happen to her, you know, anything else. It really was, what are people going to think about me? Are they going to think that I'm not a good husband, I'm not a good person? All these other things, I mean, I had, I went out, I was living in Berkeley at the time, I went out wandering onto the campus, and I laid on the grass next to the psychology building for some reason. And right next to it is this big clock that's made out of bushes and flowers. And there was part of my mind that was entertaining, ending my life, you know, like, boy, this, I just feel awful, this is horrible, and you know, how am I going to face having to let go of this image that I have of myself as a good husband and everything else? I was laying there, and then suddenly it occurred to me, this is not worth ending your life over. This is just standing a marriage, I mean, it was just kind of like there was just like this, okay, I'm going to let go of me as a married person. And I don't know what's going to happen, but it took, I mean, it was very, very uncomfortable and painful to hold on to wanting to be who I thought I was, and then once I let go, it was much, much lighter. I mean, I just, you know, I walked, I went up to the Rose Garden in Berkeley and smelled the roses and kind of had a real glimpse of what liberation there was in letting go of this view I had of who I was. But it's still hard, there's, you know, it's got a lot more to let go of. Let's see, I think I'd like us to sit for another, say, five minutes just to end the evening, so... So thank you all for your attention, and thank you all for your participation, and may you all be free from ignorance and fear.
