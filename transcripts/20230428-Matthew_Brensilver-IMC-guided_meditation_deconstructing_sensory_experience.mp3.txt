The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So welcome, folks. Good morning to most of you. Good afternoon to some.
We saw Thailand in there, too. So welcome to you wherever you are.
Yeah. So it's always a little bit of a dilemma for me about how precise or impressionistic to be in giving instructions.
I feel like I almost always err on the side of the impressionistic kind of element of just dropping Dharma thoughts into the mind that catalyze a certain kind of view.
But there is a place for precision in a intentional direction, and we can do that, I feel, without incarnating a meditator self.
That is, it's cramped. It's tricky, but we can do it.
So anyway, I thought today would be a little more technique-y and share something that's been meaningful for me from a teacher I sat with for a long time, since I'm young.
His technique is always evolving, and so I don't even know if I'm representing it appropriately as he kind of tweaks and develops it.
But yeah, the kind of core of it is discriminating between three core sensory events, namely visual thinking.
So my eyes are closed, but I've got the computer screen, got the room outlined in my body.
No simpler, no more complex than that. There's words in our own mind, auditory thinking.
We can actually sense a kind of spatial location to thinking.
And so if I told you to say your name silently in your own head, you would actually hear it somewhere.
It wouldn't actually be happening there, but there would be like, I don't know if it's echolocation or something,
but it's almost like a sense of, it happens in a place, the way, almost like holographically arises in a place, usually in the head, between the ears, somewhere like that.
And then there's affect in the body, emotionally charged sensations, and different from kind of physicality of, okay, I'm tapping on my chest.
That sensation is quite different from the sensation I would feel at the same place if I suddenly heard a loud noise.
I'm startled, I feel a jolt of sensation, but it would be emotional in nature, responsive in nature.
Kind of essentially wordless surveying of threat and opportunity moment by moment.
Very kind of foundational to animal body.
There's seeing, there's hearing, there's feeling, and we begin to discriminate between those three sensory events, paying attention to their arising and passing.
And there's really no distress if we're, we have like a mindful relationship with those three sensory gates.
There's not really much place for distress to arise outside of them.
So the panic, the dissatisfaction, the longing, the suffering, suffering, has to have its fingerprint here.
And we bring our open heart to it.
This is useful.
So let's sit together.
Relaxing everything that can be relaxed.
This spine extending to the heavens and the rest of the body just hanging loosely from that central column.
Thank you.
And we practice surrendering.
Surrendering to imperfection, surrendering our willfulness.
Surrendering the subtle violence of self-improvement as Vinnie Ferrara says.
There's not much time left.
And so for a minute, just sensitizing to the visual aspect of thinking behind the closed eyes, against the kind of blank mental screen.
Images, memory, maybe an image of my face even if your eyes are closed.
An image of the outline of your body, the room.
Sometimes the images are photographic but often melting and morphing.
When we direct attention, for example, to our breathing or our body generally, it's often aided by a subtle visual thinking.
It's bound up with proprioception.
Imaging our body world moment by moment.
The mental note is very simple.
Seeing.
And if upon noticing, noting, visual thinking, it melts away, we notice the blankness, the tranquility that replaces it.
Now putting that down and bringing attention to auditory thinking.
Normally we just call that thinking, but the words, the sentences, the phrases, the voiceover, the narrator.
Constellates in this auditory thinking world.
And our default is to endow our auditory thinking with incredible trust.
Every thought pinging our being.
Every thought suddenly or dramatically adjusting the parameters of our body-mind.
But now rather than obeying the voice in our head as if it were God, we just listen to it as the voice in our head.
And we just listen to it as if it were God.
And we just listen to it as if it were God.
And we just listen to it as if it were God.
And we just listen to it as if it were God.
So we very vividly examine the drama and melodrama of identification
the ways we incarnate in the thought, becoming identified.
Take birth as a protagonist.
And from within a thought we lose all sense of attentional autonomy.
Then we wake up. The sentence ends. The paragraph ends.
We're reborn as a meditator.
The mental note is simple hearing.
And if at the end, in making the note or a sentence coming to an end, there's just silence, we listen to the silence.
And then lastly, feeling, just attuning to the emotional circuits in your body, the building blocks of motivation, urgency, affirming and objecting.
Sometimes we know what's arising or it's easy to give a name to the feeling, to the affect arising.
Sometimes it's just a vague something, state of arousal, state of pleasant or unpleasant.
Sometimes it's happening in one part of our body, sometimes more broadly.
Sometimes intense but sometimes subtle and subtle is significant as Shenzhen would always say.
The note is feeling.
And then we're reborn as a meditator.
We're reborn as a meditator.
So now we can practice opening to all three sensory experiences, not necessarily at the same time,
but the attention may be drawn to a visual thinking, to auditory thinking, to feeling in the body, body sensations charged with emotion.
Of course more than one may be arising at the same time, but we just choose one to focus on, doesn't matter which.
Maybe we stay with that arising for a few seconds, maybe it vanishes before that, we just notice it's gone.
Maybe you use the mental notes, can just be as simple as see, hear, or feel.
You can also use the mental notes, can just be as simple as see, hear, or feel.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sometimes I'll simply cycle through these three sensory spheres.
Just checking in with the seeing for a few moments, hearing, feeling.
Then around again.
Imporing mindfulness, equanimity into each moment.
