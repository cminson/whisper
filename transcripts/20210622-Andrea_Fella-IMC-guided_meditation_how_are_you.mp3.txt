 Sometimes it can be helpful to begin our practice by remembering just for a few moments, and it doesn't have to be a deep thinking about, but just remembering why we do this. What is our motivation for practice, for being aware of ourselves? Just remembering that intention can support our willingness to be here, our willingness to be with ourselves and observe just how we are in this moment. Learning to whatever your experience is in this moment, however you are, as perhaps a friend when, if you haven't seen a friend in a while, you might ask them, how are you, and really mean it. Really mean, wanting to know how you are, asking yourself that question not through words but through being with yourself. How are you in this moment? Really our entirety of mindfulness practice comes down to that question moment after moment, a friendly inquiry into how you are right now. No judgment, no demand to be otherwise. Just a question. How is this human being in this moment? What is here, and recognizing that what is here, the what part, you might think of the what part as being a thing that's here. That the what of our experience is not a thing but rather a flow, a process, a set, a tumbling on of conditions, ephemeral phenomena coming and going, nothing lasting for long. And so the how we are when checking in. How are you in this moment? It's a lively dance of changing experience. Changing sensations of the body, changing sounds, changing moods and mind states. How are you right now? What's here? Bringing that curious and friendly attention as you would to a dear friend. And of course the mind will wander, will lose touch of that connection with ourselves. That too is simply part of the unfolding process of what's happening in this moment, that the mind wanders. And it will equally wander back, it will equally arrive, mindfulness will return. In that moment when mindfulness returns, the same curiosity, the same interest, you're meeting yourself again in a new moment. So how are you in this moment? As mindfulness returns, friendly, curiosity, how are you right now?
