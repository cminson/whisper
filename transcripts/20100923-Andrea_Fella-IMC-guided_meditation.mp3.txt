The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
To begin a period of meditation with relaxation.
So settling into your bodies through consciously relaxing.
Relaxing those bases in your body where you tend to hold tension.
Perhaps your neck, or your jaw, or your face, your forehead.
Perhaps your shoulders, your back, or your stomach.
Gently bringing attention to the areas of your body where you tend to hold tension.
Seeing if you can soften, consciously release, and relax those areas of the body as much as possible.
Sometimes tension is habitual, so just soften as much as possible.
Sometimes it helps also to check into your legs and hips. See if there's any tension in your legs and hips.
Sometimes we hold tension there without being aware of it.
You might want to take a couple of deeper breaths to assist in this process of relaxation.
And returning the breath to normal.
Seeing if you can also connect with the relaxing inside the body.
Also sometimes an area that we don't consciously think of checking into.
See if you can relax behind your eyes.
Relax inside your throat.
Relax your heart.
Relax your lungs.
Your stomach.
Your intestines.
Kidneys.
Liver.
All of your organs.
Also allowing your mind to relax in whatever way that makes sense to you.
Letting go of thoughts of the past and the future.
Even any thoughts of the present.
For the next half hour or so there's no where you need to go.
No one you need to be and very little that you need to do.
Just connecting with present moment experience.
From this base of relaxation.
See if you can just take in the experience of sitting here.
Relax.
And notice whatever is obvious in this experience.
Pressure of your butt.
Feel of your hands.
Feeling of your legs or feet contacting the floor.
And simply being aware of whatever is obvious.
Within this field of experience.
Allowing your attention to rest.
To connect with the experience of breathing.
It's already happening this breathing.
You don't need to do anything special.
Just see if you can allow the attention to connect with however the breathing presents itself.
Whatever is obvious about your breathing.
And relax.
Sometimes when we begin to direct our attention in meditation the mind gets a little tight.
The attention for you.
Settle back. Relax.
See if you can allow the experience of breathing to come to you.
Rather than you going out and looking for the experience of breathing.
Sometimes find it helpful to not directly look for the experience of breathing.
But almost let it come in as if through peripheral attention.
When you're breathing in know that you're breathing in.
When you're breathing out know that you're breathing out.
All that needs to happen.
If in this experience of paying attention to the breathing.
You notice from time to time that the attention is drawn to some other experience.
Like hearing or some other body sensation.
That's not particularly a problem.
We can be mindful of anything.
So if hearing becomes predominant allow yourself to hear while hearing is obvious.
And when that experience fades gently reconnect with the experience of breathing.
From time to time you'll notice that you've woken up lost in thought.
In that moment you're already back.
Already aware.
That can be a good way to reconnect with this moment of remembering.
Just saying to yourself already aware.
Notice what you have woken up into.
Some kind of thinking.
Daydream fantasy planning.
See if you can let go of the pull the momentum towards that thought.
In favor of reconnecting with the experience of breathing and hearing.
And pressure and movement.
