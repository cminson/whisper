Good afternoon, everyone.
The morning will reflect a bit about the conditionality of various processes
in our minds and bodies.

and so just reflecting a little bit on the conditions
that we are cultivating conditions
that support moving us in the direction of freedom
and that those conditions
include observing
the conditions that lead us towards suffering.
So the conditions that lead us towards freedom
are the observation of the conditions that lead us towards suffering.
And so the practice, you know, we can do the practice,
we can engage with it and in fact it's like
this is how the whole practice unfolds
that we hear a teaching, we hear something,
we hear about mindfulness,
maybe in that process something sparks an interest,
whether or not it sparks an interest is also conditioned
based on our upbringing, our conditioning,
our proclivities, our openness to various thoughts or ideas.
And if it sparks an interest then perhaps we start to engage,
perhaps we, because these teachings are not just about believing,
you know, the teachings are about engagement.
So, you know, we can't just hear the teachings
and expect some kind of anointing of,
tada, there, there's freedom,
that the teachings describe a way to make effort.
And so there is something that we pick up, that we do.
And this practice, what we pick up and do
is pretty minimal, again this morning I pointed to,
just the simplicity of being aware,
noticing what's obvious and checking the attitude
and in that awareness, the kind of the curiosity,
the allowing of what's here,
the curiosity of how the mind unfolds,
how the conditions of the mind unfold
and that kind of the way of observing
is what supports the freedom.
It's not just any old kind of observing,
it's the way of observing.
And so this is a condition, we learn something about
how to observe our minds and our bodies.
And then it's a little bit of a closer and closer approximation
to that, a closer and closer approximation
to why's mindfulness, a closer and closer approximation
to the mind with why's view, why's attitude.
And yet the whole process begins with the condition
of hearing the Dharma dropped into our system.
Somehow that happens for us.
And so the instructions and the practice
are both conditions that support freedom.
There's a way that that freedom is described
as the unconditioned.
And that's something that I reflected on
and that other teachers have talked about,
this interesting kind of almost paradox
that there are conditions that support
our minds' ability to open to
what's described as unconditioned.
How might that work?
I like Tanasaro Biku's analogy of this
or description of simile
that kind of elaborates on this.
He said,
the Grand Canyon is an amazing place.
It's a beautiful expanse.
And you can walk, you can follow a trail.
Somebody stumbled on the Grand Canyon first
without having a path.
But now there are many paths that lead to the Grand Canyon.
And so somebody can tell you,
there's this amazing place,
you should go and see it.
Follow this path and you'll get there.
And so you can walk on the path pretty reliably
following the path unless you get distracted
by some kind of event here or there
or some cool flower or plant
and go wandering off the trail.
If you follow the path,
if you follow the instructions,
you'll arrive at the Grand Canyon.
And so following the path is the condition
for the experience of the Grand Canyon.
But following the path did not create the Grand Canyon.
The Grand Canyon was there.
Whether or not the path was followed,
the Grand Canyon was there
or there were even paths to be followed.
So this is a kind of,
partly an encouragement.
It's not,
the Buddha describes his teaching as a path,
a path that will open us to a release
from the patterns,
the habits of suffering
that our minds have ensnared us in
and tranced us by
and enchanted us into believing
that they lead to happiness.
I'm debating about
whether to offer another reflection
on conditionality
from the teachings of the Buddha.
Maybe I will.
This is more,
I think of the Buddha sometimes
as an amazing psychologist
in terms of uncovering
the workings of the mind,
how the mind does what it does
and how it entraps us into
our patterns and habits
of suffering, of dukkha.
And there's a teaching
and actually in the suttas
it's described,
I believe as being
from Shari Putra.
No, Mahakasika.
Mahakacana.
So the Buddha offered
a brief teaching
and then it was a kind of
cryptic lesson
and the monks kind of were curious
about what does that mean
and so they asked
and the Buddha went off to rest
and they asked this other monk
Mahakacana.
What did he mean by this?
And Mahakacana gave a teaching
about conditionality
and the teaching is in the sutta
Majama 18,
it's called the Honeyball Sutta
and it really talks about
the processes at work in our mind
and how they interact
and how the processes of,
well the interaction too
of the processes of body
with the processes of mind
and then how the processes of mind
kind of take over
and start to
confuse us we could say.
So the,
I'll just say the teaching,
many of you have heard this teaching
so it's just hearing the words
of the Buddha again.
So the
Mahakacana goes through
the six sense bases
and I'll express this through
just one of the sense bases.
Dependent on the eye and forms
my consciousness arises.
The meeting of the three is contact.
So this is the bare sense experience
and the conditionality
of that bare sense experience.
Sight doesn't arise
unless there is an eye,
a functioning eye with consciousness.
So these three are interdependent
so there's conditionality here
just in the arising of sight,
just the bare arising of sight.
Dependent on the eye and forms
my consciousness arises.
The meeting of the three is contact.
With contact as condition
there's feeling.
What one feels
that one perceives.
So with the experience of sight
there's not only the sight itself
but there's feeling.
There's a feeling
pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
With that feeling
my understanding here is
what one feels
that one perceives.
Those kind of happen together
some of the Abhidhamma teachings
talk about
contact, feeling, perception
arising together.
So there's a contact of sight
and then there's feeling and perception.
This kind of points to the contact
or the meeting of the sense base
having a feeling
my understanding is in the mind.
It's not in the sense base itself
it's a mental process.
So it's not a physical process
it's a mental process.
And that process of feeling
is kind of like what
lets us know there's been some contact.
I think that's kind of
what's being pointed to here
and then with that kind of contact
of contact and feeling
the mind orients towards
recognizing it
that's what perception is.
So again these are
these are conditioned processes at work
I was just describing this morning
kind of the curiosity
of noticing the difference
between body and mind.
So there's a sight
and then there's a feeling
associated with sight
and there's a perception
associated with that.
So the sight form and color
a feeling of maybe pleasant
and then and kind of arising
with that is a perception
what is being seen.
Perception might be
at a very simple level
of just like green or brown,
jagged
and then layered on top of that
might be another perception of tree.
Again these are mental
conditioned unfolding
of just our human apparatus.
All of this part is
just our human apparatus
doing its job.
Not what we're trying to
we're not trying to stop it
we're not trying to change it
or fix it
but what the Buddha points out
or what the teaching here points out
the Buddha actually blesses
this teaching later
in the teaching
he says yes
Mahakachana knows his stuff
so think of this as my words.
So in this teaching
what I think partly is being pointed to
is it's useful to understand
that these are processes at work
to not be seduced
or enchanted by
or pulled into believing
something is something
is something that it is not.
It is very often in this process
of perceiving a tree
we pick that up
and we do something with it
as I talked about this morning
it's not just a tree
there becomes the concept of the tree
and what relationships I have with trees
and when I saw a tree like that before
and that all kind of comes in
and this is what the teaching goes on to point to
actually
because the next thing
what one feels that one perceives
what one perceives that one thinks about
so we see the tree
and we start thinking about it
this is very normal
what kind of tree is that
not my window I'm seeing a palm tree
okay
that again is
that's kind of a perception
but then the mind starts thinking about
hmm I wonder what kind of animals
live in that palm tree
or who cleans those branches
off the bottom of the palm tree
or various thoughts about the palm tree
now none of those may have a particular kind of
stickiness to it
it's just like that
they're just kind of random thoughts
associative nature of our minds in a way
so we think about something
we perceive something
and then our minds start pulling in
other ideas, thoughts about that
the next place is where it starts to get
sticky
what one feels that one perceives
what one perceives that one thinks about
what one thinks about
that one mentally proliferates
that term that's translated as mental proliferation
is translating the term papancha
which often is translated
and mental proliferation may sound like
a lot of thinking
like where the mind kind of charges out into
a rambunctious thought about the palm tree
that can happen definitely
the mind with its associations
and all of its relationships with things
and this can particularly happen
with people
with relationships
we see somebody
and it may be that we don't know the person
but they remind us of somebody
that we have a relationship with
and there not only are we seeing this person
we may not even be consciously aware
that they're reminding us of this other person
but it kind of pulls in
a whole bunch of conditions
related to our relationship with that other person
and maybe we start to judge that person
thinking oh that person is this way
or that way
there's nothing about them
we see this on residential retreat
when we're wandering around
and noticing our kind of views
and beliefs about people
that all we see is how they pick up their spoon
and stir their tea
and we've got a whole story about them
so this is a form of papancha
that our mind is kind of proliferating
and picking up
without even being aware
it's picking up history
and conditioning
based on
like
how tall the person is
or something like that
just some feature of the person
may be triggering a kind of a connection
with some of these histories
so this is a way that papancha works
that
kind of the baggage that gets pulled in
to our relationships to things
but another way that
I think that is actually pointed to
by papancha
is not necessarily as a proliferation
of any kind of thinking
but more as
the kind of the delusion that creeps in
around the
kind of the reality of that
perception or concept
as
a thing
kind of a reification or a belief
in the
thoughts that we're having
as truth
kind of the
it might even be really simple
just as like yes
that is a tree
it could just be that simple
that kind of belief
that what I am seeing is
this tree
and that that tree is an
independently existing thing
from me
and I'm not saying actually
that there's nothing out there
I do actually think that there are
things out there
but the only way that we
experience things
is through
this mediation of the mind
and we cannot
experience what is
actually out there
we cannot experience that
what we experience is a construct
of our minds
and because of that because what we
experience is a construct of our minds
there's all this room for
beliefs
and delusions to enter in
to those concepts
and skew our
perceptions
skew our view of
what's happening out there
based on those beliefs
and so this whole notion of
belief
of kind of believing our
perceptions or concepts
to be truth
this is a piece of papancha
and it may not be
a lot of thought
it may be just like really just a subtle
sense of yeah this is right
this is true
and then the sutra goes on
to point to that with
what we have proliferated
with what one has mentally proliferated
that then
affects
how we
perceive
everything else
and so the statement is
with what one has
mentally proliferated as the source
perceptions
and notions tinged by mental
proliferation beset one
with respect to past
present and future forms cognizable
through the eye
so this is pointing out that
papancha is not just simply something that's
a
you know a one-off thing
it actually goes on to shape
and influence how we take in
how we receive
information
how we
perceive things
is influenced by our views
and beliefs and so this becomes
a cycle and so the next
the next thing that we perceive
based on the eye and forms
eye consciousness arises already there's
a filter in there already there's a view
already there's a belief that is
shaping
how we
perceive that how we feel
that
and so this is a kind of an alternative
in a way description of
of how
suffering gets created
how our minds get caught
in their own traps
and so again this is
understanding this as a process
that this description really
is a kind of a very psychological
description of
looking at the apparatus
of our
physiology
and how it interacts with the mind
and then how that
in
future
shapes how our
physical apparatus
actually receives experience
kind of brilliant I mean I'm just stunned
that the Buddha figured this all out
2600 years ago
and we can see this
we can see
these kinds of processes happening
in our minds
and maybe not at this level of detail
sometimes we might be able to see
at this level of detail
but there are ways in which we can recognize
for instance something like
an emotion arising in our
in our experience and maybe
my pointing to looking at belief
looking at what's being believed
that emotion arising
and emotions will contain
some kind of belief
that we bought into the belief that's associated
with that emotion
there's going to be an investment in it
and we
that investment
will then shape
how we
take in the next things
that we see
or feel or hear
so an example
of this kind of thing is
that we are all familiar with
is when we are caught
in a maybe an aversive
snit
just in my experience
the mind can easily get caught
in this kind of aversive mode
and what I've noticed
particularly
on retreat but also we can notice this in daily life
is when there is that kind of
a pattern in the mind
it's filtering, it's shaping
how we receive experience
so notice that when I'm in a kind of an aversive state
my mind will be searching out
other things to be aversed to
it will tend to find
the things in the environment
that it doesn't like
and it will ignore the things
that might
you know
be more pleasant or soothing
it will actively seek
out the things
that kind of reinforce
that mood
and this is a very common
a pattern in our
in our minds
that when we have a particular belief
or mood or state
our system seems to look
for kind of selectively
pull out of the
out of the environment
things that will confirm or support
that belief
that seems to be just a way
that the system works
we have to actively
kind of recognize that that's happening
in order to kind of counter
that tendency
and yet it works the other way too
in that when there's a wholesome
tendency arising in the mind
that when there's love
or compassion or joy
arising in the mind
a wholesome quality of mind
then the mind also can begin to
towards things that will
reinforce that
so it's not again
that the mechanism in our minds
is a neutral mechanism
and what
to come back to what I was talking about earlier
about the conditions that support
the path being on the path
it's like we're kind of
the Buddha
in his teaching basically
seeing well this is how the mind works
this is how conditionality works
and then watching in his own experience
how the mind can lead
itself towards
the conditions that
support freedom
then we can cultivate those conditions
we can cultivate the views
the
the
the perspectives
that support freedom
now the
and this can sometimes lead people to wonder
or to think that you know
well how is this then any better
how do we know it's a better path
and the answer to that I think comes in
our felt sense
when we are on a path
where
delusion
and ignorance and greed
and aversion are driving
our
our choices
when we are aware
when we notice what's happening
we feel the suffering of that
so our system is actually pointing out
to us this is not helpful
and the mindfulness
the practice of mindfulness begins to
to reveal
these states
of greed, aversion, confusion
as not being
oriented towards well being
not being in the direction of well being
not on the path to well being
our system has no confusion about this
when we see
these states with wise mindfulness
there's no confusion about this
and when we
see with that same
kind of mindfulness
we see how
being curious
about
they said earlier you know
the path towards freedom lies
in seeing
witnessing the ways in which our minds
are caught
the ways in which
it's
kind of confusing itself
seeing that
as opposed to just being caught
in that
when we
open to that with mindfulness
and open to the states of heart and mind
that arise with that
there is no confusion in our minds
that this is
a path towards well being
and our system
our human system to me feels like it is
oriented in the direction
it wants to find its way to well being
and when it gets this information
through this practice
of wise mindfulness, when it gets the information
about
acting out of anger
of frustration
of greed
creates non well being
system begins to reorient
it recognizes
this is not helpful
it feels
the other side
the side of compassion
and kindness
equanimity
as helpful
and so this is
this is how
wise view is not just
another view
another kind of belief in the mind
it is used as a belief
in the mind to support us
to move in the direction of
freedom but the feedback
that we get as we hold that view
as we explore using
that view in our practice
the feedback we get is
visceral
it is not
the mind is not confused
about this
being
a useful perspective
so the question
one of the questions that came in
actually kind of
feels like it relates to this topic
that I just was sharing
the question
checking the presence of awareness
or the attitude of how we are
aware
be related to the factor of investigation
or vijaya in the seven factors of awakening
maybe vijaya is
broader and may check on many
different aspects of the experience
like to hear your comments on this
my understanding vijaya
dhamma vijaya
is often translated as
investigation of states
investigation of experience
I think that the vijaya
is really this
this exploration
of
what is suffering and what is not suffering
so what states are suffering
what states are not suffering
so that is
actually the piece
that leads us on the direction towards freedom
is really having that clarity
of that understanding these states
it is interesting
in the seven factors of awakening
just as a reminder
mindfulness
investigation
or this dhamma vijaya
energy
joy or rapture
tranquility
happiness
and
equanimity
the first
the second and third
investigation
and energy
kind of to me
kind of overlap
with
the
the factor of right effort
investigation is an activity
of mind
it's a doing
or a kind of a
and it doesn't have to be a conscious doing
but it is an activity of mind
to have some curiosity
and investigation
about what's happening in the mind
and body
and energy
the factor of
of
the awakening factor of energy
is described
elsewhere in the sutas
as resulting from
as being that energy that results
from having made wise effort
and so
the enlightenment factor
of invest of invest
the faculty of investigation
is described that way
the faculty of energy is described that way
that it is the
the result of having made
wise effort
and wise effort is not in
the seven factors of awakening
but I think it kind of is
is in this
aspect of dhamma vijaya
and so to me this
points to again
major part of the investigation
that's pointed to in the seven factors of awakening
has to do with
what is suffering
and what is
not suffering
what is wholesome
and what is unwholesome
so that I think in some ways
when we talk about investigation
it may be that
our definition is
broader in some ways
that we think about investigation
as being just looking at everything
and I think in the seven factors
it may be a bit more precise
towards
the recognition
what is it that leads the mind
towards awakening
this is what the awakening factors are pointing to
what leads the mind towards awakening
is an understanding
of what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
and the recognition of that
is this
our system knows this again
as we
explore our experience
and feel into
the qualities of mind
that have more of the greed
or the aversion or the delusion in them
there's the recognition
the feeling of the suffering of that
and that's not a mistake
that's how the practice works
and so you know
if you're seeing suffering
with awareness
you can celebrate
because this is the mind learning
that this is dukkha
and that will support the wisdom
the mind to
to recognize that
that is dhamma vicaya
that is wholesome
investigation
to know this is dukkha
and the checking
of the attitude is crucial in this
this piece of checking
what's the relationship
to experience
will begin to reveal
exactly this question
is what's
kind of motivating the mind right now
is this wholesome
or unwholesome
and exposing the attitude
bringing it into consciousness
it kind of like allows it to be felt
allows it to be recognized
maybe it was operating in the background
and there was some subtle way
in which it was
there was something recognized
it feels like something's not quite right here
and then we check the attitude
we check the attitude
and we see
anger or frustration or aversion
and we feel
the suffering of that
hopefully we can feel it
within the context of
of not resisting it
where there can be some space around it
and we can begin to recognize again
it's like even as we're feeling
reactivity
we can feel the kind of
spaciousness that comes with holding it
with skill
with wise attitude
right in that moment
our mind understands
the dhamma vicaya
of that moment is recognizing
yeah the reactivity
is suffering this holding of it
is leading towards freedom
as many teachers say this is holding
of it is the kind of suffering
that leads to the end of suffering
so the yeah the checking of the attitude
is a crucial part of
of dhamma vicaya
I think it's kind of almost a central
aspect of it that knowing the
relationship revealing
those habits and patterns
and also when we see
when we see wise attitude
we feel into that
the mind being calm or curious
or balanced
the mind being interested
and compassionate
about what's happening
that is felt
as leading
towards
wholesomeness and it's felt
as leading towards well-being
and so again there's not a question about
that when that is felt
our system knows this
it is not confused about this.
