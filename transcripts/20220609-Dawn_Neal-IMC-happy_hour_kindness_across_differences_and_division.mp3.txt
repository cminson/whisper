The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So welcome everybody. Welcome tonight to happy hour.
My voice is a little froggy, but I think I can make myself heard.
So tonight, I just wanted to spend a few minutes to some introductory remarks on loving kindness, meta, across differences, across divisions.
I'm going to start with a story. So some years ago, my friend and acupuncturist Jorge told me about how well his soccer team was doing.
And he explained that in their division, they weren't the most talented or even the best trained, but that they had this extraordinary rapport, this friendliness among each other.
And so that they could perform really, really well in the field. They just got each other. There was a lot of trust, collaboration.
And we talked about how even amidst all these other teams, many of whom had like much more talented or professionally trained players, they were winning the division.
And they were winning the division because these more talented teams weren't pulling together. They didn't have the same kind of cohesion that Jorge's team had.
And that collaboration, that kindness, that ease made all the difference.
When I was preparing tonight, I ran across a blog post that reminded me about this. It's from, I'm reading this, the Saskatoon insight meditation community in Canada.
And in it, this anonymous writer, a hockey player talks about generating meta, love and kindness for people who are behaving in difficult ways.
Let's just say people for whom, with whom the only thing this person had in common was that each thinks the other is a jerk.
And nonetheless, like they'd be on opposite sides of hockey bench, right? Nonetheless, when they went out on the field to play, they would pull together.
And they did their best to help each other out because as this person wrote, in the end, we win or lose as a team.
This is the kind of meta they found useful when someone was acting aggressive, belligerent, hostile or inexplicably difficult in some way.
Instead of simply responding out of that very human first impulse of outrage, anger, unfairness.
Instead, they would envision the other person as if both of them were on the playing field together.
Where it doesn't matter who scores, because everybody wins.
Because the goals are credited to the whole team, not to one person.
And then they describe this sort of mental experiment of trying to figure out what play the other person is making, what goal they're trying to score, right?
The goal on the playing field of life.
And regardless of the play and how irritating it is.
The goal all of us are trying to score is to be happy.
Safe at ease, right?
This is the goal beneath all of the other goals.
And at this fundamental human level, all life is on the same team.
We might have different ways of expressing it, confusing even hurtful ways of expressing it to each other and with each other.
But that fundamental wish weaves amongst all hearts, right?
So metaphors, you know, they're very personal.
Each of us, each of you, please pick your own.
Some people find they have different ways of accessing kindness and compassion, even on different days, right?
But for example, if developing kindness or compassion for someone, I find difficult.
It might be helpful to imagine them as a baby or a small child or on their deathbed.
Found as a chaplain, people that I might not otherwise have anything in common with are really easy to connect with.
When you're dying, we all die.
So whatever form it takes, tapping into some kind of goodwill, unifying wish is useful if we live in a heart divided,
house divided, a neighborhood or family divided or a nation divided.
So tonight, the US is televising hearings about a sad chapter in this country's history.
And my invitation to all of us is to practice expansively.
You don't have to go there, but we'll build up to it.
But the invitation is to include practicing goodwill across some kind of sense of division or difference,
even if it's within your own heart, within parts of yourself that you've divided out.
It said that loving kindness and the ancient teachings as the power to create social cohesion and friendship.
So the invitation is to begin that possibility at least privately in and for our own hearts.
Okay.
So those are my introductory remarks.
I'm now going to mute you all.
Really just mostly in case someone comes in, not muted, so that they don't inadvertently cause some kind of disturbance in meditation.
And we'll be meditating for about half an hour.
So please mute anything that is inclined to beep, buzz, ring, alert, vibrate or otherwise interrupt your experience, especially technological in nature.
Feel free to turn away from the screen if you prefer.
You are of course welcome to keep your camera on if you wish.
But really moving into your own body, your own relaxation.
Softening the eyes.
Softening the face.
Closing the eyes if that feels safe, hospitable in this space.
And starting by just acknowledging wherever this body, this heart, this mind is at whatever that is.
Maybe greeting it a little half smile.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Perhaps taking four or five slow breaths into the belly.
Long and slow out.
Relaxing, letting go on the opera.
Letting go of the words, any tensions, any extra energy or thinking that it took to get here.
Feeling the support beneath the body and cushion or chair.
Find yourself to be held, supported, cradled by the support beneath you and by the boundless support of the earth beneath that.
And the turning to the whole body, pulsing, vibrating, motion or stillness.
Warmth or cool.
Noticing any place's attention or relaxation.
Breathing, softening around any stuck spots.
Feeling to the vibrancy of the body.
Perhaps settling on the breathing as your anchor of attention.
If that doesn't work for you, feel free to choose whatever object of attention does work.
Hearing embodied sensation and adapt these instructions.
Resting the heart, the attention on the in-breath and out-breath, the rising and falling of the belly or chest, or the rising and falling of sensation.
Breathing.
If the mind wanders, stepping back into a larger awareness.
Oh, wandering.
And inviting again the experience of this body to be the center of attention.
Awareness of breathing the body of this moment.
As the attention settles, setting the resolve, the aditana to meet each experience with kindness.
Goodwill.
Trust this.
Goodwill.
Now gathering the attention, the torso, especially the heart center, the area around the heart, the center of the chest.
Noticing the sensations, emotions there in the in-breath and out-breath.
If it feels natural, offering a sense of kindness on the out-breath.
Breathing on the in-breath.
Noticing any shift in sensation, even by invoking kindness.
Now calling to mind a person or a being with simple, easy, makes you smile, maybe brings lightness to your heart.
Maybe someone you don't know all that well but like an animal for whom you have easy affection.
No one for whom it's tough or complicated or sad.
Perhaps envisioning them.
Having a felt sense of them nearby.
Or even just the idea of them.
Wishing them kindness, wishing them well.
Perhaps using these words, or just wordlessly, or words of your own.
Be safe from inner and outer harm.
Be peaceful.
Be free.
Be safe.
Be peaceful.
Be free.
Can imagine bright light from the heart, from the body.
Maybe radiating through all of your cells out towards them.
Touching and infusing kindness.
Through this heart and that heart, those hearts.
Perhaps imagining a response, seen or unseen, felt, heard.
And allowing maybe a smile to come to your lips or your heart.
Feeling how it feels to offer goodwill to this other one.
Perhaps imagining a response, seen or unseen, felt.
Knowing kindness, goodwill, to ripple out through the body.
In whatever way feels right right now.
Now taking a step back, maybe zooming the camera out.
Consciously including yourself in this field of goodwill, kindness, benevolence.
May we be safe from inner and outer harm.
May we be peaceful.
Be free.
Be free.
Be free.
Be free.
Be free.
Be free.
Allowing these wishes of kindness to saturate all corners and quarters of this heart and body.
All corners and quarters of the field with this other one.
Breathing like a star.
Perhaps moving outward to the breath.
Breathing, leaving goodness.
Breathing.
It's fine to stay here. This feels nourishing, grounding, settling.
And the invitation is to expand a circle with you and this other one.
Outwards to your neighborhood or area, to those nearby.
Human and non-human.
Be safe, peaceful, free.
Be free.
Be free.
Offering these intentions, and trusting they are doing their work.
Acknowledging with kindness, anything and everything arising in the heart and mind and body.
Including that too, in kindness.
No need to force or make anything happen.
Allowing.
Intentions of kindness, radiating outwards and inwards.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
From time to time, refreshing the intention.
Of goodwill for all that arises and moves across this heart and mind in this moment.
Nothing left out.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
And now the invitation is to expand the circle of kind intentions.
To some other one who can be a person, part of yourself, a group, with someone seen as other.
Someone where it feels like there's a sense of division, difference, a wall or a moat of some kind.
There's no need to condone behavior, there's no need to like or to understand.
Just to acknowledge whatever difficulty perhaps is manifested.
Could be the result of confusion, collusion, some misdirected energies.
But far beneath the surface, no matter how hidden or malformed, why is the wish to be happy, to be safe?
Be peaceful, free of suffering in this core wish.
Sending along the wish of kindness to this other or these others.
May you be safe from inner and outer harm.
May you be peaceful.
May you be free.
Offering that wish and being kind to anything and everything that comes up in this body, heart and mind.
Even the intention to offer kindness starts at home.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now letting go of any particular aiming of kindness towards anyone.
Fiddling into this heart and this body for a moment.
Feeling exactly what's there.
Wishing yourself well.
Allowing breath, sensation, emotion, thoughts, intentions to flow through.
Like with speakers or weather through sky.
A heart that can hold it all.
With loving awareness.
Favouring any feelings of warmth or kindness.
Allowing being with everything else.
Thank you for your practice, friends.
And as it's becoming my custom when teaching happy hour, I want to invite you, you're welcome to stay with yourself, stay inside if you want.
But the invitation is to stay in this space of metta of kindness.
And take a moment to send kindness to the other people in this zoom room, maybe looking at their videos or their squares with their names if it feels okay turning on your video.
Just sending kindness, metta, goodwill to your fellow practitioners.
Eyes open, eyes closed, just fine.
In either way, trusting, knowing that as you're sending kindness, the others on this call are sending it right back at you.
Taking a moment to take in this wonderful community.
Thank you.
We have just a moment or two for any short responses, reflections anyone wants to share.
Thank you. You're welcome to chat it or maybe you've got more than one screen so raise your zoom hand and name it can be a comment.
It can even be a complaint. That's okay.
I'm curious how that was for people.
Thank you.
The invitation now is going to do breakout rooms you do not have to participate in these you're absolutely welcome to hang out in the main room, silently while everyone else does break out and then we'll all join back together in about six or seven minutes.
But I do want to just see if I can do options here.
Okay, we're going to do six minutes, plus an extra 60 seconds.
And the invitation is to talk about you choose to join one.
What helps you feel kindness with people who are different than you are, whatever it is.
Thank you, Dave. Dave writes enjoyed it immensely. Thanks.
So, if that prompt doesn't resonate, please feel free to talk about any part of loving kindness practice that feels helpful for you.
I'm going to send you off now those of you who want to go, and we'll see each other again at about five.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
I always love your segment I wish that you had like a regular day every week.
I'm here the next two Thursdays to fantastic.
Wonderful welcome back everybody.
So, I'd love to hear any reflections on that how that was for you or about the practice, anything you wish to share.
This time that you learned or imparted or challenges that have happened.
What's on your mind.
Thanks, Jesse.
I really appreciate this practice today.
What I got from what you were saying was just the subject this idea of divisiveness or being divided me being divided in myself.
And what I noticed was that
this resentment is, it's already in, it's in progress, like it's already has momentum.
And so, two practices that I hope that I mentioned in the breakout report to practice loving kindness, like immediately, you know, for the person place or thing, the object of resentment, but also myself, you know, that I'm, because I'm maybe trying to avoid some type of pain
or wound or something, and then to maybe, like, actually seek comfort somewhere, like in a
seek refuge, you know, with a friend or something like that. Thank you.
Beautiful. There's so much wisdom in what you were just saying to immediately move out towards the other and towards your own heart.
It's so true right if there's already resentment happening something's already been brewing whether or not we were seeing it.
And then extraordinary helpfulness of community, a friend of connection. Yeah.
Thank you.
Any others realizing I can't see the chat. I'm going to get to a point where I can see that too.
Yes, Marianne. Thank you. That was was really, really helpful.
The one part that I really felt really felt some response especially was something about having them loving kindness, filling your whole body like all the way down to your toes.
And that, yeah, that seems like that was that was really, really great. So thank you for that, especially.
I'm curious, like, having it go all the way down to your toes. What was helpful about it?
It was the physical like it made it kind of a physical embodiment of of mental, I think, not just like, well, I'm going to be kind down in my head.
But just to it seemed like also very like a flowing thing coming out of the heart a lot and just filling up the whole body.
Nice.
So yeah, this can be a deeply embodied practice, right? It's beautiful that you discovered that like the for me anyway, it's been really helpful to get my body deeply involved.
Toes, fingers, cells, bones, whatever, right, wherever it works.
A delightful, a delightful image.
I don't remember saying toes, but that's great.
We have time maybe for one quick other one if anyone has something I want to say.
Otherwise, thank you all. Thank you for your practice. It's such a sweet song. I really appreciate being here at happy hour with each of you and just dedicate our time together.
May the benefits of our practice here together ripple out through each of our hearts, bodies, fingers, toes, bellies, backs, sides, through any corners of our own hearts and minds,
any corners of our own lives and out beyond touching all beings in the path of our good intentions.
May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free.
Thank you for your practice.
