 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, again, warm welcome to all of you. Happy to have you at happy hour. As I mentioned just a minute ago, it's vernal equinox today. And that, the fact that it's the vernal equinox is the reason that I am here and not Nikki. Because the spring equinox also happens to be the Persian New Year. So she is celebrating with family tonight. And I am celebrating with you tonight. I'm happy to be here. In addition to those two kind of celebratory events, there's yet another celebratory event. Which is that today is International Happiness Day. I wonder how many of you knew that. International Happiness Day. And this was established by the United Nations in 2013 at the instigation of a tiny Buddhist mountain nation named Bhutan. And Bhutan, which I've actually been to, beautiful place. They have their kind of rulers set up this idea. Instead of having a gross domestic product index the way we do and many, many Western nations do. They set up a gross domestic happiness index. And that is designed to, it's sort of the, well it's not just an index, but it's an overall kind of taking a pulse. Of the collective well being of the country. And they have several different pillars for it. But the idea being that if something is cared about enough to be tracked, measured in this collective way that it will be attended to. Isn't that sweet? So Bhutan also lobbied the United Nations successfully to have an International Happiness Day and today is it. First day of spring in this hemisphere. And it just kind of got me thinking, this sort of confluence of different days about what our internal happiness indexes might be. Let me just take a moment to think about what might your internal happiness index be. What are the contributing factors for you in your own life, your heart, your mind. What might that be? I'm just pausing for a moment to give you a moment to reflect. And then to say what whatever the answers are, then they're all fine, I'm sure. With regard to the heart practices. I guess you could say there's probably many approaches but one might be to be aware or be mindful. To appreciate the good. To be grateful when possible. To be kind. And to be connected to something bigger up to something bigger than just my personal concerns, my personal life, whatever that bigger is. And however modest of a form it takes. This idea of perhaps dedicating yourself to something. It could be as simple as modeling health and well-being. Or spreading a sense of happiness or peacefulness through a way of being. Whatever it is. So those are a few factors that I would use in my own personal happiness index. The contributing factors to happiness independent of what's going on outside in our lives. So with that short introduction, I invite you to settle into a meditation posture. And we're going to play with some of these kinds of approaches in practicing metta kindness. A little infusion of appreciation and gratitude. Finding yourself a comfortable posture, balanced between relaxation and alertness. It's something that you feel like you can really relax into, sink into. Just maybe take stock. If your eyes aren't closed yet, you can look around the room, notice where you are. If your eyes are already closed, the invitation is to look inside. Observe. Whatever and however you actually are in this moment. Don't change anything. Just noticing what is. Noticing the physical sensations of your body immersed in the world. Maybe the warmth or cool in your skin, in your inside the skin too. Any sense of weight or lightness. Maybe tuning into the sense of being supported by your chair or cushion or whatever else your body rests in. Noticing any physical sensations inside the body. The lightness of pulsing or tingling. Tension. Softness. Vibration or movement. And attuning, tuning in to the sensations of breathing. Or if it's more helpful to you, the overall feeling of the body, your body here now. Noticing breathing in when breathing in. Breathing out when breathing out. And setting the intention that awareness, mindfulness, will be at the forefront of these few minutes of settling in. Relaxing the end of the exhale, investing there, before allowing a natural inhale. And from time to time noticing the top, the fullness of the inhale, before letting go, softening into the exhale. Allowing awareness, attention to settle. And the fullness rest on the experience of breathing. And from time to time. Noticing the return of awareness, mindfulness, and appreciating. What's happening in this moment? Anything good, nourishing, about just being here, sitting together. Breathing, being. Let the mind and body settle just a little, perhaps. The invitation is to call to mind the person or being who's been good to you in a simple way, has benefited you some way. Could be an image of them, a felt sense of them, or a simple memory. Could be someone personally known, or an inspiring figure, you hear the man. Calling of him, seeing how that feels in your body and your heart. Taking a moment to recollect some of what you appreciate about them. Maybe they're good deeds or good qualities. Noticing any feelings of appreciation or gratitude. That emerges, you consider them. Imagine them. Perhaps like an internal gesture of offering. Or warm light on the out breath, sending them good wishes. It's helpful to focus your wishes and words. I'll offer a few of the classic phrases. Please feel free to use them or not use them, or use your own words in your own language if you wish. May you be safe from inner and outer harm. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be peaceful, safe, and free. Gathering the attention with words or without, and offering kindness, friendliness, appreciation, gratitude. Perhaps imagining the response. From time to time, noticing how it feels in your own heart and mind. To be offering these wishes. Continuing building a rhythm that feels right for you. You can help in gathering momentum, focus, to shorten any phrases to a word or two. Happy, healthy, be peaceful, and free. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now widening the circle. To include yourself. You're welcome to turn the attention to yourself if that feels right and natural. Or to invite the benefactor, this other one, this other being, to join in these wishes together. May we be safe, happy, healthy. May we be peaceful and free. Thank you. Thank you. From time to time, turning in to notice how it feels. And encouraging any feelings born. Kindly being with anything else. And trusting, trusting these intentions. Safe. Happy. Healthy. Peaceful. Easeful. And free. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For all of those nearby, all of those near in your life, maybe in this stone mill. Filing ripples of kindness, good wishes, flow out through the breath, through the body. In any directions that feel natural to you, towards these other ones nearby. Physically, virtually, or in the heart. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. really allowing them to ripple through the breath through every organ, every cell, bone, tissue and pore, this body, spreading out in all directions, turning into the energy, the felt sense of these good intentions, allowing them to ripple out still further with the people and creatures on the edges of your life, those you cross tabs with, in one way or another. Safe, happy, healthy. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Peaceful, peaceful, real. Open the heart, expanding the circle as wide as it wants to go, radiating, sending, offering, loving-kindness, like the sun itself, the star, warmth in all directions, through all corners of this heart and mind, and towards, around, through all beings everywhere. May we be safe, happy, healthy, peaceful, peaceful, and real. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The invitation is to let go of any phrases or destinations for your metta. Just be, ask, savor, or be with whatever is present flowing through the body, heart, heart, and soul, and notice in the quality of the heart, any mood or inclinations in the mind, stay flowing through. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. As has become the custom on the diet that I teach you, the invitation is to stay quiet for a moment, kind of a meditative space, and to take a minute to wish your fellow Zoom room participants, fellow practitioners, well, just a little pulse of goodwill, friendliness to each other, seen or unseen, video or tile. Let me take a moment to scroll through if it's easy. Does you do that, knowing that others are also wishing you well right now? Thank you. Thank you for your practice. So we have a few minutes now for any reflections on the meditation. Any comments or questions? Anyone has anything they'd like to offer? Yes. Basil, is that how you pronounce your name? Yeah, Basil. Hi. So I have a question that's kind of embarrassing because I've been coming for happy hour for so long and I don't know this. So when you do, first of all, thank you for reading this. It's very nice. So when we practice metta, is it best to focus on the breath and infuse it with metta or focus on the concept of loving kindness or either or? It's a great question. It's not silly at all. So different things work for different people is the short answer. Okay. Really want to invite you to experiment for yourself and see what the difference is for you. Okay. I often invite people to use breath and sensation because embodied metta is what works best for me. Okay. So I think that's something that I find the concepts and the phrases are helpful. Internal gesture is another one that I often teach for the same reason. There's something about tying it to some kind of movement, imagined movement or real breath that can be helpful. What have you done for yourself? What seems to click for you? I've always, you know, I've always done it with, kind of infused with the breath or infused with the sensations in the body, I think this last week I tried it for the, one time when just kind of with just the general feeling of mecca and just focusing on that, not so much on the breath and that also worked well. So I was just wondering if there's one that's I think there were, I wouldn't say one was better than the other, but I tried that again today and it wasn't able to do that. So I was just, you know, with the breath in the body again. Yeah. So I think you're doing it exactly right, which is experimenting and seeing what works for you in different conditions, right? Sometimes when the momentum is much stronger or for whatever reason, you know, whatever conditions in our lives were more concentrated or more in that mode, it can just be focusing on the feeling or the intention is enough to pop it up. And then other times it's really helpful to engage in a much more deliberate way, whether it's phrases or embodied or combination. Great question. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody else? Comments, questions, complaints? And please use your zoom hand because we have more than one screen tonight. You're also welcome to put things in the chat if you're shy to speak. That's completely fair. And if you chat me privately, I'll just read the question without reading the name. So that's an option. Maybe in a quiet mood tonight. Oh, June. Hi. Welcome. Please. Sorry, I'm unmuting. Yeah, I really like the way at the end you mentioned about sincerity. And I'm curious on why do you use this phrase because I like I like it. And can you share more about the intention behind it? Sure. Yeah, I'm happy to. So the short answer is that I found sincerity of practice to be one of the strongest vehicles for my own development and the development of those I've taught or coached that there's something really beautiful about the sincerity of intention that meditators bring to practice. And then there's also something that I heard early in my practice. I started out at the Zen Center many years ago. And there's this quote, I think it's from Suzuki Roshi. A student asks him if I practice really diligently while I get enlightened. And he responded, if you're sincere, it's almost as good. If you're sincere, it's almost as good. So high value on that purity or sincerity of intention. A beautiful question, June, thank you. Thank you. Any others before we begin, what for some people is the favorite part of happy hour and for other people is not. And that is break up. They are optional. If you don't want to join, please feel free to stay in the main room with your meditate. That's totally fine. So invite you to connect with each other. Many of you know each other. You've been practicing here for years, some of you. And just speak about this notion of this. Be mindful, appreciate the good, be grateful, be kind, be connected to something bigger. If any of those resonate for you, you can use that as a sort of departure point for your conversation. It'll be about six minutes and then one minute closing warning. See you in order now. I'm not able to, I'm not sure who's speaking. I can't hear you clearly. Please go ahead and raise your zoom hand if you'd like to talk. I'd love to hear from you. And comments are also welcome through the chat if you prefer that. Amy, hi. So I went on a hike this weekend, and I'm very fortunate to live in Hawaii, and it's absolutely beautiful. I was like, I fell in love with this tree. Had these giant roots sticking out and I was like, I just couldn't get enough of the meta I was having for this giant tree. I was like, I'm just so excited. Just something about it. So grounded and beautiful and unique. It's just such a unique experience. I don't always go around falling in love with trees. But I feel like it has something to do with the practices we're doing here. And I think that we're going to have a relationship with nature with trees as well as with other people, other creatures. Some people consider that a sign of spiritual development. Thank you for your words. Anybody else? Yeah, hi. I was in the breakout room, and I remember she was not really looking for happiness. And that resonated with me. I thought, yeah, I'm not out looking for happiness. And then they made me, well, what am I looking for? But I realized I'm looking for love. I am looking for someone to love. And when I saw some trees and loves, and when I find that, then happiness comes. Beautiful. So one of the key conditions for you for happiness is love, feeling love. Yeah, that's beautiful. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, I wanted to ask a question. I can't seem to raise my hand. I don't. It's the computers not cooperating. Please feel free. Ask away, Barry. I'm familiar with two types of guided meta. One is where meta is radiated out, and the other is where it's directed to different categories of relationships. It sounds like you were doing the radiation style. Were you, and is there a name for each of these types of meta? That's a great question. So I was actually kind of doing a fusion of both. At the beginning, the guidance was to send it to someone who'd done us some good, a benefactor, someone who's been kind, and then include ourselves and then include others. But I kind of mixed it up with the radiating, especially towards the end. The last half of the meditation was mostly radiating. It's in the ancient suttas, the text that's called pervading. That's the word. And the difference between them is really for the radiating, it doesn't have to involve words at all. And it's the earliest form of meta that the Buddha taught. And then sending it to these different categories of people were teachings that evolved later in his teaching. And they're both equally valid. Some people like one or the other both, some people like both. So it's entirely up to you as to what you practice. Thanks for the question. And we have come to the end of our time together. And so just a quick dedication of the merit. May the practice that we have done here together be of benefit to ourselves, to each other, throughout our lives and all the lives we touch and all the lives they touch outward and onward. May all beings be safe, happy, peaceful and free. Be well, good people. Feel free to unmute and say goodbye if you wish. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Good night everyone. Thank you.
