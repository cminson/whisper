The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So good morning. So today I'm going to cover two of the seven factors of
awakening, partly because we get all seven into these five days. And so the
third one is effort. And the fourth one is joy. And the two fall joy follows
effort because rather than effort being a drag, rather than effort being
something stern or serious or hard or work to do, the effort is delightful.
It's just, of course, this is a good thing to do. It's just feels to be able to do
so of course every moment we're in the fork in the road and if the buffering
happens again or if we freeze or even disappear, you're at a fork. And your
question, always the question is which fork do you take? Do you take some kind
of fork that's disappointed, upset, angry, grieving or something, you know,
something where you get tight and constricted, try to make your computer
work, or do you take a fork that is much more beneficial, that maybe tries to
figure out what's going on, but it doesn't feel any tension around it. It feels
relaxed and open. Okay, so this is happening now. So this is not a should,
the effort we're making here at this point in practice. This is a byproduct of
the meditation developing such a degree, mindfulness developing to such a degree,
that there's a heightened sensitivity, a natural sensitivity, a natural awareness
to the choices that our system makes. Maybe we don't even make it the choices, but so we
start, you know, thinking about something, maybe we start thinking about breakfast,
and we start kind of fantasizing about the most wonderful breakfast we could
have, and we start thinking about how can I get it, and how can I get it and make
it, and all kinds of things. And if you're very sensitive and you watch that
process from the very beginning, you feel that there's a loss. There's a
contraction and narrowing, a preoccupation where the delightful sense of
presence, a vitality and awareness, a natural awareness that's there, has been
shut down, has been lost. And if you're right there, you can feel this is not
interesting. I'd rather stay present, peaceful, free, rather than thinking about
breakfast one more time. I get preoccupied about breakfast every morning, and I've
wasted how many years of my life thinking about food and breakfast, and
nothing wrong with doing that, but I can feel how it's not skillful, it's not
helpful. There's a loss of something that's even better that I've learned
maybe through this practice. I've learned to value the practice. I've learned to
value the practice of being present, and so rather than continuing down the track
of the mind, the reactivity of the mind, because the practice has gotten strong,
we feel like we're at the fork, and I just come back to awareness. In fact, what
seems more interesting is to watch and track what my awareness is doing, how
my awareness is present for the next thing that arises, how it receives it, how
awareness maybe moves from one object to another. Now it's this, now it's that,
now it's the birds, now it's the workers doing the work here, and so we're
seeing, in a very natural way, this distinction between what is healthy and
not healthy, that classic Buddhist language is skillful and unskillful,
and we're choosing skillful, and that doesn't have to mean that we're
choosing a lot of new effort to do something new, it means that we're
actually choosing to be present, we're choosing the practice, we're choosing to
be awake, to be present for what's going on. As this becomes clear, that this is
really for our betterment, really a nice thing to do, and it's the best game
in town, then there's a kind of joy that begins to arise, a delight, a gladness,
an appreciation, a feeling, I'm so lucky to have discovered this, I'm so lucky to
have this ability to stay in this flow of skillfulness, this flow of healthiness,
this flow of clarity, where that's where freedom is found. And the, so the, and so
this joy begins to arise, and that joy has different qualities. One quality is
just the delight and the gladness, the sense of gratitude, and that this is a
great choice, it's a great place to be, it's great to be tracking and following
the healthy choice, and, and, but then as we begin getting it more, I'm in the
flow of these healthy choices, especially in meditation, choosing to stay
present, the flow of present moment awareness, maybe the flow of staying with
the breath, and just kind of surfing on the breath, or letting the breath surf
on your awareness, just kind of being present more and more, kind of surfing
in the present moment, the continuity of just this is good, it tends to start
giving a rise to a joy that can even be kind of, even thrilling, kind of a joy
which is, some people call it even rapture, but a joy that just, there's so
much pleasure, there's so much delight, so much we could start getting filled in
the goodness of this path, of doing this practice, of doing it, and as the more
joy there arises, so I'll just continue, and so as we feel more the gladness, the
joy, the delight, the good feeling, the goodness of practicing and choosing the
healthy fork, then we're choosing a path of pleasure, it's pleasant, and that
pleasure tends to grow and grow into a kind of ecstasy, a kind of delight, a
kind of real joy, and this can be part of meditation practice, not automatic,
not just coming to meditation from a busy life and a lot of different
challenging things going on, but rather a joy that comes from having developed
and cultivated the practice over some time and really beginning to feel the
the benefits of it, and so rather than seeing the juncture between skillful
and unskillful as another reason to be judgmental to oneself, so no sound, so
can't hear you, too much buffering, so let's see if I'll continue with my last
words when I know that you have sound, okay, so rather than this coming to
this juncture and feeling like it's a drag, it's like now's a lot of work and a
lot of choice, when the mind is, the practice is really clear and settled,
that there is, then there is just a delight in doing this, following the
path of pleasure, no need to be critical or judgmental towards oneself about how
it's going, because that is, that itself is choosing the stressful fork, the
unskillful fork, always choosing the skillful one, and the minimum of what
that means is to come back to awareness, the clarity of awareness that sees and
knows, so I don't know if this buffering is going to happen again, I am using an
Ethernet cord which is supposed to make it easy, so maybe the problem is not
here with the local Wi-Fi, but maybe, and tomorrow mind, and maybe don't feel like
you have to do a lot, but just really see it, and then see what happens, look, see
the forks, and see them again, really see that, oh now I'm at this fork, and just
that kind of clarity, see what happens then, what you decide to do, and maybe it
will bring you a sense of joy, that you see the fork so clearly, and maybe you
choose the right thing, so thank you, and I look forward to seeing you back at IMC
tomorrow, thank you.
