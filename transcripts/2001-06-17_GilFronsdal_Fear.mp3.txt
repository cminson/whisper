 So, my reflections for the last little while have been on the subject of fear. Last Monday night we did an evening looking at fear. Turned out on Thursday evening we just had open questions and some of the questions had to do with anxiety. I promised last Monday that I would maybe give a talk tomorrow night unless I changed my mind on fear. So it's been on my mind about fear tomorrow night. So it's on my mind, so I thought I would talk about fear today. Give me a chance to warm up for tomorrow night. Fear is a very interesting topic. It's a very important topic. Many years ago I asked the Dharma Sea Tape Library for a list of their best selling Dharma tapes. They think Dharma Talks. And so they came back with a top ten of 1995 or something like that. And we should play that someday. And the surprise for me was that four of those top ten, the most common theme in four of the top ten tapes, best sellers of the year had to do with fear. How to work with fear, how to be with fear. It's a very common topic. A lot of Ipasana students who go on retreat for example or do any period of meditation at some point will be surprised by how pervasive fear is. They maybe know there's some anxiety or some fear. Maybe sometimes they don't. But then to discover what a common denominator, a common theme, underlying theme that seems to infuse out, penetrate so many different areas of our lives is a big surprise for some people. I believe anybody engaged in mindfulness practice or maybe any spiritual practice will sooner or later have to deal with fear, will have to confront fear, will meet fear. I think that part of the process of opening up, that is involved in spiritual practice, opening up, dropping away our defenses, dropping away our resistances to life, being able to be fully present for this moment as it is, entails confronting all the ways in which we're not present and the ways we're closed, the way we do resist, the way we run away or try to deny. All those processes of staying closed are often informed or influenced by anxiety, fear, apprehension. And so if the mindfulness practice is going to be an honest approach to dealing with those ways in which we're closed, it has to deal with an honest approach, a very realistic approach to fear. Certainly a willingness to be with our fear and not to kind of try to do a spiritual bypass which people often try. They think, well, if I just get concentrated or just get calm or just do this or that, X, Y and Z, then I can just avoid my fear and be quite blissed out or quite happy or very spiritual. And the path of mindfulness practice is not to do a bypass around who we are, but really to enter deeply directly who we are and if fear is a part of who we are, to enter into directly that fear and learn the skills it takes to be present for the fear in a very honest, realistic way. So fear is important to look at. If you go to Southeast Asia or read books by Southeast Asian Buddhist teachers, especially from the forest tradition, there's a lot of stories about confronting fear as part of their practice. You have these wonderful stories. They're a little bit, since there's very few tigers left in the forest of Thailand, they're kind of part of the legends now, but just a generation or two ago, there were a lot of tigers and wild elephants and all kinds of dangerous snakes in the forest in Thailand. I'll tell you my story, my snake story. So it's not just legends, other people, right? I have two snake stories. Actually, it doesn't have much to do with fear, exactly, but it just came to mind. And since this is the warm-up talk, I can kind of... The first one was I was in a forest monastery in Thailand and it was dusk and so you couldn't see, you could kind of see, but not too well yet at that point. There was a very... It was a dirt road in the forest and quite wide. I don't know how long it was, but it seemed quite wide to me. And there was a branch that was fallen on the road, crossing the road. So I was just walking along, I don't know, maybe semi-mindfully, I don't know what I was doing exactly, but... So I just kind of... I was aware that I was stepping on the branch, but it was a branch. So I stepped on the branch and the branch moved. And I just flew up into the air, I was carrying my camera and I just... I kind of flew up into the air, twisted up in the middle of the air and used my camera as a defense. I kind of flung it down the ground, whatever it was that was there to kind of keep it away from me. And it was this huge snake. I have no idea whether it was a poisonous snake or not, but I stepped on this big snake. And then I had the other stories, more of the kind of things that... The supernatural is built on. Part of it. Who knows what actually happened, but there was this wonderful... I think it was a Singaporean monk who spoke very good English, who was living in a little... I was deep in the forest in this little dirt path, kind of cut out in the jungle. Following that path past my little cabin, a little bit further deeper into the jungle, was another cabin. And there was this old, old monk who had been a monk for many, many years. And he was somewhat famous for having been a hermit for many years. I don't know how long, but for many years he lived in a little cave by himself as a hermit, practicing away. And he was considered to be quite well realized and developed in his practice. And so one day he was walking down the path and I was sitting meditating on the porch of my little cabin. And so I stopped and went down and stood on the bottom step of the porch and was talking to him for a while. It was very nice. And then it was time for him to leave. And he said goodbye. And my memory of it is that literally all I did was I turned around 360 degrees on the steps. Not really very far enough for him to really... Quick enough for him to really get very far down the path as he was leaving. But as I turned around 360 degrees after he said goodbye and looked back at exactly where he was standing, what was standing there was a big snake. Not him. So... So that's the kind of thing that's... Who knows what that was? And since I tend to be kind of a rational kind of guy, I didn't jump to the conclusions that he was transformed or he was... I don't know what it was. I just let it be what it was and went back and meditated some more. And you never quite knew what was in those cabins. Those little kutties, little huts, you know, snakes up in the rafters and these big lizards. So anyway, it was a dangerous place. You hear a lot of stories of people confronting tigers. They meditate in the middle of the night and they hear these sounds and the crunching of the jungle floor, you know, the leaves and stuff. And they kind of were convinced it was a tiger. And they wouldn't open their eyes but rather break out into a sweat. Or they would open their eyes and just say, wow, it's a tiger and they close their eyes. Okay, I'm going to die. This is where I'm going to die. But I'm going to die doing the dharma. I'm going to sit there and meditate and try to stay clear and not have the fear, have the upper hand. And of course, the people telling stories are the ones who survived, right? And I think someone, maybe Ajahnamara or someone said that there's a lot of these stories of confronting tigers and snakes and wild elephants and things, whatnot. But there's no record of a monk ever being eaten by a tiger, attacked by a tiger. So maybe it was less dangerous than it seems. But there's a lot of stories like this. We're going to cemeteries. Ties are particularly afraid of cemeteries and much more than most Westerners are. And I remember once, I don't know, it's okay, I just tell personal stories, I have nothing to do with anything. When I was 21 or so, I was kind of a hippie hitchhiking around Europe. I was dropped off one night in the middle of the midnight or something, in the middle of this kind of like town in Denmark. I needed a place to stay, a sleeping bag with me, so there was this park just near the side of this kind of low wall. So I climbed over the little wall, jumped over the little wall and rolled out my sleeping bag underneath the bushes and went to sleep for the night. Only to wake up in the morning to find out that I was sleeping on top of a grave in a cemetery. So if I had known it was a cemetery, maybe I would have been a little bit afraid. But anyway, I think we're here in the West, we tend not to be afraid of cemeteries and graves as often people in Thailand are with our ghosts. And so the stories of monks intentionally going to meditate through the night in the cemeteries and then something coming, often they think it's a ghost coming, and then sitting with it. Now what's interesting is that the approach in Thai Buddhism is a little bit different than the approach here in the West. Even I think among the way the Pasana teacher in the West talk about being with fear. The tendency in the West is to talk about it from a psychological point of view, to understand your fear, look at your fear, come to terms with it, learn how to be with the fear, understand the causes of it, the underlying roots of it. It's a little more psychological orientation, which is a very wise thing to do, I'm not putting it down. But in Thailand, which tends not to have a very psychological approach to practice like we have in the West, the approach tends to be more meditative. In a sense, rather than dealing and coming to terms with the fear itself, what you're trying to do is to develop the inner strength of concentration, of calm, of fearlessness that allows you to override the fear, allows you to remain calm and centered in the midst of having the fear. So it's really kind of a way of, to speak very loosely, not being interested in the fear itself, but rather seeing can you develop your concentration enough so that you're concentrated in calm and independent enough of your fear that the fear doesn't have the upper hand. And so that always, many of these stories, then that's what happens. Otherwise, that's why they're recorded. You know, is he sure enough the monk sat there and broke out in the sweat and thought was convinced he was going to die that night and he was going to die meditating. So he just really kind of threw himself into his breath meditation, stayed with that breath no matter what hung onto it and got very, very concentrated. And lo and behold, it broke through to a tremendous feeling of bliss, of calm, of peace. And then before they knew it, dawn happened and they realized they were awake and they feel very happy about themselves with the fact that they sat through their fear and didn't succumb to it. And then they got a lot of courage from that and it became kind of a breakthrough experience for their meditation. And then in the future, when fear arose, they didn't tend to be caught by the fear. They didn't get to kind of get afraid of their fear. But rather they said, I have this ability to be with my fear. I'll just rely on my meditative ability. And there they each time the fear came up, they were stronger than their fear. And there's also here in the West stories like this. I don't know so many stories of people, of Buddhist practitioners who put themselves in fearful situations like that and then kind of write it out. But I've had lots of friends who were meditating for some years and then found themselves in fearful situations, dangerous situations. For example, found themselves in situations where they were being mugged because I was living in the San Francisco Zen Center where people got mugged a lot. It was part of the Zen tradition up there. And sometimes it was more than just being mugged. I mean, there were people who were stabbed and shot Zen students up there. It used to be quite dangerous in that area, the Fillmore area. And there were some marvelous stories of my friends being held up at gunpoint or knife point. And they said that what got them through that experience was their ability to stay centered and calm. And they didn't panic, they didn't get anxious, they didn't strike out, but they stayed calm and centered. And that calm and centered gave them somehow perspective to know how to be with that situation that got them through it in a wise way. My favorite story is my friend Steve who was being held up, I think, at knife point or somehow. In the evening. He was going to a meeting where other people were going to also the meeting. And another person going to the meeting, one of his friends, passed him on the street. And later Steve came into the building and said, you know, as he passed me I was being held up. And he said, oh, it seemed like you were just having a nice conversation. And he said, yeah, what happened was, you know, he wanted my wallet. And I explained to him that he was welcome to have my wallet, but, you know, I really needed my driver's license or my credit card or something. And, you know, I'd be happy to hand over everything else to him, but please, could I keep my driver's license or whatever, my identification cards or whatever. And the guy was quite amenable to that. And so, you know, we had this exchange and he worked it out. I gave it to him and he left and that was quite nice. And the working out was done in such kind of calm way that the friend passing him by on the street didn't think it was anything wrong. Now, you might think he was stupid. Maybe he could have said, hey, I'll call that first friend for help. But, you know, sometimes maybe being calm is sometimes the wise thing to do. I'm not going to advise anyone how to respond to being mugged because every situation calls for a different response. But they attributed their meditation to the fact that they were able to enter that situation and stay calm. And there were a lot of stories like that. The one story where the person didn't stay calm after he was mugged, he ended up in jail. Not the mugger. The mugger got away. But the person who didn't stay calm acted out in weird ways. And so the power of meditation is one that can help us not to be caught by our fear, but rather stay calm or centered, stay concentrated, stay alert and present for what's going on. So it points to the fact that sometimes part of the value of meditation is not learning how to deal with fear directly, the mx of your particular fear, but rather the skills that come with learning how to be present. And then you bring that in a situation where you're afraid. So for us who are very psychologically oriented, I think that's a very important lesson. That it isn't always a matter of coming to terms and dealing with the fear directly, but it's learning to develop these inner strengths that could become in a sense stronger than the fear itself. Some people come to me asking about how to deal with fearful situations, and I offer the best advice I can. But one of the advices which I tend not to give when people come with particular issues is the advice that you really should prepare yourself before the fear. You should practice meditation for a few years and really develop your ability to get concentrated and stay calm. So when you come to difficult situations, you come with a skill of being able to turn your attention to your breath, for example, and then develop very quickly, but being with your breath, some ability to stay calm and concentrated, some ability to disengage yourself from the normal preoccupations that the mind gets latched onto. And with that kind of preparation, you can get through a lot of difficulties in life. I was talking to someone about fear recently, and I don't remember exactly who said what, but the basic point was, given that the tradition in Thailand is that we all go off into the forest and face the tigers, should we do the same thing? Should we go find... these bears are coming back in, right? Should we go out and find someplace... I guess they're still down in Monterey, but they're making their way up here. Should we go up and find the black bears and someplace to meditate where the black bears are, or the mountain lions, or now it's wild boar. If you go up on Long Ridge Preserve, and I'm going to sit here until the wild boar come, I'm going to face that boar down. Or, you know, should I go... it used to be, you know, you can go to East Palo Alto, I'm going to go to East Palo Alto and just meditate in the street corner there at midnight. That's going to really face my fears. That's what I should do. And the response of someone with this kind of question was, oh, in America we don't have to do that, because we're just so anxious to begin with. We don't have to go anywhere to meet our fears. We carry them with us everywhere. All we have to do is sit down in the most safe place at all, and go to Spirit Rock, which is one of the safest places in the world. You don't have to lock your doors up there, and the fear comes. But it's certainly important to face our fears, to be wise about fears, and to not run away from them. Though, at times, fears can be quite overwhelming, and part of a wise approach to fear is to know when to back off from them, when not to be engaged in them, when to kind of do something else, if they're going to spiral out of hand and end up in a panic attack or something else. But everyone who does a spiritual practice sooner or later will have to confront their fear or their anxiety. And to hear that maybe will give you some courage, some fortitude, some willingness, then to be interested in your fear. Not to be afraid of the fear, not to recoil from it, not to feel like it shouldn't be there, but rather take it as an opportunity, okay, now I'm going to really get to know my fear well. And just that interest will change your relationship to fear. If suddenly you have a little bit of curiosity or interest, or you see it, oh, it's really important to get to know my fear, and I've never tried to get to know it before, that can actually change your relationship. And that change of relationship can make a world of difference, because a prior relationship to fear is one of avoidance, of running away, of being anxious about the presence of fear, about lashing out, about getting angry. There's all these maladaptive ways that we respond to fear. And you might ask yourselves, you know, what is your most common reaction to the presence of fear, or the potential presence of fear? Are you afraid of it? Do you want to deny it? Do you try to escape it? Some people who stay very busy are really running away from their fear, or other things they're afraid of in their lives. I've been told that there are people who are workaholics, who work all the time, not because they really like to work, but because if they stay at work all day and all night, they don't have to face their fears in some other part of their life, at home, who differ. They don't have to face their difficulties, you know, with their family or something. You know, it's more comfortable to kind of be stressed out at work than it is to face our true fears, our deepest fears. So there's a lot of, we have a lot of relation, we have a lot of attitudes towards our own fear. An important part of learning about fear is to learn what is your attitude towards the presence of your fear. What's your common assumptions, your reactions, your relationship to it? There's a whole range. Fear is a huge subject. It's quite diverse, the different kinds of fear and the causes of fear. But there might be, even though fear is very different, the relationship we have to fear might have certain predominant patterns. It might be one particular way that we tend to usually relate to fear. And to see that relationship is very, very significant. One of the ways I've advised people who have a lot of fear is not to go into the fear directly, but to hang out at the edges of the fear, where it's safe to hang out, and then just look at what is the relationship to the fear. Is there resistance to it? Is there fear of the fear? Is there tension around the fear? Is there pulling away from it? And then they find that it can feel a lot safer to be at the edges of the fear. They don't even have to know what the fear is about. But explore there at the edges of it what the relationship is. And once the relationship has come to terms with that, maybe it's dropped away, then it can be a lot easier to step into the fear itself. Because the fear of fear is often what is most frightening for some people, partly because it's the fear of the unknown. So to study that, to get to know it, to explore it, so that we can develop a willingness to be present for the fear. A willingness to feel it, to be open to it, to be interested in it, to go into the body and feel what is it like in our body? What does it actually feel like to be afraid? Many of us can identify the physical feeling loosely, butterflies in the stomach or contractiveness in some parts of the body. But have you ever really gone into it and pinpointed it? Like you were getting a massage from the most wonderful masseuse in the world, you're really going to want to be paid a lot of money for this massage. And you really want to be present for it and really feel and sense every possible push and rub or whatever. So in the same way, you're really present, savor each sensation of fear and really be there for it and feel it. That kind of willingness is part of mindfulness practice, to bring that level of concentration to it. Because one of the ways to become free is to understand what keeps us from being free. So it's not a matter of just jumping into freedom directly, but understanding all the limitations to it, all the inhibitions, so we have to understand our fear. So the willingness to be there for it is not easy to do that. It's far from easy to do it. But to feel it physically can be a great help because the physical sensations of fear are often not what we're afraid about. And the physical experiences of fear are just sensations. And if we can just feel the sensations in the present moment, then we're less likely to trip out in the thoughts that we're afraid about, the ideas. A lot of fears are fears about something. Anxiety is a fear about imaginary things, but what might happen in the future. Most fear in modern Western culture is not the fear of the mugger who's standing there in the corner with his gun, her gun, but rather the fear of maybe I'll get mugged. Maybe. So then the mind spends a lot of time being anxious about the possibility, which is somewhat imaginary. You might want to take some precautions and not be foolish about it, but how much of our anxieties are really imaginary, and then how much do we live in that imagination? So dropping into the physical body is a way of kind of dropping out of the imagination and being present for what we actually hear, and then learning how to be present for fear rather than recoiling from it or tripping out so quickly. As we feel fear physically in the body, that can give us the opportunity to begin feeling it also a little bit more as an emotion. The emotion of fear, what does that feel like? The feelings of fear, the kind of the various, which are kind of overlapped with the sensations quite a bit. The impulses are connected to fear. The motivations are rising together with fear out of fear. In the Buddhist tradition, fear is often characterized as a variety, as a version of aversion. It's greed, hate and delusion. Greed, aversion and delusion are the three primary poisons of the mind according to Buddhism. Fear is a form of aversion. So it's a kind of an impulse, a desire, it's a kind of a motivation to get something away from you, to push away or run away yourself or something. So part of feeling the emotion is to feel that motivation, that's part of it, in the present moment. There's a very important movement, shift in mindfulness practice that happens when people can see a sensation as just a sensation, when they can see an emotion as just an emotion, when they can see a thought as just a thought. Because we tend to believe and identify so strongly with our thoughts that they have more reality than they actually deserve. We think our thoughts are true, we think our thoughts are who we are, we think our thoughts are kind of believable. As Mark Twain said, I had a lot of problems in my life, most of which never happened. Because our mind has this great ability of creating problems, imaginary problems and thoughts. And to just say, oh, it's just a thought. You know, you're worried about some talk you're going to give in the future, public talk maybe. But it's just a thought, oh, thought, oh, maybe people won't like it. It's just a thought. And to see it as just a thought bubble in the mind is very freeing. If we don't see it as a thought, then we tend to sometimes get pulled into it and believe it, and it's almost as if it's happening in the present moment. The more powerful your imagination, the more it can seem like this is really happening in the present moment, even though it might not happen. One of the great lessons that come from, some lessons in life are only learned through repetition. By going over things enough times, and it kind of slowly goes in. And one of those ones for me was like this, is the fears I had about the future. Slowly I learned that the future didn't work, often didn't end up the way I was afraid it was going to happen. And after a while it dawned on me how much wasted energy I was spending. Worried about things that, you know, if I thought about all the worries I had in the past, about things which never happened, I feel, what a waste of energy. I could have probably powered California through one of the blackouts. But in fact, so slowly it dawned on me, and so I was like, well maybe the fear I have about tomorrow, you know, maybe it's not going to work out that way. Maybe I have it cold and I won't go, or those people won't be there, it's been cancelled, or maybe, you know, something else will happen, or who knows, you know, I never quite know what's going to happen. So I try to be more relaxed now, kind of because of that. So, it's just a thought. To see it is just a thought. Fear, anxiety. What's happening up there? A bird? Well, before you know it will be tigers. Fear is very deeply rooted, I think, in us. I was thinking about this, in thinking about some of the lists people have of the most powerful fears people have. You know, the fear of death is one of very common ones. And some people will trace a lot of fear back to being at the root, kind of fear of death, fear of rejection, a fear of sickness, a fear of losing one's loved ones, a fear of losing one's livelihood. And then there's great fears like that. And then in usually the top five lists, there's the fear of public speaking. And people then kind of laugh and go, wow, you know, it seems kind of non sequitur. But I think it points to that we're very deeply, we're very profoundly social beings. In a lot of very, in our psyche, kind of our very deep senses of ourself and who we are as an individual is very much tied in to our social sense, a social relationship with other people. And there's a kind of a social death that we're afraid of when people reject us and are afraid of us. A horrible story that I was told, I don't know if it's true or not. But the Japanese poet Basho was wandering around Japan on his pilgrimage and he came across some bushes next to a lake or something. And there was a baby, newborn baby crying in the bushes. And it was obvious that the baby had been abandoned there and abandoned there to die. And so he picked up the baby and kind of comforted for a little while, reflected on what to do, and then put the baby back in the bushes and continued on his journey. Now that's a horrible story. For Basho, the way the story goes, his understanding was this baby no longer has parents. He's been severed from social connections. Japanese culture, that in society, is very strongly, Burgess Watts coming in and out, is very strongly, it's a very strong social bond in Japanese culture. Your role and your connection to society is who you are. And if you sever that connection, you're outcast in society. So Basho's feeling was, this person is better off dying than growing up a social outcast. Even if I adopt this person in kind of whatever, this person is always going to be a social outcast. That's why being ordained as a Buddhist monk or nun in Japan is a very, very radical thing to do. I mean, a lot of Westerners, you can get ordained, go to Asia and be ordained as a monk, or even America, be ordained as a monk. And then you can just chuck it all and decide to go back and get an MBA at Stanford or something. And they're waiting the wide doors wide open for you, or whatever. Society doesn't hold that against you. But in Japan, if you step out of the social context that you're supposed to be in, it's very hard to come back in again. So you become a monk or a nun, you've stepped out, you're out. So it's a big decision. So Basho kind of belonged to that culture. And many very, very traditional cultures, tribes and villages, the sense of social bonding is so powerful that to sever that social connection is kind of a death. So our fear of public speaking, I suspect, is very deeply tied to our sense of social self, our relational self, which is very deeply part of who we are. And in that our society has a lot of anxiety about the individual, a lot of ideas of being, what it means to be an individual, individualistic, individualism, about being connected with it. We've kind of lost, many people have lost a sense of community or a traditional sense of community where people are very accepting of each other. And so there's a lot of social anxiety in our culture and lends itself to a fear of rejection, all kinds of very deep anxieties. As we confront fears, we're willing to be present for it. I believe often it leads to greater discomfort before it leads to greater comfort. I think it sometimes leads to a sense of sadness, a sense of fear, a sense of vulnerability, a sense of personal pain. I think sadness, vulnerability. Fear is kind of often kind of agitated, anxiety is kind of an agitated kind of word. Kind of energetic, the more afraid you are, the more energized you are. Some people will use mild fear as a way of energizing them to get through life, to get things done, like writing a term paper at school. You don't really do it until you're up against a deadline and then you're afraid. But also it can be paralyzing for people. I lost my train of thought. Where was I? Sadness is almost the opposite. Sadness is often kind of quieter and calmer, more settled. And sometimes in a deeper place in us. And some people are less willing to be present for their sadness than they are for their fear. But part of fear at times is to be willing to open up to the deeper well springs of sadness, of grief, of loneliness, of isolation, of many things that might be there. And sometimes things like depression at times arise not because depression is primary, because depression is a result of an unwillingness to be present for the deeper things we're afraid of. Deeper for our loneliness, our isolation, our sadness, our grief. So part of it is maybe open up to those deeper layers of what's going on. And then to open up even further, perhaps to a vulnerability, a deep sense of vulnerability, a tenderness inside of us. And finally, I think what the practice can show is, if you go far enough in the mindfulness practice, practice can show how it's possible to be radically at peace, a radical sense of well-being without any with nothing. With nothing. That all the things that we defend, all the things that we take as being threatened, that at a fundamental place, there's nothing in there that can be threatened. It's a little bit of an illusion, perhaps, at the root, at the essence. It's kind of like the word integrity. I thought it was very interesting when I looked it up in the dictionary. I like etymology of words, and sometimes you can give a whole Dharma talks and etymology of the words. And so I thought, integrity, I like that word a lot, so let's look up and see what it means. And I was completely perplexed when I saw the etymology of it. How do I make this into a Dharma talk? Because my dictionary said that integrity meant something like, can't be touched. Can't be touched. And so how does it, you know, great, what's it supposed to do with that? But I think that at the core of who we are, there's something which can't be touched. So when it can't be touched, it can't be threatened. So one of the great opportunities to this practice is to realize in some very deep way how little is at stake. So we can have nothing at stake. The hell do we need? So we all know that as we're growing up, things we're afraid of as teenagers, or as, you know, three-year-olds, you know, we're not afraid of what's in the closet. Most of you are not afraid of what's in the closet anymore. But then you become a teenager, you're afraid of rejection, you're afraid of whatever, you know. And so you're just going to notice your zit. I noticed this morning I had a little zit somewhere here, and I had no fear about what you think of me. Though when I was 14 I did. So there's a whole level of fears which we kind of have nothing at stake anymore in relationship to my zit. The practice, and so as we get older and older, you know, certain things which are very meaningful and very threatening, you know, we have nothing at stake in relationship to that anymore. The practice is supposed to, it teaches us that in a very fundamental, at the root, foundational level of who we are, at the foundation of who we are, we have nothing at stake. There might, other places it might be placed things to where there's things to be, need to be careful with, for example. But if, but at the foundation of who we are, at the foundation of our identity of who we are, there's absolutely, fundamentally, nothing at stake. And if you realize that, it pulls a rug underneath, from underneath, a lot of our fear. So to sit with the fear, understand our relationship to our own fear, to study our fear, get to know it better, get to know it so well you can write your dissertation on fear, and then to go underneath the fear and see what's really there. And if you go far enough down, you'll find that at the very root, you actually have nothing at stake. And then, someone who has nothing at stake is said in the Buddhist tradition to be someone who is fearless. And fearless is one of the descriptions of someone who is fully awakened, they're fearless. But what's most interesting is not simply that they're fearless, but it's said that person then brings into society and to other people the gift of fearlessness. To be fearless is a gift that we give to others. They don't need to be afraid of us, for example. So those are my reflections about fear, and I didn't mean to talk so much. I was afraid it might happen. We use the word a little bit too easily. You know, afraid it might happen was, I wasn't really afraid, I just, I was concerned. So, do I have one or two questions that maybe need to be said to kind of, please? I was just wondering if you had a sense of fear, and what he was saying was to really look at fear, but not my fear. But fear is fear. Yeah, exactly, yeah. To possess fear, to make it, of course it's you, your fear. There's no one else's fear. But when we say my fear, that I am afraid, for example, the difference between being saying, I am afraid, versus saying, there is fear within me. It changes, perhaps, a relationship to that fear. If I am fear, it's kind of a global identification. It's kind of like really big, I am, I'm afraid. My son has a lot of fears, and I was talking to my wife about it yesterday, and I said, he has a lot of fears. He's a very deeply, in some ways, kind of a deeply fearful person at times. And she agreed with me, but she very quickly said, don't ever say that in front of him. Because then he'll take it on as an identity, kind of make it that's who he is. And if you become, that's who I am, there's very little room to move. But if you simply just take it as being, there's fear within, there's fear in the body, then maybe there's a chance of having a lighter, more open relationship to it. When we say it's my fear, there's all these associations and other things that's a magnet for all kinds of other ideas. You know, it's my fear, uh oh, if it's my fear, I'm responsible for it. If it's my fear, I better not let anybody else see it. It's my fear, that means that... So, of course it's your fear, but the mind tends to contract things. So try to shift how you see it in a more open way. There's fear here, there's fear within me. Is that help? Heh heh heh. Are there important things to be said? Because I don't want to leave someone kind of feeling that... Something important was... Yes? I was simply going under a kind of too analytical and annoying approach to practice. For example, you're talking about fear, which I've thought a lot about. It's occurred to me that by the way, I'm going to detach myself from these belief systems that kind of engage with fear. That kind of helps to alleviate it. But at the same time, I'm afraid that I'm too analytical about this. And that maybe I'm not getting enough into the emotional piece. Oh, it's definitely possible, yeah. I mean, I can't evaluate that for you without talking more. It's possible that you're not in the emotions enough because at the analytical level sometimes we just stay always at the same level. And we don't really... So we're kind of moving furniture around in the Titanic kind of, you know. Whereas if you get deeper, you kind of see what's really kind of fueling it. But also, it doesn't have to be just analytical. Even some, you know, doing the work at the emotional level sometimes can just seem like an endless cycle. And some... And you know, samsara in Buddhism means endless cycle. And Buddhist practice is meant as a way of stepping out of whatever endless cycle loops we're stuck in. And so some aspect of practice, at some point in practice, some aspect of it has to take us out of the loop. Rather than engaging with a loop, with the cycles, in a way to try to solve the problem or fix it in some direct way, some aspect of practice has to take us outside the loop. Otherwise it just continues and goes around and around and just changes the characters in the play. So this is a Thai approach to fear where you don't really try to understand the fear, analyze it, or even try to work with the emotions. You just try to develop your concentration on the breath. It's very, very effective. And you might try that. Just try to develop such a strong concentration that maybe radically changes the whole game. Kind of lifts you out of the loop. And once you're out of the loop, you might see the whole thing from a very different perspective. Okay, so we'll see how I do tomorrow night. Thank you very much.
