 I'd like us to do a sitting now which I'll guide that goes through these different categories, some different categories, some more. And then we can do some walking and then come back and do another sitting and have some time for questions. As soon as you sit, try to sit comfortably. Remember that there's no way in the world you can squeeze your mind down tight enough to hold on to the object of meditation and not have your mind wander. It will wander. There's no doubt about it. The real art of the practice happens in the moment you've realized. It's been quite some time since you last said a meta phrase or felt your breath or whatever it is. It's the moment when we practice the gentleness of letting go and some compassion for ourselves, some forgiveness for ourselves and realize that we can begin again. We need to begin again. That's what's really critical. And so if you find yourself lost a lot, it's okay. It's genuinely okay. Practice letting go and coming back. Let your attention settle. See what phrases emerge that are really meaningful for you. It may be a phrase. It may be just a word. And direct that toward yourself, wishing for your happiness, your safety, your well-being. Let your attention gather toward just one phrase. You don't have to worry about trying to create a feeling or making anything special happen. Just gather all your attention behind that one phrase. That's the planting of the seed in the ground. And then the next phrase. And then the next phrase. And then the next phrase. And then the next phrase. And then the next phrase.

Someone you respect, you're inspired by. You're grateful for. If someone like that comes to mind, get an image of them, you can say their name to yourself. Get a feeling for their presence and offer the phrases of loving-kindness to them. If no one comes to mind, it's fine. You can just stay with yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Think of a friend who's enjoying good fortune right now. Success, happiness. They may not be perfectly happy, but in at least one aspect of their life, things are going well. If someone like that comes to mind, bring them here. Offer the phrases of loving-kindness to them. Think of a friend who's having a difficult time right now. Who's afraid or experiencing sorrow or some difficulty. Bring them here. Offer the phrases of loving-kindness to them. You can get an image of them, say their name to yourself. Get a feeling for their presence. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then everybody here. May we live in safety. Be happy. Be healthy. Live with ease. Whatever phrases you've been using. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let's walk for about 20 minutes, and then we'll come back here and do another sitting. So we'll do this last sitting, have a little bit of time for questions, and then I'll be here if any of you are there. If any of you want me to sign books, then we'll go bring this energy out into the world in some way. People often ask about how to do this kind of practice at home if you choose to. And what we usually say is that it's good to begin the sitting with the offering of loving-kindness to yourself and to end it with the extension of loving-kindness to all beings everywhere. And what you do in the middle is really up to you. You may not have time to do yourself in a benefactor and two friends and a neutral person, a difficult person, and all beings and so on. So you would really choose depending on what's happening in your life. But those are kind of the bookends, is the offering of loving-kindness to yourself and the offering of loving-kindness to all beings. And so in each of these sittings, I've been kind of doing a variation of different possibilities of ways you can get from one to the other. And so in this sitting, I'd like to do that as well. The offering of loving-kindness to ourselves, then to somebody we care about a great deal, or a benefactor or a friend, then to a neutral person if you have one. Often we say in a situation like this, you know, maybe there's somebody here that you didn't know before and that you feel neutral toward it rather than judgmental of them, having seen them. So that would work. Or if it's not anybody here, then somebody in your life that does play a role of some kind. Dry cleaner, you know, a checkout person at the supermarket, something like that. And then the next classical category of beings is somebody you find difficult. And here, the principle of doing the practice in the easiest way possible really comes to bear. You're not, one is not encouraged to right off the bat to choose the most difficult person, the person who has hurt you the most in this life, who has behaved so horrifically in the course of history that it's almost unthinkable to have a sense of connection to them. You're meant to start out with somebody you feel a little annoyed with or a little bit of irritation or a little bit of fear, something that has you pull away. Because the purpose of the practice is not to try to force something that isn't real, but to really play with different ways of using our attention and see what happens. It's not that one never faces that challenge, but there are kind of reasonable building blocks to that. And one of those creative extensions is to understand, sometimes even with a mildly difficult person, it's too difficult. And so what we sometimes suggest is placing yourself up there with them in your mind's eye so that you're in effect saying, may we be happy? Because sometimes the difficulty comes from the tendency to defer completely to someone else's needs and to forget about taking care of oneself. And in a reactive fear about that, we just don't want to wish them well. And so to balance that out, sometimes we do that. Or sometimes it's just too hard, and then we say, well, just go back to yourself. It's okay. And so there are lots of ways of working with that edge. So in this setting, I'll just time it in such a way so that we're moving through these different categories. And if you feel like it's too fast and you're not ready to move, it's fine. You can stay with yourself. You can stay with the benefactor, whatever it is that feels right to you. So once again, we'll begin with ourselves. Thank you. . . . . And then somebody who care about a great deal, either a benefactor or a friend, bring them here111 or for the phrases of loving kindness to them. you you you And then a neutral person if you have one that comes to mind you may not know their name But you can get a feeling for their presence and offer the phrases of loving kindness to them you you you you And a mildly difficult person if you have one Bring them here. I've already be here bring them to mind Remember that this is also a time in the practice you can be very creative. Maybe you need to place yourself there with them and Be saying may we be happy The texts say imagine if there's a way that this person could Call out to your heart in a way imagine them as a very young child as an infant vulnerable to conditions Imagine them dying Not of course with glee but with recognition that This is what we share after all the turmoil And the rivalries and the jealousies This is what happens Can we let go of all that and wish someone well You You You You And then everybody here You You You And all beings everywhere They all beings known and unknown near and far Live in safety Be happy Be healthy Live with ease You You You You So do you have any last questions I Stay went by like 10 seconds. Yeah The question was about the cultivation of sympathetic joy There is a specific practice for sympathetic joy The proximate cause is being able to see happiness It's actually being able to perceive happiness and then There are Kind of psychological conditions that make it come much more easily One is being able to rejoice in our own happiness Actually to be in touch with it. It's that sense of inner strength Or inner abundance one is a sense of gratitude or contentment with what we have It's Also helped by Easing the grip of fear You know the sense of deprivation that can also be done through meta practice, you know So all these practices kind of support one another In terms of reading, you know when I wrote loving kindness it has it has chapter on compassion meditation chapter on sympathetic during a chapter on equanimity And you can actually get the practices from From that and often meta is used as a kind of base practice or foundation practice because the others are very similar They're just changes in the wording of the phrases and they're changing Changes in the sequence to try to go along with the idea of doing it in the easiest way possible So if you do meta pretty thoroughly you will be able to then do sympathetic joy quite easily in terms of the practice whether You find it easy to you know, cultivate or not Sometimes it isn't sometimes it isn't mostly it isn't And that's when compassion really comes to mind You know if you also have Confidence and how to do compassion practice and that really is the entree because inevitably, you know, we hear about Somebody's success and there is that feeling of You know as though if they were failing we would be better off You know, but it does it comes up and and to take a moment And I think that's a really good thing You know, but it does it comes up and and to take a moment and to pause and to And to remember okay This person suffers too and to to extend some compassion toward them then the sympathetic joy will come more easily So it's really it's practicing like all of them which will help any one of them Yeah, yeah Yeah Yeah, yeah, the comment was about finding herself in dialogue with a difficult person. I imagine Kind of telling them how they might improve You know, which is usually the case and then realizing that and coming back to the mat and it's very common That's that's really how it goes, you know, we find ourselves Doing one thing or another either chastising them or being angry at them or being angry at ourselves for being angry at them or or You know making recommendations for Their improvement and then we come back and it's that continual movement. That's why what's So important in the practice is that you not feel discouraged, you know as though your mind shouldn't have done that you know because So much of the development of the practice is the development of that ability to start over You know, we're there we're fine reminding our own business. Everything is together and then we're gone You know in one way or another it's just gonna happen that way for everybody, you know, and you realize that and you come back You know, but we can be so critical Toward ourselves, you know and say oh, well, I didn't do it right because my mind did this or that and you know Really we don't have to have to do that I The question was about Kind of the energetic effect of offering love to somebody that you have difficulty with and whether it can actually intensify the difficulty or Make a change and I think actually there's On one level there's no knowing, you know, it's not That's why the giving really needs to be without conditions I Don't think that in the normal course of events If you send love to a difficult person it's going to intensify their negativity I think in maybe The specific case like of a teacher-student relationship where somebody is actually Consciously looking at their own problems in their own situation that Sometimes those very negativities are highlighted in Either through our own practice and the loving relationship with ourself or in the love that we might get from the teacher or the community But that's not a problem You know, it feels like a problem because it's not what we think should be happening, but it's not That we are actually getting worse, you know, so for example with my first teacher a man named go Inca I Because I went to India when I was very young I was just 18 and I wasn't very Psychologically sophisticated. I knew I was suffering a lot and that's why I went But I didn't really know the nature of my mind and everything was shocking You know, it was so disturbing for me to look within and I went up to go Inca at one point in a state of tremendous Accusation and I said I never used to be an angry person before I started meditating Which of course was not true But I had never really seen it before you know, so in one way one could say that the negative energy had gotten stronger and It probably had but that wasn't so bad you know because it was in the intensification of the feeling and the kind of honesty and Clarity with which I was looking that I could see that it was there the delusion was that it was his fault, you know Or that it was it was new which it really wasn't and and that just took some time To me to understand that these were tendencies that were very very strong in me That I had not been aware of you know, so I can imagine in that situation, but I think in the ordinary course of events We don't know what's gonna happen You know and that that's what makes it That's in a way. It's what makes it an act of faith Just to make that offering And yeah I think in a given practice period it's probably a good idea to spend more time on fewer people Just for the sake of your concentration And You'll feel the rhythm that works for you And if you leave somebody out there's always another practice period In the world The question was is there any way of knowing if we are making a difference I think that's a good idea Well, you know the way the practice is taught traditionally like in Burma the primary and fundamental difference which we can know is in terms of Ourselves it's in terms of the field of motivations from which we come and motive in The Buddhist psychology is an extremely important component of an action Because that's where the juice really is you know it's like the very same action like my reaching down and handing somebody this book Could be born of many many different things inside of me You know I could be giving you the book because you have a book I want and I think hey You know I'll give you this book and you'll give me that one or because I'm in front of a room full of people And I want everyone to think I'm really generous because I like you and I want you to have the book or Because I lost a bet with somebody you know and I have to give everyone knows You know all anyone can see externally is someone's hand moving down and moving an object forward But the motivation the intention the heart space giving rise to it. That's where the real energy is That's what distinguishes one giving of a book from another giving of a book and so the practices especially the four brahmins are said to Transform our field of motivation so that if we in general have come from a place of fear Over time in general we will come from a place of love. That's what happens and it does happen I mean that's something we can see but you know you can't see it like every hour. Which is our problem It's like oh well. You know You know how how much have I improved you know it takes time to? To kind of see that flow and then in terms of making a difference for others You know The other way the practice is taught is that it really is an energy That it can make a difference it can Create an environment It can create an environment that isn't dependent on time and space as we know it you know for that impact And as to knowing that that happens you know getting reassurance or getting a comment sometimes it happens But again you know in my experience the freest Thing is to understand the the nature of equanimity because sometimes you know we can be so impatient and we Want our results so quickly and sometimes it's a long time You know people often say well you know You said that thing in 1992 To me you know you said that thing in 1992 and I didn't get it. You know it meant nothing to me And four years later you know I was having surgery and suddenly You know I thought oh look at that You know that makes sense now or something you know there's just there's so many instances like that and so At the same time I I do believe it can make a difference in the world I believe it does make a difference in the world Energetically and in terms of of how people behave, but we can't have that kind of attachment because we'll You know we'll spend our entire lives kind of being impatient and evaluating and feeling distressed and like we failed and you know Life's just a little more mysterious than that so I think we need to stop And I just didn't come up and ask me a question when you're done and then I'll be in the back signing books and I just want to thank you all for coming and Say how happy I am this place exists, and I hope that you Get a lot of benefit from it and are able to come here a lot and practice and and support it so thank you
