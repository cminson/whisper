 In the sense that you notice you have a sheet of paper in front of you which is a little chant. It's one of the many chants that we do in our monasteries. It's a compassion chant. We had a hard time to choose which one. We finally chose a little one, a small one, because we knew we were limited by time. We don't have to do it now. We could do it now, I suppose. That could set you in a good place in yourself to meditate. Let's do it now. Very, very simple. You notice you have dots on words, either below the words or above the words. These are what we call half tones. There is a home note, any musician here? There's a home note which is like, let's say, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. So it's very simple. There are three notes. You can't really go terribly wrong. The dot underneath is the half tone down and the dot above is half tone up. When there are no dots, dots, then it's a home note. What I do with the simplest way to do it, I noticed, is I do it once and then I repeat that with you. You repeat and we do it together. That seems to work quite well. Shall we do that? Okay. May I abide in well-being? May I abide in well-being? In freedom from affliction? In freedom from affliction? In freedom from hostility? In freedom from hostility? In freedom from ill will? In freedom from ill will? In freedom from anxiety? In freedom from anxiety? And may I maintain well-being in myself? May everyone abide in well-being? May everyone abide in well-being? In freedom from hostility? In freedom from hostility? In freedom from ill will? In freedom from anxiety? In freedom from anxiety? And may they maintain well-being in themselves? And may they maintain well-being in themselves? May everyone... Sorry. Hang on. May all beings be released from all suffering? May all beings be released from all suffering? And may they not be parted from the good fortune they have attained? And may they not be parted from the good fortune they have attained? When they act upon intention? When they act upon intention? All beings are the owners of their action? And inherit its results? And inherit its results? Their future is born from subtraction? Their future is born from subtraction? Companion to subtraction? Companion to subtraction? And its results will be their home? And its results will be their home? All actions with intention? All actions with intention? Be they skillful or harmful? Be they skillful or harmful? Of such acts they will be the heirs. Of such acts they will be the heirs. Okay. You get a sense of the attitude you're supposed to have in your practice now. Feelness from the beginning to the end towards yourself, towards others, and towards your body as you practice. So let's sit comfortably and make sure your back is upright and your shoulders are relaxed, your hands are resting on top of the other or just on your knees, whatever is comfortable for you. And spend the next minute or so just checking how your face is feeling. You can even smile. I encourage people to smile a little bit. It doesn't hurt. You don't harm anybody. You won't be integrated. The sense of integrity won't be too shattered. Just have to do it with humor. Even if you feel really grumpy and miserable and depressed and angry and frustrated, you can still have a little smile and just feel fun. And just notice, just relaxing the face has already an effect. It's on your nervous system. Your body is already a little bit different just by smiling. You can spend a whole day just looking miserable, even noticing it. So check between the eyebrows how you're feeling, around the eyes where we hold a lot of tension. Around the mouth, the corner of your mouth, the jaws. The space you're sitting in, remember you're not a kind of entity sort of dropped from the sky here on your own. You're surrounded by a kind of atmosphere. Many people are sitting with you. Just incorporate this in your awareness of the present moment. So you're not alone. You have energy of other people with you. And for the next few minutes, just scan your body. Just slowly sweep your body with awareness, with attention, mindfulness, noticing. Any tension, any tingling, pressure, pain. So you're very sensitive to what's going on now. You're not cut off. You're not trying to push away anything. You're very, very aware of the breath, body breathing. And using this chant we've done at the beginning, just using that reminder. It's like a reminder of the way to approach one's meditation with kindness. Your mind may not be free from anxiety, from ill will, from negativity, from whatever, from affliction, from suffering. But right now you just let your heart really relax. And in this moment, remember there's nothing to contend with except yourself. There's no one around. Everyone is here with a spirit of friendliness and benevolence and kindness, I'm sure. So we can just abide within that spirit of friendliness towards oneself, towards the body as we scan the sensation, as we notice any pain, tension. We can just relax and breathe through it with kindness, with compassion, with friendliness, becoming friendly with everything in ourselves. Even the unfriendly bits, the thing we dislike about ourselves. And our body is often a target for our dislike. We drag it around like an old piece of furniture. So now you give it attention to the life that is manifesting through it. With gentleness, with total acceptance, there's nothing you have to become right now. Just a friendly feeling throughout the heart, generated from the heart, even as I said, to anything that doesn't appear very friendly. Notice maybe you feel some pain and there's an immediate reaction wanting to go away from the pain. You're friendly to that desire to run away from pain. You're friendly towards that feeling, that tendency. You may be worried about something and I've asked you to scan the body and so you feel in a state of conflict. Should I go on worrying or should I scan the body? You're just friendly to that feeling of uncertainty, not knowing, maybe distracted by the concerns of your mind. Letting the attention rest and be wide open. You don't need to worry about what I say, just listen to it, just a sound. If they're useful, it's fine. If they're not useful, just listen to it, just sound. And if they're useful, listen to it, also just like sound. Out, like sound. Using the body to keep resting your mind, calming the mind, bringing steadiness and calm to the mind, to your emotions, your feelings, your moods, your thoughts. The body is a very good friend when you know how to use it properly, not through aerobic only, but also through meditation. Calming the mind, calming the body, letting go of attention, letting go of the desire to get rid of things that we don't like, just acknowledging, giving it space and resting. You gently go from the top of your head down to your feet, as if you had eternity in front of you. There's no rush, even if it is only a five minute period. It's still the sense that you have all the time in the world to do this. No pressure, it's your time. And when you finish scanning the body, you can just rest in the whole experience of breathing. The body breathing, you can focus on the beginning or the end, or the whole experience of breaths, of the breath, breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Maybe focusing on the out-breath and the time of when we shorten our out-breath, we tend to shorten it through tension and being hurried through habits. So notice the out-breath and notice that moment when you want to breathe in before you have really truly let go of the breath. Just notice that. How quickly we want to breathe in before we can breathe out. Now as you are doing this practice, I encourage you to use every sensory impingement, including noise, to be totally part of your practice, otherwise you'll end up neurotic. Because there's plenty of noise around, so notice, you know, part of your breathing is also, your breathing experience is also the sound of the creaking floor, people moving about. It's not an interference in your practice right now, it's part and parcel of your meditation. And you relax, you open yourself to everything. You don't need to push anything, you don't need to get rid of anything, you just completely open and accepting whatever comes into your field of consciousness. Whether it's a car outside, whether it's an even breath, whether it's a pain that comes along as you're breathing in or out, everything is included in our practice of meditation right now. Any thoughts, any mood, any memories, anything that you're aware right now is included in your practice. It's not a hindrance or something extra, it's part of your meditation. So you can begin to relax and be at peace with whatever you're experiencing right now. The sound of a plane, the sound of my voice. Whatever it is, you keep relaxing into the present moment as it is. With the spirit of friendliness, kindness. You can change your posture if you need to, but you do it discreetly and quietly. It's alright to move as long as you are discreet and respectful of others. It's alright to move as long as you are respectful of others. It's alright to move as long as you are respectful of others. It's alright to move as long as you are respectful of others. It's alright to move as long as you are respectful of others. So stretch your legs, relax a little bit. You're going to hear a little chant, a little chant which is a request. In our tradition we can't actually teach unless we're invited to do so. So that keeps our life quite peaceful in a way. We don't get into trouble in other words. Like everybody else, we don't interfere with people's wishes. If they don't want to be here, they can go. Jill and Christy, Jill has been hosting me since I came here. Christy is her daughter who just came down for the weekend. Yesterday we had a major rehearsal, or how to request those talks in Pali. So you'll hear it in Pali. Maybe I'll tell you a little bit of the story behind it. When the Buddha was after his enlightenment, the Buddha realized that he had realized something so profound that he didn't think that the world being so enmeshed in darkness, greed, hatred and delusion would ever understand what he had discovered. So he nearly didn't teach, but from high up in the heavens, God, the god Sahampati, you see you have gods in Buddhism too, many, God Sahampati realized that the Buddha was maybe planning not to share his enlightenment with other beings. As quickly as you can flex and bend a forearm, this is an expression you hear throughout the suttas, when they want to express speed, lightning speed, they say as quickly as you can bend and flex a forearm, Brahma Sahampati, the god Sahampati came and spoke to the Buddha, of course. We don't know how this happened, but anyway he communicated with the Buddha and said, please, please, there are those who have little dust in their eyes, please are out of compassion, please teach them, teach those who have little dust in their eyes. So here we are, we have the teachings thanks to the god Sahampati. So we should be really grateful to him. And this is what Jill and Chrissy are going to request, this little passage that god Sahampati pronounced to the Buddha, in front of the Buddha, has been kept through 2500 years and it's still with us today and it's been used as we're requesting a Dhammatog. So it's, some of you, probably hocus pocus, but it has a real meaning, it's part of our discipline actually that we cannot teach unless we're invited. Well, sometimes I don't have to wait for the palli formula to be chanted to start because I'm in a place where I know I have been invited to say something. But Jill and Chrissy were interested in actually knowing the traditional way of doing it, so this is what they're going to do now. This is very good. So sit down comfortably and use this time to continue to meditate. The emptier your mind will be the better. Remember the story of the, if the glass is full you can't put anything else in it. So if you have too many ideas or expectations or whatever, even however good they are, you might not be able to hear what is being said. So you can just continue this practice of mindfulness as you're hearing. And in fact, the more you're empty, the more I will be able to say, I'm dependent on you really. So we don't prepare our talks, we reflect on what we're going to say, but often it's spontaneous, it comes spontaneously. So I have no idea what I'm going to say, but it rarely fails me. I can for two hours without any problem. So even when I feel I have nothing to say somehow. So today we started this last session with chant on compassion. It's, compassion is very important in the Buddhist tradition. In fact, if you look at the first precepts, among the five precepts that a lay, a lay Buddhist practitioner commits himself or herself to, the first one is to refrain from harming any living beings, which is another way of expressing compassion, not harming, not killing, not committing any act by body, speech and mind that would create suffering for other people. Of course, sometimes we forget ourselves, don't we? We think about not harming maybe the people in Africa or Afghanistan and all. We look around the world and think of all the people we could help and could alleviate, where we could alleviate suffering, where we could perhaps help to release suffering. In other people, in very distant parts of the world, sometimes we have really deep heart opening when we see children on television, perhaps suffering in a famine, a ridden area, or some maybe women who are being abused in certain countries or even in the West. But often we are distracted. We don't actually realise that the one we're suffering most is who, is me, is suffering but not knowing that there is that kind of aching in the heart. That kind of yearning for peace, profound peace. And most of our tools to find peace and some kind of relief from our everyday dissatisfaction or discontent often end up in searching, looking for some more means to alleviate this discontent. And we are part of a society which breeds discontent, actually. Not only breeds it but encourages it. You're supposed to be discontent to continue being a good consumer, don't you? If you were suddenly satisfied with what you've got, society would go bankrupt. So not only it encourages you to look at the pain of discontent, but it encourages you to believe that there is pleasure in being discontent and getting something other than what you've got now. Whether it's a new bed, a new TV, a new partner, or a new house, or a new job, whatever. It's endemic. We have hospitals and research, an incredible amount of research going on to find out how to cure illnesses, how to fight certain microbes, and how to find cures for so many diseases that are part of our everyday life. Yet, the greatest disease, the source of many of our problems, is very little addressed, if you noticed. There is not yet an institution that is really researching deeply into the disease of the mind, the real disease of the mind. Not the disease of the mind of a psychotic or a mind that has gone crazy. But the disease of the mind of an ordinary human being, like you and me, a human being. We think we are okay, don't we? Most of the time we remind her we're fine. As long as we keep buying, we're okay. As long as we keep biting the bait of society's lures, we are recognized as perfectly functioning in society, perfectly functional. It's only when you start looking within your mind, within yourself, or maybe at a time of crisis in your life that suddenly you feel felled by your society, or you feel felled by your schools, or your parents, or your family, or your husband, or your wife, that sense of being let down maybe will suddenly redirect your attention. Instead of keeping one's gaze looking outward, you will perhaps, how you'll be forced to look in a different direction. This is what meditation is addressing, how to direct one's attention properly, skillfully, in the right direction, so that we can really look into that general sense of discontent. If any of you have find those moments of profound peace, profound sense of wholeness, being really one with things, being one with your environment, one in a relationship, one, the sense of being totally at peace, have you ever investigated what this sense of peace is? What is it? What is the result? What is the cause of this sense of peace? What is it that actually brought about that deep profound sense of oneness? Have you ever questioned this? It's often we have stopped seeking, we stop looking for something. When seeking, wanting has stopped in our mind, we are at peace. You can see how far the perfect human being in this materialistic society is from the perfect peaceful being, how far it is from that model, because as a social creature of part of a consumer society, your health is seen in wanting. As long as you want, you are okay, you are healthy. And this is so much with parts of our everyday, it's reinforced constantly in our self, and it's being done so frequently that we don't even have a chance to find some space to question that, to challenge that assumption that if wanting is a way to peace, wanting is a way to happiness. There is something in that wanting which is very energetic, as you notice, if you want something, you feel alive. It pulls you, it leads you somewhere, you feel you are driven by desire. If you don't want anything, there is a kind of dead end feeling. We are not very good at living with not wanting. Most of our energy comes from acting on this wanting, searching, looking, seeking. Very rarely do we find peace without doing this. And so this is a completely new learning for us, to really investigate a completely new realm of values. Because it is true, in that reality, if there is no connection with that deeper dharma and insight into the mind, it is true that unless you want, you will feel alive. I think we can all agree to that. Often, maybe not you in this room, but you could say the rest of the world is being kept alive by this unfulfilled constant feeling, or being unfulfilled at some level. Whether it is in our work, in our family, in our relationships, in our profession, or in ourselves, a sense of being not fulfilled. And how do we cope with that? Just that very simple of not being fulfilled. We think that to cope with this unfulfilled feeling is to find something that is going to fill the gap, fill the hole, fill the abyss, maybe an abyss in front of us. The sense of being unfulfilled is so huge that it seems like a gaping, bottomless pit hole. And so we go about, most of the time in our life, trying to feel this sense of emptiness. Because again, this feeling of desire and wanting goes hand in hand with this assumption that I am a person, a real person, a real me, who is always wanting something. And this assumption is rarely again investigated to see whether there is any foundation, any reality in this view, view of myself and others. So as long as we consider ourselves as, view ourselves as a personality only, as this conditioned mind and body, as my thoughts, as my feelings, as what I consider very personal, very much mine, we feel separate from the world, we feel separate from each other. We are in a way, we are experiencing our limitations, the limitations of mind and body. Mind and body always give you the impression that you are separate. This body is separate from this body and this body is separate from the body behind and Jill is separate from Kristi. She is not in the same body. So they give you this impression that you are separate. I think physically we can easily see this clearly, are we? We are all sitting next to each other, separate in our little separate pile of candas called body candas, means heap, for those who are not familiar with the Buddhist teaching. Heap. And that's how the Buddha defines a human being. It's a heap of form and matter. And then it's a little heap of feelings and sensations and then the little heap of perceptions and memories and the heap of mental constructs, thoughts. And then another heap called consciousness, the sixth sense consciousness. And consciousness has six sense doors, there is a platform of consciousness that has six ways of connecting to the sensory world, the eyes, the nose, body, tongue and a mind. Interestingly enough, the mind is a sense in Buddhism, which is an extraordinary step, isn't it? To suddenly see that mental consciousness or mind consciousness is only a sense experience. It's not a soul, it's not something everlasting. It's another sense. And perhaps this is where we have the chance to experience the greatest freedom, because what is most binding for us is really the world that we have created through our thoughts, perceptions, feelings, sensations. And in the Buddha says something which we can all relate to, feeling, perception and consciousness are totally conjoined, they're not separated, because separate them. When one appears, the other appears. You don't have consciousness without feeling, without perception. So all this is our world, feeling, perception and sensory consciousness. They're all sort of playing on each other and building what we call the world, our world. The world I see, that the world that is the sort of screen, that screen, what I see outside externally. So often we have the Buddha said, unless you awaken to your world, then you will never be free. You'll never be able to go out of the limitations of your conditioned mind. You will never be able to really go beyond that. And there's nothing wrong with not wanting to go beyond that, but it's that edge of discontent that we all experience is a bad thing, it's not an unhealthy feeling, it's a very healthy one when it's seen from the perspective of Dhamma. When you suddenly see that that moment of discontent is actually just a sentence of your heart yearning for freedom. Now, whenever you feel discontent, instead of saying, oh my God, what has happened to me, it's terrible. I'm completely wrecked, I'm just, you know, a mess. I need to go to the therapist quickly. I need to do something. I need to get something. I need to... I need. Instead of that, you can actually stay at home and realize that that moment of discontent is just a wonderful thing. It's just a moment of showing you your limitations. It's showing you the moment where there is... you're hitting the walls, so to speak, of your conditioned world. And something in you doesn't want to go beyond that, and that's discontent at some level. The shadows of discontent, it's like at some level, the discontent will create another wall. It will create another desire for you to get out of it, okay? So you have a choice. Either you can create another wall or thicken the wall. Just thicken them a bit. You know, the more you act on your desire, the more it will thicken the walls of your conditioned self. Or you can let it go, and that you are thinning the walls. So the more you let go, the more you, in a way, you're kind of hacking away at that kind of hard self that we have to live with so often. So letting go is not just a nice metaphor for, you know, a practical metaphor for freedom and bliss and, you know, whatever it is. It's a very practical thing. It's really saying to you, whenever you let go, you are freeing yourself. Whenever you are not clinging, holding, acting on that energy of desire, which is restless, isn't it? It's so restless. Notice whenever you want something. You know, the Buddha did not say you should not have any desire. It never said you should kill your desires. It never taught that you should start with being totally free from desires. The reason why he taught is because we had that we are living with that energy, that restless energy of wanting all the time, and we don't know how to fulfill it. So out of compassion, he taught a particular teaching that is allowing us to investigate our realm of reality, what we consider real and which might not be so solid and so real. So just to come back to, you know, what we think we are, to come back to the assumption that we are a permanent conditioned entity that will just be repeating its own action again and again for eternity without any, you know, without any break, without, you know, relief from that. He taught a path of investigation, you know. But this investigation, this faculty to investigate the realm of our mind and body cannot really take place very deeply unless we have already a certain amount of comfort in ourselves, certain amount of peace, a certain amount of ease, you know, unless you wouldn't be able to sit for very long here if there was already not a certain degree of peace within yourself. You know, ask somebody who is, you know, a criminal full of remorse and regret and really, you know, maybe a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of ill will in the heart, maybe, you know, to sit for more than five minutes. They can't. Or somebody who has maybe unfortunately had a life, you know, created a lot of unskillful karma, unskillful activity in their life which has filled them with a lot of remorse and regret. They have a very hard time to sit with themselves. This is a result, this is the result, the karmic result, you could say, of a life which hasn't been investigated properly so you can, so as to know for yourself from your own experience, you can know what is truly helpful and useful and a source of happiness, a cause for happiness in your life or a cause for misery. Pretty simple, isn't it? Now to go back to the, you know, certainly a foundation for investigation is the ability to be still for a while. The mind is often compared to a pond or a lake, you know, and if the lake is constantly stirred up, constantly agitated by whatever elements, whether it's wind or whether it's boats crossing it or whether it's people passing it, or paddling in it or whatever it is, when it is stirred up, whatever is at the bottom or just the amount of waves it creates, it's very difficult to see, very deeply. You can't actually go and look at the bottom of the sea unless it's quiet and still. So in the same way the mind is compared to, it can be an agitated lake or it can be a still one. And one of the conditions to be able to investigate at first, to really start one's investigation, is to be able to sit still, to be quiet, to be still, to listen. So this is the first step in meditation, is that to learn, to quiet down. Unless you do this, you will always be in an agitated state, unable to see what's what. You won't be able to see truly how you're feeling, how you are affected by things, how you are affecting other people, how your habits, whether they are bringing you happiness or not, whether they are really leading you to being content or not. So when we have established in our meditation, the way we calm the mind down is just focusing, just bringing one's attention on an object which is calming. Sometimes you can just meditate on something very unpersonal, like a candle. Just focus your attention, you don't need to concentrate heavily on the candle. And it can be the breath. You don't need to focus heavily on the breath either, just feeling the rhythm of your breathing. In your everyday lives, that doesn't cost a lot of money, does it? It's pretty inexpensive and available. So you have no excuse really. I have seen no justification for not learning how to calm your mind down so you can see more clearly. There is no clarity of mind as long as there is agitation, turbulence, stormy seas within yourselves. As long as you have that kind of mind, you will never see anything clearly. You will never be able to come to the point of deeper insight when the mind is truly transformed for good. It's not just a thought, it's something you carry around. You have to go back into the books to actually look at them and verify whether this is right or wrong. The point of insight is when you actually know beyond doubt what is truly skillful and not. And it doesn't mean that you don't fail. It doesn't mean the habits don't take over. And you go back right into the same old rut. But that is exactly why we have a Buddhist teaching, is actually to get us out of the ruts. When everything goes well, we can dispense with the teaching. But of course, often we do, even when they don't go well. We are so confident in ourselves in thinking that we've got it now, that we can easily forget and be forgetful of what is going on. And what of the medicine that we need to take daily. Because the Buddhist teaching is a medicine, it's a medication. The Buddha was often compared to a physician, a physician of the mind, of the heart. So, investigation to go back to this, what I was talking about earlier, is how do we do this? First of all, as I said, it requires a degree of peacefulness and quiet. Eventually, if you get better at it, you don't need a physical skillfulness. You don't need to have special conditions. Anything will be fine. Any condition will be fine in the middle of the most outrageous situation. You can find the stillness there, the still point. The eyes of the storm, there still. But at first, and we tend to be arrogant and conceited, have you noticed? We think we only need the ultimate teaching. We don't need the practice. That's for really the beginners, not me. But I can assure you, I have been practicing for many, many years, and I'm really glad to keep considering myself as complete beginners. Because as far as my ego goes, it doesn't know a thing. It's always the beginners. I'm always sitting at the beginners' feet. It doesn't know anything. So, this is why practices are important. Because we tend to think, oh, I don't need to practice, because I've done this before. I've done this for ten years. Yes, maybe that's true. But what have you learned from it? Are you more at peace? Is your heart more content? Are you still angry? Are you still frightened? Are you still greedy? Are you still lustful things? Are you still jealous, envious? Well, it means there's a little bit more work to do then. That is the case. You're not finished. Not the end of the path. So, as you investigate, you notice that the Buddha has always, as part of this path of peacefulness, the Buddha has encouraged his disciples to follow certain guidelines, which some of you probably hate to be confined to these guidelines. And it's ethical guidelines. He talks about the five precepts, which is sometimes a talk in itself. But just in brief, as I said before on Monday, I was saying that at the heart of the precept, the lifeline, the precept, it's really compassion, not harming. Not harming yourself, not harming your body, not harming your mind, not harming others. It's harmlessness. So, if you can't bear the idea of not stealing, not lying, not behaving, not acting on sexual misconduct, not taking drugs and intoxicants, if you can't bear having those guidelines, that's too much to bear really. That's too tight, maybe, for most of you. Maybe that's just too much. At least you can reflect, how can I be compassionate? Am I compassionate right now? Am I respectful of this person? Am I respectful of myself? Do I have really a kindness towards myself? When I'm saying this, do I really hurt myself or not? Do I hurt other people? You can reflect. This is the investigation part. This investigation can be done through thinking, wisely reflecting. There's a term for this in Paris called Uniso Manasikara, and that's part of many of our painful mental state, whether it's greed, whether it's anger, whether it's restlessness and worry, are the result of the absence of Uniso Manasikara. Uniso Manasikara becomes Ah, Uniso Manasikara. Not wisely reflecting. In the Abhidhamma, in the Buddhist psychology, some of these states of mind, such as restlessness, worry, anxiety and so on, are the result, they say it's caused by this lack of wise reflection. But you could say really, in terms of experience in practicality, everything is a result of unskillful reflection. And this investigation can also be done just in your everyday life, just looking at the six senses. You're just looking at something, and notice what it brings into you. It brings wanting, not wanting, pleasure, pain, that it brings up tension, anger, frustration. You can see the door is open to this mega field of questioning, investigation. And not just investigation, but discovery. It's a path of discovery. And it's so wonderful, because in a way, most of us have never been told this, haven't you? Have you? Never been told how to look at something, at a flower or person or whatever, and to see how we are affected by this, mindfully in the space of stillness. And the Buddha doesn't say, you should be, when you look at this, you should feel good, if you feel bad, then it's really not good practice. He doesn't say, you should understand everything straight away, you should have full clarity straight away, you should not want it, you should have no desire whatsoever for what you, if you want something, you should really not want that at all. He doesn't say that. The teaching doesn't, is not discriminative or judgmental in that way. He just says, watch, observe how you're affected. So you are put in the seat of complete responsibility for yourself. You are responsible for yourself. Nobody is. And sometimes we feel intimidated by other people. We want to look good, don't we? But the idea of the goal of practice is not to look good. It's to understand what is good and what isn't. And sometimes you have to look really silly to understand what is silliness. You have to look greedy. Don't be frightened by your greed or by your nonsensical mind. And you don't have to be anything, you don't have to become anything to investigate this mind. You can just use what you've got. So in a monastic tradition, when you have a lot of limitation, a lot of constraint, a lot of restraint, then desire has very few doorways really to get fulfilled. Which is a very amazing experience because then you really know the intensity of desires. You have no doubt that the energy of desires is pretty blinding. Most of us, we are in that energy day all day, all night. We don't notice that energy of desire. But when you let go, when you're not really acting on certain habits, for example, ooh, there's a roaring tiger in us that will just pressurize you to the point where you have to act. And in our monastic tradition, monastic training, we learn to really befriend this tiger. Don't think monastic are just sitting peacefully on a cushion, blissed out. In nibbani kind of stays. No, we're just dealing with a tiger all day long at night, the roaring lion inside. You know. Don't think we get away from anything. No, we're not earning our money, but we have plenty of time to deal with that tiger that is always asking you to earn more money. You know, to that tiger that is always saying, no, no, no, this is not good enough. I need more, I need more, I need more. I want more. Even when you have a multi-millionaire guy, you're women, still wants more. I've met plenty of those. Even as a nun, I meet plenty of people, extremely wealthy. They're still miserable. Totally miserable. Still thinks, you know, they're just worrying about their money now. A terrible thing, isn't it? So in your everyday life, you can investigate. Just, you know, the standard of the precept, the five precepts, is also not a field of domination, trying to impose themselves on you and trying to kind of straighten you out. You know, turning you into this good guy that's going to be pleasing for everybody, loved by everybody. No, it's a field of investigation. When I say this, am I content? Am I happy or not? When I acted like that, when I lied, what is the result, you know? When I take things that are not given to me, when I steal things, when I steal other people's belongings, we don't have to go to court to that, but there's plenty of stealing going on in the house, is there not? You know, going to people's room, rummage around their little kind of private corners and so on. That's stealing, taking what is not given. How does that feel? Do I feel good? Do I feel at peace with myself? When I take drugs just to annihilate myself because I just can't bear the reality of life anymore, does it feel good? When I just can't cope being actually myself, when I can't accept myself as I am, when I can't actually conjure up in myself enough compassion to be with this totally unsatisfactory being that is me. I'm sure this is not an experience that's common, is it? Seeing oneself as constantly unsatisfactory. Even when people go out of the greatest university, out of the greatest establishment, still they are not good as the first one that went out of the same establishment. You can see how this kind of life just breeds, an awakened life breeds discontent. It's a factory, it's a kind of discontent factory. Unawakened living is a factory of discontent, constantly reminding you that you need something different. Yes, you do, indeed you do. You need to awaken. But you don't never get the message from the awakened life, unawakened life. So one should be considered, one should be very lucky, very fortunate to be here and to have realized that maybe the Dharma is necessary in one's life to not bring further discontent or further state of unawakened state, but to awaken to that possibility of change, to that possibility of transformation. And that possibility of being fully alive with ourselves. Isn't it wonderful that you don't need to be different, you can just actually come to a place of peace and aliveness and transformation and love and compassion and confidence and trust by just being content with yourselves. Isn't it wonderful to realize that you are totally perfect and you just are the perfect material for your field of investigation. You don't need to be anymore, you know, somebody else, whoever you can conjure up in your mind, who you want to be right now. Think of somebody you want to be right now, you'd rather be right now than yourself. Think of it for a second, close your eyes and think of it. Think of somebody you've been wanting to be for so long, even if it's a super nancy or... And drop that and realize that you don't need to be that person, you can just be yourselves. Isn't it hard to come to that point? That old Jo is fine, old Harry is fine, old Mary is okay, she has everything she needs to be enlightened. So, look at your practice as a field of experimentation. And we are lazy, aren't we? We just desire so much more fun. When you desire an ice cream, or you know, a woman or a man, it's so much more fun. You get this juice, you know, the energy is kind of rising up and you feel great. But to rise, to arouse this kind of energy, you know, for enlightenment, that's another story. You know, to be awake, this is not easy, is it? In fact, you know, in one of the Dhammapada verses, I think, it says, practice is like fighting a thousand men a thousand times over. So don't imagine that you are dealing with a little teddy bear there. You know, it's not a teddy bear, or a little doll, you know, or a little sweetie inside. You're dealing with a roaring tiger who is going to pressurize you into being totally ignorant, very often. So, and don't think monks and nuns have it at all. We just, you know, just always fight, you know, not fighting. But it is. If you go to the entire, they'll say, fight the kilesa, you know, fight the defamements. Fight, because the Thai people are so sensual and lazy, and so happy go lucky type, you know. Nothing is a problem for Thai people. You say, oh, yeah. For us, if you say fight, it's just completely counteractive. We have to use the word open and relax and receive and be kind and be, you know, because we're so much in kind of fighting mode all the time. So you have to keep reminding yourself, you know, practice to relax, to open, to be compassionate, to be kind, to be, you're okay. I'm okay. You're okay. You're okay. You know, so you have all these pressurize of books kind of coming out being published about being okay in different forms and names and ideas and so on. Because feeling okay with myself is a beginning. Unless you feel okay, that means peace. Unless you're at peace with yourself, you can't begin because you're still kind of struggling, fighting, shaping, reshaping, renaming, relabeling, you know, pushing to the side, pushing to the left, trying to lift, stretch and lift and whatever, you know, reshape in some way or other. Reshape your thoughts, reshape your feeling, reshape your body, reshape your hair, reshape your breasts, reshape your buttocks. With all these kind of, you know, all sorts of strategies we have. Strategies. Strategies. Is that the word also? And strategies we have to keep this wanting going. So I really encourage you to see your practice as a very alive thing. It's not just kind of getting dead on one's cushion. Like Adjensha said, hands can still sit on their buttocks all day long at night and they don't get enlightened. Hands do that. We're not like hands, are we? We have a bit more, we've been more going for us, you know, we're not here to see kind of suppressive things. Especially in your daily life, you can do much of that, you know, concentration practice, deep concentration practice, you know, and sometimes you don't do deep concentration practice but there's a tendency to want to shut down everything, you know. I hear somebody in the room, there's a little background sound and I heard somebody in the room once here when I was here, a background sound which I hardly noticed it, it doesn't bother me, just like, you know, my breast doesn't bother me, you know. My body doesn't bother me. I feel the googling and the sound, whatever it is, you know, I'm not trying to switch the knobs, you know, switch off. And I remember this person saying, you know, at some point the sound went off and we'd been in meditation for quite some time and this person, the noise is gone. And it really kind of showed to me, it showed me that people are still very much wanting to control and push their meditation mats. You know, you're there with the mind is going out there, you know, I wish, you know, they will turn the sound down, nobody will make any noise, I will stop breathing, I will stop thinking, I will stop feeling and everything will be okay. Once I shut down everything then I can really start meditating. This is why a lot of the time we do. So don't be so stupid to think that you have to stop desire, to reinvestigate desire, to stop life, to investigate life and to stop being who you are, to start being who you are. You know, that's, we're going to this kind of really funny mood, but we're not even humorous about it. A lot of the time we get very serious, you know. So I leave you on this. May you be filled with compassion for yourselves, for other people and for all the little monsters that are totally and compassionate and completely bent on making you miserable. You have lots of compassion for those because they're just blind. If they knew any better, they will be, you know, much more keen to make you happy. But sometimes they make you happy too, so watch out for those.
