So, hi everybody. Welcome to Happy Hour. It's nice to be back. Nice to see some familiar faces.
And today I'm going to continue a kind of little three-part series I've been doing on the beneficial potential of META, loving kindness meditation.
And I guess I'm going to start just by saying there's a number of stories in the early Buddhist teachings about, and the myths actually, the commentary is about how META can either keep good relationships, keep a sense of social harmony,
or even shift relationships from hostile or fear-based to friendly and harmonious.
So, these relationships can be between people, between people and animals, in the myths there's sometimes between people and embodied natural forces in the world.
But there's several examples, like the Buddha, for example, has an enraged elephant, drunk enraged elephant charge him and stops him with the power of his META.
And there are stories of he and others in the ancient teachings who thwart or stop assailants intending to harm them just based on the power of their kindness.
So, it happens a fair amount and then there's also these stories of sort of beautifully harmonious sanghas or groups of monastics living together, based on practicing META for each other.
And Buddhism loves to distill this kind of thing down to lists, right? It was an oral tradition early, so lists are easy to remember.
And the first three principles of cordiality of the six principles of concord that's called actually are practicing META,
practicing META in private and in public for oneself and for others through spot, through speech, through action.
So, it's fairly highly thought of that and ethics are sort of run through a lot of the commentary about community and relationships harmony.
And studies, scientific studies in the last couple of decades suggest that the science can back this up.
And to be clear, there's only a little handful of studies really at this point about loving kindness meditation and compassion meditation, compared to the many, many hundreds about mindfulness.
And they suggest positive effects on how we relate to relationships.
And that includes a greater sense of social satisfaction, connection, and kind of safety in relationships.
And includes a greater resilience to rejection, for example, and more of a willingness to connect less interpersonal reactivity.
It's pretty powerful. I'm going to put drop the citations for these in the chat when we're done. So I don't have to worry about them now, but just to give an overall sense.
Perhaps, this is not so surprising, right? As Nikki talked about earlier this week, we're integrally interdependent we enter are always impacting each other.
From the perspective of neuroscience neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett talks about how the best thing for a human nervous system is another human being.
And the worst thing too, but the best thing for another human being is a human nervous system.
Another human that we can come into synchrony when there's kindness and compassion there that it has a palpable effect on our entire system.
And one of the beautiful things about this is that relating that relationship extends to ourselves, this body mind.
And we can offer that same to that same resonance within.
So I don't know if I have much more to say about this other than another correlate between the suit as the ancient teachings and the science is this sense of a decreased fear or anxiety.
And specifically, especially folks who participate in self compassion or compassion practice, both the formal practice and the actually helping others notice a decreased fear of being with suffering.
More of an ability to take in compassion and to receive the benefits of something called compassion satisfaction, which is this sense of joy, meaning goodness that kind of saturates the field of awareness, even when meeting great suffering.
It's why I can do what I do as a chapter. Actually, that compassion satisfaction.
So most of all, this practice helps us become peaceful in ourselves, open, settled heart.
So with that, we'll do some practice.
For the moment, friends, I'm going to not allow people to unmute just in case people come in late and are accidentally unmuted and scratchy and noisy.
And the invitation for you to is to turn off or silence any alerts, beeping, buzzing, vibrating, anything like that, and allow yourself to just be in this sun god for this little while.
So, starting by settling back into your body into this moment, softening your eyes, maybe closing them.
Just noticing what's present in this body, this heart, this mind.
Starting to notice the sensations, the attitudes or energies that came along with you, as you logged on.
And perhaps either actually physically or in your heart and mind, imagine or actually give yourself a hug for a minute, or maybe an imaginary or real smile.
Just settling in.
Sense of friendliness.
And setting the Aditana, the intention to cultivate goodwill, to nourish that intention of Mehta.
Noticing the posture of the body.
Checking in with the internal posture of the heart and mind.
And allowing the heart to settle. To settle in the body.
Perhaps on the rhythm of breathing.
Or hearing sensation.
Grounding in the body.
Settling.
And allowing the internal gaze and the sensations of breath to be kind, soft.
Perhaps allowing.
Hearing.
Listening deeply.
Beneath any surface level chatter or thoughts.
To the music underneath.
Notifying any feelings, emotions, just to be.
And fade to the periphery.
To offer attention to this moment.
Perhaps on the outbreath.
Or even just what's here on the inbreath.
And now calling to mind.
A person or being who is endearing.
Easy to like or love.
Someone who brings a smile.
To your lips, to your heart.
Simple as a fluffy animal.
Or a person.
Even a revered figure.
Noticing any sense of warmth.
To call them to mind.
Perhaps there's an image of them or a felt sense of them being nearby.
Or even just a concept or name.
Offering on the outbreath.
A sense of friendliness, goodwill, kindness.
Perhaps imagining them receiving it.
Receiving how it feels to offer this loving kind expression.
A sense of warmth.
Perhaps allowing the intentions of Mecca to radiate through your body towards them.
Receiving now and then.
How it feels to be offering kindness.
Perhaps on the inbreath.
Or between breaths.
If it's helpful.
Using the word or phrase to focus your intentions.
We'll offer a few here.
You have phrases or words you'd like to use.
Feel free to use them instead.
And silent energy, intention is also a beautiful practice.
Be happy.
Be healthy.
Be safe.
Be peaceful.
Be useful.
Be free.
Be silent with words and writing a rhythm of offering Mecca.
Be free.
Be free.
Be free.
