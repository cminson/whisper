 So, good morning everyone. And I hope you can all hear me well. I'll try to keep my voice at about this level. If this is good, can everyone hear it? Okay. I'll try to keep talking up as I go on to the talk. I sometimes get concentrated and the voice wants to drop. I would like to explore today this subject, the relationship between Buddha nature and human nature. And I think that anyone who keeps going down this path finds this a subject of interest. What is Buddha nature? I know certainly when I first started doing Buddhist meditation practices, that was a term that kind of piqued my curiosity and also confounded me. That, well, what is that? Is that outside there or something? And what does that have to do with me and my life? And in the past couple of years, I've reflected on this even in a more, it's just come up for me in a more natural way and also in a more systematic way. And that's because in these last two years, we're living in a time where there are many dramatic and violent human actions that seem hard to understand and perhaps put together with, well, what is this Buddha nature, human nature? There are many leaders around the world, political leaders, including our own, and also religious leaders that are telling us that what we have to pay attention to and what's really important, a strong, deep part of us, of our nature is to be at war. I think this comes up when great fear arises in us and it becomes difficult to see and to sort out what our true nature is. Of course, Buddhist teaching says the opposite, in other words, that our nature doesn't need to be at constant war. I'd like to quote from a translation of the Dhammapada, which is one of the earliest collections of the sayings of the Buddha and one of the most pithy and poetic in a way. Of course, there are volumes of Buddhist teachings, but the Dhammapada, in a sense, it would be the one small book if one had to take one with a book to a desert island that one would need to come to some understandings of the Buddhist teachings. This is from Thomas Byram's translations and these quotations, these verses are from the very first verse, which he translates as choices. Only love dispels hate. This is the law, ancient and inexhaustible. See the faults as faults, the true as true. Look into your own heart and follow your nature. Give up the old ways, passion, enmity, and folly. Know the truth and find peace. Share the way. And it's not only people who follow the Buddha's way, who see human nature in this way. There are many people throughout human history who see a very different view than the one of the 17th century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, that our lives are short, brutish, and nasty. And I'd like to also read something now from Stephen Jay Gould, who unfortunately died this past year. You may know him, he's a prolific scientific writer and writer in general fields. He wrote a lot about baseball too. He's one of these incredible people who had many interests and much energy and really a wonderful writer, even for those of us who aren't really scientifically minded but like to read in that area. He was very accessible. He worked at Harvard as a zoologist and paleontologist. He lived in New York and wrote this following piece shortly the week after 9-1-1. He worked in the volunteer brigades bringing food to the rescue workers and the firemen at ground zero after 9-1-1. And he wrote, we often assume societies are made of decent and depraved people in equal numbers, but we need to expose that fallacy so that in this moment of crisis we may reaffirm and celebrate an essential truth that's too easily forgotten and regain some crucial comfort too readily for gone. Good and kind people outnumber all others by thousands to one. The tragedy of human history lies in the enormous potential for destruction in rare acts of evil, not in the high frequency of evil people. Complex systems can only be built step by step whereas destruction requires but an instant. Thus in what I like to call the great asymmetry, every spectacular incident of evil will be balanced by 10,000 acts of kindness too often unnoted and invisible as the ordinary effects of a vast majority. So this view of our human nature is that our ordinary state is one of kindness, benevolence, goodwill toward others. And that is a view that's consonant with the Buddhist teachings. In one way we could look at a broad overview of what the Buddha taught as an experiential learning about our human nature. And this is an integrative learning, one that unifies our body, mind and spirit through a truly remarkable set of participatory guideposts and instructions. And the main guideposts are the four ennobling truths. I heard Stephen Batchelor give a lecture on this subject of what he called the four ennobling truths and he chose that word rather than using the more common translation of the four noble truths and talked about that in a way that was very convincing to me and also very encouraging. And one of his reasons for calling these truths the ennobling using the ing, the gerund form, was that the Pali language itself, that's the way that it's structured. So it always has this active verb form dimension around nouns and adjectives. And also because it helps us recall and remember that these are participatory truths, that these are ones we engage in and with and live. They're not something we just read or listen to and can file in the memory banks. Although hopefully we will so we have them to call up for us in those moments when we really need them and find them of great use. And there are key instructions that are derived from these truths that really show us and point the way that we can get to know our human nature and see how that relates to our Buddha nature. And these are the foundations of mindfulness and the teachings on loving kindness and the other Brahma Viharas, compassion, generous joy and equanimity. Of course there are many, many teachings, meditation techniques in the Buddhist, in all the Buddhist traditions. But the one I'd particularly like to bring in today in exploring this relationship of our nature are the teachings around awareness. So these teachings depend on each of us as individuals to inquire what is this. And they are also, it's well worth remembering, accessible to us and it's said very clearly that they're accessible to everyone that's a human being. And they do call for us to engage with our whole being, our curiosity, our attention, concentration and our patience and perseverance. To find out who we are, what is this life. And all these teachings hinge on a central fact of our human nature and that is awareness. You know it's really quite remarkable our awareness of our awareness is particularly what defines us as humans. We know that we know in ways that other creatures don't. We have the capacity to share our knowledge through language in a way that's much more complete and far-reaching than other creatures do. We also have the capacity to, this is in a sense part of language, a capacity to externalize our awareness and our knowledge. And so I think this is both the good news and the bad news. The Buddha said everything we need for complete freedom we find in this body. So we have all the equipment necessary to understand our whole nature. The five body sense doors and the mind sense door is all we need. That's the good news part. The difficult part is that the way we're constructed and put together as human beings, it looks like and feels like we're split apart. We have this kind of inbuilt duality to us and that makes it difficult to see a wholeness of our nature. The way our minds and bodies are constructed we can externalize the existential events that go on within us and that we see the events that go on outside us so that these events which are really processes look like fixed things. And this is what is the ordinary lens of our awareness. And what the Buddha's teachings point us to are the more powerful lenses we have so that we can access both broader and deeper views of our lives. In a metaphorical way of speaking we can tune into and turn both the microscope and the microscope that are also part of our awareness. And the way that we do this is through meditative practices, particularly practices of mindfulness and awareness themselves. So I'd like to give an illustration from the teachings, some of the central part of the teachings of the Four Noble Ennobling Truths. You may know of the marks of being, suffering which is called dukkha, impermanence and anicha are two of these marks and they're fairly easy to bring into a coarse focus with our ordinary awareness. But the third mark of being, mark of existence, impersonality or no self is hard to see and hard to comprehend. When we haven't activated the subtler and more powerful lenses it really looks quite counterintuitive to think that we have no self, to be aware that we have no self. I mean it looks like a self, it walks like a self, it talks like a self. But when we slow and stop and sit and still then we can see from the inside of our being that we just like everything else that we can also apprehend through this kind of awareness doesn't exist in a fixed way. Though I'm Caroline and completely unique as Caroline, as every other human being is completely unique and every other thing that exists actually, there's no me that I can point to that exists independent of these causes and conditions of my whole past. Everything that's brought me to this moment, speaking here now, drinking this sip of water and everything that will bring me to the next moment. The Dalai Lama describes no self as interdependence. That suggests to me that we don't have a standalone self, that we cannot in fact exist without everything else. And this isn't a linguistic trick, but something that each of us can understand directly through our faculties of awareness and particularly those subtle awarenesses that are innate in our mind body that we can tune into through our practice. And also when we become aware of the more subtle aspects of impermanence, you know the course aspects that we all understand easily is impermanence. We see our children grow and develop and we see ourselves age, our parents pass on, we see many things change in our circumstances and that's all fairly obvious to us. But when we become aware through our meditative practices of more subtle aspects, we can actually sense that our material being does only exist in a provisional way. And likewise with our suffering, we all know suffering on a kind of an obvious level without having to undertake any sitting down and looking at things through meditation. We know when things feel unpleasant and pleasant, we know the suffering that we feel in our hearts when those close to us and even in the world when terrible things happen. But when we tune into the finer lens of suffering, we become aware of how and when suffering comes about for us in the moment. You know and we can even stop beating our heads against the wall then when we become aware of this. When we really see how the suffering arises, how it comes into being, we can see how to let go of it, how not to, how it's actually not the deepest part of our nature. And I don't want to go on too long with this lens of metaphor because our awareness is not only seeing but it's also a much more profound and global way of knowing. We have hand awareness and ear awareness and many, many more, most of which we have little conscious control over such as gliver awareness and gallbladder awareness. Each component constituent of us as human beings is aware in a way that we usually just take for granted. And also our awareness which we usually think of as centered in our minds and about our ideas isn't just about our ideas, although awareness definitely includes those. It's much larger than simply ideas and in fact our ideas can get in the way of awareness. Ideas are representations of reality, concepts. Of course they're necessary and useful, extremely and powerful. They become problematic because we construct them so that the ideas are very often far removed from an accurate representation of reality, what's actually occurring in the moment. And this is exactly what Buddhist meditation practices point to. Of course many people, particularly scientists, make the point that it's impossible to nail down reality. I mean many people understand this. I enjoy reading popular science and especially what physicists and astronomers are doing. And we can, following what those guys are doing, we can see that the more we look into space the more vast the cosmos appears. The more finer aspects and features of the universe that we exist in have become apparent to people who look into this, who do research in it, whose work it is to look into this. And also on the very small physical level when physicists was just reading look into the very tiny microscopic level, they're postulating that there are universes in an electron, sort of sub sub subatomic infinite regress, that that awareness is in fact vast and none, there's no end to it. But nevertheless this, none of this stops us knowing that we have ideas and that they're not really real, that they're concepts and representations, but it doesn't stop us from believing them, that they are real, which can be a handy device to go through the world. But it's very helpful to understand the whole of our nature, especially to look at the idea of what our self is. We can describe awareness as a fluid comprehension of reality as it moves through our senses. And this kind of awareness has been known to human beings from a long time before the Buddhist time and co-existent with the Buddhist time. The Taoist site for example are our total awareness which they identify as kind of an energetic awareness. In the belly it's called the Dantin and in Japanese Zen this site is called the Hara. And in these traditions this centered awareness is considered more important than than any individual awareness including our head awareness or our heart awareness because it holds all of them in these traditions. There's a Renzai Zen master, Sogaku Harada, who said you have to realize the center of the universe is in your Hara. So pointing to what our nature is. And when we engage in with this awareness we can come to radical comprehension. We can realize that at the root there's no difference between our human nature and Buddha nature. We can know directly that we are not our cravings and hankering, our sorrows and afflictions. Zen Buddhism describes this kind of realization because we ourselves are intrinsically Buddha nature. It's possible for us to awaken to it even though we can't describe it. In the Buddha in the early Pali texts in the Samyutta Nikaya describes a great human as one who has liberated his or her mind through the practices of mindfulness. So it's famously not easy to talk about the quality of this experience because it is beyond the dualities of mind and language. But nevertheless there are some representations and some pointers as to what this looks and feels like and these each one of us can discover for ourselves. Even within the flood of streaming information that goes on within us every moment. The inside and outside data from all the six senses, the changes, the movement. We can sense with this broad awareness an ease, a wholeness, a completeness. Within this awareness we can know what's going on but we don't have to be perturbed by any of it. We can act and remain balanced within the world of action and no matter what the outcome and the results of our actions are. This kind of awareness which is both very broad and global and encompassing and can also be very fine and precise and detailed is in our ordinary lives as well as in our meditation practice. But as I said earlier it does take some time to patience, to cultivate it, to understand it more deeply. It's alluded to by many poets both within the Buddhist tradition and outside and I'd like to I'd like to quote a couple of these at this point. One is Itzumi Chibuku who is a 10th century Japanese woman. She was an attendant to the empress of Japan in the Heian Empire, considered one of the high points of the Japanese cultural flowering like the Western Renaissance. She was also a courtesan and later in her life became a Buddhist nun. And she writes in the short form of Tanka and Haiku very precisely and clearly about this kind of awareness. Watching the moon at dawn solitary mid sky I knew myself completely no part left out. Another pointer to this to a quality of this awareness that that allows us to see both our Buddha and human natures is pointed to by Wallace Stevens a 20th century American poet. One of he wasn't a Buddhist but one of his main themes was awareness the mystery of awareness and knowing oneself. I was myself the world in which I walked and what I saw and heard and felt came not but from myself and there I found myself more truly and more strange. In the Theravada tradition that we undertake the practices we undertake there's great emphasis on mindfulness and I'd like to touch on an aspect of this mindfulness that I found very helpful to understand a more a larger picture of my nature and this is bare attention. So bare attention is the kind of the basis or the seed state of awareness the basic facts of our mental processes the simple awareness without add-ons everything we know and can be aware of begins with bare attention but because that happens very quickly we're usually not aware of it that's where we engage in meditation that helps us slow down enough to become aware of it. Usually the next step which is associative thinking follows bare attention instantly follows its heels really just jumps right on it and we find ourselves in the story lines and the reifications in the idealizations the concepts we add our egos in this wonderful phrase I love from one of my teachers Angie Boisifan who speaks here sometimes the great me we put the great me in the starring role very very quickly when we're not paying when we're not tuned into this bare attention and then we project and defend. As a practice I find bare attention is kind of a sifting practice we can tune in to finer and finer aspects with this keeping in touch with this aspect of mindfulness and we can see what actually appears in our field of awareness what is what is actually happening within each of our senses all coming up together and this this finer sifting is finer in the sense of less weighed down with concepts with notions of ownership with judgments when we tune into this aspect of awareness those tend to fall away and we learn to expand the space time of our awareness this is all accessible through our direct experience but it does take some development at the skill so our patience is called for and as our experience matures through our practice in patience we come in to our own mind body realization that there is nothing that that is lasting and that are trying to hold on to things at these deep levels is what causes us stress and suffering and then another bit of the good news that when we knowing this directly for ourselves allows us to loosen up and lighten up experiencing this kind of awareness is like the sun coming from behind the clouds to shine on our true nature and as we see and remember this from our continuing practice we discover uncover the possibilities in every moment of living from a more balanced place being both more buoyant and more grounded oh i'd like to end um my talk this morning by noting that the larger we open this lens of awareness the more we see the elements of wonder and the opportunities for creative engagement with our lives we see our human buddha nature can encompass vastness and yet can remain part of our everyday lives doing all the things we must do to get here and get away to work to eat to keep alive as human beings in our relationships in every aspect and we can see that we are both our unique self and also our self is not fixed and it's related to every other thing and finally i'd like to end with some more poetry which for me points the way in a different way than description this poem is by William Stafford who is a 20th century american poet he just died recently also a couple of years ago and i don't believe he had a buddhist practice this poem is called the gift time wants to show you a different country it's the one that your life conceals the one waiting outside where the curtains are drawn the one grandmother hinted at in her crochet design the one almost found over at the edge of the music after the sermon it's the way life is and you have it a few years given long suffering you wait and pray and maybe good things come maybe the hurt slackens and you hardly feel it anymore and you know that you're not the only one who's ever been and you hardly feel it anymore you have a breath without pain it is called happiness it's a balance the taking and passing along the composting of where you've been and how people and weather treated you it's a country where you already are bringing you where you have been time offers this gift in millions of ways turning the world moving the air calling every morning take it it's yours it's yours and the last poem i would like to read is from patacara who was one of the early buddhist nuns lived at the time of the buddha and took teachings directly from the buddha and she points to this awareness this nature in a very simple direct way that izumi pointed it that izumi pointed it to it in her poem bathing my feet i watched the bath water spill down the slope i concentrated my mind the way you train a good horse then i took a lamp and went into my cell checked the bed and sat down on it i took a needle and pushed the wick down when the lamp went out my mind was freed freed so i thank you very much for your attention and i invite you to speak if if there's something you want to say about awareness meditation practice or anything i really find it very enriching and enjoyable to hear what you have to say thank you yes well i think we have i think we have this awareness this is it's part of what we it's part of our apparatus we have the awareness but to tune into those finer aspects i think concentration practice is is very useful my personal experience it's very useful to do that it's i don't think it's necessary necessarily we all have different um because we are all unique we all have different we've all composted our ourselves in in different ways in a sense so that um so that perhaps for one person a concentration practice isn't necessary i also believe that this changes over time um and that it it develops and unfolds as we go on with with just simply sitting down and certainly there are whole buddhist traditions that say for example zen says you don't need any concentration practices whatsoever you uh you just simply bring yourself to sit down be with your body and mind be with your breath although you know we could get we could get technical say how much is being with the breath the concentration practice but in a way that's um that's it's it's kind of interesting to do that i hope this has addressed um some of your question anyway thank you jim uh it's a great topic and i've been reading joseph campbell recently and he um made this statement something like uh anybody who's ever worked in the creative realm knows that the way you work is you create an open space and then something comes into it and you can't control it and um and he talks about how the greeks thought that these were the gods speaking to them they didn't think of it as self-talk like we do they thought that it was something that was completely separate from themselves so i'd be interested to you're a writer what was it like for you to have this awareness that brings your ideas and brings you know your insights well thank you for for uh for bringing that in that's a very um it's it's i find it quite a beautiful way and also a very succinct way what you quoted um joseph campbell of of describing this process and um and i remember reading that in another context from another writer um julian janes um about the the greeks believing that the gods are speaking to them and the way that that buddhism which i tried to touch on a bit um this morning the way that i understand that buddhism sees this is is that it's all of a peace instead of being the gods out there or ourself talking to ourself um and i've i very much resonate with and i and this is a just with his description of you open when you when you do creative work you open a space um or or you you allow yourself to be in a space of openness i mean there are a couple of ways you could phrase that and i think that it's um many people who who are artists are engaged in so-called creative work describe it as this but also other people and i i um i'm coming more and more to look at every work we do is a kind of a creative work in in the sense of in this and that's through my buddhist practice actually of seeing that um particularly through the practices of mindfulness moment by moment of seeing these spaces that are there and that allow creative engagement with whatever it is that we're working on or doing in our lives so thank you yes well i agreed with what steven j goo was saying that there are a very small number of people who disrupt an otherwise more harmonious society um but i wonder how Buddhism addresses the current political situation with alpedo for example you know most americans have very little to do with what it is that is bringing them to this state of this hostility for us so what is the what is the response that Buddhism gets back well i don't um i don't really know that there's a that there is a buddhist response in fact my sense is that there's not a monolithic response of of that that one could call a buddhist response accept that um and this comes from my sense of that comes from talking with the number of people who are engaged in practice for some time how to how to how to be with this how to address it how to engage it etc so and maybe one there was a lot written right after 911 by various buddhist writers and there were views all over the map kind of in a certain way so since buddhism seems to allow the most possible of of individual response working from um certain basic principles as again according to my understanding which which some of which i quoted at the beginning from the dhammapada if if you if you believe that from your own knowledge that hatred never dispels hatred only love dispels hatred if you if you have a sense of that and many people who are not buddhist have a sense of this that can be a guide post for you that can be something that you can tune into if you feel that that's part of your integrity your way of looking at the world so in a way one could say that that's um a very buddhist way to to to really have integrated and to know this principle from inside and then the question becomes and this is the difficult part without a doubt it's not easy and i think the people that i've talked to are practicing buddhist all kind of work with it and and try to keep open and try to see how to engage with it creatively the dalilama is a you know a light for many people because he he steadfastly refuses to to lay blame uh on the chinese for example who've done um you know pretty awful things in tibet to his people and he says we just have to keep talking we just have to keep engaging so then how does one keep doing that it's it's not easy it's frustrating it's um it's many things i i personally found for myself that i that i started to do piece work after not doing i mean and even not you know huge dramatic uh you know earth shaking breaking stories but doing some vigils with people and doing some things like that after years of not thinking about that so i don't know if this has gotten to the heart of your question which is a very profound question it is it is the um the nub of it in a way how do we hold this all can we hold it all can we hold it all this is true is one well i think there's holding there's hold there's there's there's a way of being peaceful in our hearts um that's in a sense a ground and independent of of notions like effectiveness for one thing effective is a time-based um idea and so buddhist that i've heard talk also describe um describe this as really focusing on patience and seeing that we don't have an answer that's going to come or or we may not see the fruits of our actions even in our own lifetimes but what we are doing by refusing to engage in violence including laying blame becoming angry with those who are committing these actions is actually even though we may not see it that these are actually powerful and deeply healing actions that we can take and stances that we can take and another argument once again this is an argument um which doesn't necessarily address it may not necessarily address what you're what you're getting at but i think the central thing is holding it is having a sense oneself where one's own self stands about violence you can look at it in your own life but um the argument is has the other way done anything that's what the dhammapada said you know in very few words hatred never dispels hatred have we ever seen that in human history where hatred has stopped hatred i i don't i don't know of any examples we're still living out where we have the counter force the violent force and then the counter force and that just proliferates and spins out it's kind of um this way this buddhist way in a sense we could say it's a way of non-proliferation but um well thank you for bringing that up and uh well perhaps we could sit for a couple of minutes and um um maybe tune into a whatever nature is coming up for us now
