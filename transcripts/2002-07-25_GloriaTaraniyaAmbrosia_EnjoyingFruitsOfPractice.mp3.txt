 As I said, this is my last Thursday night and it has been so nice to be with you. I feel like I've been in the company of some very serious practitioners. Your questions and your interests, your clear devotion to the practice has been very... It's like it feeds me, you know, and in a situation like this, it ends up being quite cyclical, and the more I feel the sense of your interest, then the more the dhamma comes out. We just keep flowing in this wonderful cycle. So I've thoroughly enjoyed this and I'm glad we chose this topic of karma for the Thursday night group. Some of the questions and the feedback I've been getting is that it's been helpful. So I wanted to wrap this up tonight with some thoughts, some more thoughts about karma. And remember, when we're talking about karma, we're talking about it in the sense of just looking at our conditioned habits and patterns of behavior. You know, the sankaras, this is the Buddhist teaching on sankaras. They're mental formations. They're the sort of the ways of relating and reacting, if you will, more likely reacting to what arises in our conditions, in our lives, in our relationships and situations that we find ourselves in. But also it includes at very subtle levels the way that we are reacting to and receiving, even our own states of mind, even our own emotional states. You know, so... And this is one of the richest areas, I think, of practice, because you find that as meditators, as you begin to uncover what are your habits and patterns, and each of us has our own kind of signature, you know, the classic reaction to this is to hate them or to want to be some other way. And sometimes we don't even need to meditate to do that. Most of us are caught into having an image of ourselves and wanting to be a certain way. And then seeing the way that we are in subtle and not so subtle ways, you know, creating a relationship with ourselves that just can be full of self-loathing and self-criticism. So, you know, just being able to relate to our karmic patterns and habits in a new way, you can see how rich this area of our meditation practice can be. If we can relate in more healthy and useful ways to our own states of mind, to the situations in our lives, to the people in our lives. I mean, the practice is about becoming harmless, becoming kind. You know, how are you going to do that? You know, the first line of, battle line, if you will, is to begin to uncover the way that we are, our own habits and patterns. And, you know, as we talked about it, being very honest and open about what we see, learning to relate even at this level with the most open-hearted kindness that we can and getting it over time that that's the best approach. So just to give a little summary of the previous weeks, first we started this whole thing by looking, just kind of getting a sense of the impulses and urges that arise in the mind and the states of mind and the way that we behave. And trying to get a clearer understanding of how these states arise and how to work with them. So we looked the first week about, what Buddha talked about as really restrained, but often that's a word that can kind of get people all tight and twisted inside, you know, the idea of restraining what's going on. But it's a very, very useful response, a much more skillful response than being completely caught and indulging in our states of mind. So initially, I guess really what he's saying here too is that the power of our habits is so great that initially one of the only things that we can do is just try to restrain that impulse and not follow that impulse. And it serves a very important purpose by not going with it. It's like, as long as you're going with it, we can't see it. You know, indulging the state of mind, being caught up in it is completely consumed. You have no perspective. You have no objectivity in relation to it. So you're just completely caught in it. And so that one of the first approaches then is to get some, to try to get some sense of just kind of restraining impulses. And from that perspective, and only from that perspective really, can you begin to see them as a phenomenon, of something that's an arisen phenomenon in the mind. And you can feel that just beginning to relate from that slightly different perspective than you're in a position to get a little more familiar with what they are, you know, to look at them more impartially and not be caught so easily. Then you can, then from that position, you can sort of turn around. Can you feel that? You're not caught in it. You turn around and you look and you can get a sense of what that state actually is. So in this, we talked about the six animals, you know, that beautiful sutta of the Buddha's where he talked about taming the six animals by tying them to a stake, recognizing that the input, where everything comes in, is through the sixth sense of mind. And so the effort is to, you know, tie a stake around these six animals and kind of anchor it a little bit until they become quiet, until they become tame. So that the mind isn't always going out to things. The heart isn't always going out to things. The eye isn't just picking up everything it sees. The tongue isn't doing the same thing. You know, it's just relaxing more. Restraint is relaxed. It has a lot to do with relaxation and cultivating tranquility. You know, to say it in the way that we use it in everyday language, it doesn't convey that feeling, does it? You know, it's like a strain, tighten up. But in the purest sense, when it's mature, it has this quality of a mother who loves her child and keeps helping the child not get into danger. That's a very loving quality. It's not a quality that's yanking things out of their hand. It's sort of giving them other things that might be more skillful or useful. So it's this, if you can feel that as a metaphor, that's the quality that we want to cultivate. And from doing this, you begin to get a sense of just the early pinnings of seeing the force of greed, hatred, and delusion in the mind. Because they have had free reign up until this point. They can do anything they want. But then when you begin to pull back, then you're in a position to observe them from a much more detached perspective. So really, at this stage, you're beginning to take another tack and looking at things. You know, that objectivity is huge. So then we looked at ways of working with the karmic habits and patterns. So recognizing that just knowing them, knowing when we're in a difficult state is huge. I think that's highly underrated. Until we can look with some semblance of impartiality and say, you know, God, I'm really angry. I'm really being piggy right now. You can feel the shift that's taken place from being piggy or being angry, just completely caught in those states of mind. Versus having this sense of, wow, this is really, I can feel what this, I know this state. I can name it. I can feel what it's like. Can you feel that? It's like it's very different. It's a very distinctly different experience. You're not lost. And from that vantage point, then one is able to begin to investigate. And investigation in the Buddhist teachings has to do with getting a sense of what it's like. You know, it's yes, it's finding out, getting clearer as to what the state of mind is. Yes. So sometimes you have to poke at it. And you know, what are you? Am I pissed or am I just sort of irritated? You know, try to discern the subtle differences between different states of mind. So you have that aspect of it. But it really, the investigation as we talk about it in practice has more to do with making contact with feeling what it feels like to be in that state. Feeling what it, you know, and this is sort of the beginning, middle and end part of practice. Feeling what it's like as it comes up. Feeling what it's like to be caught in it. Feeling what it's like after it's all over. You know, that kind of, you know, and really like bringing those moments fully into awareness and letting the magic of mindfulness. Let letting mindfulness do its magic, you know, which is, and that's a wonderful thing that begins to get cultivated too. It's like, as the more you're able to do this, then one gets this sense of the power of mindfulness. You know, we think that we're the ones that have to smack ourselves around to stop being angry or piggy or whatever, you know. But really, one begins to get a sense that that hating ourselves when we're in these states is useless. It actually does more harm than good. You end up in a whole, you end up in these cycles, these twisted states of mind that just go on and on and on. You know, there's like no end, you know. You hate something and then you hate that you hate it and then you hate that you hate that you hated it. And it just goes on and on and on, you know. You've got to find a way to snap out of it. And what's happening in this phase of practice is beginning to get a certain trust open to a whole new approach, a whole new approach, which is just direct experience. Not just direct experience. It's direct experience, you know. That if we dare to allow ourselves to feel what it's like to be in these states of mind, then, and do that repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, no matter how bad. And I mean, this phase of practice, I call it sort of the noisier phase, you know, because it's like when you're speaking ill about somebody, it's like black gunk coming out of your mouth, you know. When you're caught in a hateful state of mind, it's like hammers, you know, bashing you down and bashing down. These states of mind only have to be felt directly. We're not stupid, you know. We get it when we just trust this process. And I think what's going on in this phase of practice is you're really getting to where you can trust it. You can trust the practice, the processes of practice. That's great. That grows and grows and grows over time as it gets more and more imbued with wisdom, as you get more and more understanding. Not only about the methods of practice, but what's going on with these states of mind, you know. The more we understand, the more objective we become. And when we get objective, then we're really well positioned to contemplate these processes of mind. So when we aren't caught up, then you can begin to get the insights of insight meditation. This is insight meditation. Well, what are those insights? You know, from this vantage point, then you can begin to see very directly that I don't care what the state of mind is. It doesn't have a very long life. It rises and it passes away. And over time, one begins to trust in the truth of Anicca, you know, that these things are impermanent. And if it's difficult and you're just trying to feel the harm of it, you can trust that, well, that's an impermanent state anyway. You're not going to have to endure it very long to get it, you know. It's going to move. We get to see that every time we get caught up in them, we're suffering. So this grabbing, you know, Buddha talked about tanha, clinging, and grabbing as sort of the suffering of our experience. Well, you know, we just can see that every time we're caught in these states, grabbing in that way, then we're suffering. And the most important one, I think, is you begin to see over time that you're not making any of this happen. You're not bringing these states up. They're coming up on their own. And as you trust practice more, you're also seeing you're not making them go away either. It's all happening. And this posturing yourself as the knower of it all gets stronger and stronger. Can you feel that? It's like you can pull back and you're the knower. You're not the one that's making it happen or making it stop or any of it. You're just the knower and the knower and the experiencer of it. That really pays off as the years of practice go by. You know, that posture will strengthen a lot as well. And finally, in that last week, we looked at the importance of turning to these skillful states. We're not always being unskillful. Every time we talk about karma, we only talk about the bad karma. And there are also highly conditioned skillful karmic acts. And we behave well. We all behave very well. And the point is that maybe because of our propensity for self-loathing, we're not tuning into these times enough. We need to tune into our goodness a lot more than we do. So that every time that there's a kind moment, when you restrain oneself from saying something on kind, maybe there's an impulse to gossip or talk about somebody behind their back and you don't do it. Those moments are great. We really have to see those moments and let the heart be happy. Let the heart experience what it feels like to be kind, to be good. You know, they're as much our teachers as feeling the pain of unwholesome states. And that's, I mean, I like that. That's kind of like a little carrot in practice, you know. We get lost in thinking that it's all bad. There's so many happy, good moments. And I think because of our preoccupation with other things, we're missing them. So the effort here is to tune in more and let that do its magic on us as well. So actually, what I wanted to offer for the rest of the evening, came up really from some of the meetings I've had with people. You know, just wanting to get a sense of the fruits of practice and what one can expect from opening in this way, identifying one's habits and patterns and learning to work with them in a more skillful way. And these thoughts come from my own practice and from talking, as I have through the years, with many, many other practitioners. And really getting a sense that there's definitely patterns here. There's definitely things, kind of, signposts and things that are quite common. And the Buddha talked about these at length as well. So just looking whether we're talking about the sitting meditation or just noticing our experience throughout the day. And, you know, I like to think of meditation as 24-7. And really, I think that in terms of mind states, a lot more of your practice will actually take place off the cushion than on it, you know, because that's when normally, or often, not normally, but often during the sittings, one is using those periods to train, just to cultivate that staying power, that sense of opening and focusing and all of that. And that's great, and that's how we should use it. And sometimes mind states will come up and we can contemplate those on the cushion. But a lot of it, I find, happens just kind of walking and talking and living daily, living in your regular life. So the first things that happens as meditators is we become aware of the tremendous activity in the mind, tremendous activity. The Tibetans call this the first major insight of practice, and they call it seeing the mind as a waterfall. There's just this cascading of thoughts and feelings and sensations. And, you know, as you begin to see this, gradually over time, one develops a relationship with it that becomes more and more impartial. But initially, it's not impartial at all. Initially, when we start seeing what's going on in the mind, just the chatter, the inane chatter would be enough to sit. How many hours have you sat and listened to this? Yeah, just going on and on and on and on about things. Most of it is entirely free of any useful content. It's just chatter. So that right there is enough to start to feel a little dejected about. But then, you know, you see the states of mind. You see what this mind is capable of clinging to. And so our looking, it might be somewhat impartial, but initially it has a little bit of an edge to it, doesn't it? It's like, you know, yeah, I see it, but, you know, it's sort of a wishing that it wasn't there, you know, or a sense of maybe even being a little dejected about it. But, you know, as meditation, just keep hanging in there with it. And over time, I find that, you know, we soften around it. And I find the capacity to just say, you know, yep, those states really come up in me, you know. That's the way I am. If you want to put it that way until we get enough insight into Annata, you know, that's the way I am. That has to happen, you know. And actually, initially it can feel very heavy, but I've grown myself to actually love it, you know. It's almost like, yep, that's the way I am. Yep, that's, yep, I do that one too. Yep, yep, yep, I've seen that one too. I do it all, I've done it all, I've seen it all. And there's a piece in that, you know. It's like, there's not much that anybody can tell you that you do that surprises you, you know. It's like, yep, you know that one. And so it's tremendous in relationships, because, you know, you cooperate with what you see in each other. So the emotional charge around this, all of this stuff begins to settle. And things get a lot more matter of fact, don't they? Just like, yep, that's the way, yep, yep, that's the way it is. This is for those of you who heard me tell this story about the cups and bowls, you know, at IMS, where I went through this whole phase of being completely caught up in getting the attractive cups and bowls, and then disengaging a little bit from that, and seeing that as a pattern in my mind, and then getting irritated by it, and hating myself, that I wanted these pretty things, you know. But eventually, just getting to this place where, you know, I could see that this impulse to reach for beautiful things was, it was a very strong force. And it was really too strong to be threshed down by hating it. You know, hating it wasn't working. And so just, instead, beginning to adopt a posture that allowed me to be more spacious around, could I receive that? Could I allow that that is the way that I relate to things? You know, that's, and also beginning to get a sense that it's happening by itself. These were huge aspects of kind of just opening to this simple experience of being drawn into things. So in the face of all this, we get a little bit more accepting, just a little gradually, you know, there's this sense of accepting and receiving things, all manner of things, you know, just begins to get stronger and stronger. But there can still be a sense of dejection in it, you know. Just ever so suddenly that edge, you know, where, I don't know if you've ever had this thought, you know, where it's like, I'm never going to change, you know. It's never going to happen. I am always going to be this way. I'm never going to get any kind of power over these states of mind. So that can still be operating. That can still be quite strong. But still you have to recognize that the mind is beginning to shift and turn. So eventually even that softens. And, you know, I've experienced this in my own practice as sort of, it's like a resignation, you know, it's like, you know, a fatigue, it has a quality of fatigue. It's like I've seen this state of mind so many times. I see it. I'm impartial. I'm not hating it anymore. It's almost like I'm just tired of it. I'm just getting so tired of this state. I wish it would stop overtaking me. It's like, you know, an alien possession every time it comes up, you know. Just trying to calm myself down a little bit. And I actually have grown to love this phase. It's kind of like it has a very humbling quality to it. You know, it's almost like this sense of self that thinks it's in control and running everything is really getting a thrashing. You know, it's really getting beat down. It can't, it's finally found something bigger than it. Karma is like your habits and your patterns, your own states of mind are bigger than self. Self can't control them, you know. It's been trying and it's using all these methods that don't work. And after months and years of practice, you know, you're starting to get it, aren't you? It's like it's not working. Hatred doesn't work, you know. Restlessness and agitation and worry don't work, you know. Doubt and confusion, beating up on myself, they just don't work, you know. So all you're left with is this is kind of like, oh. There's no place to go, you know. There's nothing to do. You know, Ajahn Chah talks about this, you know, you sort of get to this place where the mind can't go forward, it can't go back. There's just no place that it can go. This is great, it's great stuff, you know. This is right where you want to be. So just experiencing this, you know, for myself it sort of felt like an exhale, you know. It's like. And that, it was like that for a while. It just, you know, it had, it didn't pick it back up again. But after a while it does. It's like, you know, every exhale has an inhale, even these, you know. And there was this finally, after a while, might have been months, could have been years, don't remember, you know. It's like, it's like. That inhale is like, it has this, it's really where practice is getting interesting. It's starting to take on a life of its own, if you can feel it. Because what's happened is, you have enough experience to see that it's all just happening and there's not much I can do. Everything I've been doing doesn't work. And you let go. You just let go. And then you can breathe in the next moment, which says, well, what is all this stuff anyway? It's sort of, can you feel it? It's like there's interest finally. It's not completely caught in it. And you can feel the factors of enlightenment beginning to take root. There's interest. There's a new vitality. There's a peace around it all. There's tranquility. Because it's like, you know, I'm okay with this. I'm okay. This is what's happening. I'm not quarreling with it anymore. There's awareness, you know, mindfulness. There's wisdom. There's enough understanding to know that the hindrances don't work. Let's try a new tack, right? These are all the factors of enlightenment. So the mind just starts to get brighter and lighter. And it's much more interested. And then you can turn to these states of mind and get some sense, a much deeper sense of them as a risen phenomenon, a much deeper sense of being caught in them as suffering, a much deeper sense of, it's none of it's under my control. I can let it go. And I love that, you know, if you can feel it. It's a very organic process, this waking up, you know. It's all predicated on mindfulness. All we've done to get to this place is pay attention. That's all we've done, really. If you've done more than pay attention, then you're back in the soup, you know. So it's just kind of impartial. Pay attention. Feel what it feels like and let that do its work. So this is all very important. At this point, we're less concerned about the fact that the mind keeps going off and more and more concerned about what it's going off to, you know. And this is where, like in the fourth foundation of mindfulness, Buddha says, this is what we have to see. We have to see that it keeps going off to the body, to the mind. It keeps grabbing hold of physical and mental experience and claiming it as its own. We have to see that for ourselves. We have to see the importance of guarding the sense basis and seeing what it, you know, this is when it stops being an idea. Oh, let me put my centurion at the sense doors and try to restrain. It actually gets more internalized because you have to see, we have to see for ourselves that it's right there where all the action is. If I can get a sense of my mind going out to things, then, and now I know the consequences of that, then my capacity to just kind of hold it right there just strengthens, doesn't it? It's like it's, what's actually happening is that we're developing what's called the quiet mind, Viveka. It's the capacity of the mind to just kind of notice all of this activity and just receive it. It's like standing free from the mind states. The mind states are there. We have this big debate whether enlightenment means the mind states are gone. I was just reading a book by Ajahn Chah and he said, no, it's not about what's arising in the mind, it's about how you're with it. So anything can keep coming up. The point is you've found this silent place. You've found this place that's quiet in the midst of all of that, and you've found that that's your refuge. That's where you want to be and really condition your capacity to stay there, to strengthen your capacity to stay there. And then that over time matures, that Viveka matures into what's called dispassion, which, you know, there's another one of those words. I don't want to be dispassionate. But getting an understanding of what the Buddha is talking about with this way of relating, it can sound so heartless, but it's actually come out of incredible compassion. It's come out of our capacity to see all of these states of mind and to open our hearts to ourselves and as importantly to other people. Other people's states of mind aren't bothering you so much either, so that we're more spacious and kind with our own shortcomings and those of other people. So out of this capacity to be dispassionate, then comes this feeling of it's okay, it's okay to be that my patterns, my habits, my karma, they're okay. Other people's are okay, I can be with it. Even if we don't always see them, even if we get caught in them, it's like, oh, I should be beyond this, you know, that doesn't happen anymore. It's okay, you got caught in it. That's a given. You know, in the Buddhist teachings, that's a given. That's what it's all about. It's like, it starts with the baseline of we're ignorant. So everything is all up from there. Can it be okay that even if we see them, we can't always disengage? Even that becomes okay. Like, wow, this is a really strong state of mind. I can't get a handle on it, it's probably going to take me months. But even that's okay. You know, can you feel it's wonderful, you know, you're really enjoying the fruits of the dispassionate heart. This is what we talk about, this is what we mean when we talk about dispassion in the practice. And then this matures even more to a state that I love the translation for it is one of disenchantment. And where literally, in relation to these difficult patterns and habits, there's, you know, the tendency to even go in that direction dries up. You know, it's like it really gets rich. And I know you've all had this experience, haven't you? Where it's like, you see, you suddenly see the fruits of practice. Like, one day you notice that you're in a situation that used to do it for you. You know, this is one of those situations where I used to get nuts. And I'm not nuts, you know. This is one situation where I used to get anxious and worried, you know, confused and completely out of touch. And that's not happening, you know. Well, how did that happen? Begin to see that. And that gets, you know, that fuels, fuels our practice, fuels our effort more and more. So the understanding of the truth of the Buddhist teachings, you know, the faith, the so-called, maybe sort of the blind faith that we enter practice with gets more and more internalized, verified from our own experience. And we know that he's right. You know, the things he's saying about breaking out of these incredibly painful and difficult states of mind and heart, the things he's saying are true. They really work. This is the way that it operates. This is the way that the mind operates. This is how we get into suffering. And this is how we get out of it, you know. And then I think the A-fold path becomes like this huge attraction, you know. You just, what does that path say anyway? Well, how can I live that? How can I do that? Because there's such a happiness that is experienced from living it. So I hope this is helpful. I wanted to tie some things up tonight and leave a little time for some questions, see if you have some questions or maybe some comments about all this. I know that you have experiences of your own that might be useful to talk about. Yeah. I didn't hear you right, but you said you were talking about kind of the negative states it sounded like and that you find that you're not creating these. It's one of those paradoxes. Yeah. Yeah. That they arise. They arise. I mean, if you could not be angry ever again, wouldn't you not do that? So there's something in it that whoever it is you think you are isn't the one that's running it. You know, it's sort of mental phenomenon are just kind of following their own rules, their own laws. They arise. And that as an insight is huge because if that's true, then I don't need to be making such a fuss about them. I don't need to hate myself when I'm in them. And I don't need to completely get caught up in them when they arise. I don't have to believe them, which is actually the greed. We relate to them with greed, hatred and delusion. This greed, which we call greed, but in this sense, it's much more subtle. It's a movement of the mind to identify with it, to become that. And if we're not doing that, then we've just become it and we hate that we did. Right. Yeah. And it's like if we can just get at that level of reactivity, that's big, where you begin to see that we relate to our own states of mind with greed, hatred and delusion. And it just kind of soften around that. That's 90 percent of it right there. Yeah. I mean, that's what I jokingly talk about lowering my standards in practice. But I used to have this standard that somehow the mind was going to become completely pure and clean and none of these states would ever come up. And now I'm happy just to not hate them when they do. You know, we're not get caught in them. Yeah. A lot easier and actually more accurate. What else? Yeah. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. But there is a moment or two when I can just, I guess you call it even moment. And it's clear and calm and there's nothing there. But that, you know, it's almost like you say, it just comes up and you just kind of go over there. Yeah. No, it's really hard to put that in a straight line. Right. Right. And I think the point needs to be made, though, that there is pain in life. And, you know, some pains go on for a long time. It's like a wave. It just keeps arising and will take you over for a while. And that this is normal and this is natural. And that's not indulging a state of mind. There is sort of the ordinary pain and misery. What the Buddhist teachings are talking about is the suffering that gets added to that. So just to discern and see that you're not wanting to get rid of something that actually just is absolutely normal. To feel a sadness for loss of a loved one or difficult situations or something like that. That's fine. That runs its course. The thing is, if there's a going out to it, we can. I mean, there's a way that even painful situations are attractive because they give the sense of self something to get caught up in. Something to become identified with. This is who I am. I'm this miserable person who's having a hard time, you know. And that's what you want to look out for. So just discern those two, okay? Does it help? Yeah. Have you seen this? These kinds of things? Yeah. I'm very new to this practice. And you talk about karma in a way that is different from the understanding that I have to karma. You re-put yourself. Yeah. But you're talking about karma. What is that? To give a definition of karma? Yeah. So that might understand. Yeah. We talk about it in a number of ways. And you're right. It does. Karma, it actually means action. So it's like it has to do with the intention behind action and the consequence of all of that. So when we look at karma, there's really two ways to look at it. It's the action itself, which is the momentary creating of a pattern or a habit. Because basically when the way that we act has a momentum and it creates a condition that makes us more likely to act that way again. So it has to do with that. But then there's what we call vipaka, which is like the accumulated outcome of past action. So that momentum that gets created by the way that we behave is what's arising now. Like when you sit on the cushion and there's all these thoughts and patterns and mental activity, that's the outcome of past actions. I mean, it could be a simple, just to give you sort of a mundane example. If one has too much going on in your life, there's just way too many things, too many irons in the fire. And then you go and sit down and meditate and expect your mind to be still. Well, what you get instead is this flood of activity because of all of the things that we have going on. It's like, you know, you can't, that's the outcome, this flood of activity. Like you go to lay down at night and you can't go to sleep. Well, your mind's been all day. It can't just stop. It's got a momentum. So it's that level. Yes, sorry. So what we're talking about is really the whole range of human emotions is acceptable. It is there. It's only the question of how we look at it. Yes. And in the book of the waterfall, it's a question of sitting in the waterfall or looking at the waterfall. Interesting. Yes, very good. Isn't that what you're talking about? Yes. You're talking about perceiving the waterfall. It may still get wet, but we're seeing it as what it is. Right, right, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And that is the primary ingredient for not creating any more karma. So that whole impulse begins to dry up, you know, where when there's no more unwholesome karma being created, the mind just gets quieter and quieter and quieter. All that's happening is sort of the residual effects of yesterday's karma. And those fizzle out after a while. And at that time, are you creating wholesome karma? Well, in a way, at that time, you're a Buddha. You're not creating anything. A Buddha can't create unwholesome. But it's not entirely accurate to say that they're creating wholesome. They're really just being. It's a fine point. If you're having behavior that's creating unwholesome karma, and you start paying attention and holding it in a different way, that is a good type of behavior. Yeah. Is that in the same way that we're creating wholesome karma? Right, right. So that way of working through the unwholesome karma is, at the same time, creating some wholesome karma. Right, right. Just consider that the wholesome and unwholesome fall into these two categories to elaborate on those. Buddhists said that there were six basis for action, six kinds of intention, and three are unwholesome, and those are greed, hatred, and delusion. Okay? And then the three are wholesome. And they're non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. So if you can just imagine, which, I mean, at least from where we are now, we can only imagine, I think, what a mind and heart that has no greed, no hatred and delusion in it is like. That's the place from which one would be acting. Do you talk to someone about relationship karma? Like what I was saying about, yeah, just the, I think what happens over time is, is you get more skilled with working with your own states of, as we get more skilled with working with our own states of mind, and more enlightened, if you will, to how they happen and to how easily one gets caught in them, how difficult it is to overcome them, then you can imagine that that humbling effect that I was talking about, what that does to you, would have an effect on the way that we relate to other people, so that what comes at us is received a whole lot differently. And then if both people have the same kind of understanding, what's possible, to me, what's possible in relationship is that, sometimes they can so much get into this, well, you do this and you do that and you do that, and all that kind of stuff can go on, and it's so debilitating, you know? But what's possible is that if we both know how or all know how to work with mind states, then we're much more spacious and forgiving about each other's shortcomings, you know, or the places where we need to open, and much more helpful, you know, it's like we know what it takes to open to states, you know? And so you're like much more helpful, like, oh my gosh, you're in that state, you get more compassionate instead of angry, you know? And so you can see the implications of what might be possible from working with things in this more enlightened way. I see, like, instead of this, it's more like, you know, there's like a triangle, there's the two of us and we're both trying to get free. Now how are we going to do it, you know? And maybe we can be a help to each other in that instead of making it more difficult, which often happens, you know? I don't know if that's helpful yet. Yes, one more. I have a question about the grieving, truth, and delusion. If that's pushed aside and something like art or being creative or something like that, is there a different type of waterfall that you're suggesting, like, forward standing beside the waterfall that will create something like this, not based on trying to get something or push something in? Yeah, actually, I think in many ways artists have a little bit of an edge on us as meditators, you know, because what it takes to do that is just, in many ways, what it is we're trying to do, which is to get ourselves out of the way so that what would interfere with the creative process would be wanting it to be a certain way, hating the way it is, you know, being deluded about the whole experience. So that the more that one can free oneself from these states of mind, I think it's quite common to find very creative channels opening up. In fact, there's, in some monasteries, this is highly encouraged that even as a tool for practice, that the monks and nuns pick something up creative to have more experience in their life of not controlling things, you know? Is there passion then? I'm questioning nihilism, like, you're not going to go to a place of numbness by the side of the... No, no, you're not going to go, oh no, I don't think it's very much alive. It's not being attached to those, you know? Right, right, it's kind of riding the waves, you know? It may not be very mindful, that's the only thing, but it's not harmful. Again, thank you, thank you for your attention, thank you for your intention, thank you for your kind support. It's been a pleasure to be here this week and I look forward to seeing you again, probably this time next year maybe, we'll see.
