 
 Dharmette:  Feeding  and Not Feeding  
the Troll

I am in a bit of a silent  mood , so what  I’d like to do is tell 
a story.  Some  of you have  heard  this story  before,  but it 
can be applied  in new ways.  It’s a fable  – a myth  told in 
the ancient  Buddhist  texts.  It concerns  the great  chief  
god of the heavens , Brahmā  – a powerful  figure,  who 
has a great , divine , heavenly  palace . In the main  
meeting  room,  there  is a mighty  throne  that only 
Brahmā  sits on.  
 
One day when  Brahmā  was out and about  in the 
universe  away  from home,  along  comes  an ugly,  little 
runt of a troll. This mean -spirited,  little troll hops  along,  
dragging  its body,  and finds  its way into the great  
meeting  hall of the palace.  He jumps  up onto Brahmā’s 
great  throne, and sits there  looking  out across  the court.  
The other  gods  who are there  are quite  concerned . 
They  start to get upset  because  only Brahmā  sits in that 
seat.  So they tell the troll to get off the throne , but he 
doesn’t.  They  start raising  their voices , expressing  their 
anger  and hostility  to this ugly,  little runt of a troll. And 
as they get more  and more  angry  and upset  with him,  
 the troll gets bigger , stronger , and less ugly.  He is no 
longer  a little runt. The gods  of the court  are confused  
by this, so they go out across  the universe  to find 
Brahmā  to tell him what’s  going  on at home.  Brahmā  
says,  “Oh, I understand,”  and he magically  makes  his 
way home , “as quickly  as a strong  person  could  flex 
their arms  and snap  their fingers.”  
 
Brahmā  goes  to his throne  in the meeting  hall, and 
stands  in front of this now big, strong,  radiant  troll. He 
starts  bowing  to the troll, offering  his respect.  He tells 
the troll, “I hope  you’re  well. I hope  you’re  comfortable  
up there.  It’s nice to see you.”  He bows  again,  offering  
his kindness  and respect . And as he does  so, the troll 
starts  getting  smaller , and smaller , and smaller.  It keeps  
getting  smaller  until finally  – poof – it vanishes.   
 
Brahmā  then gets up on the throne , and explains  to all 
the gods  in his court : 
That troll was an anger -eating  troll. That’s  what  the 
troll subsisted  on. In fact, he sat on the throne  to get 
you angry.  And the more  angry  you became,  the 
more  food he had, and the more  he grew . So, he 
became  bigger  and stronger.  He was feast ing on 
your anger , so of course  he wasn’t  going  to get 
down.  He loved  his strength , his power , and the 
majesty  of looking  out at those  angry  eyes.  It was 
wonderful.  But if you stop feeding  him, and offer him 
kindness  and respect,  then his sustenance  is not  
 provided , and he’ll shrink,  get small , and – poof – he 
vanishes.  
 
There  is no indication  in the story  that there  was any 
sympathy  or compassion  for this troll. It’s a fable  for us. 
I don’t  know if you like trolls.  I’m from Norway,  where  
there  are lots of trolls  – and they’re  kind of cute.  But 
there  are trolls  in us. So, which  ones  do you feed?  Do 
you have  an anger  troll that gets bigger  as you feed it – 
as you get angry  at yourself,  angry  at your anger,  or 
angry  at the world?  What  are you feeding?  What  gets 
bigger?   
 
Do you have  a greed  troll?  Does  your greed  grow  
bigger?  Does  the greed  promote  more  greed,  more  
desire,  and more  wanting?  I’ve had times  in my life 
where  it just seemed  like I was a wanting  engine.  I 
wanted  this, and this, and this. Sometimes  I didn’t  really  
have  an object  that I wanted.  I just wanted  something . I 
just knew  that I wanted . Desire  is sometimes  insatiable.   
 
Is there  a self-pity troll?  Is there  an arrogance  troll that 
feeds  on arrogance  and gets bigger?  What  do we feed?  
This idea of what  we feed is recognizing  that there  is a 
difference  between  having  any of these  things  – having  
anger,  greed,  arrogance,  fear – and feeding  them . 
There  are fear trolls  too. There  is a difference  between  
having  these  emotions  come  up, and how we feed 
them.    
  
It’s feeding  them  that is the issue  – the way we relate  to 
our emotions  and attitude s – what’s  extra , what  we add 
on. Some times what  we add is the fuel that feeds  and 
grows  the troll, justifies  its very existence,  insists  on 
being  seen,  and values  its power  and strength . 
Sometimes  we feed it by giving in, collaps ing to the 
despair  troll. 
 
In the path of mindfulness,  everything  is to be 
respected . Everything  is allowed  to sit on its throne  and 
be respected  in that way. It’s for us to be willing  to meet  
what  arises  with humility  – with a lack of conceit,  
demands,  hostility,  or conflict.  In a sense,  it is to bow to 
all things :  
Hello,  I see you. I know  you. I respect  your 
presence  right now.  It doesn’t  mean  that I agree  
with you. It doesn’t  mean  I’m fueling  or encouraging  
you. But I offer you my respect  – my ability  to see 
again , to look more  deeply,  to not be in conflict  – 
and to hold you in awareness  and see you clearly.  
 
If you do that – if you can offer your trolls  caring  and 
respectful  attention  – not condemning,  succumbing , or 
collapsing  to anything,  not being  hostile , afraid of your 
fear, or angry  at your anger  – not being  angry  at or 
afraid  of your desires.  Just look at them.  Imagine  that 
you put them  on the throne  in the center  of the palace,  
and in placing  them  there,  you can leave  them  alone.   
 Don’t  get involved . Don’t  feed them . But look at them  
carefully  and kindly , and then see what  happens.   
 
Maybe  it’s not a troll that will get smaller  and smaller , 
and just disappear.  Chances  are it’s a being  that will 
transform  itself into one of the most  friendly,  loving,  and 
appreciative  trolls  that you could  ever imagine  having  – 
kindness,  love,  care,  generosity,  peacefulness,  
patience,  mindfulness.   
 
May your respect,  kindness,  care,  and your non-
involved , non-reactive,  and non-conflicted  attention  
support  the profound  transformation  of what’s  inside  of 
you, so that the very best of you has a chance  to grow,  
develop,  and become  part of who you are.  
 
May you be careful  that you don’t  feed the anger  troll. 
 
Thank  you all for being  here.  I appreciate  it very much.
