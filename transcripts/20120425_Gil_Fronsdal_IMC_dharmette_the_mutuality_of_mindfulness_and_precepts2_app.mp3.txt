Dharmette: The Mutuality of 
Mindfulness and Precepts

Here in the West, it’s possible and very easy to receive 
mindfulness instructions cold. By that I mean that, 
without preparation of any kind, you can come to IMC or 
other places and receive teachings on mindfulness. And 
many people find this very beneficial in their lives.  
 
Traditionally, however, in Theravāda Buddhism, 
mindfulness isn’t offered by itself, but rather is offered 
together with other teachings that are considered 
foundational. One important foundation for mindfulness 
is ethical behavior. Mindfulness is built upon being 
careful with your behavior. Often, the simplest way to 
talk about it is to talk about the precepts. The precepts 
are not a requirement or something puritanical, but are 
seen as a foundation, a support, for being able to do the 
practice of mindfulness. So, if you are a lay person, 
sometimes even before you’ve learned to do 
mindfulness, care is g iven to emphasize looking at your 
behavior, and seeing if there are ways to align your 
behavior more with the five precepts.  
 The first precept is usually translated as not to kill , 
which is probably just fine. But the literal translation 
would be not to hit anything that breathes , or not to 
harm anything that breathes . I guess plants breathe, 
but I think the idea here is breathing with lungs. So not 
to harm  is a higher order than not to kill , and is more 
inclusive.  
 
The second precept is not to take what is not given . 
This differs from not stealing in that unless something is 
clearly offered, you don’t take it, even though it may not 
necessarily be stealing.  
 
The third precept is not to engage in sexual 
misconduct . This connects to the first precept not to 
harm , which  is the basic principle for all of the precepts. 
This means not to engage in sexual conduct that 
causes any harm to anyone  – neither to those parties 
directly involved, nor to those indirectly involved.  
 
The fourth is not to be involved in false speech . 
Perhaps false speech is a little broader than just not to 
lie.   
 
And then the fifth one is not to intoxicate the mind , not 
to be involved in altering your mind state by intoxicating 
it.  
 
There’s a wonderf ul mutuality between aligning yourself – living by these five precepts – and being mindful. 
Generally, if people are going to break or violate the 
precepts, they do so with mindlessness – there is 
something they are not paying attention to, for example, 
being mindless of the impact of your behavior, and of 
the people affected. If you really took in how you are 
hurting someone, how you are betraying someone, and 
you really understand that, then you probably wouldn’t 
violate the precepts. So, if you want to l ive by the 
precepts, then it’s important not to be mindless.  
 
One way that the precepts have this mutual relationship 
with mindfulness practice is that, since you now have a 
limitation on what you can do, that limitation becomes a 
mirror to help you see y ourself better. If you have no 
restrictions in your life (no precepts at all), you can just 
act on every impulse you have, and not really see 
yourself. If you have an unfettered ability to do 
something, you don’t really see what’s motivating you, 
or what b eliefs and attachments are involved. You can 
be very attached to something, but because it’s easy to 
fulfill what you are attached to, you don’t even see that 
you’re attached. However, if you can’t fulfill your 
attachment, then the frustration shows you, “ I didn’t 
realize I was so attached.”  
 
I’m sure none of you are attached to your computers or 
the internet (if you do have computers and access to the 
internet). It’s as easy as breathing these days.  I’m sure it’s just an ordinary part of life, and you’re not attached 
at all. But if the electricity goes out for three days, or the 
internet or your computer goes down, you can probably 
feel the frustration, the momentum, the desire, the 
wanting that’s there.  
 
Part of the function of the precepts is to create a  
limitation on the unfettered ability to do whatever you 
want to do. You may find yourself about to lie, or to 
exaggerate, or to not speak the truth in one way or 
another. Or you are about to take a pencil from work. 
No one has offered the pencil, but you’ re about to take 
it. But because you have this precept, you don’t.  
 
Or a mosquito comes into your house [claps as though 
killing a mosquito]. You could easily just squash it and 
be finished with the mosquito. But because of the 
precept not to kill, you sa y, “Oh, I can’t do that. I can’t 
just swat the mosquito.” That inability to swat the 
mosquito because of the restriction of the precepts then 
becomes an opportunity to look at what motivates you. 
What’s going on for you that you want to kill the 
mosquito? Is it fear? Disgust? Annoyance? Impatience 
with other approaches where you’d carefully catch the 
mosquito and take it outside? I used to go around and 
catch mosquitoes using the cup of my two hands, and 
then I’d ask someone to open the door so I could 
release them outside because I didn’t want to kill them.  
 Or the pencil at work. No one has offered you the 
pencil, so what’s motivating you to take the pencil? Is it 
really innocent? What are the feelings, the motivations, 
the sense of self going on now that keep you from not 
taking what’s not given?  
 
Perhaps I  find myself wanting to exaggerate. It can be 
as simple as telling someone, “I ate at the best Thai 
restaurant in the world.” It’s kind of a colloquial way of 
saying that it was really great. But it is an exaggeration. 
It can’t possibly be true. What kind of a statement is it? 
So if I have this precept not to lie, it becomes a 
reminder to be more careful when I speak. What 
motivates me to exaggerate about the restaurant? 
Sometimes I’ve seen in myself that I’ve exaggerated, 
not because I thought they needed to know this was the 
best restaurant ever, but rather because by saying that I 
ate at the best restaurant, it’s kind of like advertising 
myself. Look at me. I had this great experience. I was 
able to choose the best restaurant. I know something 
that you do n’t know. Actually it wasn’t so innocent. So 
now, with this precept, I have to look at what’s going on.  
 
The precepts operate as a mirror, and this becomes 
interesting when you’re going to transgress against 
them. It isn’t necessarily that you are now a b ad person. 
But it becomes an opportunity for you to look at yourself 
more deeply. And if you look at yourself more deeply, 
chances are that you will see that it’s not in your best interest to behave in those ways. You’re losing touch 
with some inner sense of peace, well -being, freedom, 
compassion – something that’s actually quite valuable.  
 
The mutuality of mindfulness and precepts also works 
the other way. As people do mindfulness meditation 
practice and feel better about themselves, and they feel 
a certa in depth of peace, well -being, love, compassion, 
or no longer being caught by things, then this becomes 
a reference point for not wanting to give that up. You 
see yourself in another way. You have this deep 
appreciation for another way of living.  
 
General ly when people break the precepts, they’re not 
so peaceful – they’re not so settled in themselves. It’s 
much easier to violate the precepts when you’re 
stressed out, caught up, angry, or filled with greed. 
When those things are not there, and you feel bett er 
about yourself, then that becomes a support to live 
ethically.  
 
In fact, it’s said that at some point when someone is 
deeply mature in their practice, they don’t need the 
precepts anymore. They don’t need them – not because 
they can now do whatever they  want and harm people – 
but because, due to their deep sense of inner 
contentment, well -being, and peace, there’s no 
inclination to do those things anymore.  
 Another direction in the mutuality from precepts to 
mindfulness is that unethical behavior tends t o promote 
agitation. If you are agitated, it’s harder to be mindful 
and settled for the mindfulness practice. So to live by 
the precepts is a protection and a support for the 
practice of mindfulness, peace, and freedom. And the 
practice of mindfulness is a  support for the precepts. 
The two go hand in hand.  
 
A classical Buddhist would be equally interested in both 
as they live their life and try to bring mindfulness into it. 
People often ask, “How do I integrate mindfulness into 
my life?” The way to do that is to have a heightened 
interest in ethics and ethical behavior.  
 
I’m confident that all of you are conventionally quite 
ethical. So, the opportunity is to be more subtle or more 
nuanced in how you understand the precepts and apply 
them in your life – not in a moralistic, puritanical, 
judgmental, or even obligatory way – but in a way that 
supports you in your practice and in your life.
