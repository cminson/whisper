The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, good day. It was nice to meditate with here with you all. I feel much better
now. I was, I had a shingle shot yesterday and I was warned that shingle
shots might have a big impact and it did. I went to bed and I had shivers and
quite cold and then I got hot and that fever and woke up this morning feeling
tired and kind of, kind of going really slow. So, I wonder how what it's boy was
going to be like to come down and give a talk here today. But just sitting there
for this half an hour, I feel more and more normal again. So, but if somehow I
slur my words or I'm not quite coherent, maybe it's still the effect of the
shingle shot. I was warned that the impact would be strong. So, I want to
talk about karma. So, it's one of the really big topics in Buddhism and some
people feel like it's one of the most central teachings of Buddhism or the
Buddha. And, and it's sometimes Western teachers like myself are
criticized for not teaching it enough and not emphasizing it because it's so
central. And so, I want to talk about it and I want to talk about that there's
three different aspects, the major aspects of the karma teaching. And, and
so, and understanding these three different areas will help you find your
way when people start talking about karma and you'll start saying, well, which of
these three are they addressing? Is it all three? Is it just one of them or two
of them or what are they actually talking about? Because sometimes people
use, talk about karma, assuming you know what they mean. And so, this maybe helps.
So, the first is that karma, the word karma, literally it's karma in Pali, K-A-M-M-A,
the way that Sanskrit and Pali are very closely related and sometimes just a
softening of some of the consonants. And, and so, karma, it literally means
action. And, and that's the basic meaning, it means action, how we act. And then by
extension then it's become associated with theories of action, theories of what
action, you know, understanding of the, how actions work. And so, one of the, one
of the aspects of this theory of action is the idea that actions have
consequences. What we say and what we do, and also what we think, what goes on in
our mind, is not impact-free. It, whatever we do has an influence. It has
results that can happen. And so, if, if you race around for a whole day trying to
do many things in a hurry and in the end of the day you're exhausted and have a
headache, that's the consequence of having rushed around all day. If instead
you do things calmly and mindfully and you come to the end of the day and you
still feel calm and settled and you're not so exhausted, that's partly the
consequence of the actions you do. If you lie to your best friend and your best
friend now doesn't trust you, you're lying headache consequence. And so the
teaching of karma has this idea that all your actions have consequences. And what
this implies is that you should be careful, not only about what you do, but
also careful about what you do in terms of the consequence it has. What impact
does it have on others? What impact will it have on yourself? And seemingly
innocent things we do are not so inconsequential. They're actually quite,
everything has some kind of value with it. It's part of the conditioning factors.
It creates an influence. It creates a lingering effect. So, in one of the ways
that karma works, consequences is not just the consequences in the world, but
the most important part is consequences to ourselves. We might want to say in
the Western terms, psychological consequences. So, what we do regularly
becomes a habit. What we do regularly becomes a momentum and force in our
minds. We're more likely to do that again. So, if we complain a lot and that's what
we're always doing, complaining has consequence. It has maybe some kind of
consequence in the world. People feel a little bit hesitant to talk to us if
they're always complaining. But also, complaining is a stressful activity
of the mind and we're compounding that stress if we do it regularly. And we're
making it more likely that it becomes a habit to complain and then we find
ourselves complaining without having planned to complain. It's just like
it's become a habit. And so, some of these things that we do regularly or we do,
the influence it has goes underground for a while and then comes out later. So,
we go along merrily living our lives and then we meditate. And then in meditation,
at some point, we realize that we have to now take into into into account the
fact that we hurt someone 20 years ago. And we know we hurt them but we never
really the impact of that, the real, you know, the impact of what that impacted
us or the impact of them. Somehow, there's something about meditation sitting
quietly and being attentive. Sometimes, especially on retreat, things long ago
come up really big and then we have to deal with them. And they've been living
underneath there, living kind of underground and waiting their turn. There's
not inconsequential they're living there. They're kind of like simmering there and
in the background. And so, now they come to the foreground and now we have to
deal with it somehow and work with it. And my teacher in Burma was, he loved
Pandita. He loved to frequently tell stories of people who came to meditate
with him, who lived, you know, violent lives. I mean, there were people who were
soldiers or in Burma there's guerrilla fighters fighting the government. And
both of the guerrillas and the soldiers who come to meditate with him. And they
would, the consequence of the violence they'd done would come and impact them
in their meditation and they'd have to sit with it and be with it and work
through it to the other side. And for some of them, it was a challenging time
to sit with the inner landscape, the consequences of what they've done. So,
the first principle of karma is that actions have consequences and we can
be careful with our choices we make about what we do in deeds, in speech,
and also in thoughts. The harder in our thinking, but with meditation we start
learning that we have actually some ability to choose. And so, having more
and more choice of how we live our lives is one of the consequence of mindfulness
meditation. The more choice we have, the more freedom we have. People who don't
see that they have choice don't have choice. And they just become kind of do
things on automatic or they do things they don't even know why they say and
do things. It's just kind of like it was what happens that comes out of them. But
as we get quieter and more attentive, more and more we see there's lots of
choice in all kinds of small ways in our lives. When I came back from three
years or so in the monastery, then monastery, where everything was
choreographed, everything was very organized and how you stood, how you
walked, how you bowed, when you bowed, when you sat. Everything was on a
schedule, kind of, much of the day. And so, you don't have to think a lot about
do I stand now? You know, the bell rang and you stand. But when I came to, I left
the monastery, I realized right away that all kinds of things
before the monastic training, I just done on automatic pilot. Now I saw that
there was a choice. And so, I went to the abbot and told him this, that
how I sit down in a chair, I never thought about it before, but now when I
sit in a chair, I'm aware of the choice about how I sit there, the posture I
take. And I see all this choice. And then the abbot did something that he never
done to me before. When I said this to him, he reached forward and shook my
hand. Like he was really pleased, I guess, by this realization. The second
thing is a principle of karma, is that the consequences of our actions are
influenced by the quality of the actions. So, if what we do, we think, say, or do,
is influenced by, is characterized by something unskillful, something
unwholesome, something that is unethical, something that is going to harm
someone, then the consequences will have something, some flavor of being
also unskillful, unhelpful, unethical, or harmful. So, if we live a life that's
harming, the consequence is going to be harming to ourselves and maybe to
others. The opposite is true, that if we do live a life that's wholesome, that's
skillful, that is non-harming, that's beneficial to self and other, then the
consequences of our actions will carry with them some of those skillful,
wholesome qualities. So, it's not a, the impact, the consequences of our actions
are shaped by the quality, the ethical quality of the action that we do. And so
then it's important to be even more careful, because if we do things which
are unhealthy, then the consequence will be unhealthy. And we just
perpetuate that through time. And it's a cyclic thing where sometimes that if you
do something unhealthy, something unethical, the consequences will be
unhealthy, kind of, not necessarily unethical, the consequences, but will
carry with them some of the unhealthy or unwholesome qualities of the
original action. And this is particularly, I think true again, in our
psychology, the impact on our actions and our own psychology. And it's
cyclic, because as something unhealthy happens, the consequence, it predisposes
us to do more things which are unhealthy. If we do things which are
unhealthy, wholesome, then when the consequences are wholesome, that
predisposes us to do more of the same. So that's the second principle of karma,
the idea that the consequence is influenced or shaped or by the quality
of the original action. The third principle of karma, this karma theory, is that
the consequences of our actions and consequences of our wholesome actions
or unwholesome actions come into play out also over lifetimes. The idea that
there is multiple lifetimes and that the way that you'll be reborn when
you die will be very much influenced by the quality of the actions you did, the
things you did and the quality of them being ethical or unethical or wholesome
or unwholesome will influence how you get reborn. And it's a kind of an
extension of the second principle, but it's extended into rebirth. So some
people, when they talk about the karma, are talking about all three of these and
some of them people talk about only the first two because the idea of rebirth
is not so important for them. And so when people talk about karma, you have
to kind of listen to them more carefully and say, are the first two
principles or is it the third principle as well? And then you have to
decide, you know, it's up to you to decide if this teachings on rebirth has
any value for you or importance for you, if it motivates you to live a better
life. But regardless of whether you believe or not believe in rebirth, the
first two principles are the foundational to this teaching of karma. Your actions
have consequences and the consequences are shaped by the kind of the ethical
quality of the action itself. So consequences are shaped by the ethical
quality of the action. And it's all a call then to be careful, to be attentive,
to appreciate that you have choice. And the calmer you are, the more steady you
are, the more awake you are, the more you'll see all the choice points through
the day and you'll start choosing to live more wisely and ethically and
kindly. And it might seem like a lot of work to make all these
choices, but it becomes more like second nature and obvious that we're all
making choices all the time anyway, but we're not so conscious of it. And what
we do with meditation practice, we become more conscious of it and hopefully
become more conscious as we do so, more aware of all the unnecessary energy and
effort that goes in. And so this living a life of choice becomes more and more
effortless over time because we can live from a place of ease. So thank you. And
may you engage in good karma, good actions. Or as the Buddha said
sometimes when he talked about this karma, he talked about beautiful actions.
Sometimes it gets translated as good actions, but the word kalyana means
beautiful. And so if you live with beautiful actions, then there'll be
beautiful results. So may you live a beautiful life. Thank you.
