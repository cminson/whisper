Practice Note : Patient Abiding

One of the benefits of meditation practice is that some 
of the problems we have don’t get solved , but they get 
dissolved . They dissolve – they fade away. Certainly not 
all of them do. But one of the things that happens when 
we sit down, close our eyes, and just sit upright and be  
– be present for what is  – is that we make space for 
things to begin  to unwind, to let go, to soften, to relax, to 
fade away.  
 
Perhaps for some people, the clearest place where that 
is seen is with muscular tension. Just about any kind of 
ongoing activity in the way we live our lives will build up 
a little bit of tension , or a lot of tension , in our bodies. 
When we sit down to meditate , we might feel it in the 
shoulders, stomach, face, hands , whatever  place it 
might be. Within reason, it’s nice to relax a little bit if you 
can. But some tension  is not easy to relax. You can’t 
just soften the muscles by themsel ves. So, you feel this 
tension.  Then as you just sit with it  – sit upright, be 
aware of it, hold it in the awareness, just be present for 
it without trying to solve it  – it begins to dissolve . It 
begins  to relax and soften on its  own.  
 This can also be tr ue with some of the bigger problems 
in our lives. When we meditate, t hey can manifest in the 
moment with a certain mental tension, mental fixation, 
involvement, concern, or insistence. If we can just be 
present for it, clearly aware, we aren’t feeding it o r 
engaged in it. When t here’s a kind of stepping back an d 
being mindful and aware of it, t hen some of th e 
insistence of those thoughts and concern s, some of the 
preoccupation , begins to dissolve as well. The problem 
doesn’t necessarily go away. But the way  the mind 
relates to it begins to soften and relax.  
 
Sometimes what happens is  that when t he mind relaxes 
enough from its  insistent way of being involved with its 
concerns, then we get a different perspective o n our 
concerns. And very occasionally , we realize there 
wasn’t a problem to begin with , but the mind made it  a 
problem . When you can see it from a different point of 
view, you can say: “Well, it’s  okay to let that be .” Or, “I 
don’t ha ve to be worked up abou t that .” Or, “I can  let 
things take their course .” Or, “There’ re other ways to 
deal with it so that I don’ t have to be tense around  it” – 
all kinds of things.  
 
With this patient abiding , present abiding, just abiding, 
and letting awareness be as strong as you can, you are 
really here and present in a way that is quiet and still. 
Don’t make things into a problem. Just be with what is. 
And perhaps, just sitting here, many of the so -called problems will  dissolve  on their own. Y ou don’t have to 
be the one in charge , with an agenda of what’s 
supposed to happen.  
 
So, you might explore th is today as you sit and walk. 
See if there’s something about patient abiding with what 
is that is v ery mindful, and that shifts or settles 
somethi ng at its own pace, on its own terms. The 
momentum begins to slow down and we ar out , and you 
can just be – more and more still , quiet , and peaceful.
