So continuing this topic of exploring the teaching of not-self primarily through looking at what we take to be self. 
I just thought I'd recap a little bit what we've explored in the last few weeks around this, the last sessions around this. 
You know, basically starting with the teaching of not-self itself, what is that teaching? You know, what is it? What does it mean? How is it expressed? And I guess I would say in a nutshell, we could say that, well, two pieces. 
One is that it seems like there's a self. 
It feels like there's a sense of self. 
But what we, when we, when we don't look at that carefully, we will assume it's something that it's not. 
And so essentially, our sense of self, what we take to be I, me, is a misunderstanding. 
We are attributing a kind of a permanence or a kind of a traveling through time. 
Often this is the way it comes about. 
The sense of self feels like it's like traveling through time, that there is some thing or entity or being that is stable and traveling through time. 
But what the teachings of the Buddha point to is that this experience is simply a conditioned changing experience and that actually what that, that the experience of the sense of self is an arising experience that is kind of an ideal or a concept. 
One way to put it might be from the teaching of dependent origination, which talks about both how suffering comes to be and how a sense of self comes to be, that the sense of self is a response to wanting things to be a certain way. 
So that when we kind of out of out of a misunderstanding that having what I want will make me happy or having getting rid of what I don't want will make me happy out of a kind of a misunderstanding of that. 
When we get something that we want, then a sense of self springs into being in an attempt to or in a kind of a way to, in the service of that wanting to control or to manipulate or to continue that that direction. 
So the sense of self can be understood kind of as a set of patterns that are in the service of clinging and craving. 
So the teaching of not self is important in a way because it is through this misunderstanding that a lot of suffering is perpetuated. 
And this is really the key. 
It's not to understand not self just because it's a teaching of the Buddha, but it is to understand how what we take to be self contributes to suffering in our own experience and in the world. 
And so that's part of the investigation, part of the curiosity, and in exploring what we take to be self, often we do find, and I certainly found for myself, I had strong identifications around particular mental habits that were deeply tied to suffering, a strong habit of identification around self-hatred, a deep suffering pattern, other patterns of identification, a kind of an opposite pattern to that of I can do things really well. 
And in a paradoxical way, I found, you know, that those two patterns were dependent on each other. 
That the sense that I could do things really well was kind of holding a standard and ideal in the mind. 
And when I couldn't do everything really well, it was proven that I couldn't do everything really well, I would flip into the pattern of self-hatred. 
I'm a failure, I'm no good. 
And so both sides of that, I thought, I thought when I first started observing this, I thought I was supposed to get rid of the hatred side and just feel good about myself, you know, that I'm a good person, that I can do things well. 
But that identity itself was also suffering in that it was a setup or a kind of an ideal that I had to always achieve. 
And so this, as we start to look at these identities, as we start to get familiar with what we take to be self, we begin to see how they play into our patterns and habits of suffering. 
And this is really the key to this whole topic. 
It's not trying to come to some kind of abstract understanding of not self just for its own sake, but to understand what we take to be self and how we, how that is participating in how we are suffering. 
That it is a construction of mind, that it is conditioned. 
That sense of being the one, you know, the one who felt like they were a failure, that was a conditioned arising. 
The one who felt like she knew what she was doing, that was a conditioned arising. 
And so the understanding of that, what we take to be self, is this conditioned tumbling on essentially. 
And then last time, at a certain point, we also explored a piece of this, a piece of the identity, one major way in which we tend to construct a sense of self is around this area of control, of wanting to control, to fix, to hold onto. 
And that fits in very much, the Buddha actually highlights the sense of control as a key place where we identify. 
And he kind of component of the construction of the sense of self. 
And so, and that fits in very well with this sense of the sense of self being the arising in the service of craving and clinging. 
To control that I still, you know, that I can keep things that I have, that I can control my environment to be the way I would like it to be. 
And then last time we talked about studying possibly or recognizing a kind of identity connected to more relational exploration, like the kind of identities that we have, or that we put on other people, that we talked about selfing and othering. 
And the, you know, the othering piece, we can, we can other other people, and we can other ourselves, and we can be othered by other people. 
So that the the identities around other, or we could also, I talked about a little bit that there, that we can other in terms of individual, you know, particular people, but often the othering happens in terms of group identities, collective identities. 
And we create a sense of us versus them. 
And, you know, so that exploration not explicitly talked about as far as I know in the in the suttas, although there are places that the Buddha does speak about the conventional understanding of discriminations between people, just being conventions in the mind, that they're just ideas, they're just concepts, there's one particular sutta where the Buddha points to the number of ways that we often discriminated or kind of discern differences between people. 
And he lists the whole host of things, you know, the kind of hair you have, the kind of skin you have, the height, your height, your body, your gender, the way you make love, all kinds, he mentions all of these things. 
And he says, these are just conventions, you know, these just these, these are not inherent differences in human beings, it's just conventions that make these seem like differences between people. 
So he did speak to that, that that it is just concept essentially, these differences that we we have between people. 
But I think, you know, it is a place that's worth our exploration, especially in our culture, you know, this seems to be a major area of suffering, this othering, this discrimination, these identities, these us versus them, you know, it comes in political identities, in gender identities, in identities around race and religion and all kinds of differences that we kind of we delineate between people and decide who we like, who we don't like, we have ideas and views that we attach to groups based on those identities. 
And then we we tend to relate to individuals through our views about a group, rather than directly with an individual. 
And again, this is this is important to understand that this is large, this is, you know, this is conditioned. 
It's when I when we talked about it last time, I pointed to this being a very kind of natural process that unfolds in in our, you know, the way that we're brought up, we tend to gravitate to the people who look like us, who act like us, who do the things that we do. 
So there's a kind of a comfort in that. 
And then we tend to gravitate towards that comfort. 
And then if there's other other people doing different things or looking in a different way, it may create some discomfort. 
And so we we we feel a little bit of discomfort and we pull away. 
So that, you know, it's it's a natural part of our system that we tend to gravitate towards the comfortable, the familiar. 
But it is just conditioning. 
And so it doesn't have to be forever encoded this way. 
So we can, through awareness, through mindfulness, begin to notice when these these views and these ideas are influencing how we relate to each other. 
So there were a couple questions and I wanted to get to some questions this time. 
That's what I promised last time. 
There's one one question from the question submitted in advance. 
And I'll read this and just speak to it lightly. 
And then we'll see if there's any comments or questions in in the group about anything we've talked about in the last few weeks. 
So the the question is about collective identity. 
I'm curious about not self in the context of a collective identity, seeing self as separate or part of a whole, and how the self-group relationship affects the different decision-making models consensus top down or a combination. 
So I would say, you know, we all do, I think, have some collective identities. 
I mean, it's very natural, again, you know, that we would identify with, you know, for me, I identify as a female cisgendered. 
So I have a female sexual identity at birth and I feel like a female, although that was a process, I would say, and heterosexual middle-class, maybe upper middle-class from from my childhood well educated. 
So there's a whole bunch of different kind of groups or identities that white, you know, that that I have kind of a sense of of an association with. 
Now some of those are identities that kind of were given to me were put on me or kind of conditioned into me. 
The the the socio-economic class, that was conditioned into me. 
I mean, the the sense of of, you know, experience I have around financial security, you know, we had no financial insecurity when I was a child, and so that kind of was part of my experience. 
And so that's a part of my experience now. 
So that was just conditioned into me. 
And so some of these some of these identities are conditioned into us in that way. 
Some of them are ones that we pick up as we go through our lives, ones that we choose to bring to into our experience, and some of them are ones that are put on us. 
There are definitely times when I felt like when I was in the computer programming field, for example, you know, that I felt like I had the identity of female put on me. 
You know, that you know, the female engineer was not very common, you know, in in my when I was a computer programmer. 
There were some of us, but you know, so the identity of female wasn't one that I was particularly identified with in being a programmer, but it was one that was put on me and one that I felt some rub against, you know. 
So sometimes these these collective identities are put on us, and sometimes they are taken up by us, and sometimes they're just naturally conditioned into us. 
What I think is most important here, the question here about how does this affect different decision-making models, well I would say that the most important part of in terms of what we're exploring here in terms of the Buddhist understanding, the most important part is how do these identities affect choices that relate to suffering. 
When we make choices out of these identities, when we make choices othering other people, you know, if we're if if the choices that we're making are creating suffering in the world, then and those those are connected with the particular identities, those we need to really see. 
So it's this is all our own exploration. 
These identities, the collective identities very much are not our own doing, you know, they are cultural doings in a way, but they're not they're not just one individual creating it, creating these collective identities. 
These are these are identities that are that come through kind of a group conditioning in a way, and so the the way that we are conditioned into these all of our identities is it's not just what's happening to us, it's this kind of interweaving between what what happens in the world, how other people relate to us, how how the how we are related to in the world, how we relate to the world. 
So there's this interweaving in terms of choice and decisions and and that those choices and decisions we affect each other, and so there's this very much this looping or this interaction that happens in the choices that we make based of on our identities, those choices don't just end at our skin, they go out into the world, and so we need to be very aware of our choices and how they affect not only our experience, but how they affect others. 
Now the Buddha definitely talked about this. 
The the the teaching often that's that we talk about here in the West is very often focused on what's happening in this being, you know, looking here and seeing as they're suffering here, but the the Buddha really spoke over and over again around noticing not only how your your actions, your choices affect yourself, but how they affect others. 
He frequently said notice how it affects yourself and others and both. 
Is it causing affliction in self or other or both? He frequently talked about this and so this is this is the place this is the terrain to look with identities and suffering and choices are our choices based in particular identities or group identities. 
Are they creating suffering in the world? Now there are some times I think that that certain identities what I think is important is that we understand when identity that I what identities are. 
They are a construct. 
They are an agreement with oneself and one's others. 
It's not something inherent in who we are. 
It's a concept that we have adopted and those concepts can sometimes be useful and sometimes be harmful. 
And so sometimes, you know, for instance, you know, this is a this is a kind of a simple example in a way, but there was a period of time where I adopted the identity of being a meditator and that helped me to, you know, kind of support my ability and my interest in connecting with the practice really supported a letting go of some of that self-hatred, a lot of that self-hatred. 
And then there was a particular point where the identity of being the the meditator began to be suffering in itself. 
There was that, you know, that holding it up and then there's the success and failing around that. 
You know, I'm a good meditator. 
I'm a bad meditator. 
I'm failing at meditation and and so at that point, that identity then became something else to look at as a source of suffering. 
But it was useful for a time. 
For a long time, actually, it was really useful. 
And so, you know, it supported me in being able to navigate some of the really like wildly unhelpful mind states that the mind was in. 
And so there are times when identities, whether they're personal identities or collective identities, can be supportive. 
Just, it's important to understand that they are something that we're adopting for a period of time. 
They're not inherent. 
They're useful or not useful. 
Skillful or not skillful. 
So, just like mind states, can be skillful or not skillful. 
Identities can be skillful or not skillful. 
But still, it's helpful to understand that they are a conditioned, not a thing, not who I am, but just a frame that is supporting me in this moment. 
So, yeah, other other questions or comments that was that's so what I wanted to say about that that topic. 
Anything about the teaching or comment about this and you're let me just make sure you can unmute yourselves. 
Yes, you can unmute yourselves if you have a question. 
And I do want to continue recording this. 
So, if you prefer not to have your voice recorded, you can type in the chat. 
So, the question is it okay where you are? Are you safe from the fires and that to everyone? I am safe from the fires on the peninsula here. 
There were fires within 12 miles of me at one point, but at this point on the peninsula, in the last two days, the air has radically cleared and we can breathe again, which is wonderful. 
So, yeah, I know others others in various places are not so fortunate. 
So, yeah, it looks like Olga, you're still in some smoke, huh? Ali. 
Hi, Andrew. 
Hi, Ali. 
Thank you. 
So, the couple of things that came to me all speak fast so I can get to both of them. 
One is with my own, you know, identity as you were speaking with. 
It's just like I am of a, you know, Middle Eastern background male and then, you know, it just portrays us especially in the, you know, in the past, in the near future, near years as a certain type and then in order to, in some groups, I have had to probably drop the eye and go with the owl, you know, just to fit in with that group. 
No, I didn't quite understand you. 
Drop the eye and go with the. 
. 
. 
Yeah, the eye of the alley and then just I call myself like owl. 
Oh, I see. 
Okay, okay. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Just a no, no, no, no, not the eye itself, but the eye of my name. 
And just to fit in because of the basically economic reasons and then my projection of how am I seen or whatnot, spoken or not spoken. 
So that, that created and I have like, you know, cringed a bit inside as I have done that, but I have done it and then, but, you know, in these circles. 
. 
. 
I know in that circumstance what it sounds like there was a little bit of protection. 
Yes. 
From being othered. 
Yes, exactly. 
Yeah, yeah. 
And so it was a little bit of protection from that. 
Yes, exactly. 
And then so, yeah, that's, I guess, that part of it. 
I continue to investigate, but thank you, you know, in this, in this, in this circles and many other circles and I have, as I have aged, I'm way more, I don't really care, but that might be some of it is my own projection outward. 
I'm not sure it exists in every group or, I mean, in every encounter or not. 
That's first part of the question. 
And then the second part that I was going to also ask you to see if there has been studies of individual cultures versus the collective, how the self arises here is individualistic, more individualistic society. 
So just see me, I'm doing this, this and this and then some of the maybe Asian cultures are, I mean, there are more collective society, whereas the self is not really portrayed as an importance there, but the group identity is more emphasized. 
So both of those are kind of, I know it's like a long, long but. 
I mean, that's the second piece, you know, that's a really interesting thing. 
I don't know a lot about studies in that realm, but I think there probably are some studies in that. 
It does seem that there are different, you know, different cultures have different kind of norms around that and certainly in the United States we have this incredible individualistic mentality that I think in some ways is playing out around masks, you know. 
That's what's going on here. 
We've got this real individual mentality that the individual trumps the, you know, the good. 
The individual is more higher than the good, than the good of the collective. 
And so that, you know, that's that and I think in some other cultures that's not necessarily the case. 
And so, you know, I think we do see that playing out and so it's useful again to reflect on and see where is there suffering created by these identities. 
These, you know, I think that the tools the Buddha offered us are very general, you know, that the tools of looking at how are you identifying, what are you taking to be self, where are you identifying, you know, that and then and then to notice how that's connected with suffering. 
So that, you know, that I think that the tools are very general and we we don't and there's some certainly some help I think in in in various cultures in understanding something about, you know, the conditioning of that culture. 
It's useful to understand what the conditioning of a particular culture is so that we have some understanding about why or how, you know, things have come to be the way they are. 
But the key here again is around the suffering, you know, this like is this contributing to suffering. 
And certain times it might and certain times it might not. 
And the other piece, yeah, the piece you asked about uncertainty of whether the, you know, that whether it was projection around the being othered or not. 
I think that was the question. 
Is it, am I really being othered? Or is it my idea of being othered? And I think that's worth being curious about. 
You know, I think, I think it's it's hard, it's hard to know. 
But it's, there definitely are, I have definitely seen situations that, you know, somebody somebody would love to not have a particular identity. 
It's just it's being forced on them essentially, you know, so so that it happens that we are othered and we the the example of George Floyd being othered as a black man by the the police officer, you know, that seems seems a very powerful instance of the the othering that the, you know, the the sensing of of danger in the situation or, I don't know, it didn't look dangerous for the police officer, but you know, just something that there is this idea, you know, that that that was a clear sense of danger, you know, and so that there can be, I think, with certain certain situations and identities that that it feels like, well, this is dangerous. 
And it's worth honoring that because, you know, in in history or historically, there has been danger in that in that situation. 
And so they're taking care with that. 
But it is, you know, worth, especially if it's in a situation, maybe where it feels a little bit safer, you know, then it might be it might be worth exploring a little bit. 
What if I don't drop the eye on the end of my name? What happens, you know? Yeah. 
So, you know, I think it is mostly it comes back to exploration and curiosity. 
And yet take care of yourself, you know, do do take care to, you know, because some of these patterns around safety are there for a reason, you know, they're there because there has been danger in the past, or danger for for, you know, historically with your community, danger for others who look like you, or who have a name like yours, or for me, danger for a small elderly woman, you know, walking at dark after night, you know, in a particular neighborhood or not, you know, it's like, you know, that I have never had that danger myself. 
Personally, I've never been in that situation. 
But there's some way in which the collective understanding that there are women of my age of my weight, etc, who have been attacked, that affects me, you know, so it like comes, it comes in through, you know, the conditioning. 
And so there is a way in which I take care that, you know, so that so that that it's not, it's not just imagination, I think. 
Yeah, yeah, so it's time to stop. 
.
