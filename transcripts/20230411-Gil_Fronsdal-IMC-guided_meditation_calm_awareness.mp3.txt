Welcome you again to Insight Retreat Center where I'm teaching this week. And
I feel very kind of, I don't know what the right word is, cozy, comforted with a
topic for this week. It has to do with compassion. And the, and these morning
meditations this week that they are meant to be kind of a foundation for
compassion that supports it. So for this day I want to emphasize calm and to say
that there's always a choice and maybe it's not easy to find the choice but
there's always a choice to have a certain kind of calm when we meditate. And the
calm I want to emphasize today is calm awareness, calm recognition, calm feeling
what's going on, sensing what's happening, calm observing what's happening.
There's some capacity in the different forms of awareness that we use in
this Mindfulness Practice to let that be calm even if what we're being aware of
is agitation. So there's a moment, a place, a little location somewhere in
the field, in the place where we're aware from that that is calmly recognized
as agitation. So if there's a recognition then the mind would either
verbally or in some more silent way would have a clear but calm recognition.
Agitation, agitation is present. The, the, if there is discomfort anywhere we
would recognize discomfort. If the, if the place of calm awareness is a little
bit more embodied, like it almost feels like this feeling, the body can sense and
feel discomfort or agitation then feel that with the calm. That's the place of
for the Mindfulness. If there's more a sense of being the observer, a little
bit removed from the experience, stepping back in a sense and just
observing that's, and that's where calm is, then take that backward step and
observe the experience. If it's most calm to be intimate with the experience,
really close in, then really touch the experience, softly, maybe lightly, but
really be close. If it's more calm to step back and have a bird's eye view of
it, then the, the do that. So see if you can experiment with whatever is
happening to have a calm awareness. So assuming an upright posture and gently
closing your, your eyes.
And as you are right now, to just be aware of how you are calmly, is there
some way of just matter-of-factly recognizing how you are in the most
obvious way, that is calm, a calm knowing, a calm sensing.
And with that calmness, be aware of your breathing and now take maybe two or
three long, slow, deep breaths, relaxing as you exhale, settling in.
Then letting your breathing return to normal.
And settle in to your breathing, becoming aware of your breathing.
And if your breathing is, in any way, uncomfortable, be calmly aware of the
discomfort, the uncomfortable breathing, maybe without having a need for it to be
any different way.
If your breathing is comfortable, easeful, no
that calmly.
If, if there is discomfort in your body, it's tense or aches in some way hurts.
Know that calmly and this calm knowing, calm awareness might be fleeting, it might
just last a moment or two. And let yourself be content with that. That's
enough. And then do it again.
If your, if your mind is uncomfortable, you're agitated with your thoughts.
Know that calmly, calm recognition. This is how it is.
If you have emotions which are challenging or uncomfortable, know that
calmly and tranquility of awareness.
As you're aware of your breathing, finding a way to become
aware, maybe even calmingly aware, aware so something becomes more peaceful,
tranquil.
If you're agitated, you're aware of that calmly, being aware in a way, in a way
that is calming for yourself.
If you're agitated, you're aware of that calmly, being aware in a way
that is calming for yourself, being aware in a way that is calming for yourself.
If you're agitated, you're aware of that calmly, being aware in a way, in a way
that is calming for yourself, being aware in a way that is calming for yourself.
If you're agitated, you're aware of that calmly, being aware in a way
that is calming for yourself, being aware in a way that is calming for yourself.
If you're agitated, you're aware of that calmly, being aware in a way
that is calming for yourself, being aware in a way that is calming for yourself.
If you're agitated, you're aware of that calmly, being aware in a way
that is calming for yourself, being aware in a way that is calming for yourself.
As you're aware of breathing, body, mind,
whatever you're aware of, if you can be aware of it calmly, lightly,
can you find in the middle of that or next to it some care, some motivation,
or impulse to care, or have compassion, the simplest form of compassion.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
Aware with calm compassion, aware with tranquil love, even of what is difficult here and now.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
For now, it doesn't need to do anything.
And then as we come to the end of the sitting, to consider for a moment or feel for a moment,
the compassion that might be, a companion of calm or tranquility,
a compassion or a love that has no room when the mind is agitated in a hurry, reactive,
the simplest form of care.
And if you were going to live this day with care, with compassion,
that came from being calm, calm, compassionate, calmness,
how might you live your day differently?
How might you live your day informed by a calm love, calm compassion,
compassionate, calm?
Would you live differently if you were informed by compassion, care, love or kindness?
Live differently in the small details of your life
or in the large areas of your life.
And may our care for the world somehow be carried out into the world
on these words. May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful,
may all beings be free.
Thank you.
