 How many people are here today who are new? They weren't here last week. Do we have any more metasutas? I think there's some of the table out there. The only handout last week was a copy of the metasuta, which you can pick up on the way out today. The expectation. It's a little bit loud today. That's a little bit better? Can you all hear okay? You can put it down on the table next to the chair there. The only handout from last time is the copy of the metasutta, which if you're going to be in this class you have to memorize. That's part of the deal. I didn't say this, but I was expecting you to have memorized for today. When I mentioned that to someone, they were shocked. How could that be so soon? Some of you might have memorized it. Does anybody memorize it? Who would like to recite it? First three lines. If you don't mind standing. This is what should be done by those who are skilled in goodness and who know the path of peace. Let them be able and upright. Straightforward. Straightforward and gentle in speech. Humble and now conceited. Unburdened with duties. And comforted and easily satisfied. Let them not do a single thing which the wise would later reprove. Not proud and demanding in nature. Wishing in gladness and in safety. May all beings be at ease. Whatever living beings there may be, whether they are weak or strong or many known, the mighty or the great, medium, small or short. The seen and the unseen. Those living near and far away. Those born and to be born. Let all beings be at ease. Let none despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another. This is my favorite line, something that we should love to everybody. Even as a mother who with her very life protects her child, her only child. So with an unboundless heart should one cherish all beings. Radiating kindness over the whole world, but there's nothing before that. Radiating kindness over the entire world. Spreading upwards to the skies and downwards to the depths. Outward and unbounded. Free from hatred and ill will. Whether standing or walking seated or lying down. Free from drowsiness. One should sustain this recollection. This is said to be the sublime abiding. By not holding on to fixed views, the pure hearted void, with clarity and vision, being freed from all sense desires, will not be born again into this world. Great. Thank you so much. It's a little refining, but the spirit was there. It was great. Thank you very much for doing that. I love reciting it. Every time I hear, it's like a reflection for me when I hear the words or speak the words and be reminded about some of the values in it. It's a wonderful inspiration for me. It's a wonderful thing to memorize. One of the main reasons, two reasons I wanted you to memorize it for this class. This is a concentration class. There's a relationship between how we use our mind to memorize something and then to recall something from memory, and how we use our mind to be concentrated. As you're memorizing the text, pay attention to what happens in your mind, how you use your mind to memorize. Not only, you might notice difficulties you have, the stray thoughts and the distractiveness and the judgments that might come in. But more specifically, when you're actually doing it well or succeeding, how is it you're using your mind when you're being successful at holding a phrase or holding the whole sutta in your mind? What's the felt sense in your psyche, in your mind, when you're holding something like that? Maybe initially when you're first trying to memorize it, it's kind of tense and stressful. But as you get into it and as you learn it and as it becomes easier and easier, how is it you're holding it in your mind? What's the flavor in your mind? And as it becomes second nature to do it, but still there has to be kind of focus, that focus that you're using to hold the sutra in mind might help you a lot with how to hold your mind in meditation when you want to concentrate in meditation. Because sometimes in meditation, in a sense, you want to use your mind in a different way than how you usually use it in everyday life, especially when you're doing concentration practice. And my idea was by memorizing that you can get kind of another way in to learning that there's a different way of using your mind. Because you have to use your mind differently. You're forced to when you're trying to memorize. So that's my hope that you do. You study that and pay attention to what happens to you in the process of memorizing. And the second reason is that once you have something memorized, then it becomes a concentration device. And you can repeat it. And the repetition of it tends to focus the mind and concentrate the mind, stabilize the mind. And there are times when if you're really agitated, for example, and restless, that's really helpful to have something memorized, you recite it, maybe even out loud. And some people hold on to that as an anchor in very desperate situations and really see a person through great difficulties. But even when you're not greatly agitated, sometimes people find just having something to chant at the beginning of a sitting is a way of kind of getting yourself concentrated. And then once you're concentrated, you can continue with the concentration meditation as you usually do it, or you can switch over to Vipassana practice. So please memorize the text. And I'm hoping next week someone else will volunteer. In the course of the five weeks, four people do it individually. And then last week, when everybody has to memorize by then, unless you, you know, I'll do it together, out loud. So, and the other requirement for the class, for those of you who are new, is to sit for 45 minutes every day during the course of this five weeks. And it doesn't have to be continuous. It can be broken up to sittings, you know, 20, 25 minutes, what works for your life. But the total should be 45 minutes each day. One of the really important principles for developing concentration is that of continuity. That the continuity of the practice is one of the really important factors that creates concentration. And that's often overlooked because many of us will measure how we're doing in the moment and decide we're not concentrated or not working or do something. But, and we think we have to do more. And there is something we have to do in applying ourselves to the practice. But simply applying ourselves and staying in there in the continuous ways to continuity that build something over time. The analogy for this that's used in the suttas is that of starting a fire by rubbing two sticks together. And if you rub two sticks together to start a fire, and you're rubbing for a while, then you decide to go get tea. And you come back and pick up your sticks and start again, then you say, well, it's time to go pee now. And then you come back after a while and rub them again and say, well, this is kind of tiring. I think I'll come back tomorrow. You're not going to build up enough critical friction to create a spark. And the same thing with concentration, with meditation. You have to have a continuity of practice in order for some kind of momentum to be built. And without the momentum being built, it's very hard for deeply concentrated states to arise. So in terms of daily life practice, if you sit once a day, then it's sitting every day. And if you sit three days in a row and then decide to go on vacation for three days, and then start up again for a couple of days, and then off again, that on and off again is certainly valuable. It's always valuable to meditate. But what you're not getting is the benefits of the continuity, the momentum that's created day after day, which is very, very significant. And it's kind of invisible in a sense. You don't actually see how you're doing it. It's like a thing you're doing except you're showing up and just doing it and doing it. And the same principle applies on retreats. The continuity on retreats is really important. So it's the continuity of your practice which builds concentration. If you decide to sit for a sitting and then go take a bath or take a nap, and then I'm really going to apply myself now and I get back, and you apply yourself for another hour, and then you go get tea, that doesn't really allow the benefits of continuity to occur. And you might have tremendous willpower and dedication to keep practicing for those one or two hours here and there. But if you're much more gentle and relaxed about the practice, at ease about it, but do it continuously to have a continuity, the continuity will bring the power, a lot of the power of the practice. I wanted to read you this opening of this paper that I have that's written by Eleanor Rauch, who's a professor of psychology, a Buddhist psychology actually, at UC Berkeley. It's an academic paper she wrote. It opens with this story. Some years ago I was questioned by a visiting Tibetan monk about how psychology was studied in the West. Carefully, I tried to delineate our fields of psychology. Cognition with its sub-areas such as attention and memory, personality psychology, development, and so forth. He looked puzzled. I attempted to explain what we meant by empirical method. He seemed even more puzzled. I talked about operational definitions and described some psychological experiments. Suddenly his look of intensely interested bewilderment turned to one of aha. So, he said, you are saying that in America people teach and write about psychology who have no meditation practice? Yes, of course, I said. And he said, but then how can they know anything? And then, giving me a piercing look, he said, do you think that's ethical? Is it ethical to study the mind without studying your own first? So, concentration is one of the avenues into studying our mind, getting to know our mind. It's a concentrated mind that has the ability to really see deeply into our own psyche. In fact, the Buddha said, he kind of wanted the kind of imperative declarations he makes in the sutta, which he says, develop concentration. The Buddha was really into the importance of developing concentration. Develop concentration for one who is concentrated sees things as they are. We usually think of the expression seeing things as they are as being vipassana practice. And it is in a sense, but he says, develop concentration. Then you can see better. Vipassana is often talked about as seeing things, not having different kind of experience, but seeing your experience in a different way. Concentration is one of the great aids to learning how to see things in a different way. Certainly see it clearer what's going on, but often it changes the perspective of what's going on in our life. It happens over and over again in my own life, where I'm consumed and concerned about something, and I feel like I'm trapped in a box, I don't know how to get out or how to figure it out. And then I meditate and get still and quiet and concentrated. And sometimes there's a very different perspective of the possibility and the potential and what's really the issue at hand or what the problem is or what's not the problem after all. Concentrated state changes a lot, changes how we see things. Concentration is, I think, concentrated states, developing concentration. It's probably much more common than is often realized. And many people who complain that they have no ability to get concentrated, some of it's sometimes true. But sometimes we overlook how in daily life there's many situations where we do get concentrated. I think often children who don't have tension problems can naturally fall into sometimes very deep states of concentration. And I've known people, and it was my own situation, that when I started doing my meditation practice, I recalled states that I'd entered into as a child, which I had long since forgotten. So it's kind of returning memories, really good memories, really feeling whole and healthy and at home in the world that I experienced as a child. One of them was, part of my growing up was in Italy. And when I was about 11 or so, I took the public transportation, the bus, into town to go to school and the bus home. And we lived at the end of the bus route, right near the end. And I noticed that if I sat, back then they had the bus driver and the conductor who sold the tickets. And at the end of the route, the conductor would sit in a certain place every time, and he would tally up how many tickets he sold in this ledger, how many in one way, how many round trips, how many children, whatever he did. And I learned that if I sat right behind him and looked over his shoulder as he concentrated on his work, I would feel tremendous sense of well-being, very peaceful, very at home, very still. And until years later, I'd get some sense of what was going on. I just knew it was great. And I would always sit in that place, so I could sit there with him. And it was my daily meditation practice. And I was kind of rioting on his concentration or rioting on something there. Somewhat to be provocative in the past or to be evocative, I've said that the amount of concentration you need to meditate is the amount of concentration you have when you take the written exam, the DMV. I don't know how it is from all of you, but at least for me, that I'm pretty focused when I'm taking that test. You know, I want to get out of there. I want to be finished. My mind doesn't wander that much. I'm just much less than when I meditate. That ability to concentrate is right there sometimes. If fear is part of it, then the fear will encourage you also. But back to how I felt as a child, the sense of well-being, sitting behind the bus driver, the sense of being at home, the sense of delight and joy. I felt very much in my body at that time, kind of feeling of warmth, a sense of well-being, kind of waving through my chest and my shoulders and my belly. And it points that concentration is more than just one-pointedness. It's more than just thinking that the mind has to be one-pointedly focused. It is an awakening or arousing of other factors also. And it's having a sense and appreciation that it's more than just developing one-pointed concentration. I think it's very helpful for knowing how to get concentrated, to begin recognizing some of the other factors that are getting aroused as you get concentrated. And we'll talk about more of that as we go along in these weeks. The word concentration is samadhi, which we talked about last week. The word samadhi is often translated into English as concentration. I don't think I said this last week. My favorite translation of it is composure. Did I say this last week? Because the word sum in samadhi is the same as our word khan, with. And the word, the dhi part, in its root, means to stand or to pose. And so to compose, it makes a very nice, at least literal translation of the etymological origins of the word samadhi, to be composed. And I like that a lot because composure is something you do with your whole being, your whole body. You compose yourself on your experience. Rather than thinking it's purely a mental thing of focusing your mind. Certainly that focus is an important part of concentration, but it's a composing ourselves around that experience. And so much more of you is involved in just this one mental factor of focusing. How can you compose yourself around the experience? In order to be composed, you have to pay some attention to what you do with your body. How you hold your body. How your body relates to what you're trying to do. Are you composed in doing this? Are you settled and stable? So the image is often used for a stable meditation instead of being a mountain. Imagine yourself as a big pyramid-like mountain. Some people like to use the word concentric to be a translation of concentration, because it's bringing things together into a center. So rather than concentrating, if you focus on one thing, concentric, somehow these people imply bringing everything together onto that center. And then I've seen people then differentiate that with, contrast that with being eccentric. And most of us are eccentric. And at least in meditation, you're being asked to be concentric. Eccentric means you're outside the center, outside of yourself in a sense. And concentric then is everything is harmonized, everything works together, everything is integrated together, the sense of integration and connectedness. It's part of the reason why I think a lot of people feel at home when they get some degree of concentration. The word for one-pointedness in Pali is ekagata. And so I want you to learn that there's a different word for one-pointedness than the usual word for concentration, which is samadhi. Samadhi is a different factor than one-pointedness. One-pointedness is one particular mental factor. In some of the later Abhidharma literature, they enumerate that there are 33 to 35 mental factors involved in getting into the first jhana, first deep state of concentration. That's a lot of mental factors to harness and get together. Luckily, most of them happen without, you know, are needing to organize or take care of it. But there's many different things that come together to create a samadhi. And ekagata, one-pointedness, is one of those things. And some people emphasize it's the lead thing, it's the main thing. If you have enough of this ekagata, one-pointedness, it gathers around it. All the other factors, it pulls them in together and is kind of like a magnet for the others if you hold at one-pointedness. But it can also work the other way. And that is, if you focus or develop some of the other supporting factors for concentration for samadhi, outside of the one-pointedness, it's actually possible to enter into a samadhi without necessarily having a very strong one-pointed focus. Some of the various states of samadhi that can arise, one-pointedness isn't the one necessary factor for developing concentration. The other thing is concentration or samadhi, samatha practice or concentration practice, is different from vipassana practice. And I want to talk about some of those things because most of us here have been doing vipassana practice. And to really clearly see that there's a different practice might be helpful when you're doing samadhi practice itself. You don't try to confuse the two. One of them is that when you do concentration practice, there are such things as distractions. When I teach vipassana, I emphasize that when you do vipassana, there are no such things as distractions. So you're allowed to have distractions when you do concentration practice. And which means that you have to be wise about how you relate to so-called distractions. Because what you're trying to do in samadhi practice is in a sense develop some kind of one-pointedness on one thing. And distractions, anything that takes you away from that. And if it takes you away too many times or too powerfully, it's very hard to develop that stability or composure on one thing. So that's why if you want to develop concentration practice, it's helpful to practice in an environment which is peaceful and calm and hopefully quiet. Hopefully some way you can reduce the number of disturbances around you if that's possible. It's helpful to have a clean environment, an orderly environment. So everything is self-consupportive of the concentration practice. You don't want to be neurotic about this. You don't want to start getting earplugs and eye patches to cover your eyes or shooting your neighbors. Because you also want to be realistic. You can put yourself in a sensory deprivation tank and enter into samadhi that way if you really... One of the things you're developing is also part of developing concentration is developing a strong ability to develop samadhi, inner strength. And that inner strength needs to become stronger than the forces of distraction. So in the suttas there's descriptions of the Buddha sitting in deep samadhi states and having 500 oxen carts pass by on the dirt road in front of him, which is where he's sitting. And when he comes out of meditation, he said he didn't hear it. He's so concentrated, so focused that he's not aware of the environment around you. Generally when you do vipassana practice, we're not encouraging you to have that kind of... Sometimes that happens in vipassana, but you're not aware of your environment anymore. But it's not put up as being kind of the point of the practice. When you enter into deep states of concentration, that often happens. The environment, sensory inputs from the environment tends to fall away. So when you have a distraction, rather than ending your meditation, you want to then try to override it by developing a stronger focus, a stronger strength of being focused. So take it as a challenge. And we'll talk more next week about how to work with all obstacles, and many kinds of obstacles that get in the way of concentration. But it might be helpful for you to realize there are distractions, and do what you can to minimize those distractions within reason. There are also prerequisites for concentration. I talked some about this last time, and this time I'll talk about it from a little different angle. Prerequisites means you don't just simply plop down on your cushion and just throw yourself into getting concentrated. It's helpful to use prerequisites in terms of how you prepare yourself for that particular meditation practice, and the prerequisites in terms of the kind of understanding you bring to bear to the practice before you start it. It's very helpful to have some... both for vipassana and for concentration practice, to have some good understanding of what the practice is. So the first thing you need to understand with concentration practice is the value of getting concentrated. And we talked a lot about that last week, but you need to review that and think about it and really reflect for yourself. Do you understand how valuable it is to be concentrated? And from that sense of feeling value and concentration, then hopefully there's a sense of inspiration. And inspiration is one of those 35 mental factors that supports developing a concentration that can support it. The second thing you need to understand is what the practice actually is. Really understand what the practice is you're doing. The specific practice, how to do it, what it takes, how it's done. You feel like you at least theoretically know what the practice is about. You've got good instructions. If you don't understand the instructions, you ask questions. And when you sit down, you feel like this is what I'm going to do now. I'm going to really apply myself with the breath. I'm going to stay with the breath. This is what it's all about, this being with the breath. When other things arise, I'm going to try to be wise about how to relate to them so I can get back to the breath as quickly as I can. This is not vipassana practice. It's not about learning how to work with these other distractions or work with the kind of forces that... in the same way. So is it not trying to penetrate it or learn how to be free of it while allowing it to continue? The concentration practice, learning how to be free from things by learning how to develop a stronger concentration to basically avoid them. There's a lot more to be said next week about this, but part of concentration practice, it's a seclusion practice or a sensory restriction practice. It's a practice we restrict our attention. Vipassana sometimes is talked about a practice which opens attention to how we become unlimited and wide, expansive. Concentration is a restrictive practice and we're composing ourselves on something very particular as opposed to all possible things. But to understand this is what I'm doing. Right now I'm really going to develop my composure on this particular thing. Are there issues? Are there thoughts? Are there ideas? Are there things that I could be working on? I'm not going to do that now. This is what I'm going to work on for now. Hopefully understanding what the practice is gives you some sense of confidence. This is what you're going to do. The other side of that is it's helpful to know what the practice is not. It's not working on your psychological problems. It's not working on great ideas. It's not trying to figure something out. It's not trying to... There's a lot of things that... It's a very, very, very simple task. And the simplicity of it is simply to get still and quiet and peaceful composed on one particular thing and to have all the different elements of your psyche engage together harmoniously on that one particular thing. So it's a simplification practice. As opposed to... Many of us are addicted. They're very strong programming to be working on all kinds of issues that we meditate. And concentration practice is a reprogramming or it's breaking old habits of how we use the mind and learning new ones. And learning something very simple. Learning how to let go. A lot of it is letting go. Just letting go of everything else besides the one thing you're focusing on. The other thing that's helpful is a prerequisite for doing concentration practice. Is to appreciate your own potential to change. To change your mind, to change your heart, to change your psyche. And to have great respect for your own capacity to change. Some of us have no confidence that we can change. But all of us can change. All of us have within us the potential to become awakened, to be fully awakened. We have the potential of becoming freer, becoming more loving. And to have great respect for that potential, I think is very helpful for developing a meditation practice. I think it's actually a lot easier if you come to yourself with respect and care. And so can you find some modicum of respect and care for yourself? And it's epidemic in our culture that people don't have that. People have come with the opposite. They don't have respect for themselves. They have to come with a sense of lack of self-worth. But your respect doesn't have to be for what you can do so much, but rather for this potential that you have. And the potential, it's helpful to think of the potential within you as not being personal. Because if you think it was being personal, then it gets tied up with all kinds of personal issues and ideas you have. But this potential for awakening and love and compassion that you have within you is not a personal thing. Every human being has it. It's not there because of your personality, but rather it's inherent in who you are, this potential. So understanding the value of concentration, understanding something about what the practice is and isn't, understanding your potential for change and respecting it. And the fourth thing is to understand something about what might happen to you as you develop concentration. When we do Vipassana practice, at least me and many teachers don't want to suggest that anything particular is going to happen to you. We'll say Vipassana practice is not about any particular thing happening to you, it's how you relate to what's happening, how you see it. It's not about developing some great state or getting a right state, it's just about learning how to be present for all states without choosing, like choice as awareness. Concentration practice is about developing some states, is about particular experiences. So it's a very different direction for the practice that's going. So having some sense of what direction you're going in is one of the things that will help you develop concentration. What might you expect as you're doing the practice? What might happen? If you have some sense of the various things that might happen as you develop concentration, hopefully it will provide you with some patience and some trust in the process. If you know, for example, that continuity is one of the keys to practice, then you might have more... Continuity takes time. Then you might be more trusting and patient to what arises. If you know that concentration practice often works like to dislodge repressed material in the psyche, and suddenly you might be bombarded by all kinds of things, and you know that that's fears and angers and memories, if you know that that's part of the process, then, oh, you can be patient about that and say, oh, I was told this might happen, I'll go back to the breathing. I won't engage in it or think I'm a failure. If you know that you might have memories arise, long since forgotten, if you know that you've been told you might start writing the great American novel or even a great creative idea, then you may be more less likely to be derailed by those and say, okay, I know this might happen, I'm just going to be patient and stay there. If you know that when you first sit down to meditate, the first day or two in retreat, the first 20 minutes of the sitting or whatever, that there's a tremendous amount of momentum from your daily life of agitation, of thoughts, of concerns, of things, and that's what you expect to have momentum. That has to work itself out of the system, and part of it is just patience. You can't suddenly expect the momentum of your life to stop just like that, just because you'd like it to stop. You have to be very respectful of the momentum that's built up by how you've been living your life up until that moment you sit down to meditate. And then to be wise about how to practice with that momentum, not to be patient with it, not to fight it, but just very matter of fact, it's a very simple concentration practice, not being derailed by the fact that it's not working very well, you're agitated or restless for a while. Concentration states are very susceptible to the attitude that you have, the attitude you're carrying. So you have to be very careful with the attitude you have when you're practicing Samadhi. If you have an attitude of defeatism, if you have an attitude of self-critical judgment, if you have an attitude of pride, if you have an attitude of impatience, all those things have a very powerful influence on what happens to you as you, you know, in these kinds of states, and they can derail you quite strongly. So you have to have some sense of your attitude. What's the attitude in which you're practicing? Be very careful with that. You can respect, patience, trust, are very important elements. So that's what I want to say for now. And what I'd like to do now is to have us sit again, this time with a little bit more guided meditation. If you'd like to stand for a minute, you've been sitting for a while. Is the speaker system working okay for people? Everyone's happy with it? It won't be a long sitting because I have a lot to say. And the class time is not going to add up much to your 45 minutes. Don't depend on the class to fill your requirement for the day. Busted, huh? So compose yourself. Take a posture. Compose yourself with your posture. And then in the beginning of every sitting, it's helpful if you have a set-up procedure, some little procedure, some ritual, a way that you have to help you get settled, to remind you to be here, to let go of the tension of the day. I find it very helpful to take a few long, slow, deep breaths and the exhalation to let go of whatever tension or stress that might be easy to let go of. Concentration practices are, I think of as being embodied practices. It's very important to be embodied. And so to use the set-up time or the beginning of the sitting to somehow or other embody your body, take some deep breaths and feel your whole body as you breathe. And then you can return your breath to normal. And since this is a ksamadhi practice, in vipassana we say don't control your breath. If you find it useful, especially in the first 5-10 minutes of a sitting, it can be helpful to control your breathing a little bit, perhaps to breathe a little bit more fully than usual. So there's a little bit of conscious effort involved with each in-breath and out-breath. It's a way of that conscious effort helping you to stay connected, being involved, engaged. So the conscious effort to breathe helps center you on this phenomenon of breathing. And you want to feel the in-breath as carefully as the out-breath, the out-breath as carefully as the in-breath. And the operating word is feeling. We're switching from thinking to sensing the breath. And then you want to develop as much continuity of sensing the breath as possible. So you sense the beginning, middle, and end of the breath, the in-breath, of the out-breath. If the word makes sense to you, compose yourself around the breathing. Compose yourself within your breathing. As you continue a session of meditation on the breathing, chances are that your breathing will change as you continue sitting. And it's helpful to know, to track how it's changing as you stay with it. When you first sit down, it might be tight or short or tense. As you relax, it might become deeper and fuller. Then as you get more settled, it might become light and slow and very subtle. It might even disappear. No awareness, no sense of breathing at all. You want to be very patient and not be ahead of yourself, expecting it to be different than it is. But if you start becoming familiar with how it does change, then you can kind of track how it's going. Oh, now the breath is like this, kind of that stage of breathing. And then later, you know, now it's changed to that. And then as a way of helping you develop the concentration, you can begin counting the breaths, 1 to 10. If you lose count, start over again at 1. And give a count to the exhalation. And make the count right in the middle of the exhalation. Let your interest be with the breathing. If you find yourself interested in anything else, let go of that other thing. Just be with your breathing, the counting. Develop a strength of letting go. So you can really let go of anything else. And now continue counting the breath. And now, each time you count, give the count at the end of the exhalation, just as it ends. And notice if there's any differences in how you feel, the concentration, or anything at all, between counting in the middle of the exhalation versus counting at the end. And now continue counting, but now count at the very beginning of the exhalation, just as it begins, or even just the instant before. And how is that different for you? And then to end the sitting, and this is usually what you should do at the end of every sitting for the concentration class, is to spend a minute or two reviewing what that sitting was like. What happened, how you applied yourself, what the quality of your effort was, your enthusiasm, your interest. Not to be judgmental, but just very matter of fact, so you can learn from your experience, so you can compare different sittings over the week and the weeks, and see the patterns. So there are many different techniques for developing a concentration. For this class we're using the breath and the counting. And you might find it interesting to move around where you do the counting. How many found that interesting, the differences? And sometimes you can use the differences in your favor. So if sometimes you can use the differences in your favor, sometimes if you're sleepy, for example, you might find that maybe counting at the beginning of the exhalation makes you more awake, or simply varying it keeps you more awake or keeps you interested. Or if you find yourself very agitated or very tense, maybe counting in the middle and drawing it out, one, changes how you are. Or if you're very agitated and it's very hard to stay focused, you find yourself drifting off a lot, you might find that giving a count to both the inhalation and the exhalation in the beginning helps you get on track. One, one, two, two, like that. But you can experiment with that and play with different ways and learn how it affects you and find what works best for you in different ways. In developing meditation practice, especially for concentration, there are two factors, many factors involved, as I keep saying, but there are two factors that are very important. One is the factor or the possibility of relaxing. A deep samadhi state is a very relaxed state. The other is to be alert. We don't always know how to hold those two together. Some of us are really attached to being relaxed and we just go into the relaxed state and fall asleep. In a samadhi state, I don't know if this is true, but they talk this way, that you want your body to fall asleep but your mind to be wide awake. Both these things are going on, deep relaxation, physical relaxation, mental relaxation, but also a kind of vitality and alertness in the mind. It's really clear, it can get crystal clear in a way, like you woke up from a great nap. These are two different factors, alertness, also effort. Relaxation and effort, applying oneself are important. It's important to look at these and see how they work. Relaxation is a very important element. If you know some of the signs of relaxation, notice how you get relaxed. What happens to you is you get relaxed. It can be very helpful to nourish along the process of developing concentration. Part of relaxation is loosening unnecessary control. Sometimes relaxation is frightening for people because they don't want to give up control. But there's a lot of unnecessary control that we give up when we practice concentration. There is some control involved, controlling the mind to be present for the object of concentration. We're letting go of control of knowing, for example, or figuring things out, or manipulating, or being right, or always... It's a lot of different things we let go of. Unnecessary control. Understanding how you get stressed and how you hold stress in your body and mind. Your relationship to stress can be helpful. Some people are really attached to their stress because some people think that stress is what gets them by in life. They're more confident, more capable in their work or in their life. They think that people will like them more if they're hyped up. Some people rely on stress to avoid facing themselves because if you're really always hyped up and stressed out, you don't have to turn the attention back and really see deeply what's going on. Sometimes stressful states are often outwardly directed what has to be done. We need to acknowledge the stress that we carry with us. Vipassana practice, of course, is very helpful if you have a strong Vipassana practice for doing concentration because you have the skills of seeing clearly what's there. We need to understand our stress. And sometimes understand the source of it. Understand how it gets relaxed, how it gets released as we meditate. The process of it is relaxing. I carry stress in my shoulders. It's the burden of my sense of responsibility that I carry with me. I sit down, sometimes I meditate, and one of the things I'm aware of is how I carry it in my shoulders. I'm not aware of sometimes going around being a responsible kind of guy. But when I sit down to meditate, then I'm aware of it. And one of the things that happens is that begins to relax and release. I know that's part of the deal. I don't get upset with myself that I'm tense and aching there. That's part of the deal. I wish I could live my life wiser, but somehow that's one that still catches me. And luckily I meditate. But there are signs of relaxation. And it's helpful, I think it might be helpful if you know some of the signs. What happens to you as you relax, and tracking what happens to you as you get concentrated, helps the concentration process. One of the things that happens sometimes is that the body starts feeling heavier. Sometimes it feels lighter. A lightness sits in or a heaviness sits in. Sometimes when there's a lot of adrenaline flowing in the system or a lot of stress, adrenaline has a way of lifting a person up. And sometimes when adrenaline falls away, the body comes back to earth. Sometimes the body feels heavier, the shoulders feel heavier as we relax. Sometimes as the relaxation deepens, the sense of lightness in the body begins to occur. Sometimes it goes from heaviness to lightness, sometimes from lightness to heaviness. But the sense of weight in the body, the sense of solidity in the body, shifts and changes as you develop concentration. And sometimes in the beginning stages of concentration, I find my body feels very home in it, but it tends to feel very solid. As the concentration deepens, my sense of my body becomes almost ethereal. Sometimes it even disappears. There can also be tingling and warmth on the skin that occurs. There's a classic idea that when you're stressed, sometimes the blood leaves the extremities. And when you relax, the blood goes back to your fingers, for example. You can raise the temperature of your hand by relaxing. Sometimes you can feel that warmth spreading through your body. Some people get cold when they meditate, so they shouldn't feel bad. I don't know why that is. Some people find they get warmer when they meditate. And just to recognize that, this is a sign of relaxation, things are going along that way. One of the interesting things that can happen as you relax is that things get worse. Unacknowledged tensions get revealed, and you can start feeling aches and pains. And to know that that's part of the deal, to know that when you sit down, I know that I'm often to feel the tension in my shoulders. Oh, that's just part of the deal. Meditation is not making me worse. It's like suddenly I'm getting tense in my shoulder because I meditate. It's revealing the tensions already there that I'm unconscious of. And there's a whole series of tensions that can reveal themselves as we meditate. And to know that that's the case, and be very patient with that, very accepting of it. Oh, it's there because of causes and conditions in the past. It's there because of the way I've carried myself around in life. I can't expect it to go away just like that, but it can go away as I continue practicing, it will begin to unravel. And the other, which I talked about in the sitting, is your breathing itself can change as you get more relaxed. And to track how it's changing also can help the process of developing concentration. To know how your breath is, how your street breath is. Maybe you normally carry a short, tight breath fast. Then know as you relax that it starts getting longer, softer, more relaxed, more open, deeper. Then to know that maybe after a certain point it goes in the opposite direction again. It gets very short, a very deeply concentrated state. The breath gets more and more subtle and sometimes very, very short or very little movement goes on there. Hardly notice any movement at all. You don't have a deep, really deep, excellent breath anymore. You have this very tight little movement that goes on. And sometimes the breath seems to stop entirely. Other signs of relaxation. Some people will see colors as they develop and get concentrated. Some people will see images. Some of them develop a great sense of space, of being very spacious. Some sense of lightness, a great sense of physical and bodily lightness. Some people feel very grounded. Some people feel increasingly at home in themselves. There are many, many different ways you can feel. But there is a change that takes place as you go into a samadhi state, as you get concentrated. And to be a little bit cognizant and aware of those changes and be wise in relationship to them. Don't anticipate them. Don't be upset if they're not there, not happening quickly enough for you. But to notice, when they do occur, to notice them and appreciate them. And I believe the appreciation and noticing of them and tracking of them helps the interest. Of staying focused and developing concentration. It helps keep you on track. It's kind of like using a biofeedback system. Where you use this to feedback or to keep you on track and to do what you're doing. So there's a lot of relaxation that can happen when you meditate. Some people think of meditation as the place they're going to relax. They use that for their purposes. There's nothing wrong with that. What I would recommend to all of you, if it's possible, try to relax before you meditate. It's really good if you're already relaxed by the time you sit down to meditate. Then you might say, why should I meditate then? There's much more beneficial things you can get from meditation than just relaxing. So if you can even just take 5 or 10 minutes to sit and sip a cup of tea or do something kind of to unwind. When you sit down to meditate, you're prepared to come with a more relaxed disposition. It probably can help. Now you can have too much relaxation. Mostly what you can have is too much relaxation is not balanced with effort. One of the symptoms of too much relaxation is what sometimes in meditation we'll call the sinking mind. There's two opposite directions of the mind. It's sometimes called sinking mind and drifting mind. The sinking mind is a mind that's gotten dull and cloudy and not really engaged. At first the sinking mind can be very subtle, just a little bit. You can be concentrated, you can be very present for your breath or whatever. Then after a while your effort is not so strong anymore. Effort starts getting dull and the clarity of the breath starts getting a little bit duller and fainter. You can still stay present, but things are getting a little bit duller and hazier. Often when you're concentrated, it's somewhat of a pleasant state. You might be congratulating yourself as to how well it's going. But the mind is actually getting dull and duller. The mind is sinking. You want to track that. You want to track the vitality of the mind. The vitality of the effort that you're making so you can be balanced. To develop sense of samadhi the mind has to be balanced. Not too far one direction, not too far the other direction. Not sluggish, not agitated. Not hesitant, not striving. Not dull, not agitated, I guess. When you notice a sinking mind, you want to adjust for that. In the pastana practice we don't usually do adjustments so much. We talk about seeing more clearly. When you do concentration practice, you adjust constantly to keep you in that balance and keep you going on track. You can adjust your body if you're getting too relaxed or too sleepy or dull. You can sit up straighter, develop more energy in your body somehow. Be more kind of intent physically. You can adjust your breathing. You can breathe more deeply to get more energy back in. Sometimes if you relax the abdomen more, sometimes that can bring actually paradoxically more alertness. Sometimes a deeper, more relaxed breath will alert the mind. Change the place where you focus on the breathing. Like the way we did the counting, for example. Or maybe if you tend to follow the breath in the stomach and your mind is getting dull or sleepy, maybe move the breath up to the top of your chest or to your nostrils. Moving where you pay attention to the breath can change the dullness of the mind. It can wake up the mind or get it sharper a little bit. Sometimes if people need to relax more, being aware of the breath lower in the body can help with relaxation. Higher in the body can help with more alertness. You can experiment with this. How is it for you? How can you adjust the breathing? Some people who meditate will use the breath to soothe themselves. This is what Vipassana practitioners do too. It gets in the way of Vipassana practice. If you're using the breath to soothe yourself, it's very good if you're tense. But if you're already somewhat relaxed, if you keep that up as a habit, you're going to start putting yourself to sleep and the mind is going to get dull. You have to be very aware of how you're connecting to the breathing. Are you leaning into it in such a way that you're being soothed by it? It's the best word I can come up with. Soot by it, nurtured by it. You're trying to hang in there with relaxation. You're trying to rest with the breath. If that's the case and your mind is getting dull, if it's sinking, stop doing that. Otherwise you'll keep putting yourself more and more into sleep. So adjust your body, adjust your breath, and you can also adjust your mind, your mental state. You can inspire yourself. You might think of something that's inspiring. You could remind yourself to be patient. You can have wisdom, clear understanding of what's going on. You can bring mental energy into the situation. Apply your mind more fully. It is a mental focus that's going on with samadhi. It's one of the things going on. So you can put more energy into the mental focus, bring more mental effort into the involved. So change your mind also. It's fine to do that when you do samadhi practice. The other thing we do is, and probably go over 10 minutes again, like we did last time. It's 9 o'clock, is the drifting. The mind gets slightly overexcited or you're putting too much effort into the practice. So you want to be very attentive. Is the mind beginning to drift into thoughts a lot or the mind beginning to get distracted a lot? Then you want to bring it back into focus. Sometimes when the mind is drifting a lot, you want to relax more. Then you want to soothe yourself with the breathing, rest with the breath. Sometimes developing a more receptive attitude is helpful with the drifting mind. Relax and become very open and receptive to the breathing, whatever your object of meditation is. Again, you want to adjust yourself. If you have too stressed, too much effort, it gets in the way. Too little gets in the way. If you're too tense, it gets in the way. If you're too relaxed, it gets in the way. If the mind is drifting, you get in the concentrated state. There's a sense of well-being that sets in. Then people get complacent. Then the mind drifts all too easily. Be careful the mind isn't drifting. You stay in focus, you stay engaged, and you apply yourself. The last thing I want to talk about today is some of the things I talked about last week, but I talked a little bit more emphatically about them. In the classic development of samadhi in Buddhist tradition, there are the first two important factors that get developed in the mind. Eventually you have to learn how to let go of them. You have to first learn how to use them and bring them up, arouse them and apply them. Then you have to learn how to let go of them. They're called vitaka and vichara. Vitaka is usually translated as the initial application of mind, of attention. Vichara is the sustaining of that attention over time. Some people are very good at the mind drifts away and distracted, and they bring the mind back to the breath. They're very good at bringing it back. Once they're there, they give up, they become complacent, or they don't apply themselves anymore. There's a different kind of effort that's needed to sustain the attention over time. First you make the effort to bring the mind back and apply it to the breath, whatever your object is. Then you make a different kind of effort to sustain it over time, to hang in there. There are all kinds of analogies which are given. The beautiful one is that vitaka, the initial application, is a bird when it takes off to fly. Vichara is when the bird is flying. Vichara is when a bee is heading towards a flower. Vichara is when that bee is buzzing around the flower. Upandita loved the analogy of if you're polishing a brass bowl, first you have to take your cloth and connect the cloth to the bowl. Once you're there, you sustain the attention in the bowl by rubbing it and polishing it. The initial application and then sustaining the attention over time. Colloquially in English we can say, hanging in there with it. An analogy that I like, or an image that I use for myself sometimes, is fishing. I don't do much fishing, or I didn't, I mean I'm a kid, I did a little bit. Hopefully this is accurate enough. But if you catch a big fish, you have to vary the length of fishing thread, the fishing line you send out. If it's pulling away from the boat, then you give out. But if it's coming towards you, you reel in. What you don't want to do is have any slack. You don't want to be too taut because then it might break. You don't want any slack because if the line gets slack, then possibly the hook can fall out of the mouth. So you want to keep it taut all the time. So you want to stay in this taut connection between you and the fish through the line. So the same thing with the mind and the breathing. I sometimes imagine that there's a fishing line to the breath and I've hooked the breath. And I want to keep that connection taut. Not tight, not tense, but not slack either. Just the right tautness. Just keep it there. So that means that the sensing of the breath, the feeling of the sensations of the breath being connected, I'm not going to leave that for one moment. So I like to stay in one place usually in the body. Usually it's my abdomen. And I'll just hang in there in that one place and try to have as much continuity in that one place as possible. So the awareness doesn't leave that one spot. At any point in the cycle of breathing in and out. I'm tracking and feeling what's going on there. The whole cycle. That's where the line is taut and connected. I'm not letting it let up for one moment. Now, I can't always do that, right? But that's the direction we're going towards. And as the mind gets more and more concentrated, it's that continuity that we want to have. And that requires letting go of all the other things that might pull the mind away. All the habits we have, other ways in which we use our mind, we get interested in. So developing new habits of mind and breaking old habits is a very important part of the concentration practice. Learning how to exert the mind when the mind is slack. Learning how to restrain the mind or hold it still when it's agitated. Learning how to encourage it when it's restless or dejected. And viewing the practice with equanimity when it's going well. So those are the things. So initial application of mind, sustained application of mind. Learning how to apply just the right amount of effort in doing those things. Not being too tense, not being too relaxed. But being very intent in what you're doing. And as you keep doing the practice, the initial effort that you make changes. And initially it might feel a little bit tiring to do it, but as you get into the groove of it, it becomes easier and easier and more relaxing. And eventually you have to let go of both the initial application of mind and the sustained application of mind because they're no longer needed. And they just get in the way because, you know, it's like, you know, if you're trying to run all the way to the beach, you can go swimming. When you get to the beach in the water, you should stop running. But you needed that effort to get there. So you need to have some effort, and then you have to know when the right time is to let go of that effort. So again, I talked a lot. I hope this is useful. And if some of you have questions, I'll stay around a little bit and use that as an opportunity for questions. Next week, I'll come an hour early. I'll come at 6.30. And that'll be a time, that hour 6.30 to 7.30, will be a time where we can talk about all this much more, have a dialogue. You can talk about how it's going in your meditation, how it is practicing this at home. And we can explore all these things much more before the class starts. And I really hope that you have a real appreciation for the contemplative life, the life that develops our capacity for great stillness, great peacefulness in the mind and the heart. Samadhi is a route to finding this contemplative stillness, peacefulness, silence. And it's really a beautiful thing. So many thanks. See you next week.
