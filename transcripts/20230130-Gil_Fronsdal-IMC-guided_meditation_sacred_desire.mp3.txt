 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. I'm happy to be back here. I was on retreat last week at our retreat center in Santa Cruz. That was very nice. To begin with some comments relevant for the meditation. I believe that often enough in different parts of the world, different religions, that which is sacred is also considered to be dangerous or potentially dangerous. And so to approach the sacred with respect because of that danger. So I would like to say something about this in Buddhism that might sound like it goes against the grain or contrary to what you've often been taught about Buddhism. And that is that desire can be sacred. But because desire is also dangerous and that in Buddhism certain kinds of desire are the origin for our suffering and the origin for a lot of the suffering that we see in the world. Because of that sometimes desire gets a bad name or is considered to be only something to let go of. Let go, let go, let go is a kind of Buddhist refrain. And we want to come to the end of desire. There might be some truth to that to some degree, but having desire is a very important part of the Buddhist path. Having some kind of desire is a very important part of the Buddhist life. The Buddha advocated having particular desires. But as soon as we have desires, we have expectations. As soon as we have desires, it all too easily slides into attachment to the desire, fear of the desire. All kinds of things can happen. And so it's easy then to fall back on desire is bad, we shouldn't have desire. But desire is important. And as we meditate today, perhaps you can experiment with finding a desire for meditation, a desire for being mindful, being present here and now. That is not just a simple desire, not just following instructions from a teacher, like be present, follow your breath, but rather arises out of a deep wish, a deep aspiration, a deep intention. And that being present here now, being with a breath, being present and attentive is animated, is motivated by such a deep desire within us, such an integral desire within us for such an important purpose. That the desire has a kind of sacredness to it. It's something to respect, maybe even have an awe that we have this capacity for a heart's wish. Not to get excited and not to get spitting up in thought, but the opposite. And where we appreciate this desire and appreciate that the fulfillment of the desire is not found through thinking, but is found through knowing, being aware, being present here with a quiet heart, a quiet mind, a fullness of heart, a full mind, mind which is full of the present moment peacefully, to know that the desire goes in that direction in a certain way or that the meditation is foundational, the useful for fulfilling other desires that we have. So to assume a meditation posture, a posture that is participating in the desire, maybe the sacred desire to be present now here, gently closing the eyes. Taking some gently bigger breaths, establishing a connection here and now. In this body. In this body. Letting your breathing return to normal and feeling resting in your body for a few moments and then doing it again and again. And each time you return to your body resting, see if you can rest deeper into your body, settle deeper. Okay with each exhale, settling deeper. Relaxing the body. Exiting the mind. Exiting the mind. And then taking a few moments to feel your way in, assuming there's a place deep inside where desires can be peaceful, desires can be peaceful and profound. Desires that have no expectation or attachment, but desires which are maybe sacred, maybe integral to us. And can there be a clear desire for being present here and now, for being awake in this body and mind? Desire to not have your thoughts take you away to other places, other times, past and future, other events. Desire or the heart's wish to be here in the lived moment, to find the fullness, the sacredness, the vitality. It is being manifested in each moment. Stay close to that desire. As you stay present, mindful here and now. Exercbrande...... When you find your mind wandering off in thought, rather than coming back to the breathing, coming back to the present, come back to the profound desire or the peaceful desire to be here, to be mindful, a desire that has no demand and no expectation, but a desire which is sacred or valuable, a desire whose byproduct is then to be aware. Settling back into the desire to be present, settling back into the desire to be present, passing known And then coming to the end of the sitting, compassion involves having a certain desire for the end of suffering, desire for the welfare and happiness of others, desire for the welfare and happiness of oneself. There are different kinds of love. One is the love that is activated, that is animated by what we receive from others, the love we receive, the care. Another kind of love is a love that we generate to care and love others, wanting their well-being, wanting to support and to serve and to care. Passion and love can have within them desire, sacred desire, the heart's wish desire for the welfare and happiness of others. To feel that desire, that wish, to feel that well-wishing, no matter how small it is, it's even significant if we wish we had goodwill for others, just a wish to do so, even if we think we can't do it. That wish is the beginning. And then to always find a way to give expression to that care, that goodwill, many infinite numbers of expressions, but to let it live in you and to manifest in you. And at the end of the meditation, it can manifest in expressing thoughts of goodwill for the world around you. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be safe. May all beings be free. And may it be our desire to contribute to that. Amen.
