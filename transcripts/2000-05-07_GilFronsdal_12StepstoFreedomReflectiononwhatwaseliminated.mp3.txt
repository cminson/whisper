 Today I'm going to finish this 12 part series on the 12 steps of the transcendental dependent origination. And talking about it since the beginning of the year, how many of you have come to most of those? What did you say? So the majority of people have only been to maybe few of them, maybe none of them. So you have no clue what I'm talking about today being the last pinnacle culmination of it, punch line. It's one of the very interesting aspects of Buddhism historically in almost all schools of Buddhism, not universal but it's pretty common. It was pretty common in the teachings of the Buddha was that he presented the path of spiritual practice as a path, Sanskrit word is marga, in Pali it's manga, and as a path of gradual development, gradual cultivation, a step-by-step path that leads to a full awakening and for some people to Buddhahood if they so choose to take that path. And he called it a path, it's called a path. And one of the interesting aspects of a path, as Stephen Batchelor pointed out last week when I heard him speak, a path is a clearing in the woods or in the field or something. The path is an absence of something, it's an absence of obstacles. So you can make your way through the woods or through wherever you're going without being obstructed by anything. You can follow this absence of obstacles through an area where there's lots of obstacles maybe and find your way. Some paths are quite direct and that's the virtue as they show you the direct way. And in terrain where there are lots of obstacles the path maybe is winding but still it provides a clearing which frees our life of obstacles we can go ahead. Now for some people it's a path not because the path is freed of obstacles maybe the path is there for us to follow but since the last time someone walked on it it's gotten overgrown. So that in our particular negotiation of the path we have to clear the path we have to kind of just find out what the obstacles are and address them and somehow clear them out of the way so that our path becomes obstacle free. Now some Buddhists will focus simply on what it's like to take each step on the path and some Buddhists will focus more on the long-term possibilities of that path and lay out the whole realm of it. I like it that the Buddha talked about the path as being good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end. And this means that it's just it's a good thing all along it's not like it's a you know your second best to be at the beginning and you're hoping to get to the middle or you get to the end that's really the best deal of it all. But rather the famous saying that this kind of cliche now is wherever you go there you are that wherever you are that's where we negotiate our life that's where we discover our life that's where we work with the obstacles of our life and and to be engaged with our life as it's lived right now is the only thing we can do. You can't be engaged with your life as a form of wishful thinking that oh I hope that in the future you know if I dream enough if I fantasize enough of what I could be then maybe I'll somehow miraculously be that and be kind of like reading a menu and never ordering the food. So the path is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end. Some people will focus mostly on what it's like to take each step on the path and find some great value and just waking up here right now in this moment and waking up in this moment to your life as it is is to some degree relatively easy if we just remember to do it. I was coming down here today and at some point driving down the hill I noticed that I had been involved in composing a story and rewriting an ancient Buddhist story in my head and it was a pleasant thing to do but some way I noticed I was doing it and I kind of woke up from that storytelling and the road and the trees and the traffic and the street sign that I kind of was driving by was suddenly very vivid and very present for me in a very wonderful way and then I noticed you know I wondered here I'm driving my car and I don't know I don't notice I don't remember how any memory of seeing anything on the road before that. I'm sure I was conscious and a good driver I don't think I was completely out of it but I wasn't so present that it was a vividly a lie for me that it registered in some strong way this is what's happening in the present moment. I was living in story making as many people we live sometimes in memories or in planning or whatever and it is a kind of a it is a kind of sleeping estate or kind of dull state or unattentive state so then I was present for this very simple you know wood side road and the rain and the trees and whatever is going on there and I could easily I thought I could easily imagine someone feel that this is not very special just a road and we see roads all the time just trees we see trees all the time and there's a person driving it's you know big deal it's actually kind of boring it's you know it's kind of like very mundane and it's you know human beings can aspire to much loftier things and just simply being present for a road and in the present moment sometimes we can have maybe for some people can have the appearance of what's not good for anything you know this particular moment that I find myself in you know I'll just hurry and get through this moment so that I could get to work where the real important work of my life is or hurry and get home so I can do the really important work of watching television or you know or whatever we think is really important there's all these lofty things we can do in our life some of them which are very worthwhile doing and we can sacrifice the present moment because the present moment seems rather uninteresting maybe compared to these lofty things we can do exciting things we might be able to do what happens is that as we begin finding ourselves more in the present moment willing to take the chance to just kind of explore and be in the present moment it allows I found that it allows a state of simplicity a state of ease a state of calm or peacefulness to kind of bubble up and surface and that's and that state of simplicity then becomes phenomenally rich and that if I'm always involved in doing something and engaged in projects and things that are really important and exciting there is a certain kind of satisfaction that come from that but the deep inner satisfaction and joy and delight of simplicity of just being fully alive with no need to do anything to be present without the mind always needing to grasp onto some activity or some desire but rather the mind is resting and just present for things as they are that is not available to us if we're always engaged in these wonderful things so beginning to kind of settle back and just be very simply with the simple things of life the roads the steering wheel as you're driving the sound of the rain whatever it is find ourselves with the present moment as it is allows for the growth of some real deep sense of intimacy and presence that I think is ultimately the most satisfying it's much more satisfying some of the exciting things we can do that's my my experience or my feeling about it um but this willing to kind of be present and awake for the moment as it actually actually is then some people see that as ultimate in itself some people find it's very satisfying just some people some people have found the great satisfaction of just being awake in this moment nothing else is needed to be really awake is to have a mind a mindfulness which can see clearly or be present fully for what's here and is not trying or needing it to be any different which means it does not pushing anything away or is not holding on to anything in the mind the mind doesn't have the contractions of pushing away or holding on to anything your body might decide you might decide through your wisdom to make changes in the world but the mind doesn't have to contract for against anything it can stay open towards everything some people find that phenomenally powerful and freeing and liberating they don't feel there's any need to talk about any other developmental model of a path there's nothing no need to get anything or attain anything it just seems so full to be present without wanting or rejecting just there and open um um however if we do that if we sit completely open and present and aware without wanting anything or pushing anything away you involve yourself in a process of change you might not be wanting to cause change you might not be interested in change you might be satisfied with life as it is but life continues anyway and so you involve yourself in a process of change interchange that um i think is actually quite phenomenal i think there's a phenomenal um movement momentum within us if we get the obstacles out of the way towards freedom towards release and so whatever way we can kind of lower or drop the obstacles we let this momentum this process happen on its own um we don't have to attribute the process of liberation the path and developmental model the path is always something that we will and want to happen or making happen but rather something that happens to us if we get out of the obstacles out of the way maybe the hit the path is downhill you know once we get on the path and don't have any obstacles we'll just slide down the hill in a rainy day then you know the mud's wet right and we just down we go um um i've told this story many times but kind of an example of this way in which if you don't want change some that that itself is the great changemaker um the um i think there's so much non-acceptance of our life for many of us that is actually a very radical thing to practice mindfulness that is an accepting of life as it is right now that that movement of going from not different states and reactive states of non-acceptance to acceptance of things as they are pulls the rug from underneath much of the structure of our life much of the way in which our life is held up and is going along so you pull the rug from under the whole cathedral of ways in which you're defending ourselves and building ourselves up as as be as in our self-image kind of falls away and we involve in change not falling away so the story is uh is the one of uh this man is writing a letter i guess or writing he says um i was miserable i was depressed i felt awful and my friends all told me that i had to change and i knew that i had to change and the more i tried to change the less successful i was at changing i became more miserable and one day i came across a friend who told me don't change i love you just the way you are i love you just the way you are what a relief to hear those words i relaxed and then i changed and what i and he continues and says what i didn't know was i couldn't change i forget exactly how it continues but i couldn't change unless somehow there was someone loved me for who i was without needing to change and that someone in buddhist practice is ourselves can we love ourselves that you know as we are about the need for change in a sense and that's actually a very powerful way of causing change causing kind of the cathedral of structures of defense or timidity or whatever it is to fall away um so buddhism offers a path and these weeks of we've i'm going over the 12 steps of this path actually the buddha offered many models of the path um the um eighth fold path that you know of this most famous path um there's many developmental models the buddha offered since he offered many of them i think we take hold each of them lightly we don't consider any one path as being the ultimate path but kind of just see them as being useful way of looking at our life or our practice rather than our life has to fit in any particular one of them so it began with suffering the path begins with suffering and some acknowledgement they're suffering in ourselves or in the world out there there's some problem that needs to be addressed some issue that needs to be addressed and without some full acknowledgement and recognition of the problems of our life the difficulty of our life some kind of particular kind of acceptance of it it's very hard to want to be engaged in a spiritual practice or know where the spiritual practice is supposed to go um it's very easy to be idealistic in any kind of spiritual practice some people get turned off by the world of spirituality in california because a tremendous amount of idealism that's presented and it's very confusing and very hard to find our way in a very idealistic world that seems to offer a lot of hope but doesn't really um um help us really understand where the beginning should be where the problem is so the path begins in recognizing and seeing suffering to see what our actual situation is and be very honest about it and some people find that buddhist spirituality is a very offers a tremendous amount of relief to them because it says it begins where we're actually at oh oh it's speaking to me in my condition and how i actually am and then um it follows next step is some faith that out of suffering comes faith and i think that's very profound many people want to have more faith or more trust or more confidence and that somehow it follows uh the recognition of suffering um the faith can is many things one of them is a faith that it's that there is a path to follow there's something you can do about your problems in your life something you can do about your suffering you don't just accept it uh complacently or accept it um kind of dejected depressed way of just kind of give up kind of to it acceptance and not giving giving up to something it's in the deep in the deep way of practice practice acceptance is not the same thing as you know as complacent despairing acceptance which sometimes we have so i think that there's something possible to do something faith that there's a path faith that there's a practice faith that there are other people who've been engaged in the path have done it ahead of us and can offer us inspiration advice um can point out the obstacles in the path that we'll encounter maybe they've cleared the path for us uh some point so at least we can maybe there's still obstacles in our path but you can kind of you know traces of the path are still there and so we can find our way we don't have to kind of invent it all anew and then after some development of faith or the arising of faith um there's next two stages which is uh delight and joy and for me this is um has very much to do with working on our interpersonal relationships um i like to think of the buddhist path as putting early in the path focusing on developing healthy interpersonal relationships many people who look at buddhist practice think that it's primarily an individual practice you know meditation practice you close your eyes you're all by yourself and it's about negotiating your life just on your own kind of solving and fixing it as if you can just kind of take care of everything just by yourself and um in several of the models of the path in buddhism the early stages involve inter-relational activity working up those relationships clearing them up to some degree making sure they're somehow healthy um and this is done uh in two primary ways um one is through ethics virtue and develop which simply means developing healthy harmonious relationships with people around us there's nothing more moralistic about it um but without and then the second one is through a practice of generosity uh we look for opportunities to be generous and you we don't do generosity in the abstract it usually has to do with others with it's a relational thing that we tend to do so we start looking at our relationships and our practice occurs in the field of relationships it's not again not a solitary activity but we begin feeling how our practice is connected to others and how our life is connected to others and that creates a very important i think foundation for the inner life the inner spiritual life that follows that many westerners start with themselves we have such a painful individualistic society here in america and we we don't even see it how um you know it's it's built in you know from the time we're young you know we don't see how strong and powerful um the conditioning we have to be autonomous individual self-reliance self-sufficient beings i heard a story last week of um a japanese woman who had a japanese family that came to america and um they sent their five-year-old daughter to kindergarten i suppose and at some point the kindergarten teacher asked all the kids what their favorite color was and everyone said their favorite color and they came to the japanese girl and she looked kind of stunned and didn't know what to say and she said i don't know what our favorite color is and then she went back to her parents and said what's our favorite color and the mother called up the school and said what's going on here and what are you guys doing to my daughter the idea that that so the daughter's assumption was she didn't have her favorite color as an individual she had a favorite color that came you know was part of her community part of her family i'm not saying i'm not saying it's a better way of raising children or having families but it's a very different one and it highlights the fact that here in america something so innocent and simple we think it's just like you know we do it as we breathe what's your favorite color as if you should have a favorite color that's you know that's actually a very powerful form of cultural conditionings and and it expresses a certain understanding what the individual is and it feeds into this phenomenon i think feeds into that might be healthy in itself in our culture but it feeds into this phenomenally unhealthy tendency of being individuals let it let me do it on my own my life um so the buddhist path begins with some sense of interrelationship some sense of connectedness and as we practice more harmonious relationships practice joy practice generosity practice ethics traditionally that's understood that it brings joy and delight delight and joy to our life there's not a moralistic and heavy thing to do but it brings some kind of lightness we can walk through life in a blameless way it's the words of the expression of the buddha to live a blameless life and that brings joy and delight um and it doesn't mean you have to be good at it or pure at it it means like i find there's a lot of delight and joy um in knowing that i'm interested in harmonious relationships interested in ethics and developing a pure heart um um to be engaged in that attempt i think is really beautiful i don't measure myself against some model of perfection doing it i measure myself in against my interest in wanting to do that and my engagement in that process with the recognition that many different people are very different or many different stages and levels of of ethics and relationships then and what's important is their their intention not where they're at so then um that joy delight and joy is followed by tranquility because once you're blameless and once you begin having harmonious relationships and have some sense of how to live your life in a in a simple way a basic decent way it tends to bring some level of tranquility to our life many people in the west are not tranquil there's anxiety is epidemic maybe it's contagious um the degree to which uh the various forms of anxiety including depression is so prevalent in our culture i think means that we shouldn't just take it again as a personal occurrence that uh i think there's an element in which depression and anxiety in our culture is a cultural phenomena that we've somehow we're participating in in its cultural conditioning and cultural circumstances i think many of the people who feel anxious and depressed in our culture um i don't know what the exact immediate immediate causes and conditions for it but the wider conditions of it i think are the alienated work-driven society we have and that if we had lived in a small village where you knew what your job was because that's what your generations before you had always done the same kind of work and using you that's what your place in the in the world was and this is the community of people you've known you all your life i suspect that a lot fewer people will be depressed people historically have never had to make as many decisions for themselves as people in the modern world have to make and so we have anything helpful i think to realize it's not just always so personal even um our psychological difficulties um but anyway we work on these things and it comes some some some modicum or some develop development of tranquility a little bit of peace or subtleness in ourselves willing to settle back on ourselves and be ourselves um not run away from ourselves or avoid ourselves and then um that brings happiness the ability to be on some tranquility some subtleness on ourselves is the condition that brings happiness and happiness is a little more profound or sublime than joy or delight happiness um is also very helpful for the development of concentration which is an important element of meditation practice um actually the deeper stages of concentration arise with happiness as happiness is a foundation and so you know if your meditation doesn't have some you know some i want to say maybe happiness is too strong of a word but if happiness or joy is not an element of your meditation um you know so it doesn't happen right away but eventually at some point if doing for a number of years and you're not feeling some delight or joy or happiness or ease in your meditation you should probably talk to a teacher and and uh you know and explore maybe what's happening there um and happiness is then a precursor for the possibility of concentration to have a mind which is very stable and very still and quiet very focused in the present moment so that we can not just simply kind of see something in the in the passing but we actually can look very deeply very profoundly look into something and really see deeply what's what the nature is what the characteristics of our experience are in a way that goes deeper than our conceptual level it's deeper than than how we think about things or interpret things or judge things we see very deeply how things actually are concentration then is a precursor for um seeing things as they are which is the essential element of the appasana practice really being able to see clearly what things are in distinct in contrast to what we think they are to seeing things to seeing things as they are is the is the precursor for beginning to become disenchanted with the things that we're enchanted with disillusioned with the things we have illusions about um beginning to slowly let go of the grasping and holding which of objects which we think are going to give us lasting security and happiness to stop looking outside of ourselves for our ultimate well-being but to begin actually looking finding it inside of us in a sense um in the buddhist mythology there's um brahma the great god it's kind of like the greatest god of the indian pantheon he mustook himself be the creator god for a while but the buddhist straightened them out and um showed him how it was a misunderstanding um and one of the wonderful things about these great gods like brahma is they have everything you know they're like they're like the ceo of heaven you know they've been one of the heavens there's many heavens and buddhism and ceo of heaven they're they have this phenomenal you know big home in los altos hills they have somewhere like that they have you know the greatest cars and they have all the money they want and the best vacations and the greatest you know everything you know everything in the world all the best that the world can provide for joy and have you know delight or sensual pleasure these brahmas have it you know does larry elsentoo you know he looks pretty poor and snotty a comparison and um and um and the brahma realizes that that's not good enough that's not enough and the and the brahma actually is very interested in the buddha and goes listens to the buddha and talks to the buddha and and and somehow offer support and protection for the buddha because the brahma sees that the buddha has something which she doesn't have and that that is this phenomenal inner sense of well-being and peace and happiness which doesn't come from that the world and conditions around us so so kind of a disenchantment with that the world out there is going to do it for us and we learn to begin to relax our grip on the world because we start getting disenchanted with whatever it is we're enchanted with day trading or whatever there might be the current enchantment and then with this enchantment there's a beginning of a turning away or a turning away is maybe a good word um a fading away of fading away of we don't simply get disenchanted with this so like if you're really enchanted with a bowl you can realize that you can hold holding on to this bowl this bowl is really going to do it for you you're sure of it you're not going to let anybody take this ball away you can hold on to it and you're really happy to have a bowl now the function of a bowl of course is to make a beautiful sound as you ring it now if you're really attached to that bowl it's really going to do it for you and you're not going to let go of your grip at all so at some point you might realize wait a minute this bowl is not going to do it for me and so the disenchantment is realizing the bowl is not going to do it for me the turning away or the fading is the fading of our grip which follows the disenchantment we let go of the grip and then as we let go of the grip the bowl has a wonderful function and we hear the beautiful sound so as we start getting disenchanted we the grip begins to loosen on what we're enchanted with and really what's important is not so much the object that we're attached to but then we begin loosening that grip of our attachment of our attachment has all kinds of shapes right aversion hate hostility desire greed fear confusion stress virtually all stress arises out of a kind of some kind of gripping onto something and then once the fading away of our gripping it becomes thorough enough then there is a release the bowl is set free in a sense floats away or whatever the once the fading away once the holding is is just has released itself and the last remnants of attachment or holding or gripping the last fetters that bind our heart the last constrictions of our heart and our mind have released themselves then we have the experience of freedom of release and in the in the teachings of buddhism freedom is very important it's like the ultimate goal however in american society it's important to distinguish two different ideas of freedom one is in america i think many people want to have freedom to do freedom of ability to do whatever they want freedom of speech freedom to vote freedom to purchase freedom to you know have occasions freedom to do whatever we want to do which is i mean i'm not i'm not critical of that but it cannot but that kind of freedom also lends itself to this individual individualistic notion what's in it for me i want to have what i don't have any obstacles to my desires and my wishes the freedom that buddha talked about is the freedom from and what you're a freedom to do that's up to you you have to figure that out depending on circumstances but freedom from means freedom from that which constrains or constricts our heart or our mind the contractions of of clinging of hate of aversion um greed hate and delusion uh are released and what what life is like of freedom what the mind or the heart or life is like when we're released from that which binds the heart the buddha didn't talk about very much and maybe somewhat unusual in the world of spiritual traditions by not having very many positive descriptions of what freedom feels like or looks like or is how it's experienced um you know he didn't say you know great boundless white light's gonna fill you or you know or you're gonna boundless joy or great visions or experiences of infinite consciousness um he didn't have it he didn't describe it except to describe primarily by extra describing what was lacking what was absent what what you'd been released from and i think there's i think there's great beauty and wisdom in not describing the ultimate goal in a positive terms but rather describing it as what you've been released from one of them is it's very respective very respectful of how different people's experiences are and maybe there are different ways in which people experience the ultimate experience of release and freedom and in fact um when uh the past teachers when they get together to talk the teachers who've had a lot of experience in practice very deep practice and will sometimes share amongst themselves what their deepest practice or the deepest experiences are in practice and um they all kind of fit the certain model that you know kind of fits the kind of somehow in some in the traditional buddhist model in a very general way but there's a phenomenal amount of variety of how they had their ultimate experiences of practice and it's been a little bit um uh uh awing i think for some of the teachers to hear how different the different teachers have had had you know followed the path and have very different ultimate experiences of sorts or experienced in somewhat different ways and so i think that what's developed here because we talk with each other is that a kind of great respect who knows what the ultimate experience is supposed to be like you know as it is a one unitary experience it's supposed to be it and you know that's it the buddha focused on you understand it by understanding what you released what's what's been released from you you no longer have greed you no longer have hate you no longer have attachment to a sense of self you no longer have conceit you no longer have attachment to very subtle states of of um of bliss of joy of consciousness you no longer um um are driven by compulsions of sensual of sexual desires you no longer driven or by compulsions for aversion or hate there's no longer there's the absence of restlessness and there's the absence of ignorance so those things you know those things think of the vipassana teacher all understand the importance of and the cultivation of that and moving in that direction but what happens when all it's kind of like once the curtains are pulled you know everybody lives in their own home by themselves and everybody has their curtains pulled it's always very dark and they're kind of moldy and you know and their skin's turning dark or whatever green or white or whatever happens and and then somehow you read this wonderful book everybody reads this wonderful book about practice and it says you know sooner or later you better open your curtains and open the windows so everybody in their own little home essentially opens the curtains and looks out the window and everybody sees something different but the experience of opening the curtains is the same and that's enough everybody's happy wow i didn't know there was so much more to life um so the so the 11th stage is the experience of release the 12th stage the final part of this transcendental dependent origination is the knowledge these are called all these stages are called knowledges but it is called the knowledge of what has been eliminated so that experience of enlightenment or freedom in the buddhist terms comes also is followed also with some reflection some awareness of what what the consequences of that experience has been what has been released what's been removed from one person and there's many lists and things that are removed depending on how your mood that day you can look at the different lists and evaluate that way um what the most the most important list here in this 12th stage is a list of the asavas the removal of the asavas and asavas is a great word it has many etymologically has a number of different meanings one meaning is um it's a sap of a certain plant in india that's intoxicating another meaning is that it's discharge of pus from a sore psychologically in buddhism it's kind of like both it's um some people call it the drains that which you know drains your energy you no longer have anything any drains in your system but there's some people translate as the outflows but probably the best uh translation is the intoxicants we tend to be intoxicated by our infatuations by what enchants us and um and so someone is totally liberated no longer has any intoxication of the mind which bewilders them befuddles them confuses them uh leads them to live a compulsive life um a driven life but rather there's freedom to live the life um as appropriate so the um the there's a list of three and list of four asavas intoxicants and one of them is this drive for sensual pleasure that uh it's things are very different it's somewhat difficult for some people to realize how foundational it is in many people's lives the drive for pleasure the second is um um the drive the intoxication of what's called bhava becoming or maybe the best way of saying it in the western terminology is uh the drive to be someone becoming to have it to create an identity for ourselves we all are something but we don't have to create something in addition to that in terms of a self-image that way which we want to present ourselves to the world or present ourselves to ourselves defend ourselves in a certain way um we have tremendous attachment to identity and there's a difference between having an identity and identifying identifying being the attachment and one of the fundamental spiritual needs in buddhist practice is to address the issue of identification and find the possibility of releasing ourselves from the grip of identification so one of the one of the very profound intoxicant intoxications is the intoxication of identity what needing to be someone or not be someone which is why some people want to be these trying to avoid all at all costs to be anybody they're afraid to be anybody and they want to be nobody um and then uh the um um the fourth and the third when there's a list of four is opinions we get intoxicated by our opinions and they befuddle us and confuse us and cause a lot of suffering and someone is fully awakened if you remove any kind of attachment or intoxication with opinions even if they're right they don't have to defend it or whatever and then the last one in list of four is ignorance ignorance is a form of intoxication because in buddhist terminology ignorance is not the absence of knowing something but rather it's the act of ignoring and the act of ignoring uh maybe in Freudian terms is you know we call denial but the act of ignoring is um is a tremendous cause of suffering in the world both in ourselves and the world around us and one of the most profound for things aspects of liberation is liberation of our ignorance of our act of ignoring of turning away not paying attention so that's the developmental model um in years that i've taught and in the years that i have been talking to other teachers it's the experience that very few people follow a linear model of development and linear models are useful as kind of abstract kind of pictures or something or for discussion exploration but that people kind of jump around all over the place also my impression is that uh human beings are multi-dimensional and this is something that as as buddhism practices it has developed in the west there are a number of different teachers have also pointed out that we're they're multi-dimensional multi-level to human being so that's possible for someone to have very deep practice very deep even realization experiences in buddhism experiences of liberation of awakening experiences of the unconditioned the the um the experience of of uh non-duality and then to come back from that experience and be us has continued to be a psychological mess and it can even worse some people can have very dramatic enlightenment experiences um and get arrogant because of it become kind of jerks because of it which we've been known to happen so there's there's there's sometimes like a psychological level that sometimes is not addressed by even very deep practice and so some teachers um jack cornefield is one of the one of the first and he got a lot of criticism for doing that because he was being too psychological but insisted that some people really need to look at other aspects of their life than just their spiritual aspect of their life they really wanted to be to be free um and he got a lot of flack for that and then i was i was fascinated when i went to in england last july to at the vipassana teachers meeting there were 60 different vipassana teachers there 60 different vipassana teachers there um for the first time the monks from amravati and chittorst were there monks and nuns oh so far in the years past these meetings have always been just to lay vipassana teachers and um and the the monastic community in england where arjan amaro comes from it was kind of the bastion of conservative terravan teachings you know and and they kind of looked at california it's like california buddhism is boy these people they're you know all the psychology what's going on there and um in the last few years they've realized the need to invite in psychologists to help them that they had enough difficulties in their community both in group process and individual process that they realized that they couldn't do it on their own anymore and there were aspects that they and if some of the tremendous fascination then with psychology and and different forms of therapy because they felt it wasn't enough just to do the the practice itself and maybe practice itself is enough if you if you understand the whole path some people uh we we focus so narrowly on what buddhist practice is we understand you know that it's maybe that the developmental model being one that is meant to take in the full scope of who we are and if we don't take in the whole model then we have to find it fill in that from other areas of life or from other traditions from psychology or whatever um the um this idea that um liberation is a process or a path that if we know how to practice well moves through us that it kind of occurs to us it's not something necessarily we do or make happen um i think it's very profound um it means a kind of trust in our life in our full life our embodied life our mental life our emotional life and i see plenty of people who and i see plenty of people who can have some real experience or some intuitive experience of the unconditioned of a non-dual experience of freedom but from whom that itself becomes a kind of maybe not an attachment perhaps but a kind of narrowing of their life rather than an opening into the full meaning of what it means means to be a human being to be a full human being i think is to allow is simply to let the obstacles out of the way that keep from the full functioning of our humanity of our embodied experience of life our emotional experience of life our motivational experience of life our interpersonal experience of life our mental intellectual experience of life let all these things function fully rather than to narrow down different aspects of them and to avoid them that freedom the unconditioned the non-dual doesn't any kind of way require us to turn away from anything as i say in mahayana buddhism form is emptiness is emptiness is form he wasn't a buddhist i don't think but some by the end of his life after all his years of studying perennial philosophy and all the different spiritual traditions and exploring so much of it i was i've read or was told that kind of near his deathbed he said you know it's a little bit embarrassing for me to say this after all these years of study basically just comes down to be kinder to each other so i apologize for talking over i thought i was going to have nothing to say today and i thought that it would be good today to to after these 12 talks to give you a chance to ask your questions or raise your reservations around this developmental model maybe we should stop and uh and just that's something to interest you you feel like there's a need to kind of kind of give you a chance to respond to all these 12 talks or should we just kind of in two weeks when i come back just kind of merely go on to something new i think yes um at the 12th step when you talk about release of intoxicants um given that everything's impermanent i suppose that these intoxicants can also come back in so let's say i experience you know the release of hatred for a day or an hour and then it comes back oh this is interesting so part of the release oh the question is since since buddhism puts tremendous focus on impermanence on change certainly uh when there's a release of the intoxicants like anger um that release absence of it is almost also temporary and so i can release my anger today or my hate today and then tomorrow it'll be back you know that's part of what impermanence means right um so to back up a little bit one of the fundamental principles of buddhist psychology is that um there is what's called the anusaya anusaya is uh is usually translated into english as latent tendencies latent means we don't see them so you could merely go along with your life for a long time and think that you've never uh you know you have no tendency you've uprooted all tendencies to be angry and then suddenly someone cuts you off in traffic and you get angry you realize oh that that possibility that potential for anger was still there and the ultimate uh in the depth of buddhist practice what we're trying to do is to uproot just the actual traditional word uproot that potential so that potential it gets removed once and for all and um so there's a permanent removal and the permanent removal of something the absence of something doesn't contradict the experience the teaching of impermanence what's impermanent is all conditioned things that you can point to the absence of something is not a thing if you cut off your arm you're not going to grow another arm you know that's it it's gone right so if you cut off or eliminate or uproot the deep-seated potential the unconscious there's probably a good good translation good enough subconscious maybe subconscious because it can and it can be revealed it doesn't stay in the unconscious or subconscious if you uproot the subconscious potential or seeds for hate then it never comes back and one of the one of the inspiring stories you hear from the Thai forest tradition is teachers who are monks who spent years practicing and felt that they were kind of pretty much convinced themselves that they were fully enlightened and then they thought well maybe I'm not maybe I should test myself and then somehow put them in themselves in situations where after a long time somehow a little bit of anger or a little bit of desire sensual desire was provoked for them it's oh I didn't finish the work yet I thought I was done and to me that's very humbling and very you know that it's easy to fool oneself and but the point is to really go into the the ultimate point of Buddhist practice is to reach down there to the roots the latent tendencies and pluck them out and then you won't have to hate anymore yes they're connected the 12 lengths of the of dependent origination the way it was taught by the Buddha was describes the precursors or the the conditions for the arising of suffering and that's that's a circle because it kind of becomes a loop the way we relate to suffering ultimately causes more suffering if we have unhealthy ways of relating to suffering it causes more suffering and we kind of spin around and around and around and so it's so it's a wheel and so that traditional 12 links that most people know about is described suffering and and what what needs to be in place there for suffering the transcendental or the liberative maybe liberate liberating uh 12 uh 12 12 step chain or whatever um is not a circle because it doesn't come back on itself once you get liberated it's like you know it's like uh you know it doesn't create it doesn't it doesn't create further suffering it doesn't create it doesn't create more you know so um so um the the where the two 12 step programs overlap is they both have one of the links of suffering and whereas in the old in the traditional one or the most well-known one it's the first link is um the suffering is you know just goes around and around um in the in the liberative one suffering becomes a springboard to step out of that endless cycle yes Keith um the necessary ingredients for accepting the person as they are, it's really important, but it seems to me that the catalyst was that he lacked. And then I wonder if he changed or just, you know, what does that mean? Have you changed to become a different person or did he just return to what he was without the unhappiness and depression? Yeah, my understanding was that he changed, and that probably the relaxation allowed for something deeper to move through him. And what that deeper stuff is that the story doesn't say, but I've seen lots of people for whom they relaxed and finally willing to accept themselves as they are. And first there's a tremendous amount of rage and grief or sadness that kind of, you know, bubbles up in powerful ways. And then there's a release of the holding of that as it kind of moves through us. And then there's increasing layers of relaxation, of love, of peace. And there's a whole process a person can be involved in. Once the resistance is let go of or once the clinging that's let go of, all this stuff kind of like dominoes can happen. Yeah, I guess that's just what I was asking, what it seems to be, that the relaxation or the release of the release of the bell and not the clinging to the bell, so that it couldn't be human because of the gratitude. You know, in other words, the tightness that people get from this conscious or a conscious time. I mean, the relaxation or the release has to happen. I would word it a little bit differently or differently. I think that the relaxation or the release is, you know, it's really a central element of Buddhist practice, very, very important. But it's too limited to say that's the only thing we're supposed to do. Depending on any individual, different times of their life, different things are needed. And sometimes maybe we don't need any more letting go or release or it's too difficult to do it. Or we can release some things, but some things are just too difficult to release on our own. And so the developmental model means that there are also times that we should cultivate certain things. There's actually also doing. A lot of people need to have some structure. In a sense, to hold release. Some people who get released prematurely will find their life is very confusing. They get very afraid. They have very confused relationships with other people because of that. So there's a time and place for cultivation and actually doing. And it's okay to be involved in change. It's okay to be involved in trying to change oneself. But there's a place for not trying to change just accept oneself. And there's a place we're trying to change. And ultimately, from a certain perspective of liberation, they're the same thing. And you don't have to be at war with efforts to cultivate and change ourselves. We just have to understand clearly what the nature of that is. Does it make some sense? It's responding to you. Thank you. Thank you for doing this series. It was lovely in the beginning. Thank you. I hope it was enlightening for all of you. Oh, who knows?
