Let your face be soft.
So closely associated with who we think we are.
This is actually just another part of our body.
We relax it.
You
You don't need to be anyone for anyone else.
Or for yourself right now.

The buzzing and blooming.
Expansion and contraction of your body and sensations of your body.
You just give permission for all of that.

Despite our intentions to surrender into the moment.
We notice the persistent throb of worry and concern.
Our efforts to ensure the trajectory of this moment of our life is agreeable.

So we scan the landscape for threat and opportunity.
You
But the threat is our own mind.
And the opportunity is our own mind.
Our mind is what matters now.

Bodily affect a little bit, maybe like the antenna for threat and opportunity.
So we bring soothing, we bring the blessing of awareness to these building blocks of urgency,
the affect in our body. Often sensed across the front axis of your body,
your face, throat, chest, belly, sometimes coating the whole body, sometimes at the surface of our
body, sometimes perceive it more deeply, the core of our body.

pleasant affect as often interpreted
has some opportunity, something going right. Unpleasant affect has interpreted as threat
or something going wrong, this moment, this retreat, this sitting, something's not right.
Rather than build and fabricate stories, we stop trying to make meaning and interpret
and we simply feel the feeling.
We stop trying to make meaning and interpret and we simply feel the feeling.
Our heart can be softened by all of this.
Open to the surges and flows of feeling, energy in our body.
We open the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
The temples of the head, we just let the energy flow.
When we meet it in this way, something in our heart is softened, hatred becomes less
tenable, non-violence becomes more obvious.
This becomes more predominant.
We open the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and the soles of the feet.
We open the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and the soles of the feet.
We open the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.

We open the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
We open the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
We open the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
It's not that we're putting down meaning forever, we'll come to understand our life
in this path or in more deeply richer and richer meanings.
For these couple minutes, all the building and orienting and reference points, sandwiching
this moment between an imagined past and an imagined future, drawing the line between
me and the world, none of this is necessary right now.

So, yeah, just keep, keep an eye on the kind of bi-directional relationship, thought, and affect.
And, yeah, take good care of yourself. This is retreat.
Okay, see you soon in bed.
