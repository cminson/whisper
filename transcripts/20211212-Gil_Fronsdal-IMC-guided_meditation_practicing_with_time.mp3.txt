Hello everyone and welcome.
All of you here in person and also those of you who are watching online.
Thank you for being part of this.
And we'll sit mostly silently now.
And I'll pose kind of a question for the sitting.
And that is, if you're not sitting in the present moment, what time are you sitting in?
Now, a lot of logic will tell you that you're all sitting in the present moment, so it doesn't take.
But if you ask a question differently, if you're not centered, your attention is not centered in the present moment.
Chances are you're thinking about something.
And what time are you thinking in?
Are you thinking about the past?
Are you thinking about the future?
Are you thinking about something in the present?
Are you thinking in mythic time, some abstract timeless mythic time or something about fantasy or something?
So if you're not in the present with your experience, your breathing here and now, be curious.
What time are you thinking in?
And when you realize what that is, then recognize that it is happening in the present.
That kind of thinking is happening in the present.
And what happens when you realize that? Does anything shift?
So taking an alert posture.
A posture that is alert that can stay alert as you relax.
Relaxing the shoulders as you exhale.
Softening the belly as you exhale.
And then continuing to relax the belly as you inhale too.
Relaxing the muscles of the face.
And relaxing the thinking mind.
Any tension in your body, mind, brain associated with thinking.
Let it soften as you exhale.
Gently, whatever thinking you're doing, gently think about your breathing.
The simplest possible thoughts about breathing.
Thinking, breathing in, breathing out.
As if you have all the time in the world to recognize breathing in the body.
Breathing in, breathing out.
And when you're not in the present here in your body, present.
What time are you thinking in?
If the thinking is strong, you could almost ask, what time are you living in?
And by recognizing it that it's happening in the present.
Maybe it's easier than to begin again with your breathing.
