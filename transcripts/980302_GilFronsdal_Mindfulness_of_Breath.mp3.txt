 So what I thought of talking about tonight is mindfulness of breathing. I thought it would be nice, I was inspired to kind of go back to basics, and it's always good to go back to basics. The Buddha, after he was enlightened, would go on retreat sometimes by himself and go off and sit. And I'm kind of inspired by the idea that someone who is fully enlightened would still go off and retreat. Retreats are not just simply places to develop and cultivate your spiritual life, but it's a place also to express it, to live it. Anyway, the Buddha, even after he was fully enlightened, would go and sit on retreat. And he said that if anybody asked what he was doing when he was meditating on retreat, that what he was doing was mindfulness of breathing. And that mindfulness of breath is a very important practice in almost all schools of Buddhism. And in some schools of Buddhism it's the foundational practice, in other schools of Buddhism it actually runs through a person's full spiritual development. It's beginning, middle, and end. Some people will practice meditation on breathing. And in mindfulness practice that we do, usually we place mindfulness of breathing at the center of the practice and the instructions, and then around that center everything else kind of fits into place. So it's very important, and it's useful to stress it and emphasize it and encourage all of us, including myself, to come back and really focus more strongly on the breath. It cultivates a lot of wonderful things, mindfulness of breathing. If you try it, one of the things it cultivates for most people is a discovery that our mind is out of control. And sometimes we discover what's often called the monkey mind. The monkey mind is supposedly the mind that's always grasping after things. The monkey is swinging from tree to tree, and is always grasping, grasping, grasping, grasping for one branch after the other. Something like that, the monkey mind is always racing around, always busy and agitated. And part of the function of mindfulness of breathing is not to be mindful of the breath so much, but rather to highlight what else is going on. And if you don't have a reference to somehow stop your normal activity or a reference against contrasting your normal activity, it's very hard to kind of know what your normal activity is like. And one of the great ways of getting that kind of reference is to try to be attentive to the breath. And even if you're not successful being attentive to it, what you learn in trying to be attentive to it is very wonderful. Oh, my mind is crazy. My mind's out of control. I didn't know my mind's been this busy. For the last three, four hours, my mind just racing and racing and racing. And I've been racing with it. I didn't even know. The fact that we can race along, our mind can be so driven, and we can kind of get on kind of passenger in the passenger seat of the driving and not even know that we're being driven is one of the phenomenal things about the human mind. And so we need something that shows us, that highlights that to us, so we don't have to be caught up in that drivenness. And there's many things that can do that, but mindfulness of breathing is one of those things. So while you're cultivating mindfulness of breathing, if you find that it's difficult to be attentive to your breath, knowing that it's difficult and knowing why it's difficult, that's successful. And then you've been successful. If you discover why it's difficult to be attentive to the breath, that's really wonderful for people living in the kind of busy life that we have, many of us. Once we discover that our mind is a little bit busy or very busy or the monkey mind is racing around, one of the things that the continued mindfulness of breathing practice cultivates or is supposed to cultivate is patience. It's very painful and difficult to have a mind that's out of control, that's racing around and preoccupied and driven by the many concerns we can have. And we discover what it's like to have that kind of mind, and oftentimes it's kind of painful. And it's kind of not so satisfying to be in that kind of mind. And we want it to be different. We want to control our mind, we want to stop it, we want something better, we want to fantasize about something nicer rather than fantasizing about killing our boss or whatever it might be. But it's difficult to have control over your mind. And it's difficult to cultivate a steady, continuous mindfulness of the breathing. And because it's not easy to do this, one of the things that we learned, one of the things that you have to learn, otherwise you're going to continue suffering even more, is we learn to be patient. And I think learning to be patient with ourselves and patient with our minds, patient with our hearts, patient with what's going on with us is actually a very profound ability of heart, ability of the mind, which serves us in many different areas of our life. So if we can learn a little bit of patience with what's going on for us in our sitting practice, being mindful as we're breathing, that kind of spills over, I think, into development of patience in many kind of trying situations outside of sitting itself. So we continue trying to develop mindfulness of the breathing. We try to develop continuity with the breath. But while we're doing that, we're also developing and cultivating patience, to be patient with that, patient with ourselves, patient with the difficulty of doing that. We stay with the breath, maybe we stay with the breath 10 breaths or 20 breaths or one breath or half a breath. It varies from person to person. It varies very much in the kind of activities that fill up our life. There are days where I can kind of stay with my breath for a long time. It's very smooth and easy and very content. And there are other days where I'm lucky I can get to the exhalation. It just depends what's going on with my life. My life is quite variable, the feelings, emotions, the things I have to do, the schedules and things I have to catch up to. And if I'm running around trying to do a lot, if I sit down, I have to live the consequence of being driven for a while, of running around being preoccupied and concerned. If my life is somewhat calm for a while, then it's a lot easier to sit quietly with my breathing. I don't judge that particularly. It's just depending what's going on in my life, my ability to stay with the breath varies. So cultivating some patience is very important. And it's important to remember that so we don't get caught up in trying to have some kind of achievement, trying to get some kind of award for being the best breath meditator on the block or on the planet or whatever, our delusions of grandeur want us to be. We measure ourselves against some kind of success rate. And maybe the success is not in how well you do it, but rather how patient you are with how difficult it is. As we do this and as we develop some patience, we discover other things besides the breath. We discover, as I said, some of the things that make it difficult for us to be with a breath. And a tremendous amount of insight can happen about our minds and our tendencies by trying to kind of keep coming back to the breath and then noticing why we keep wandering away. We notice how much we're driven by our desires and expectations often. We notice how much we're controlled by boredom. How many of us have been bored by our minds and breathing at times? Why do we get bored? How many of us are driven by desire? How many of us are driven by aversion? We start noticing these things and as we notice them, we can kind of have a little bit more balance amidst them, a little more ease with them, with a little bit less caught up in them and a little bit less caught up in desire, a little bit less caught up in aversion. Again, it's a very powerful training that serves us very well as we go back into our normal life where it's a lot more difficult to not get caught up in desire and aversion and boredom. A lot of people, when they come to a spiritual practice like a meditation practice, will begin with a lot of enthusiasm. This is really great. They read this great book and whatever and they think this is the best thing. They hear some kind of teachings that really sets them on fire, some possibility of some kind of radical change or some spiritual development, all kinds of excitement when people first come to meditate. When that excitement translates to trying to do the practice, sometimes it fuels a kind of intentness that really helps us to stay with the breath. There's kind of beginner's luck sometimes with meditation and really kind of in the first two weeks or months or something, sometimes people get a lot of benefit from the practice. Partly, it's because they're so excited. Inevitably, that excitement wanes. Inevitably, what will seem so special about a meditation practice becomes mundane, becomes ordinary. It should because especially if you're doing mindfulness or breathing, breath is a tremendously ordinary thing. I counted once, I didn't count, I calculated 23,000 times a day. That's a lot of times where it's become pretty ordinary and mundane. The ability to be present for the mundane life or ordinary life without excitement kind of keeping us void, without excitement keeping depression away, without excitement keeping away really who we are in deeper sense is a very important thing. To always be excited about a spiritual practice is very dangerous. Kadegiri Roshi, his end teacher, said once that if it's not boring, it's not Buddhism. No one's going to come next week. What I understand about that, not so much as supposed to be boring, but that it's supposed to be ordinary. If you need to be excited because this is the greatest spiritual thing going this week for you, then inevitably you'll be disappointed. A lot of people will do a spiritual practice for a few months and the excitement wears off, they get used to it or whatever, and then they go off and find something else. It's very important to stick to a practice at the very point where it starts becoming boring. Then boring itself, to study your boredom reveals a lot of things about how your mind works. Boredom, I don't think is inevitable when you study Buddhism. Ordinariness is, but boredom is not. Boredom often arises when we're so used to doing activities or having our life around us reflect back on some way on ourselves. If it reflects back in a way that kind of makes us feel better about ourselves or reflects back in some way that makes us feel bad about ourselves, it has our attention. It keeps us kind of excited. But if it doesn't, there are some people who have no sense of a natural state of being, a natural sense of well-being that's unexcited by either fear or desire or ambition or hate or many things. I call them these things the caffeine of the soul. People are addicted to the caffeine of the soul of always being excited in some way or other. And you'll see that, I trust, because I see it in myself. I don't think I'm so different than anyone. That as we get driven by our concerns in our mind, our thoughts and our preoccupations, we tend not to be very much in touch with some deeper sense of satisfaction, a deeper sense of contentment which is possible. There's almost a direct inverse relationship between the degree of deep contentment we feel and the degree in which we're driven in our anxiety in our head and all our thoughts and our concerns. In the Spirit Rock newsletter out there, there's an interview with Christina Feldman. And she mentions something which I think is very significant about people who do a meditation practice. If you do enough meditation practice, after a while you no longer are so interested or so addicted or so preoccupied with thinking all the time. Thinking loses some of its great allure or seductiveness. And it isn't that we stop thinking, but we're not driven to think so much. And you don't have to be always thinking madly in order to live a life which is totally successful and totally contentful and totally full of love and delight and happiness. The mind can actually be quite quiet and to have those things. Actually, in some sense, the more quiet the mind is, or the less it's driven by all those thoughts up here, the more you can actually feel your body and your mind and your heart settle into a deeper place in your body. So we stay with a breath. We try to stay with a breath as best we can. There's two things that I sometimes talked about in Vipassana circles which are great aids to mindfulness practice. One is, there's sometimes called connecting and sustaining. Connecting means really connecting to the object of your meditation practice, the object of what you're supposed to paying attention to. So if we're paying attention to the breath, it's making a full connection to the breath, really connecting to it, not just kind of casually. The danger with doing a regular meditation and breathing is at some point it becomes rote or mechanical or casual. It's possible to kind of be with it, but not really. Not really connected to it. It's kind of like dutifully kind of there in the distance, you're kind of there with it, but really you're in tahiti with your mind. So really connect to what's happening, perhaps in a loving way, in a gentle way, in an accepting way, or a calm way, or just connect with it fully. The second is to sustain the attention. So once it's connected, is to sustain the attention over time. So we connect with the breathing, with the inhalations and exhalations, and then to cultivate a sustaining of attention on that breath. And that's where it gets the most difficult, easy enough to kind of bring your attention fully and let it rest in the breath, but it's harder to let it stay there over time, to really rest over time with the coming and going of the inhalations and exhalations. As we learn to stay though, and as we learn to sustain the attention, it becomes a very, very powerful way of moving our attention, our life force, or the gravity of attention, or whatever we want to call it, the gravity of our preoccupation. It moves the gravity away from our preoccupation with thoughts, our identification with thoughts, to something else. And we are so preoccupied with our concerns that to connect to something which is physical, which is not a thought, which is not a preoccupation or concern, helps kind of lessen, dissolve, or counteract that tremendous pull that we have with thinking. And we can learn to rest then in a more contented way, in a more contented place. Most people will find, not everyone, but most people will find if they can kind of sustain some attention with a breath over time, that it begins to calm the body and calm the mind. Sustained attention to breath softens and quiets everything. A lot of it is because as long as we remain circling in the driven thoughts of our mind, that drivenness is going to, it doesn't happen in the virtual reality. It isn't like you have these virtual thoughts that kind of spin around, chase each other, look mad. To the degree in which we're kind of chasing and being chased by our thoughts, the body contracts. Have you ever noticed that? If you do some sustained meditation practice, you'll start noticing that there's a very strong correlation between what happens in your body and what happens in your mind. And your total anxiety and preoccupation with your mind, with your thoughts, translates to holding patterns in the body, in the shoulders, in the stomach, in the chest, in the hands, in the throat, in the face, different places, maybe for different emotions and different thoughts. As long as we keep being driven up here, we're continually fueling the contraction of the body. And one of the things we'll discover when you sit to be quiet is you'll notice your body is contracted or tense or tight. And as we stop being driven and fueling the spices up here, there's opportunity for the body to begin to relax. What the body wants the most is to be left alone. The body loves to be left alone. It's just begging you, please leave me alone, give me a chance. I can heal myself if you just give me a chance. Give me half a chance. And we give ourselves half a chance by not being completely lost in this world of thinking and thoughts, coming back to the breath and just being calmly with the breath, not concerned about how you're breathing, not concerned that whether you're doing it right or wrong, remember you're supposed to be patient. As soon as you're concerned about whether you're doing the breath meditation right, guess what? That concern contracts things. But if you just don't be concerned whether you're doing it right or wrong, just do it. If you do it, then you'll find that you start becoming calmer and calmer with most people calmer with time. It's a very, very powerful thing to do. So if you've come to a point in your practice where you find yourself bored with the breathing, you should take heart and say, aha, I've heard this. This is an important stage. It means you've come someplace, you've arrived someplace. It means you're no longer being enchanted by anything. And being disenchanted is really considered to be one of the great stages of Buddhist practice. It's basically being disenchanted with Buddhism. It's actually one of the formal stages of Ipasana's disenchantment. Isn't that great? If you've been enchanted, you need to be disenchanted. Isn't that obvious? It's a good thing to be disenchanted. So it's good to come to be bored for a while, but the trick is not to give in to the boredom because boredom is a very subtle form of aversion. And we have some kind of, we have some aversion to something going on. And the aversion often is based on some kind of evaluation of this situation. And it's possible to be present in an alive and full way to our life, to our body, to our breath, without evaluating in any kind of way. Evaluation belongs to this kind of driven world oftentimes. And to live and experience our physicality, experience our physical body, the liveness in our body, without an evaluation, without a judgment of what that is, is one of the things the body wants the most. It's very satisfying for the body not to be judged, not to be evaluated, just let it be what it is. And it's tricky because if we quiet down and pay attention to the body, it's not always comfortable, the body. And then if it's not comfortable, then it's almost automatic. You know, well, that's bad, or that shouldn't be, and I'm supposed to do something. And whenever I'm discomfort, I have to fix it. Mindfulness is simply to sit quietly and give the body what it wants the most. And that is not to be evaluated, not to be judged, not to try to fix it, but rather give it lots of space, which means lots of awareness. So it has a chance to do what it needs to do. It's really remarkable. I'm still very much amazed in my own practice how just sitting for 45 minutes changes my whole body. It's like I have a different body from before and after that I sit. And I'm not doing it. All I'm doing is trying to stay with my breath. So what do you think? What are your thoughts? Yeah? I was thinking, this just happened to me where it seems my body, if I miss a day or two of sitting, and I'm too busy to sit, the next time I sit, a lot of times it seems as if I go very deep into a state where it's like home or something, and the body says, yeah, I've been telling you, you should have been here a long time. But it seems that I'm aware that it's not through any special effort of my own. It just seems like I fall into that. And the same thing with thoughts. I begin to realize that I don't own them. I mean, they're not me. They're just sort of twiddle through and it's a little easier to let go of them. If you try to own them, what happens? I get tense and I start to spin off more thoughts. Isn't that great? So this idea of you don't owe your thoughts, own your thoughts is often talked about in meditation circles. And people say, well, you know, my thoughts are who I am. I'm supposed to own them. I'm responsible for them. Or the people object to it. But if you ask rather, what's the consequence of owning your thoughts or trying to own them? You probably, if you pay attention, you'll notice what Cheryl notices. You probably find yourself getting contracting more and feeling more pain, more suffering. If you let your thoughts go and not try to own them, you find yourself much more at ease. Yes. I look for me like judgment is a real issue. And you know, you understand that leaving that judgment behind gives more space and comfort. But I guess I also have a healthy understanding. I mean, living in the real world, we have responsibilities and their expectations of us and how then to not have judgments enter into our lives. I don't know. I guess maybe I just feel so far from that. I think maybe speaking to it, I think it's important to, I guess, maybe define terms a little better. Because the word judgment can mean many different things depending on the person. It has a broad range of meanings. But I think what we want to distinguish between is judgment, which is judging things as good and bad or right and wrong, which are often arbitrary categories, judging things critically or negatively, judging things based on our fear or based on our hate or based on our greed or something like that. We want to distinguish that kind of judgment with discernment, with discriminating wisdom, with discriminating consequences. So for example, what's a good example? I can't think of one now. Do you have a good sense of responsibility? Do you have a good sense of judgment around meeting those responsibilities? Well, yeah, I'm not free of judging myself. I think I kind of feel I've had to deal with this issue actually some quite a bit in the last few weeks in a new way. What do you do when you have a newborn baby who's crying terribly? How do you respond? And one of the things I noticed was that in the beginning was I took it on myself that I was responsible for his crying. And I would kind of contract terribly and feel this is god-awful. And what I have to do, I have to do something. And it's up to me. And this is, you know, I panic. And actually, I can take care of my responsibility a lot more. I'm much poorer taking care of my responsibility. If I get caught up in that kind of judgment about myself and how bad a father I am, I can't figure out what to do. As I am, if I can just simply not judge and try to not get caught up in how good or bad a father I am because he's crying. What do the neighbors think of me now? But rather, just to see the situation for what it is, stay calm myself. Allow the universe to be crying. You know, it's awful, you know, but allow it to cry. Not get contracted myself because of it. Feel the pain of it, but not contract around it. And I'm a lot more able to do the responsible thing. If I don't contract, then if I do contract, if I don't judge, as opposed to when I do. So there's a lot of discernment, a lot of discriminating wisdom that's necessary for this kind of situation. Today, my wife left me four hours alone with this little kid. And I don't have the right kind of accoutement that seems to be what he wants. So I had to be very attentive to and very discerning to very subtle cues and be right on top of them. If I miss those little cues and kind of just did the right things, you know, it was air splitting. Is this speak to your concern? The word Prajna, Panna and Pali, Prajna, sometimes is translated as wisdom, but in some of the technical Buddhist manuals, it's usually translated as discriminating wisdom. And I think that's a very good question. I think that's a very good question. Sometimes it's translated as wisdom, but in some of the technical Buddhist manuals, it's usually translated as discriminating wisdom because it involves really discriminating, but not judging. It means discriminating because of discerning, distinguishing, distinguishing wisdom. It really distinguishes one thing from another, seeing if what it really is, but not judging it. Yes. Before I understand, if you haven't meditated for a while and then you meditate, then you find your sloth and torpor is predominant. And how do you understand it? It's almost like it's something that I have to get through to the other side to get back into whatever the awareness is. It would be nice to get through quicker and easier. Well, you see part of what we're cultivating is patience, right? Patience and acceptance. And patience and acceptance doesn't mean being complacent or doesn't mean, you know, exactly doesn't mean, you know, kind of giving into something. It means you're not reacting judgmentally to it, just allowing it to be there and then continuing with the practice in a diligent way. I think different people find that there's five hindrances that are often talked about hindrances to really being present. And for different people, a different hindrance predominates. Some people are desire kind of people. The desire is the main hindrance, greed and addicted kind of thinking. Other people, it's aversion. They just hate everything. You know, I hate that breath. I hate this cushion I'm sitting on, you know, and sometimes the hate type is actually considered better for practice because you hate your defilements, you hate the hindrances, you just get rid of them. You know, all the distractions of concentration, just get rid of them, you know, no patience for it. And some people are sloth and torpor types and some people are restless types. And some people are doubt types. And it isn't like, you know, that we all have to be a type. So it's okay to be a type, but maybe you're a sloth type. You know, I don't feel like trying to analyze why. I mean, this is kind of a way of avoiding, you know, the question of causality. We can go into it, you know, analyze why sloth seems to be predominant for you. And I think that if you do do a mindfulness practice and are very diligent, you might actually some point start noticing what arises just before sloth arises. Sometimes the fraction of a second or the moment or the minute before real sleepiness sets in or sloth or laziness sets in, something else very juicy has happened. But it often happens so fast, we don't notice it. And so as the mindfulness gets stronger, you might notice the genesis of sloth. You might find that it's at a genesis, it's quite, it's another animal, it's a different animal. I need help with the note. You know, I can do the listening, listening, listening. Sort of like, I can never sort of catch it when I've like drifted off into my thinking. I can sort of, I know when I've come back, you know, it's like. I think 99% of the time, most people, unless their concentration is very strong, simply don't notice the moment when they drift off into thoughts. How many of you notice this? Oops, there I've been. It's more like that. Oops. That's pretty, it's pretty normal. But is it possible to do it? It's possible, yeah. When the mindfulness concentration gets strong, you can really kind of see the genesis of a thought. So much so you can see actually, it's kind of like, it's kind of like there's a bubble in the mind, a bubble, energy bubble or bubble of pressure or something that happens before. And you can say that that's the genesis of the thought. And if you can really just see that genesis, that bubble, that pressure, whatever kind of strange thing it is, you can actually kind of let go of it at that point. And you'll never know what that thought was. Yes. When you were speaking about disenchantment, is it the same as disillusionment in your way of thinking? Would you use it the same way? They can be used interchangeably, I guess. If you're illusioned, I guess it's pretty good to be disillusioned. So I guess it's pretty interchangeable. I think for me disenchantment is deeper because there's a stage of vipassana practice where people get disenchanted with everything, actually. And so you've already let go of illusions a long time ago, but you're no longer enchanted by anything. And it sounds kind of negative. You're no longer enchanted by anything, but actually it's a very alive and wonderful state. Partly what it means is that we're not always so wonderful, but we understand that sometimes it's very frightening. We start understanding that there's nothing in the experientable world which is going to provide any kind of lasting or permanent or any real satisfaction. And that's a kind of disenchantment. And when a person sees that through and through in a very deep meditative place, then sometimes people get frightened. Sometimes people feel very uncomfortable. Sometimes people get up and leave. But also at that point, there's often born a natural, very powerful desire for liberation, desire for the kind of presence, the kind of experience, the kind of liberation that is not conditioned anymore by anything that's in the experientable world. And that's very hard for us to understand because all our language, all our thinking, all our perceptions of everything that we've had our whole life is about things that we experience. And so we can't imagine there's anything else, anything different. But there is. And so when we get totally disillusioned or disenchanted with everything as we can experience, then there's sometimes born this natural desire for liberation. And to step, it's very difficult to talk about because often people talk about it in terms like you're leaving it, you step outside of it, you exit it or something, this experience of a world. But the experience of liberation doesn't belong to this world, but it's not separate from this world. It doesn't belong to any other world either. So I don't know why I'm saying this now, but I got myself in trouble. Yes. The five hindrances or which stages? Oh, I don't know if I can, I haven't memorized them well enough to kind of rattle them off, but there's either nine or 12 or 16, depending on how you count. It kind of gives us five or eight. Or one. Okay. Remember last couple of weeks I've talked some, especially last week I think, talked about, or in times past I've talked about commentary and conventions and concepts. And much of our life is made up of concepts and thoughts of commentary, ideas about things. We name things, we have ideas about things. There's a mental world, there's a mental recognition of things. There's things as they are, and there's our recognition of what that is. There's a mental perception or awareness of something. To see very clearly the difference between the mental side of our experience and the direct experience itself is the beginning of a real Vipassana practice. We were just sitting here being mindful, in a generic kind of way. We call it Vipassana, but technically it's not Vipassana until there's a very clear and defined distinction between these two realms of experience, of all kinds of being. Once this happens, then that's when the realm of impermanence opens up in a very profound way. That's when we see very clearly that things are rising and passing. Before that we can see that things rise and pass. Crafted lights go on and off, and all kinds of things rise and pass. But to see it at a cellular level happens after we can really distinguish between the mental and physical aspects of experience. To really see impermanence in a very, very deep way. The next stage is to have the concentration getting stronger so that our perception of impermanence speeds up. We see things start happening very fast in our awareness. They go up and down, up and down. They're very fast. Have you ever been on a train or a bus? You're looking out perpendicular, and you see the picket fence or the telephone poles. If you're looking perpendicular and the train's going fast enough, all you see is that the fence is disappearing. You don't see it's arriving. You know that kind of experience? So once concentration gets strong enough, that's the experience we have of everything. Things are just passing away. It's a little bit disorienting because you've been trained all your mindfulness career to bring your attention to something. By the time your attention is there, it's gone. So how do you practice? It's very difficult. But anyway, we don't get discouraged and we just continue anyway. And once this experience of impermanence gets very, very strong, then the understanding that there's no self in that experience, there's no self in anything that can be experienced becomes very strong also. And that also can, for some people, can be very frightening to see that they can't find anything they can identify, this is myself. It's kind of like most of us have a generic kind of global sense of who we are. But if you kind of try to pinpoint it, when your mind is very concentrated, you can't find it. It's kind of like sitting here in Palo Alto. We all know where Stanford is. We can kind of point to it over there. We have kind of general sense, right? But if you go to Stanford with a magnifying glass and say, where's Stanford? And you say, well, you pointed at that building. Is that Stanford? No, that's just the library. That's not Stanford. Well, is it the administration office? No, that's not Stanford. You can't find anything which is Stanford except in the conceptual framework, right? So we do that with ourselves and we start finding you can't find anything which is a self. And then next people often then start feeling this kind of disenchantment develops. You can't find anything which is self. You can't find anything. Everything is so passable and impermanent that it's not really going to provide lasting happiness. And so there's kind of disenchantment with that world and this born this desire for liberation. And as we continue practicing, then one of the next important stages is a stage of equanimity. And we start seeing all the flow of impermanence, things are constantly changing and the mind no longer reacts to it, no longer judge it, no longer is afraid of it, no longer tries to hold on to anything, tries to do anything, but it just allows it to come and go as it wishes. Very kind of great evenness of mind. And it's a very, very pleasant, very satisfying stage of meditation to have this tremendous, tremendous peace and equanimity about whatever is going to happen, whatever arises in your experience. And that kind of equanimity allows the mind to relax, allows the last remnants of clinging, the last remnants of fear to kind of begin dissolving, allows to trust more and more. And when the trust becomes strong enough, there's no more, even the slightest remnants of clinging or fear or aversion, then consciousness or awareness releases itself. And that's the end of the path of Vipassana. Something like that. And one of the things we realize when consciousness releases itself is that I don't know what to say, how to say it, but one way to say it is that everything was perfect from the beginning. We didn't have to do it. Does this make sense to you, Jean? A little bit, a teeny bit? Or does it discourage you? Some people get discouraged hearing these kinds of things. Yes? I mean, how long it lasts? Well, maybe, but can you elaborate a little more? It seems that for most people, the first time it happens, it's like that. It happens very fast. It's over. With training, it's possible to sustain it for a long period of time. Hours? Oh, really? Mindfulness training. So one of the beautiful things about Vipassana practice is, there is this, you know, these stages are not so important, you know, and I don't teach this very often for various reasons. But one of the beautiful things is that you follow the stages to the very top, and you know, whatever happens at the end, there's an end to Vipassana practice. And you think that it's done, you can go Tahiti finally. When you get to the end, you just get to do it again. And again, because mindfulness is very closely akin to liberation, to freedom. And so as long as we're alive and living in this world, we're practicing mindfulness, we're dedicated to mindfulness, dedicated to the liberation which is mindfulness, or the mindfulness which is liberation. Yes? I guess I'm coming back to something very like the first question, because you're in a circle, it kind of confuses me. There are certain things that are held as values, it seems to me, being skillful of reducing suffering. And when you say nothing matters, I don't understand what happens to those values. Well, I think that suffering matters a lot. And responding to suffering and trying to alleviate suffering matters a lot, it's very important. That's a central value in Buddhism. Then you're not suffering. What? Oh, then you go help them. Well, I guess maybe the same thing with the question about judgment. Yes. We can respond responsibly. We can be discerning and decide how to respond and try to be of help without there being any contraction or aversion in the mind. So I think it's useful to distinguish between awareness and all the responses and reactions that we have to the world around us. The language of allowing, the language of acceptance, the language that doesn't matter, the language is all perfect, applies only really to the world of awareness. So awareness, it's possible to have an awareness that's totally transparent, totally allows things to be just the way they are. And that's what we're trying to cultivate in this practice, to allow things to be just the way they are. But to have an awareness that does that doesn't mean that the rest of us has to do that. I guess you don't understand the word laugh. That our knowing, that our consciousness, that our attention in no way either goes forward towards something or pulls back towards something. So for example, an example of my newborn kid, I can allow his crying to be there in my awareness and not contract, not react negatively to it, just to be there. Or I can kind of close down around it. My conscious it gets darker. Or I run away. You've got to go and do something. Both way, I'll do something. Both way, I'll do something. The awareness doesn't itself stays neutral. Maybe I'm trying to explain what can't be explained, but aware of the self stays neutral no matter what happens. The rest of us, based on our values, the best understanding we have the situation, might get very actively involved in trying to remedy the situation. But remedying doesn't mean that we have to kind of, the heart doesn't have to contract. Does it make a little bit more sense? It makes a lot more sense. I still have a couple with the word allow as opposed to, somehow that seems to be very active to me if I allow it and I'm not going to do anything about it. The state of my mind is something separate from what I'm allowing or just allowing out there. Maybe I'm just using the word differently from you. Maybe it's kind of like you have a bell and if I hold the bell like this, I don't get any sound. I have to kind of allow the bell to kind of give it its freedom. I have to let it be. And what I do with my hand is very different with, with my left hand is very different when I do with the right hand. So I can do various things with my right hand. I can cling to it and make no music. But if I can hold it kind of very lightly, then my right hand can make music and make nice sound. So same thing, if we hold our heart really tight and contract our hearts around what's going on in the world, we're not going to make much beautiful music. But if our heart is, is not contracted, then I think we can respond to the world much more responsibly and know what's, what the right thing is to do. And if someone is suffering, just to allow it, you know, callously is a terrible thing. It's, you know, it's, if there's suffering in the world, we should respond to it. But we don't have to respond to it with, with contraction. Yes. When you were talking, I had the image of the mythic cystathist, knowing suffering and pushing the boulder up the precipice, the hill, the mountain, whatever. And so, and then when you're talking about breathing, I thought, well, you know, getting the rocks up the hill, with the, you know, and downhill and up the hill, yeah, downhill and up the hill. Well, it is not quite like cystathist. It's, it's, it's better. But if you breathe, it doesn't have to be, I guess the breath thing about getting it up the hill was just that, you know, you don't necessarily have to do it with your physical strength, but you can breathe and, you know, just go up there anyway, down. That's nice. That's nice. See a lot of this process, a lot of this process that I described, the stages of vipassana, you don't do it. You're not responsible for it. You don't make it happen. The more you make it happen, the less it happens. You have to get out of the way. And so it's the training and patience, the training and allowing is very, very important because as the deeper stages of mindfulness occur, you really have to get out of the way. You have to keep doing the practice of being mindful, but more than that, you can't try to do anything. It just interferes. It happens on its own. So if you're pushing this, if you're pushing uphill like cystathist, the stone will never go anywhere. Right. Yeah. Well, thank you for bringing it back to the breath. I was supposed to be a simple talk today about this very basic thing about practice. I encourage you to kind of focus on the breath and here you all go off and want to hear about everything. You know, the highest stages of practice and, you know, and, you know, now I've given you more things to be enchanted by. Anyway, thank you very much. And I hope it was useful. And if you want to, if you, if you want to come to the dinner, be sure to pick up a card. Sure.
