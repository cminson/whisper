The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So there are sometimes when I think of the dharma teachers who write out their talks beforehand
and have the little table in front and read it out and put a little bit in here and there.
Sometimes that would be quite nice to be able to do that.
But in the way that I've been trained and that I continue in, our practice in sharing the dharma is to speak from the moment, from the heart.
And it can be an act of faith because one doesn't always know exactly what's going to come out.
I feel like it's going to be one of those evenings where I'm not really sure what I'm going to speak about.
And maybe it will come in their meditation.
Maybe during the meditation it will become clear.
So during the meditation quite a number of different things are going through my mind.
Then I asked Jill, what should I talk about tonight?
She wasn't very helpful.
So I think what really strongest for me at the moment is the vulnerability or the tenderness, you could say, of being a human being.
And while we were doing the chanting, the first part of the chanting where we were recollecting the Buddha, even I've done this chant for years.
When I'm chanting, particularly the morning chanting, it's got a little bit slightly different wording.
I have this sense of the Buddha as a person, as a human being, when the phrase that comes to mind was washed by all waters.
He went through so much both before his enlightenment and after.
And I feel this sense of devotion as I chant to this man, this human being who in the human realm that we are all in,
in this sensitive human realm that we all live in, found the path that leads to the ending of suffering.
And the key to the path, the entrance to that path being turning towards suffering or turning towards dukkha.
Perhaps living in a monastic situation we hear, we meet many different people and we can hear from many different people the troubles of just an ordinary human life.
And it really hits home the vulnerability of being a human being, the sensitivity and vulnerability of being a human being.
So the Buddha is encouraging us to look at the way we create suffering for ourselves, the way we, through really being at odds with the way things are,
not really being with things as they are.
And I'm sure for the fully enlightened Buddha, he's not experiencing the sense of vulnerability or trembling.
They speak about the unshakable deliverance of the heart. It's a very beautiful expression.
So in the enlightened one, the heart is unshakable. There's no more trembling of the heart.
But for those of us who aren't enlightened, there's quite a bit of trembling going on.
It can be falling in love, it can be beautiful, exciting, wonderful.
And it can be fear, it can be frightening, it can be afraid of what's going to happen.
It can be doubt, not sure how to make the right choice, big life changes.
It can be grief, a sense of loss, things separated from our loved ones.
The heart is constantly, it seems, reverberating and trembling and responding to what life brings.
And when we're with that, it can be very challenging.
It can feel like it would be much nicer just not to have to feel sometimes.
Just to be able to kind of maybe rise up into the intellect and not pay attention to anything that's going on below the neck.
I think people do that.
But our human experience is a sensitive one. And it's what we share, we share that.
We are all brothers and sisters in hope and in loss and in birth and in death.
We're all brothers and sisters. It's what levels us, regardless of our position in society or a bank account, whatever it might be,
that we see as what makes a status.
We all share the same vulnerability as human beings.
And it's kind of inevitable.
Once we're born, it is inevitable that we will go through game and loss.
We'll get things that we want and we'll lose what we want.
We'll lose what we love or we'll want what someone else has got.
We'll lose what we can't have or isn't here with us.
It's kind of inevitable that we go through those things.
And as the body ages, you know, experience pain, physical pain and loss and loss of maybe beauty.
And then the brain as we get older, we'll get a loss of the faculties for some.
People keep them right to the end, but most of us lose a few brain cells along the way.
And eventually the body dies.
We have to leave it all behind.
Whatever we've accumulated, whatever we've accomplished, we have to leave it all behind.
So this is where we meet in that place.
It's a place that we don't often consciously meet in, because it's not a place that society encourages us to look at.
But it is where we all meet.
And when I feel that, there's a sense of, well, the word tenderness, a sense of tenderness.
You know, we can make that with aversion, feeling it's wrong or we don't want it or why does it have to happen to me?
But these things happen to everyone. They're part of this human experience.
It's part of a deal, I could say.
So I value more and more greatly the ability to stay open and present with whatever feelings are arising here in this body mind.
So there was a time when I first started to practice, I wanted to get away from the painful feelings I was experiencing as being a separate human being.
It was a very, very painful experience.
A very strong sense of a separate self.
And the Buddha's teaching was promising me a way out of that.
So at that time, my understanding, my limited understanding was that I could get away from basically being sentient, feeling.
And probably there was some motivation, a little bit of confusion there, going into monastic life, thinking, you know,
there in a monastic situation, I can avoid painful feeling.
Probably wasn't very conscious, but it was definitely there.
And of course, being in a monastery does not equal avoiding painful feeling at all.
So, you know, first of all, it would be with people, interactions, you know,
with kind of hope that the interactions would be nice, compassionate and understanding,
and we'd all be on the same wavelength, then you find that that's not the case.
Everybody's in their little world, we're all in our little worlds.
It's amazing that we can function at all, actually.
We each have our own world going on, our own experience going on.
And those worlds sometimes meet and they sometimes bump into each other.
They sometimes miss each other altogether.
And that's just kind of how it is.
And then, of course, physical suffering, one can't avoid.
Physical pain and maybe also hunger, only being able to eat in the morning.
And first, sometimes, and fatigue, going to work hard.
Now, these are just, it took me a while to realize that this wasn't, you know,
these weren't things that I was going to be able to get away from.
This is just part of being human.
And then there's the, for me, then there was the trying to end my attachments to people.
So, trying to cut, break the attachments I had to people.
I had some quite strong ones, came in with some very strong attachments.
And spending some time trying to do that, you know,
through contemplating death.
I use death as a contemplation a lot.
And my own death and the death of those I love.
And also a super practice, you know, focusing on the organs and the sinews
and the muscles and the skin and the hair and all the things that make up the body.
So, thinking about someone I was very attracted to,
then I would go through these contemplations on my own body and the body of that person.
And my motivation was to cut the attachments, sever the attachments.
And it took me some time, maybe a few years, to realize that you can't do that.
You can't sever attachments through your will.
It doesn't work.
And actually the Buddha's path and teaching is asking us to meet our experience
in a much more subtle and open way.
So, you know, there is the purpose really of the practice is to develop compassion and wisdom.
And yet it's very easy to meet the practice from a place that isn't compassionate or wise.
You know, that there's actually trying to get something or get rid of something or move on.
Or become.
Become a great meditator or become a stream-enter or become enlightened.
And then we maybe start the practice in that way, meet the practice in that way.
And then we find we keep kind of stumbling over ourselves.
We stumble over our karma and again and again kind of are brought to our knees
in our very ordinary humanity.
So it seems to me that the Buddha is asking us to look much more subtly and carefully at our experience
and to use those wings of wisdom and compassion to look, to pay attention to what's going on here.
And with, you know, you could think those wings were his hands that can hold experience.
So if you have with those two aspects of compassion and wisdom, we can be with pretty much anything that's going on.
Pretty much anything.
So if we have a strong wisdom aspect that is very focused on impermanence, for example,
wisdom is that which sees clearly the way things are.
So recognizing the impermanence of all things, knowing the impermanence of all things,
the state of flux that everything is in, this is a liberating aspect.
But without compassion, it can become cold and almost inhuman.
I've watched, I've witnessed that, I've witnessed that in the even quite experienced, very experienced practitioners,
that taking kind of a side on wisdom, even it's very profound.
Even it's not held hand in hand with compassion, it becomes heartless, becomes cold and even harmful.
And then, so, you know, we need the element of compassion, the warmth, the resonance of compassion
within which to hold the teaching.
And one of the aspects of compassion or one of the ways it can be translated is to,
the heart shakes with or is moved by what is happening.
So it's responsive to what is happening.
So the wisdom is that which is unmoved and the compassion is that which is moved.
And they belong together.
It kind of sounds like a paradox.
It sounds like it's not possible for them both to be present.
But when one is present with, when one brings wisdom to the experience that's happening here in our body-mind,
we can be with it, we can know it, we can see the change that's going on.
And then the compassion is like the warmth of understanding, the kindness, the patience, the forgiveness,
you know, the acceptance of the shaking heart.
And the wisdom knows that it's changing, so it doesn't have to hold on and become what's going on.
It doesn't have to become the doubt or the fear or the grief or the wanting.
It's knowing that, it's knowing it, and the compassion is kind of holding it.
So it's not trying to get this over and done with to get on to the next thing,
it's interested, it's kind, it's present, it's holding.
So if we can develop these qualities in our practice, then there are no obstacles to the path.
Then whatever life is bringing, whatever we're meeting in life is, the path is our teacher.
There are no hurdles to get over or obstacles to move out of the way, but they are the very path itself.
They are what teaches us.
And our impatience to get on to the next thing, you know, that becomes like a hurdle,
and then we kind of trip over that, and then when we remember and come back again,
we recognize, okay, that's the feeling of impatience, and then that becomes the teacher again.
So it is a very humble path, and it is bringing us back again and again to this experience, to this experience, as it is.
So compassion and wisdom, they need to be developed.
If we were fully equipped with compassion and wisdom, we wouldn't need to be practicing,
we would just be in a state of compassion and wisdom, we'd be free, great.
But until we are free, we need to work on those qualities.
So wisdom, you can find wisdom in many places.
It doesn't necessarily equate with intellect or IQ.
It can do, but it can also have very wise, uneducated, simple people.
So wisdom is a quality of understanding, of knowing, of direct knowing, here and now.
And it's very simple, if one can bring, if one can uncomplicate the mind enough to bring it into presence with what is happening here and now.
And the tools, just like the sharpening tools for wisdom are contemplating the ever-changing nature of things,
or noticing, not just contemplating, but noticing the ever-changing nature of everything, all the time, at every moment.
So somebody was saying the other day that they were afraid to let go of their kilesas, like their defilements, their obscurations of mind,
like greed and hatred and delusion. They were afraid to let go of that because if they let go of that, who would they be?
Who would I be without greed, hatred and delusion?
And there would be nothing, and that would be really scary.
But actually, the point is that we're a process, what we take to ourselves is a process, and our life is a process.
So we can be a process with greed, hatred and delusion, which leads to suffering, which is also a process.
Or we can be a process without greed, hatred and delusion, which is simply a process.
It simply is what it is. It is a process going through what it's going through at this moment.
And there's a great freedom in that.
So wisdom is asking us to look at this constant changing nature of things,
look at the way we fix and hold and create things where there are no things,
and to let go and allow this process to continue.
And suffering, also dukkha, is also a door to that, or an invitation to do that.
It's much less likely for us to do that when everything is going great.
But when things are getting difficult, it's like an invitation, it's a reminder, hey, have a look.
Is this really me? Is this really solid? Is this really permanent? Or is this changing?
And you can feel it. If you come into presence, you can feel the flux.
You can feel the flux of pretty much anything.
So this isn't to dismiss our experience.
This is one of the things that, when we speak about impermanence, people sometimes think,
oh, well, if everything is impermanent, it doesn't matter.
So that's just sort of, that doesn't matter. It's just changing.
But as I understand it, the wisdom and compassion are not saying, it doesn't matter.
They're saying, look, look at this. Look at what's going on here.
Come and have a look at this.
It's paying really close attention. It's being really interested in this ever-changing process of all of it, all of it.
So the impermanence is our most profound teacher.
It's not someone to be dismissed.
And compassion is that which can hold the confusion, the sorrow, the loss, the wanting, the not wanting,
the aging, the sickness, all of that.
Compassion is that which can hold all of that, the brokenness, the yearning for wholeness, all of that.
It's like, it's not impatient, it's not judgmental.
It's what the judgmental thoughts can be held within. It doesn't judge the judging mind.
So compassion is like the holding.
I've always very, very much appreciated that the Buddha's teaching is, it holds this paradox of emptiness and laugh, he could call it.
It holds both. It doesn't take sides on one or the other.
And it's a very difficult place to find within ourselves.
It's not easy to find that place where there is both understanding of the emptiness of all things,
in the constant changing nature of all things, and have compassion for ourselves and others.
Because then the rational mind wants to take a position and say, well, there is no self.
So what is there to be compassionate about? There's no self.
Or the compassionate mind or heart might say, oh, we have to just really take care of every individual, every being,
and not hold the bigger context of, in some ways, this is, well, let's say to protect others from suffering is impossible.
Let's put it that way. We can't protect others from experiencing suffering.
So the compassionate heart wants to take care of and end and ease the suffering of others, and we can do that to some degree.
But even the Buddha, the fully enlightened one, couldn't take away the suffering of others.
He could only point to, actually pointing back to the suffering as the door to the ending of suffering.
So we have to find that place within ourselves where they are both present,
the understanding, the presence with this constant change, and the compassion for being a sentient being,
which is a challenge, a challenge being human.
And a very important part of this is to allow ourselves to feel, feeling what's going on.
So we have all kinds of amazing tricks to avoid feeling.
And we can be very clever and rationalise and have very complicated reasons why we're doing what we're doing.
And often it's just a means to distract ourselves from being with what's going on here,
to not feel deeply into what's going on here.
So if we can develop the awareness, the strength of mind to be with feeling of this body-mind as it is, whatever is going on,
this leads us into the Dhamma, you could say.
This is the place where we're no longer creating ourselves or trying to get rid of,
but we're with this feeling as it is, it's like this, and it's changing.
And it's not who and what I am, it is this, it's simply this.
So what I'm saying can't really be understood through the intellect so well,
it's this experiential teaching.
And through coming into presence with this sensitive experience of being a human being,
it opens the door to the ending of suffering.
And it's kind of counter-intuitive because we tend to think,
when I come here I feel all that stuff, I feel all that vulnerability or that doubt or that grief or the longing.
And so I have to do something that moves away from that.
But actually we have to move deeper into it with greater presence.
And we find when we do that that it opens up.
And it becomes a teacher that leads us to freedom from suffering.
So I'm going to end my talk there so that I don't go round again.
And I'd like to just open up if anyone has any questions,
because I haven't gone into great detail, but if anyone has any questions about the actual practice of what I'm saying,
or if what I'm saying makes sense or doesn't make sense, maybe it doesn't make sense to you, I don't know.
So please, it's helpful for me if you share a little bit of your experience or ask.
Also if you have any questions about what I'm saying.
And I just want to add that one can practice for a long time without really going into the experience of being human.
I know people have been practicing a long time, done long retreats.
Very dedicated practice, but there's still a sense of embarrassment or awkwardness about really being with what's going on.
Really being fully human.
Because it is a kind of, being human it is a kind of embarrassing predicament in some ways.
It can be.
So this is where this comes out tonight.
I think maybe there's been a few.
Anyway, I don't know.
So I'd like to just open the floor if you have any questions about the application of this, or what I mean, or more clarification.
I really appreciated your linking of wisdom and compassion.
That's something that I've looked at in my own practice.
Being one who's had to work with being embarrassed at being human.
It's embarrassing.
And I, sort of the natural response of a mind that understands emptiness is actually to come back in the world and act with compassion.
And then I can also see that the other way and that the deepest compassion would include the desire to end the suffering of the feeling of the separate self.
So maybe the deepest compassion is to walk a path of wisdom.
So I really like the way they intertwine.
Sometimes they're set up as, you know, they balance each other and you said a little bit of that.
But I like the idea that they also enhance each other.
I think it can be that one develops one side.
Perhaps it's not fully developed.
One can develop like a wisdom aspect and lose compassion.
I've witnessed that, but probably as one continues to develop the wisdom aspect, then it comes around again.
And also with compassion, with compassion it can be, you know, a really wanting to end suffering without actually really understanding that, you know, the nature of saying sorrow.
And then there's just like a, you get compassion, burnout and so on.
So it can, just to say that that can also happen.
But I think as you say, as they develop, then they become two sides of one thing.
Thank you.
Maybe with your own experience, how does one compare the two?
Okay.
So the question, I can just repeat the question.
The question is how does one turn towards the suffering?
So like an understanding of the concept of wisdom and compassion, about how does one actually turn towards suffering?
That's a good question.
I'm so used to it now that I have to think about how one does it.
Well, I think, you know, if the first thing we tend to do is to find ways to avoid suffering, you know, there is suffering, suffering arises, you know, that's just how it is.
And then we find ways to avoid it.
And, you know, the first thing to do is to seek either like sensual pleasure or intellectual pleasure, stimulation.
And I think many people, you know, go through a whole lifetime doing that and just get to the end of life and have the consequences of that.
I think, you know, that people, once you start on the path of practice, generally people have had some insight into the fact that there is suffering.
You know, one cannot actually, one has tried hard but hasn't managed to avoid it, hasn't managed to get away from suffering.
So, you know, we have our tactics of avoidance and they wear fin after a while, or maybe they never even work in the first place.
So when that happens, then we find that we can't really avoid the suffering that is present, we just see here it is.
And then we might still try and find ways to avoid it and generally trying to find ways to avoid it, increase the suffering over time.
So sooner or later, if we're fortunate enough, we have to actually stop and have a look at what's going on.
And it's almost like, often it's when it's at a point where we can't do anything other than that, you know, we've got our nose up against it.
So we don't actually have to turn towards it, it's turned towards us and we have to just look.
So that's kind of how it starts. And then, you know, with the teaching on the Four Noble Truths, the Buddha is pointing us to understanding suffering.
So that's like being interested in it. And I like to use expression like standing under. You stand under it like you would under a thunderstorm or you let yourself get wet, you know, rainstorm.
So, you know, the first thing is you can't move away from it and then because you can't move away, you know, and then there is this teaching from enlightened being who probably knows what he's talking about.
You know, there's a kind of interest of like, OK, well, what happens if I stop that movement away from this and try to be with it, try to stay present with this painful feeling.
And, you know, it might be that we can only do it for a very short time and then we go off into something else, a thought, feeling, do something, eat something, watch something, whatever, drink something, you know.
But if we know that once we know what we're doing, once we know that that is an avoidance, you know, we can't really get away with it as easily as we used to.
It's almost like it has its own momentum and once we start to see, you know, once we start to see, then we're kind of drawn back to look at what's going on.
And then, you know, at first it might be this very ambivalent relationship where we can be with everyone, go and do something else, do something else, and then we're back with it again and it's painful to do something else.
And then over time, if we trust the teaching, then we start to, you know, instead of following that movement away from to try and make it feel better or avoid it, we take an interest.
It's like, well, what does it feel like? And how does it feel actually in this moment, this feeling of self-consciousness, let's say?
What does that feel like? And then it's like, oh, it kind of feels here and here, different parts of the body.
And it's got a sort of a feeling tone. You start to notice how it is.
And then as one pays attention to it in that way, it sort of loses its reality of self-consciousness, I'm self-conscious, I shouldn't be self-conscious.
It loses that and it just becomes this direct experience of like, oh, that's interesting, it's got that vibration and it feels like that.
And then you can feel like, oh, it doesn't always feel like that in this body, in mind. Sometimes it feels quite different, you know, so it's always changing.
And then when another something else comes up, maybe anger.
And, you know, you're really angry and you know to act on anger is going to cause more problems, so you're not going to do that.
But then you're left with this anger, you know, and that's really unpleasant.
So, you know, with that feeling, and then you're kind of like, well, what is it like?
It's got a lot of energy, it's moving, it's hot, it's got a lot of force.
And then it can even feel quite pleasant when you're really with it.
You're like, wow, you know, I feel really empowered when you're not throwing it out at other people.
So it's like changing the relationship with suffering from something you want to get away from or get over or try and finish to, oh, what's this?
What does it feel like? What does it look like?
You know, you might, some people have a visual mind, I tend to see visually, you can feel the tone and then you can see like, oh, it's red or sometimes it might even be white if it's really hot.
You know, it's got this, it's like fire would be, you know, and it's got a certain movement, like molten movement or, you know, fear.
You know, you might experience fear as a dark, like a black, contracted experience, trembling, black feeling.
And then it's like, because that's become interesting rather than a problem.
And you pay attention to it and take interest in it and when you bring your attention to those feelings, just the attention itself starts to change the experience.
It starts to open up, it starts to transform just through the life of awareness, just through bringing attention to it itself.
But if we bring attention in order to try and make it change, it doesn't work.
It's like an attitude of interest and curiosity and investigation.
And then over time you develop a strength of awareness, your mind gets stronger, you're able to be with those feelings.
And also knowing that they're changing is a very important part of it, knowing that this isn't always going to be like this, you know.
It's a very important part, otherwise it's very hard to be with it.
When we take it as me and mine, it's very, very hard to be with it.
And when it's like, you know, the weight of the tides of grief or the volcano of anger or the whirlpool of doubt, you know,
and we see them from what they are, rather than from what is me and mine, then it also helps to stay present.
So it would seem to me that if there was really a very...
Okay, I was drawn to your comment earlier about how wisdom is the unchanging and the compassion is...
The wisdom is the steady and the compassion is the changing.
The compassion is that which feels with...
It's not the same thing but it trembles with, it's like resonant.
What is changing?
Okay, so I got this visual picture that I couldn't remember the words.
So it seemed to me that if one really is wise about things, then it would be easier to hold an open heart.
The heart just is open, I think, when one is really wise.
I think when one is truly wise, then the heart is open, yeah.
I mean, like really very, you know, awakened wise, yeah.
So like Mother Teresa.
I think Mother Teresa had a lot of suffering, is she?
She had a lot of suffering.
But she had an open heart and she seemed like she was able to hold that.
Yeah, I never met her, so it's a difficult one to speak about.
I was thinking about Mother Teresa because she had immense compassion, incredible compassion.
And she served in this humble way and she did great things in terms of how many people's lives she touched.
And I mean, I never met her and I never spoke with her or anything, so I can't say very much.
But when she died, it was interesting to see how much angst she actually went through.
She seems to be like that in God and the sense of being left where are you and a lot of angst.
So it's difficult to speak about her because she's not here and I've never had a conversation with her and I don't know.
But it seems that there was great compassion and then there was maybe an element of wisdom missing.
Strike me down, like me.
I don't want to say she wasn't wise because she was, but there was something there that her heart wasn't completely free.
And there was still this sense of, it seemed like quite great troubledness, actually.
So then, okay, so it seems to me that the compassion, to have that much compassion, and let's not talk about her,
but just in general, to have that much compassion, I can't visualize.
I can't imagine having that much compassion without having an anchor of wisdom, I guess.
I don't really have a question, I guess.
I'm thinking about how does one develop that stronghold of wisdom in order to be able to really have that level of,
a huge level of open-heartedness and compassion without bringing in suffering on it.
I haven't got there yet.
I think it's a journey, because you're thinking about, it's got a little bit of a sense of completion in the way you're thinking, how do I get there?
It's a journey and it's a process, so I'm not there, so I can't tell you how to get there.
But what I can see is that wisdom and compassion, that they balance each other, that they belong together.
And maybe over lifetimes, we have to learn it, or maybe not.
In other words, she develops immense compassion, and it might be that she has to still work on the wisdom aspect.
She doesn't need to work on the compassion aspect anymore, and it's a process.
So most of us aren't anywhere near Mother Teresa's, probably all of us would say, her openness of heart.
And so coming back to how we are, it's like, it's recognizing when the heart closes down.
And recognizing where we get, so you can feel that, the heart closing down.
And then there can also be the moving into the head, and having very bright, clever, righteous ideas that aren't really connected with what's going on.
There can be incredible clarity, and it can be very right, but it isn't connected.
So I think it's the connection of those two, the heart and the head really, and the understanding and the feeling, which is an ongoing process.
And that we just have to keep paying attention to both of those.
And at some time, one is stronger, another time the other is stronger, or we may have a natural disposition towards one or the other,
and then we see that and we cultivate the other side of it.
But I think the most useful thing is to be able to be with this, what's going on here, very honestly,
and allow oneself to feel it and to know that it's changing.
And that is the path that leads to the culmination of those two being fully cultivated.
I'm not sure how useful it is to think of Mother Teresa, for example, because she's like a great saint, and we're pretty ordinary human beings.
So we have to start from here and look at this, and how to find the balance here in our own experience.
And I think know that it's possible, like the Buddha was living both.
I've been practicing only for a couple months, but I've noticed much less anxiety and feeling a lot more calm,
and noticing I'm not so interested in creating drama or being involved in drama, which was something I did.
But something interesting is other people in my life are not used to that in me, and try to get me back to the way I was sort of being or thinking before,
and I'm not quite sure how to...it's an interesting thing, but I'm not sure what's the best way to work with that.
Well, I think probably most people experience, you know, when you start practicing, you do change quite a lot, and your values change.
And, you know, I mean, I wasn't always like this, you know.
So you can lose friends. You can lose friends.
There can be a period of time when you lose the friends you had, and you haven't made the new ones yet,
and you become a very boring person that people, you know, don't know what to do with anymore.
And you have to kind of bear with that if it's important to you.
If your practice is important to you and it's what you value, then it's like your heart knows that you need to stay with that.
You can see that it's benefitting you. It's a good thing.
And then you know, well, this is what I need to be doing.
And then some people fall away from your life.
And then as you keep practicing and developing your path, you find you get to know new people and people who are more resonant with what you're doing.
And you find a whole new field of companionship in that way.
But you do sometimes have to go through that difficult period of misfit and not fitting.
In some ways it's almost like it must be for, I hope you don't mind me saying it,
but I think for alcoholics and drug addicts, when they start coming off their whatever chosen substance,
they can't fit back into the society they're in because they're not doing that anymore.
And they might still really love their friends and the people they knew, but they can't stay with them
because they're not interested in that anymore. They want to get out of that.
So it's a bit like that really. You can't keep on the things that were fun and exciting and entertaining.
They're just, they get in the way now. They're kind of a bit of pointless.
And so you just naturally move away from that.
And you can still love the people, but you can't necessarily meet them in that place anymore.
But just to trust the process really.
I was very surprised when I started practicing more.
I came to the monastery just two years after I started meditating, so I hadn't been meditating very long.
I was interested in dharma, but I didn't learn to meditate until later.
And I was very surprised at the people who fell away and the people who stayed with me, actually.
They were quite unexpected. Not at all what I would have thought.
So the people I thought would be interested and supportive and totally cut off.
And people who I thought would not at all be able to relate to it stayed in contact.
So it's kind of like you find out who your real friends are, you know, if you go into that.
Because what you're doing is good for yourself, you're benefiting yourself.
And you know that that's the right thing to do.
And then there are those who maybe just wanted you for entertainment, for fun, for a laugh, whatever, for a drama.
Because it was exciting. And then it's not exciting anymore.
And then there'll be others who really love you and they'll stay with you.
It's a few months into the practice, but it's an interesting path.
Because once you start, once you get to a certain point, you can't turn back.
And I still remember times when I wished I could.
If only I could turn back.
Because you realise that you've got to keep leaving things behind and moving on.
But at the same time, it's not like you become more and more poor.
It's almost like you get richer, your life gets richer and richer.
But in a true way.
So I really wish you well in your path, in your practice.
Okay, she doesn't give in on the time. So we've gone over time, very sorry.
