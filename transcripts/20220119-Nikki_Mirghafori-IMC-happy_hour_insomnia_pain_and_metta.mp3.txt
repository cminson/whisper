The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, formally hello and welcome to Happy Hour. Lovely to see you, to be with you,
dear fellow practitioners. So, for the theme for today, the theme is inspired by a conversation I
had with a practitioner who was talking about who was having a practice discussion and about
how they wake up sometimes in the middle of the night with, and they have insomnia and pain.
And this is part of the human condition. Anyone, anyone has ever, anyone of you has never,
I can't speak tonight. The question I'm trying to get out is to feel into your own experience and
remember the times that you have woken up in the middle of the night with insomnia or with pain.
Anyone not, anyone who's not had that experience in their lives? Yeah, it's, it's, we all have that
experience of waking up with pain with insomnia or, or if not in the middle of the night,
we have a body, we have a human body, all of us experience pain. At some point,
it's a part of being human. It's, it's a mark of existence having a body that experience illness,
it experiences pain, it experiences aging, etc. It's a mark of existence. So, so knowing that
these are parts of being human, it's not a mistake. It's not that you have done something wrong and
you're being punished or you're bad, it's just part of life. These things happen, insomnia happens,
illness happens, because we are human beings, things arise, causes and conditions, so many of
them out of our control, some within our control, but so many of them out of our control, so many
of them out of control, out of our control. So, so how do we work? How can we work compassionately
and with metta with these causes and conditions? So, so keep this meditation, this teaching in your
back pocket the next time you wake up in the middle of the night, perhaps with pain or with
insomnia. So, so the first invitation, the first invitation is how we approach the perspective
we take with what is arising. Do we self-flagellate? Do we apply what's called second arrows in the
Buddhist teachings? The first arrow is the pain, the first arrow is the suffering, the insomnia
that has arisen because of all the causes and conditions. Do we then take and hit ourselves
and injure ourselves with second arrows of, oh, why me? Why is this happening to me? Why,
what's wrong with me? Like, it's my fault, I'm terrible, like me, bad, bad, bad, ouch, ouch,
you're already hurting. You know, we often take daggers and just like, we start injuring ourselves
even more. Or this is terrible, this is awful, make it go away as if by the force of will,
we can make it go away. And guess what? It's especially sleeping and pain, the more we tighten,
the more our bodies and our minds tighten around it with aversion, with wanting to push it away.
Guess what happens? The opposite, right? They get worse, we get more wound up, both with the pain
and with being awake. So the invitation is to recognize if there are second arrows. And if
there are second arrows, again, don't take on third arrows, like, oh, I'm a terrible practitioner,
I'm self-flagellating, I've been meditating for a while and I still, I'm hard on myself. Okay,
please don't take third and fourth and fifth arrows, just have some humor. Kindness, it's okay,
it's okay, it's part of the human condition, it's okay, this happens, this happens. And instead,
instead, what if we turned it around? What if we turned it around? Let's say in the middle of the
night when you're awake thinking, okay, great, here's an opportunity for practice, I could be
sleeping, but now actually, I can practice in this moment, I can practice, I can calm and settle in
my mind and heart and deepen because often pain, often, as you well know already, pain, suffering,
sorrow, are the doorways to awakening. They are not problems to get rid of, to push away so that
now you can practice, oh, this pain is, this physical pain is bugging me, if I could only
be comfortable so that I could meditate, like, that's such a funny perspective, right? The pain,
the suffering, this insomnia is the doorway, is the invitation, hello, dear human being,
who is suffering, this is what suffering is like, ah, welcome to acknowledging, to opening to the
human condition for yourself and all other beings, you can be sure there are other beings in that
moment in time in the world who are also either having insomnia or having pain, thousands,
thousands of us, given that we have, what, seven, almost eight billion of us or something like that
now, I think the most recent count I heard, there are, there would be hundreds if not thousands of
human beings in that moment who are having the same condition as you are having, so same more
in the guided meditation, but essentially we want to open up to the pain, to the suffering,
to the insomnia, ah, hold it with, with kindness, hold it with kindness, hold it with kindness,
because sometimes we don't, you don't have a choice, it's here, it's here, it's here,
it's already here, there's not much you can do about it, you can't push it away, so by trying
to push it away it actually makes things worse, so opening up, opening up and you realize actually
when you stop resisting, when you stop resisting that something's, let's go, something releases,
something let's go, and so that's number one, and number two is metta, metta, really a lot of
metta, a lot of self-compassion, because in fact working with challenges, it's, you know, meditation
is not all about bliss and hanging out in blissful states, but it turns out that actually working
with pain and sorrow and insomnia can lead to bliss states, I mean it seems counter-intuitive,
how can holding, being with, challenge lead to bliss lead to ease, but that's exactly what happens,
which is, which can seem so counter-intuitive, but that I invite you to open up, open up
the way that your mind habitually treats pain, like okay make it go away, I don't like it,
terrible, I just want pleasure, I just want ease, open up to the ways that you can grow in your
humanity, the ways in which your humanity, your wisdom, your compassion can open up,
can flourish for yourself and for others through this pathway.
So there is so much to say, so much opportunity in this, and I've already spoken plenty,
and I think I'd like to switch, invite us to switch to practice and maybe whatever you need to
know, I'll share in the guided meditation, I think that's enough for a darnment, so.
So I invite you to arrive in your seat,
I invite you to arrive in your seat in this moment, arriving, landing.
As always, connecting, connecting with the breath, arriving, arriving in this moment,
arriving in this moment, arriving with the breath,
with the body, whatever is arising in the body,
letting go of thoughts, of plans, whatever has come before, not needed, taking a moment of refuge.
The breath connected, connecting, settling.
Let it go, let it go.
Here, just connecting with the breath in the body, gently, ever so gently,
ever so gently making space,
letting the breath be nourishing, healing, cleansing as it moves through.
Each breath, arriving more fully with each breath.
I invite you to arrive in your seat in this moment, arriving, landing.

Can there be patience?
Can there be gentleness?
The mind connects with the body, the discomfort in the body,
as if cooling, as if soothing, as if singing a lullaby.
Any part of the body that's not comfortable, that's in pain,
gentle, gentle, gentle care,
as if you're rocking, it's a little baby that is your body.

And now if you wish, imagining, inviting yourself, to consider that you are not alone,
and whatever is arising in this moment,
whether it's insomnia, or physical pain, challenge,
considering that there are so many human beings, beings around the world,
who have this condition right now,
or you can expand it, they've had it before, or they will have it.
Wishing well, opening to metta, to compassion,
or yourself and all the beings.
With this predicament, may all of us,
all of us have ease in our bodies, all of us.
Perhaps a man here in the same country, a woman in a different continent,
an older being on an island, it's okay to use your imagination
to get a sense of the common humanity of this.
See if you can connect, if you can connect,
at least one or two of you other human beings in your imagination.
Their challenge, their difficulty, not so different from yours.
In order to open, in order to help open up the heart, the compassion,
may all of us, may all of us have ease,
can be supportive instead of just thinking of myself,
to feel solidarity with so many humans, all of us.
Holding our challenge or difficulty with grace, with dignity,
may all of us have ease, may all of us have goodness,
all you dear fellow human beings, just like me, may all of us.
Be free, be free from this challenge, may all of us have goodness in our lives,
all of us held with universal compassion and love,
but being of light, or whatever compassionate archetype works for you,
or perhaps all of us holding each other with care, solidarity, and mutual compassion.
See what works for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Maybe going back and forth to giving compassion may you,
imagining a few individuals or one individual, may you be free, may you have ease,
fellow human being, dear friend, or may both of us have ease, may all of us have ease.
Giving, receiving, sharing, opening your heart,
teaching compassion and wisdom, and deepening your humanity.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Noticing how your heart can experience generosity, generosity,
pain not as a problem to hate, to be afraid of, but as an opportunity to open to generosity of your heart, or others for yourself.
Thank you.
The last few minutes, letting your body be held, the physical body,
held in this expansive care, generosity.
Wishing, wishing, sharing the generosity of your spirit,
because of, through this challenge, all beings everywhere.
May all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you.
Thank you everyone. Thank you for your practice.
So we have a few minutes. Any questions, comments, any insights, reflections
that you'd like to share for the benefit, really for the benefit of others, out of a wisdom out of your care, compassion.
You're invited to share in chat, or raise your hand.
And if you share with me privately, I won't read your name. If you share publicly, I will read your name and reflection. One private one, that was lovely.
Thank you. You are so welcome.
May it be of support to you now, and anytime in the middle of the night, or anytime in pain, or insomnia.
Oh, which I have had my fair share with my chronic illness. It's a great opportunity for practice.
It's a gift. Gift of darkness, as Mary Oliver would put it in a poem, she says, something I'm paraphrasing.
A friend once gave me a box of darkness as a gift, or a friend once gave me a box of darkness.
It took me a while to realize that too was a gift.
So may we realize that the gifts of darkness, boxes of darkness, are two or gifts.
Dave, I see your hand. Another private message. Thank you so much for that. You are welcome.
So Dave, please.
Yeah, Marilyn, thank you for this so much. This is exactly what I've been needing so much lately. Some time ago, you said something I think was just the most remarkable thing I've ever heard anyone say.
So, embrace yourself. This is going to be a little praise.
When you said, I get to suffer. I get to suffer. And you were sincerely pleased with that. And what a benefit and a gift that is to the practice.
I've been struggling with tinnitus and that helped immensely. And the other day I said to my acupuncturist that I'm going to try to treat it in principle as the hiss of mindfulness.
It's not much of a bell.
And she liked that. And I've been working on that and it has helped a lot. And I just want you to know that it's not as bad as it was. It's not as bad as it was.
Every once in a while I get a pang of dread for what it might be in the future, but the future is not here. And the practice is really helping me out. So thank you very much, Nikki.
I am so touched, deeply touched, Dave, as to how supportive the practice has been to you and the shifting of your perspective. I am so moved. I am so moved by that.
Knowing how challenging tinnitus can be for so many, yourself included, and how you've shifted your perspective to be a hiss of mindfulness. And wow, wow, how that shift in perspective has attenuated, made it softer, easier, has brought freedom.
And the Buddhist words, really, that's what freedom is. You know, nibbana awakening and freedom seems like so holy, but this is freedom. It's right here, Dave. You're experiencing freedom with respect to your tinnitus.
So thank you so much. Yeah, beautiful.
Oh, and thanks, Morgan, for finding the poem from Mary Oliver. Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too was a gift.
What a beautiful poem. Thank you to Mary Oliver.
Yeah. And also, I do want to thank the practitioner earlier in the practice discussion who offered what they were working with so that their practice can serve everyone.
And so I want to acknowledge them and thank them also for their practice as they've offered it to us as the inspiration for this, for this evening. So,
so dear ones, let's turn into practicing together in small groups. And if you can stay, please do. It's such a privilege to be able to connect just for a few minutes, six, seven minutes with fellow practitioners.
And if you have to go, it's okay, but don't go out of fear. Don't go out of other human beings. They're just they're really nice. So, so I'm going to create the breakout rooms.
And as always, take care of yourselves, take care of each other.
Don't forget metta compassion and these fellow human beings you will meet in the small groups are just like you. They have experienced physical pain. They have experienced insomnia.
With all of us have all of us. So, opening the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other. Here you go.
