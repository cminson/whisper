Dharmette : Don’t Complain – 
Investigate

There is a very challenging teaching that w hen 
someo ne takes refuge in Buddhism  – meaning  they 
really commit their life  to the  orientation, values  and 
practice of Buddhism  – then they have nothing more to 
complain  about. Isn’t that interesting? Another  way of 
saying this is that people who practice mindfulness don’t 
complain ; they investigate.  
 
Complaini ng stops something; it somehow contracts. 
When I  think of complaining , I don’t mean going to the 
Complain t Department and saying  that some thing 
needs to change. But r ather , complaining means there 
is resistin g, stopping , or giving up responsibility. With 
investigation , we put our effort  into something t hat is 
open. Complaining closes , but investigation opens  into 
what  the possibilities  are. How can I learn from this?  
How can I learn from mistakes?  How can I learn from 
what’s difficult here?   
 
For someone who is involved in  Buddhist practice, one 
of the primary things we investigate is not what’s wrong  with other people, but rather what is happening here for 
us. If you find yourself wanting to complain, then turn 
the attention back and see what is it that you’re  holding 
onto. What am I attached to? What am I feeling? W hat 
am I believing ? What’s going on for me  here?  
 
See that there is a path  to being open  and fluid. Not that 
we can always be open or fluid, but we can be  engaged 
in the process of investigation.  Simply  saying, “What’s 
going on here ?” is a very different response from saying 
that what’s  going on here is wrong – to feel that we’re 
stuck , that there is no way forward for us . Or w e have to 
give up , sink down , be oppressed , or be a victim. The 
kind of complaining that comes from that  doesn’t  fit in 
this practice , because the practice is to always be open  
and to learn. What can I  learn from this situation?  
What’s the way forward to freedom in this situation?   
 
A friend of mine told me  that when he ran a business , 
he told his employees that no one was ever going to be 
fired for making a mistake. But they would get fired if 
they didn’t learn from their mistakes. I thought that was 
pretty good. A few of us have probably made  mistakes 
from time to time. It does happen , right? So we can 
complain about ourselves and be  upset , or we can learn 
from our mistakes. The approach of Buddhism is to 
continually say , “What can I learn from this ?” Buddhism 
doesn’t say that everything is fine and dandy, b ut rather 
that we have a lif e with a lot of suffering, difficulties , mistakes, failures, and things that cause harm. How can 
we learn from  that?  How can we learn to be better 
people?  How can we learn to be people who don’t add 
further harm? H ow can we be more at ease , and 
respond fro m that ease i n a way that’s hopefully a 
strong  response  when necessary . So in mindfulness we 
don’t complain;  we investigate.  
 
There was a great sign posted in the dining room at 
Spirit Rock many years ago. It was a sign from the 
cooks to the retreata nts that said: “It is our practice to 
make the best food that  we can, and when we don’t , 
then it’s your practice .” [laughter ] I think they were 
counting on the fact  that the retreatants trusted that the 
cooks were doing the best job they could. That’s what 
they were really trying to do, but  of course they were 
going  to fail. When  the food got burned or had too much 
salt, it became  the practice of the retreat ants to work 
with that – with their reaction s, judgments , aversion, 
anger, whatever goes on . See what com es up and 
practice with that , as opposed to tightening up around 
complaint. And the rest of the afternoon , sitting in the 
meditation hall  thinking, “O h, those cooks , how could 
they? This is  a personal affront to me. I’ll have to write a 
letter to the president of the board of Spirit Rock. ” You 
could do that, but the path of practice is not necessarily 
found in  the letter. It is found in understanding  how 
we’re attached  or caught , and then freeing ourselves  
from that caughtness. That’s where the practice is. If we’re not caught, then hopefully we have access to the 
wisdom to know whether we need to write a letter or 
not. If we need to write a letter, then it’s easier to write 
it, because w e’re not caught by anything , and it comes 
across more clear ly.  
 
You might spend a little bit of time this week noticing if 
you fin d yourself complaining  about something. You 
probably won’t. B ut just in case you find yourself 
complaining about something, notice that you’re doing 
it, and see if you can turn it around. Rather than staying 
on the complaint, transform it to investiga tion. What is 
going on here?  What’s  happening here?  Rather than 
staying with . “I don’t like this ,” ask, “What is this ?”  
 
“What  is this ?” means not only the thing you don’t like , 
but also, “W hat is this here with me ? What  is my 
response? What’s happening here with me? ” “What is 
this?” is the primary Vipassan ā question. What’s going 
on here?  
 
So certainly my wish for this week is that you get at 
least one good complaint to practice with [laughter]. 
Now I just could go on an d on and talk until 12:30 or 
1:00, which would give you something to complain 
about [laughter]. But it won’t work because the lights  will 
turn off and you guys will just leave. So we’ll have to 
figure  out something different.  
 So don’t complain, investiga te.
