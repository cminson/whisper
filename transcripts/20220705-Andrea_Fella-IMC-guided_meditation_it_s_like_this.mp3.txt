 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Arriving with yourself, allowing yourself to connect with your body in this space that you're in, in this moment here and now. And seeing, if you can, in this first part, this first few moments of the sitting, really just open to how you are in this moment. Not in terms of thinking about it, but feeling into how are you right now. At first maybe checking in how is the body right now. A little bit more obvious, the experience of the body. Perhaps in checking in with the body, how is the body right now. You might notice areas of holding or tension. Just a kind of honest assessment or honest checking in. How is the body? Without any ideas of how you think it should be or could be, how is it? Sometimes this exploration of body might be through a little bit of a scan, checking into various areas of the body. And as we explore the body in that way, we might notice particular areas that feel tight or held, constricted. Can there be a holding of that at first, just a kind of acknowledgement, the honesty of oh yeah, that area, that area is held or tight without a judgment about it? Is that kind of attention, that kind of honest opening to oh this is how it is, has a natural effect that will sometimes shift, allow a release. And sometimes it can be useful in exploring, scanning through the body if there are areas that are tense or constricted or held. As we can consciously explore relaxation of those areas. And perhaps in this exploration or scanning of the body, you might also notice areas that are already at ease, relaxed, spacious. Perhaps in noticing that if there are areas where there is ease or relaxation, letting yourself connect with that. Is the connection, the opening to areas of ease or relaxation can allow those to spread or nourish the system. forest, looking after some silverlaugh. Yes. And then it's possible also with exploring how the body is I kind of settle back and see if you can take in the broader sense of how the whole body is in this moment. This is a receptive, very relaxed exploration. Not looking for anything in particular, but just as if you were relaxing your eyes to look at a wide landscape. Having a sense of relaxing the awareness to take in. How is the whole body? When I explore this kind of meeting of the body, it's often it feels like there's a lot of dynamic things happening. A lot of shifting, changing, flowing, constricting areas of different sensation and the awareness. And kind of hold a variety of experience with the body. Not needing to land or identify or constrict or confine around any one experience. Not even needing to name it. It's like this. Letting go of our tendency to need to identify and categorize and just feel. It's like this. Sometimes touching into the broader sense of how we are in our body can feel a little odd for the mind with that tendency to categorize or identify. And so just noticing when the mind kind of wants to land or make things more compact, recognizable, familiar. And seeing if there can be perhaps a softening around that. I think there are heard some people who think those thoughts should come regardless of notice or if they thought it was being applied at the moment. And to help them look at yourself down in their face a lot. How are you right now in this moment? It changes dynamically from moment to moment. And so staying present with how we are is actually a fairly lively and yet restful exploration, both alert and relaxed. Alert with the receiving of so many different experiences, sensations coming through of body, of mind, and relaxed in that our system knows how to receive these kinds of experiences. We don't need to do it. The alertness is connected with being here for it, with it. I'm letting our, the processes of our body and mind do what they do. Recognize, experience, feel, experience. If the mind feels drifty or daydreamy, perhaps there can be a curiosity about that very experience. Maybe there can be an alertness that's curious about driftiness, resting and allowing the system to show us what the experience is right now. Or maybe there's tension or tightness somewhere in the system and that's where the attention is. Can there be a curiosity, an alertness with a relaxed receptivity? This is what that experience is like. Marie THEY Our mindfulness practice explores the possibility of deeply recognizing what is already happening. An honest connection with this is how it is right now. There's curiosity about that with that curiosity, interest in what actually is here. Sometimes our mind will begin to align itself with that. This is what's actually happening. This is the truth of what's here in this moment. And at a very deep level, our system really appreciates connecting with the truth of what's actually happening. That may not be pleasant, that there's something about that connection, oh, this is what's here. That both allows the mind to soften and relax around what's here. And be in a container that allows for wisdom, understanding, transformation to happen. This takes a lot of trust. Quite a bit of patience. Yes. The feeling of this allowing, honestly opening to how we are brings together both wisdom and honest recognition. It's like this. But it also comes with compassion, with connection, with care. So this practice is one of both wisdom and compassion together. Thank you. All right. you you you you you you you you you you you you you
