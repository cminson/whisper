 This morning, today, we'll be exploring the head center. And in the instructions today, we'll be widening the instruction to include mindfulness of thought, mindfulness of the process of thinking. And I just want to say before we begin that there's a balance here for us in engaging with our thoughts, which is really about being aware of thoughts is not the same as being swept away into the story, the content, the memory, the fantasy. But it also is not about judging, rejecting, or pushing anything away. So thoughts and thoughts are not the enemy. We will be using all of the skills, capacities we've been cultivating over the last several days, working with the body and the heart, and now include that to also include awareness of the content of the mind. So please begin as we do by finding a posture, taking a seat. Again, you could be sitting or standing or lying down, adjusting the body in a way that allows you to have both a sense of stability and as best you can, a sense of ease. And letting your eyes close gently, maybe taking a couple of deep, full breaths. Letting the chest and belly fill on the inhale and letting it all go on the exhale. And allowing your breath to return to its own natural rhythm. And as you begin, you'll be a full invitation to settle in, to let your awareness infuse the body. Having our full attention, awareness, this quality of loving listening, to tune in, listen in, and to see what's here. How is the body expressing itself now? There's no right or wrong or good or bad here. We're just listening in, aware of the body, sitting or standing or lying down, just as it is. And aware of the body breathing. Looking out all on its own about any special effort on your part, the body breathes. And keeping it very simple to begin. Resting, relaxing, with the awareness of the body and the body breathing. As we tune in, listen in to the self-sense. Of the body here, now. Giving ourselves to rest fully in the present. In this moment, here. Here. And as you tune in, listen in to the self-sense. To the body. Sitting the body, breathing. Giving yourself beginning to settle, to arrive right where you are. Keep it here. As you begin to settle, land, arrive. Opening your awareness to tune in, listen in to the heart center. Just very gently noticing is there a feeling, a mood, an affective tone or flavor to your experience as you sit here now. Maybe a sense of peacefulness or contentment. Maybe there's some sadness or anxiety, frustration or boredom. A quiet delight. Whatever is here, whatever is true for you now. Can you open and receive? Can you be with whatever is happening? Can you be with whatever is true? Can you be aware of the shifting flavor or tone of experience? And if there's nothing obvious or distinct as a feeling and emotion, it's fine to continue just resting in the body and the breath. And if at any point there's a wave of feeling or emotion that feels overwhelming, overwhelming means you're not able to stay present to be with it. It's okay to let it go and come back to the simplicity, the stability of the body and the breath, allowing the nervous system to resettle. Thank you. And then expanding the field of awareness further still, including now awareness of thinking. This thinking has probably been here all along, but now we'll intentionally engage our practice of mindfulness, learning to be with thought about grabbing on and getting swept away, but with no need to judge or reject or push anything away. Having the same quality of listening with love to notice what is the content of the thinking mind. Sometimes thoughts come as words. Sometimes some people thought comes as images. Because it's so habitual, so easy to get swept into the storyline of whatever it is that we're thinking. Sometimes it can be helpful to use a soft mental note, like a whisper in the mind. Like start by just noticing thinking, thinking. Susing your heart. Most of our thoughts are what I sometimes call our riffraff thought. It's just a tumble of words, images, memories, planning, kind of churning out from the mind. Most of it is not that interesting. And if that's the case, just allowing thoughts to arise and be known and letting them fade away, kind of like clouds moving through a big open sky. As we might notice, there's a particular kind of thinking, maybe planning or commenting or worrying or rehashing. If you notice a particular shape or flavor or kind of thought, again, you can use this soft mental note. Planning. Planning. Judging. Judging. Remembering. Stella at small. Mostly the invitation is not to get so much involved in the content of what you want to be your thinking. But to use this practice to begin to develop a different relationship to thought. You might even notice if you're using a soft metal note that there may be a kind of leaning in, a tone in the note that has wanting more. And often you might see that in the noting there's a little edge of irritation. Thinking, thinking, as if we are noticing but also wishing it would go away. You can notice thought and also noticing your attitude toward the thinking. Yes, it's just along the way. Finally, for many of us, there's sometimes a sticky thought. Maybe a memory, a fantasy, a plan, a rehashing that just... We notice it. We notice it. It just continues. It's again and again. And if this is the case, sometimes can be helpful when there's a persistent storyline, memory, train of thought to drop under the content of the words and see, is there an emotion? Often there's some kind of a feeling that's fueling the thought. Maybe anger or anxiety or disappointment or regret. Sometimes it's helpful to drop underneath to feel what is the emotion that may be keeping the thought in play. Maybe it's helpful to feel what is the emotion that may be keeping the thought in play.

So in the same way that the body breathes all on its own, in the same way that the heart feels, the mind thinks. And it's so important to remember that thought is not the enemy. There will be a time when thinking stops. It's called being dead. And there are times deep, deep in concentration, in meditative practice, that there can be profound stilling and even stopping of thought. But our practice, our practice is to learn to be mindful of the process of thinking so that we are neither being run around by our thoughts, but we're also not tightening, clenching, trying to get rid of, judging like that. That thought can become like any other aspect of our experience that we can be aware of. And again, for many of us, thought would be helpful to think of thought like barking. And how might we learn as we practice, not to get rid of the barking, but to learn to shift our relationship to the barking. I was having a memory as we were sitting of my very first retreat. I sat the first time in the Zen tradition. And I was, 30 years ago, I was a very tightly wired person. My body was very tight. My heart was tight and my mind, I felt like my mind was torturing me with all these thoughts, constant barrage of thoughts, thinking, thinking, thinking. And the harder I tried to make them go away, the worse it got. And I had an insight at some point, which I remember it's very vivid still that we'll see if this makes any sense to you, but right at the center of all of the thought, kind of like the eye of a storm, there was something that was completely still, not moving at all, very quiet. And the thought was just thought. So you have been offered already a whole array of different kind of skillful means for working with thought. If there's not a lot of thought, don't worry. Welcome to just keep it simple, hanging out in the body and the breath. If there's a lot of thought, you can work with noting. There's repetitive thought, you can try dropping under. And if you find it gets pretty still, there's a way in which you could begin to notice how it is that a thought arises and abides for a while and fades away. You could watch the whole arc of a thought the same way that you could watch the whole or be present with the whole cycle of a breath. So none of what I'm saying is good or bad or better or worse. Likely that you'll have a whole array of these different experiences with thought. So the invitation today is to widen the field of mindfulness, to include thought as part of what we're learning to be aware of, part of what we're learning to listen to with love, even without getting swept into the content, the storyline, can be tricky. That's why we wait until a few days in, you have a little momentum and practice of being mindful of the body and the breathing, the feeling tone, vedna, the emotion. Now we include thought. So there's a little time for questions, comments, insights.
