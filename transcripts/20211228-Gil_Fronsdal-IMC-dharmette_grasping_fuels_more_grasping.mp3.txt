The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

What's on my mind this morning is the interesting fact that in the language of the Buddha,
the word for grasping, sometimes it's translated as clinging,
the word for grasping is also the same word used for the fuel for grasping.
The word is upadana and it can mean the fuel for a fire and what fire burns.
It could also mean grasping and clinging.
There's a way in which grasping, something, being clinging, being attached is the fuel for more grasping.
If I'm allowed to do this example, if I keep my hand open, that's fine,
but if I make a loose fist with my hand, now something exists that didn't exist before when the hand was opened.
Now there exists a fist and now it's possible to become attached to the fist.
I might hold onto a tighter, clenched a little bit more tightly with my hand.
If I go around with my clenched hand for a long time, it starts to hurt and be uncomfortable.
One response I might have to that discomfort is to clench even more, to tighten up.
This doesn't feel good.
There's a progressive way in which I start with something which doesn't exist.
I create something which is new, grasping of the hand.
That's uncomfortable or that's something that I'm attached to.
And progressively I, each step along the way, I'm grasping to what is grasped.
The very thing that I'm grasping to is the source for grasping even more.
And so there's a cycle then of attachment.
If we see attachment is the fuel for more attachment.
And that cycle cannot be broken if we keep doing more attachment, to keep grasping even more.
And so you can see this sometimes in the thinking mind where there's a drive, a push to think, a preoccupation, a strength.
We could say an attachment to grasping to thoughts, to ideas, to trying to figure things out, to make plans, to make ourselves safe.
Just swirling around, reviewing the past, repeating the same conversation with someone over and over again.
And there's a kind of a drive, a pressure to think.
And that pressure is the very source for having more pressure.
Grasping to certain ideas, trying to accomplish something with our thoughts, can become uncomfortable.
That discomfort our system reacts to wants to find more comfort.
And if it thinks that comfort is found through thinking, then the very thing that's causing the discomfort is what will give ourselves over to more to try to figure out even more.
So it becomes a kind of cyclic where we are attached to something, we're cling to something, we grasp at something.
And that sense in motion or sets the ground, the foundation for doing more of the same.
And so this thing of doing more of the same that reinforces the same over and over again.
When we're doing something which is unhealthy and stressful for ourselves, is not sooner or later, we have to realize this is not working.
And for some people, they don't discover that for decades.
It's not an easy thing to discover that the very approach we have to help make ourselves safe or get what we want or is the very source from which is making us unsafe, making us stressful.
And so grasping is the fuel for more grasping.
Attachment is the fuel for more attachment.
So at some point we have to step out of this cyclic movement.
We have to be willing to somehow realize that's not the way anymore.
And so in meditation, at some point it becomes hopefully a clear idea, a clear sense.
For me to continue thinking this way, it just doesn't work.
This kind of thinking is, I'm caught in a labyrinth, a self-fulfilling perpetual motion labyrinth that just keeps fueling itself.
And I'm going to stop investing in it.
I'm going to stop giving myself over to it.
I think it's time to step away.
And we step away into awareness, into the mindfulness that the mindfulness is not the attachment.
The mindfulness of the attachment is a way of stepping away.
We can step away into our body and begin to relax our body.
The tension, the stress of grasping is often expressed or found in tension in our body.
And so if we can relax the body, reduce the tension in the body, it goes a long way in helping us relax the tension in the mind.
Sometimes the tension we have in our mind, we can't find our way to see, well, where do I relax?
Where do I let go? How do I stop this?
It's really hard sometimes when we see it just as a mental thing.
But beginning to relax the body, quiet the body, and maybe use mindfulness of breathing or some kind of meditation to begin calming the thinking mind.
And this progressive calming and quieting of the body, of the mind, releasing attention.
At some point we get to the point where it seems, oh, you know, I can just not think anymore this way.
I don't have to be caught in this discursive thinking. It's okay, enough.
And then maybe for a few moments you can get quiet.
For a few moments you can have this mental peace and quiet, and then you can focus more on the breathing.
And then, so just as grasping is the fuel for more grasping, at some point the equation switches over that peace is the fuel for more peace.
Calm is the fuel for more calm.
Clarity is the food for more clarity.
And you can feel that.
So if I open my hand and feel how nice it is to have an open hand, it's relaxed and open and at ease,
then feeling that ease is support for having more ease.
When I do it, I can find myself feel the ease of my hand. I feel my shoulders release a little bit.
And I value that.
And so I stay close to that feeling of ease.
And so the slightest little movement to tighten up, I notice.
And I say, oh, wait a minute, the peace that's there, that's the way forward.
And so I relax my hand.
So to begin understanding this principle can be very helpful.
To be willing to see that grasping is the fuel for more grasping.
And letting go of that grasping is the way towards peace.
But it's not a linear way to peace.
Sometimes while we were grasping is to protect ourselves or get away from or cope with difficulties in our life.
Strong emotions, difficult emotions that we might have.
And so we have to sometimes go through that and really feel what's going on.
So the example I gave of grasping the hand, if I do a light grasp, clenching of the hand,
and then that feels uncomfortable, I'm trying to get away from that discomfort and I clench even more.
As I relax the hand, I might feel that initial layer where it was uncomfortable.
And it might feel very uncomfortable. I don't like being there and then I clench even more.
So we have to learn to be willing to go through this feeling of discomfort as we do this layer,
releasing the layers of grasping that we have.
Until we come to the place where peace is the fuel for more peace.
Clarity is the fuel for more clarity.
So thank you very much for all this and we'll continue tomorrow.
And maybe by tomorrow or next day we'll have a sense of the theme for the week.
Today I just kind of didn't come up with a theme for this week.
So I just kind of coming along as we go today this week.
Next week will be a theme and that I'll start the series on the four foundations of mindfulness
and based on the sati-patanasuta, the discourse on mindfulness to the Buddha taught.
It'll be comparable to how we did anapanasati at the beginning of last year, the mindfulness of breathing.
But we'll go through it systematically over a few weeks.
So this week maybe no theme yet.
Thank you all very much.
