 After the Buddha was awakened, he was reluctant to teach. And he was then persuaded that maybe there were some people out in the world who, the expression was, had but little dust over their eyes, who might be able to see the truth that he was going to teach. And so he set out to find such people. And he went, he remembered some people, old companions of his that he knew that he thought might be ripe for awakening themselves. And so he walked across from Bodh Gaya to Varanasi and to Sarnath where he gave his first Dharma talk to that group of people. And that Dharma talk is called the discourse on turning the wheel of the bra. And the wheel is sometimes a symbol for Buddhism. And maybe everybody has seen it some places that there's sometimes a flag for Buddhism that has a Dharma wheel on it. Now what's interesting about the wheel is that it was Buddhism's adaptation of a symbol that existed in India already for royalty. Monarchs, kings and queens that ruled ancient India, they would also use the wheel as some of them did, wheel for a symbol of their power. And a ruler of the vast territory, like an emperor in India was called a wheel turning monarch. And there were myths of how each of these great wheel turning monarchs that possessed the wheel. And before they became monarchs, the wheel was residing or resting in the ocean. And then when that person became the king or the queen, the wheel would come out of resting on a retirement and would roll around first to the north and the south and the west and kind of roll over to define the territory that this monarch would rule over. So what you find then is that their symbol of the wheel is used for two different domains in Buddhist teachings. It's used for very roughly, it's a very poor approximation. It's a distinction that we have in the west between secular and spiritual. And there's a spiritual wheel and there's a secular wheel. And traditionally in Buddhism, it's wanted to make a distinction between these two different realms of that which pertains to the Dharma wheel and that which pertains to the worldly wheel. And a way that this distinction is made, the words that are used to help make this distinction in Pali are lokya and lokutara. And lokya means pertaining to the world. The word for world in Pali is loka. Now if you're Hispanic, that's a wonderful, interesting, rich connection there. But lokya is the word for world and lokya is that which pertains to the world. But specifically more than just kind of the generic world, it meant the world of our conventions and customs, the world of causality, the world of cause and effect. You do A, B occurs. It's the way in which we create categories and the mind compares things. Many of the rich ways that we live in our world and which ways in which human beings interact with the environment all belong to this aspect of the lokya, the worldly part of life. And then there's the lokutara. And lokutara comes with the word loka and utara. And utara means has a range of meanings. It means the highest or the utmost. So some people translate lokutara as this transcendent or the supramundane, the trans-mundane, the mundane or the worldly, and the supramundane, these two different distinctions that the Buddhists want to make traditionally. Another way of making this distinction is to talk about two different paths of practice. One path of practice is the path of worldly happiness and the other path of practice is the path of liberation. And both paths were taught by the Buddha, but they were two different paths. And the path of worldly happiness had to do all the things that you could do that would hopefully create the conditions, set up the possibilities for you to experience happiness in the context of living your worldly life. If it's a good idea to tell the truth, you tend to be more happy if you are a truthful person. That was a kind of worldly piece of advice that the Buddha gave. Now some people would follow primarily, their primary intention in practice, was to follow the path of worldly happiness. And so they would do practices that went in that direction. They would certainly watch their ethics carefully. They would do a lot of good deeds because good deeds create the conditions, the cause and effect relationships that lead to happiness. They would do practices like loving kindness practice or compassion practice, equanimity meditation, concentration practices that were conducive for, in the old story, old tradition at least, the idea of being reborn in very happy states of life. In particular, the ultimate aim for people following the path of worldly happiness was to become reborn in the heavenly realms. Reborn as kind of a god because gods have lots of happiness. And you know, compared to what humans have, it's like we don't have anything. What's interesting about the path of worldly happiness is that you don't have to be freed of all your clingings and all your aversion to end up following the path of worldly happiness to its pinnacle. The worldly happiness, actually you need to have a little bit of clinging and a little bit of aversion in order to follow the worldly path to its pinnacle, to get the utmost amount of happiness in a worldly sense that a person could attain. And that's very interesting because many of you know that clinging is considered in Buddhism to be one of the fundamental things that keeps us bound, it keeps us from being free, and keeps us in the cycles of samsara, the traditional wording of it. So there might be a tendency then for people to say, oh, clinging is the Buddhist equivalent of sin. It's like this bad thing. What's interesting about this is that the moral result, the karmic result of acting on clinging is not dependent on the clinging itself, but rather on the object of clinging. So if you cling to intentions which cause harm, that causing of harm creates negative karma. It will make you more and more unhappy over time. But if you claim to the idea of creating a greater sense of self, a better sense of self, but there is no ill will, there's no intention to cause harm in that. You could actually be successful in having greater and greater worldly happiness. You don't have to be free of clinging to reach the ultimate pinnacle of worldly happiness according to the teachings of the Buddha. Does that make sense? So there were a lot of people in ancient India who were very interested in just that path, and the Buddha taught practices, or ancient Buddhism taught practices for that path. And down through the ages, the Buddhist tradition has a lot of wisdom concerning how to become happy in a worldly sense. What the Buddha had to teach and what was unique to him, what was different, what was special was not that he taught those things, but rather that he taught the path to liberation, the path to what could be called the sukramandhain, or that which goes beyond the customary conventions of the world. And so it's important to see the distinction between these two different worlds, or two different realms in which we could practice, so that we don't confuse one for the other, which happens often. And the ultimate realm is the realm of liberation, is where there's absolutely no clinging at all in the heart or the mind. The mind is released from all that keeps it bound, and the only thing that keeps the heart bound is our clinging, which can be phenomenally subtle. The subtlety of it can mean that we don't see that we're actually clinging when we suffer. And part of the purpose of mindfulness practice is to develop a really strong, stable, concentrated mind that can see the subtlety of the way in which clinging works for us, so we can be released from that clinging. Now, it's considered to be a different path, the path of liberation. And so there has to be a different intention that the practitioner has. And so what this means is we have to be very careful with the intention we have for how we practice, because if we're not clear about our intention, the intention can actually be moving in the direction of greater worldly happiness, which is great. I mean, who's not going to, maybe you're not going to knock it. It can be pretty wonderful, but it's not going to be the same thing as leading to liberation. So I wanted to read a story. There's a couple of various things that inspired me to give this talk today, and one of the ideas came from the story, which someone read to me this week. It's from a book which I haven't read called Tuesdays with Maury. Maybe some of you read it. I heard a little story the other day, Maury says. He closes his eyes for a moment, and I wait. Okay. The story is about a little wave, the story is about a little wave bobbing along in the ocean, having a grand old time. He's enjoying the wind and the fresh air until he notices the other waves in front of him crashing against the shore. My God, this is terrible, the wave says. Look what's going to happen to me. Then along comes another wave. It sees the first wave looking grim, and it says to him, why do you look so sad? The first wave says, you don't understand. We're all going to crash. All of us waves are going to be nothing. Isn't it terrible? The second wave says, no, you don't understand. You're not a wave, you're part of the ocean. So I like talking about waves because the waves don't exist as a thing. When a wave grows from Japan to the coast of California, we say conventionally the wave moves. But if you actually look for something that's moving, you won't find anything that moves. What you find is that water particles are going up and down, bumping into them when next to them. It's like the wave in a football stadium. The people aren't moving. They're synchronizing their waving of their hand. It looks like a wave from a distance, but you know that nothing's moving. So the same thing with a wave. The wave doesn't exist in and of itself, but it looks like it does from a distance. So this idea that we're all part of the ocean is an inspiring, for some people, quite inspiring perspective on life to see that the human being is not separate from the universe or separate from nature, and our dying is not the extinction, but rather it's returning from where we came, returning back to nature. It's something that gives a lot of comfort to a lot of people. For me, part of my motivation as a young person, to be interested, that moved me in the direction of Buddhism, Buddhist practice, was feeling that this must be the case. My home was the universe, that I was just a continuation of the universe, that it was somewhat of an illusion to assume that I was separate, individual, kind of autonomous from the universe at large. However, I had a various amount of fear because I felt myself separate, even though I felt I wasn't also. I was operating as if I was, and so I wanted to find some practice, a spiritual practice, that would help me feel at home in the home that I felt that I had in this universe. Did that make sense? So the wave. So the wave finds some comfort, I suppose, in the idea that it's part of the ocean. Now, in realizing that, has the wave realized something of worldly wisdom or supermending wisdom? The wisdom of worldly happiness or the wisdom of liberation? What do you think? Bill? You spoke. Explain. First of all, it's realized sort of an ultimate truth about who it is, which is part of, presumably, some supermending. But also, it's attained a moment of personal peace in a sort of complete ocean. That in itself is part of the real world. Okay, great. That's a very good answer. Someone else, I saw another hand. Someone said yes before? Something? Hopefully, you don't settle for that as the only answer. Yes? Well, I thought it was worldly because the intention was more still associated with the sense that you can say the wave has a sense of self. It still seems to be kind of associated with that. Great. So Ruth says it seems like a worldly wisdom understanding because there's still a sense of self connected to that realization. Someone else? Yes? I also think it sounds like a kind of worldly wisdom because the comfort that the wave takes in realizing that it's part of the ocean is kind of almost like a platypus, kind of a mental comfort rather than a direct realization of this connection to the ocean. In which case, it wouldn't be afraid. It wouldn't have to take comfort or refuge into the world because it's already recognized. It's beautiful. These are all good answers. Are there other good answers? I guess I would, if it's the Supra Monday, then there would be some, I guess I'm not seeing the direct release of clinging. By that logic, I'm saying it's maybe the Monday and wisdom. Great. Good. So three and a half people voted for it. That's mundane wisdom and we have half a vote for it. So let me tell you then, kind of switch gears. One of the reasons I was thinking about this this week is I read a book, I was reading little parts of a book called, it's a new book that came out, a little bit scholarly on the subject of engaged Buddhism. Engaged Buddhism is a very important development in Buddhism in the last 20 years, in the West in particular, of people taking their Buddhist practice and understanding it from Buddhism and applying it to social, environmental, political issues and getting involved in those issues in order to create change. Kind of for Buddhism, what liberation theology is to Christianity. So engaged Buddhism. So this was a study on it and in the opening of the study, one of the scholars enumerates three principles of engaged Buddhism and also suggests that engaged Buddhism is maybe a whole new form of Buddhism, new vehicle of Buddhism, new yana. There's the Hinayana, the Mahayana, the Vajrayana and now there's this new engaged Buddhism yana. And one of these principles stood out for me and the principle was identification with the world around, feeling of oneness with the world around us, feeling there's no separation with oneself in the world around one. So that the sense of wanting to be engaged to protecting trees that are being threatened up in the Northern California or being concerned about the welfare of people in Kosovo or being concerned about the welfare of your neighbors or whatever. All the kind of social and political and ecological issues a person can be concerned about arise out of an intimate sense of connectedness, identification with all those things that were not separate. In the same vein, what some American Dharma teachers have taken the fundamental teachings of Buddha which was on no self or not self and we translate it into English with the term no separate self and that seems a lot easier for people to understand. There's no separate self or independent self. However, the Buddha didn't teach no separate self. He didn't use that language. This seems to be kind of a modern retranslation of it and that he is saying no separate self implies oh there is a self that is one with everything is connected to everything else. And I think this is a beautiful piece of wisdom. We have enough understanding of biology and ecology and sociology to realize how tremendously interconnected human beings are. It's very hard to find where we begin where we end on all kinds of levels. When I was a college student I took a lot of botany classes and I remember taking introduction to botany. As a graduate student I took a lot of religious studies classes. My botany classes were much more religious than any of the religious studies classes ever took because I would study about the exchange of nutrients. Most of you know that we breathe out carbon dioxide and the plants breathe it in and they breathe out oxygen and we breathe that in and we all kind of great cycle of nutrients. And now we'll learn about all these wonderful cycles and I'd leave the classroom and go out into the courtyard and just stand there in awe looking at the trees and I just wonder where do I begin and they end. I would think I could lose an arm, I could lose a kidney, I could lose a lung, I could lose an eye. A lot of things that I kind of pretty attached to that I could do without but I can't do without those plants over there. With all the plants disappeared I would just be a goner. So if I'm more dependent on them than some of the essential organs in my body then who am I? Where do I begin, where do I end? And the same classes were teaching me the new theory back then of mitochondria, the energy packets of the cells. The theory I think is still the current theory. Back then it was kind of the new idea was that originally mitochondria were separate little unicellular organisms that were ingested by bigger unicellular organisms and then lived inside and in a kind of symbiotic relationship and then they kind of grew into earthworms and earthworms grew into humans eventually, whatever way, whatever way. Evolution worked. And so the implication is that as human beings every cell in our body has all these mitochondria and the mitochondria are different organisms. They just have taken up residence there and they replicate and pass on with everything else. But they're not us because they're different organisms. So if that's the case who am I? You know made up of a whole bunch of non-gill in there. And I thought it was gill. So who am I going outwards, who am I? And going inwards there's a kind of arbitrariness of who I am. And I was in awe. I'd stand there just looking. I thought ecology was the closest science gets to religion because you feel this wonderful sense of being connected something much larger that you feel not only a sense of connecting this to but a sense of responsibility for. So no separate self I think is a wonderful teaching. But my sense of it is that that understanding belongs to the worldly side of wisdom, the worldly path. And it still involves, as Ruth said, a kind of identification, a can involve identification of self and something else. So I'm here and there's something else over there. And the ways in which we very subtly have intentions of supporting a self, a self-centered version of ourselves, is often invisible to us. So for example it's maybe obvious to us when we're practicing for purposes of fame or purposes of creating a better sense of self or when we're practicing in order to get something from the practice for ourselves. When I first started doing serious practice what I wanted was more friends. So it wasn't really for any kind of great spiritual reason. I just was kind of lonely and thought well if I become a better person through meditation people will like me more. But it can get much more subtle than that and that is what we want is a sense of comfort in the world or a sense of security or a sense of feeling at home in the world. And so there's a very subtle movement of clinging or wanting or holding on to comfort and to security or wanting to be at home in the universe. And so we go and gravitate to those things that give us that sense of at-homeness. There's nothing wrong with that. It's actually quite wonderful to have a sense of home and some people really need to cultivate that sense of their life to find this kind of a sense of being at home with themselves or the world. However, the suggestion I'm making today is that that belongs to the worldly side of practice. It can provide a lot of happiness and a lot of health and sense of well-being. But health and sense of well-being is not the same thing as liberation. And liberation is a whole other possible motivation for doing practice, the possibility of release. So if we take the analogy of the ocean and the wave, you know, as water particles, you know, realizes it's not, you know, it's not a wave, it's just part of the ocean, that can give a tremendous comfort and ease and a certain kind of freedom in that ocean to realize that. But my thinking today is that that's not liberation because liberation is when the analogy would be that liberation would be kind of comfortable to the water particle evaporating and no longer being bound in any kind of sticky way to the other particles of the ocean and becoming a gas and floating free. That lack of any stickiness, any clinging that sets the mind or sets awareness free, one of the words the Buddha used was consciousness without any features, consciousness without any attachment, consciousness without any, sometimes it's said consciousness without any object. The analogy the Buddha gave was basically like this, that if you take some sunlight and pass it through space, if that sunlight doesn't strike anything, does the sunlight exist? Is it there? Do you see it? We would say yes, but you don't see it, right? If it doesn't strike anything, you don't know it's there. It's kind of like if no one's there to hear a tree fall in the forest, is the sound there? Something is there, but is there sound? Consciousness without feature, consciousness which is liberated, consciousness without an object, it doesn't really, you can't really, it kind of is not there because it's only there if you see it with something, but it's set free. I don't know if this makes any sense at all, it's in a way of describing it, but to set the mind or the heart free, all that binds it, all the movements of needing, of wanting, of aversion, of resistance, to have the experience of total release, including total release from needing to have any sense of meaning to your life. Meaning is a great thing, a lot of meaning we have in life is born from the meaning we create, and it's not that meaning is bad at all. We need to establish some meaning for our life, I think it's very helpful, but we have to realize that establishing a meaning belongs to the worldly realm. If we get the search for meaning can actually keep us there and keep us away from the possibility of liberation, in a liberated state there's no need for meaning. Both realms are important, sometimes in the history of Buddhism there's been a tendency to do one-upmanship. It says after all, Lakuttara, the trance mundane or the supran mundane, well it sounds like it's a better mundane, it's much better than, it's higher than. I think it's very dangerous to do that, I think both of them are really important, and I think it's important to become skilled, to some degree in both realms, to become skilled in the realm of how to function in the world and how to create, how to make a good sense of self. The Buddha's way of talking about the self is he said, self is something if you make yourself. As Tanisara this weekend said, the self is an activity, we make a self, Buddha said, I'm making and me making. So the thing that I say often here, if all of us leave tonight with different shoes than we came with, our shoes wouldn't care. We have to make the idea that this is my shoe, my shoe, the mindness of your shoes out there doesn't exist in the shoes themselves, there's an activity of the mind. So we make ourselves we can make healthy senses of self, unhealthy senses of self, there are some really bad choices to be made in selves, and you should be warned against those bad choices, and there are some good choices to make in terms of self, and you know you've encouraged you to make those good choices. So there's a very important realm of life, but the path of liberation teaches you how to drop all that at times, and how not to have your fundamental sense of well-being or security or happiness tied up with anything that belongs to what's called worldly, anything that can be created or manufactured or fabricated or arises because conditions come together. The ultimate liberation of the path of liberation brings you to an experience of that which is unfabricated, which doesn't come together because of cause and effect, it's called the deathless, which is unborn, undying. So my concern this week has been in looking at people who are engaged in engaged Buddhism in the way that this scholar was talking about it at least, I said to some of these people are taking their understanding of their identity of themselves in the world and nature, which I think is a beautiful philosophy and a beautiful, it comes with wonderful kind of motivation to be involved in service in the world, but taking that understanding to be the ultimate that Buddhism has to teach, and the point of meditation is to realize that oneness with everything. In my sense, I don't want to have the last word on this, so please listen to me with some skepticism here, but my sense is that they've misunderstood what is the worldly wheel, the worldly dharma, the worldly path for the ultimate that the Buddha had to teach, which was release. They're both important, but if you don't know the distinction, it's all too easy to take some wonderfully wise piece of wisdom, an helpful piece of wisdom in the worldly path as being all there is, but there's more than that. There's a possibility of setting the heart and the mind, the consciousness totally free and totally released, and the way the Buddha and Buddhists have talked about this, they sometimes call it the Mahasukha, the great happiness, the ultimate happiness. The greatest happiness you can experience is a happiness which doesn't arise because of conditions, doesn't arise because of its made or created. You don't have to do certain things and create certain setups in order to be happy in that way. So those are my thoughts. I don't know how that went over. I think it would be a longer discussion, but that was another dharma talk, which keeps more of a distinction between I guess it's Mahayala and Sunakkara. At least my thought understanding is that part of the path of the holy sattva is that same social consciousness that is evolving in the world, and that path to liberation requires unceasing service to the environment, to the world, in order to qualify, if you will, like you're getting along. How that would fit into tonight's talk. And the other comment is that tradition probably dates back to about the time of the Buddha, though that social consciousness was at least written first in the early Judea moment, and that may be part of the source of the current trend in Buddhism here in the center. Yeah, it was a very good question. I was going to maybe talk about that. But what was one of the strands that brought me to this idea of talking about this tonight was in the Mahayana traditions, there's an ideal of the bodhisattva. And the bodhisattva, in the essence, is a person who's dedicated themselves to become a Buddha so they can liberate as many people as possible. So it's kind of some altruistic ideal of dedicating oneself to many, many years of practice beyond what it takes to be just liberated for yourself, but to develop yourself in such a way that you can have the maximum efficacy to liberate as many other people as possible. As this idea has come to the West, it's got mixed up with the Christian ideas of the good servant. And the Christian idea, which I don't know very much about, but it's like basically you see Christ, for example, in the poor, and just the act of service, of attending and offering service to the poor, that itself is an ultimate spiritual practice. And so you find then that people understand the bodhisattva path in the West sometimes as being the path of just offering service to everyone. So they work in soup kitchens, they work in hospices, they do all kinds of wonderful work. It's just kind of the altruistic ideal to kind of be involved in service. However, serving in a soup kitchen, it's really important, but it's not the same thing as helping someone become liberated. And so if someone on the bodhisattva path understands they're just supposed to go off and be of service, they might not never themselves understand anything about liberation. If they don't understand anything about liberation, they can't really help someone else become liberated. They can help someone become sheltered and help someone not be hungry and help in all kinds of other ways, but they're not going to help them become liberated. It's like someone is dedicated to becoming a brain surgeon. And that's what they really want to do. It feels really important to do it. And it's like someone has to do it. There's no one in my county who's a brain surgeon, all these people dying from whatever and I'm going to become a brain surgeon. And then they say, well, I'm just supposed to help people when their head hurts. So they say, I'm just going to go around and give aspirin all the time. All people need aspirin too. So they just go around giving aspirin to everyone, but they never develop the skills to become a brain surgeon. So the bodhisattva is not someone whose only job is to be of service. The bodhisattva is someone whose job is to help other people become liberated. And so here also you find, I think among some American Buddhists, a confusion between these two different realms, the worldly realm, just offering infinite service there and forgetting about the possibility of liberation, which is really the job description of a bodhisattva. Make sense? Dualism is a dangerous word to use because there's so many associations to it. And because in many of our circles, spiritual circles, Buddhism and Indian circles, the word dualism means everything is bad, is dualistic. So we have to talk more about what you mean by it, but distinction. Distinction doesn't apply fixed dualities. So these realms, the worldly realm and the super mundane realm, are distinctions that are useful, but the two interact and support each other. And so it doesn't really work to kind of focus just on one. For many people, in order to have some chance of liberation, they need to have a firm foundation and a very healthy sense of worldly wisdom and worldly sense of self and worldly connection. And they need to develop that so they can let go of all that. And for people who are involved very much in the worldly part of life, to have a reference of liberation, to know what liberation is or have some reference and understanding of it, helps them be much more equinanimous in their engagement in the worldly activities. So the two are very important to kind of work together and they're not hard and fast distinctions. I hope that was more or less Ruth, what you were kind of, we can talk more about it. So if these distinctions made enough sense for you, you might spend some time looking at the motivations you have for doing your meditation practice, doing your Buddhist practice, and see which of these two realms it tends to fall in. Not that one is wrong, it's very helpful to clarify which it is. And when you look at your understanding of life, of the meaning of life that you have, and see how it fits into this distinction between that which pertains to release and that which pertains to adjusting the worldly conditions. Some people like to say that the worldly sphere, which is the sphere of conditions, of getting conditions just right so things can kind of work out well and become happy, ultimately is you're involved in a realm that's like rearranging the deck chair on the botanic. I mean you can finally find a really good place of that deck chair. You know you can really see the sunset really well as the boat goes down. The point being that you can get, you can get, you can reach the pinnacle of worldly happiness and it's not stable. It's guaranteed that it's going to rise and pass and pass away. And so if you put all your depend for security and well-being only in the worldly realm, so-called worldly realm, then it can be a setup for more suffering. And so that's the experience of the unconditioned, experience of that possibility, that happiness which is not dependent on anything, provides a wonderful balance to the ways in which we are engaged in the world. So it might have been, it might have been some a little bit confusing in this talk, so I grant you that. But I also hope that you grapple with these interesting topics and see if there's some ways they can become relevant to your life and practice. So may you all be liberated and happy.
