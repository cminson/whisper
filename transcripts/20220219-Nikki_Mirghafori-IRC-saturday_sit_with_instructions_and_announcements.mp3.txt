Greetings, everyone. Greetings.
So, in our instructions, like to call them invitations, the past few days we have expanded
our practice through the concentric circles, bit by bit by bit, invited you to explore.
And we've come to the last category, the last bucket, which is one that includes everything.
Includes everything, all beings, category that includes all beings.
And in this category, all the previous categories are included.
Yourself, everyone you hold dear, your benefactors, your friends, all the neutral beings in the
world, all the neutral human beings in the world, all the people you have challenges
with at this time, and all forms of life, actually, all beings includes all animals and all forms
of life.
So, really, this category, per se, is a way to extend, is a way to explore kindness towards
everything, towards everything and everyone, meeting all beings with kindness, with good
will, may all beings be well, may all beings be happy, etc., etc.
So there are different ways that this practice could be introduced.
And if you're new to the practice, great, relax and enjoy the ride, and if you're familiar
with this practice, and want to mention a couple of ways, you might have heard it before.
So one way it can be introduced, which has been also if you're familiar with the metta-sutta,
is to divide all beings into categories, and it's just their creative categories, kind
of, you know, all beings who are near, all beings who are far, all beings who are born
or yet to be born, these beautiful ways of categorizing, all beings who are small, medium,
or long, just size-wise, or I think from the metta-sutta, if I remember correctly, all
females, males, and let's add, non-gendered beings.
So just different ways, and that reminds me of my grandma had a, there is a blessing in
Azari Turkish, where she would go through people who were born on the days of the week, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, she would go through them also, it's just different ways, right?
All beings who were born on this day, all these, but you kind of ways to include everyone,
right?
But different ways to divide, so that's one way.
And then you can also think of other categories, which I might mention, all the, all beings
who fly, all beings who swim, all beings who slither, or hop on to feed, all two-legged
animals, mostly humans, all four-legged animals, so, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
So that's one way, just to bring, so that the mind can connect, the point of that, these
interesting categories, and you can make up your own categories, right?
All beings who live in Africa, all beings who live in this particular geographical location,
all beings who live in my town, and then my county, and then you extend it further.
So there's so many ways, right?
The point is for the mind to connect with it, to connect with maybe a geographical location,
or day of the week, or size, or, or yet to be born, all the, you know, babies of all
types, all the egg rows who are not yet hatched, right?
So all these different ways to connect with beings in different shapes and forms.
So, and I mentioned that because throughout the day, as the invitation is, if you wanted
to explore, you could have a fun time with all the fish, or swim in salt water, all the
fish.
Anyway, you get, you get the gist, right?
You can connect with the category of your own heart and mind, and just hang out with
them and then go to another category, can be really, really rich, it can just be really
lovely, all the finches, anyway.
So that's, that's one way that this practice can be introduced, can be practiced.
And another way is through directions, through directions, all the beings that are in front
of me, or maybe to the north, or to the northeast, etc., etc., and sections, kind of like radiating.
And that goes with this idea of radiating, which may have, may be combined with phrases.
But at some point, as some of you might have experienced, the phrases might drop, phrases
might drop, and there could just be the sense of radiating kindness through the entire world,
unbounded, limitless, the other sense of radiating, not just because we exist, here we are, this
being, this human being, that is me, radiating kindness, radiating kindness towards the entire
world.
And in order to have some handle on it, you can go section by section by section, all around
our body, say, just kind of radiate, radiate, and that can feel really, really good.
And yet, there are some nuances there, because sometimes we can feel like, wait, I'm pushing
this out, this feels like hard work, I don't want to be pushing, so the idea is you're
not pushing it out, you're just being and letting it radiate out, it's a different perception,
it's a different perspective, let it radiate out, let your kindness, let your goodwill
radiate out.
So today being the last day of invitations, instructions, what I will do, I will bring
both this way of directionality, which is one way this all beings category is introduced.
Together with some of these categories, I'll mention them just playfully as we go through
these directions.
So I kind of mix these two two ways, because hey, this is a cultivation practice, we can
be creative, and I'll put more emphasis today on radiating, because that's actually how
not only after sometimes the phrases drop how the practice could be experienced, but
radiating is also how some people practice it or some teachers teach it and not so much
emphasis on the phrases, which can be supportive, which can help us stay with the feeling, but
sometimes it's not necessary, just being with the feeling and radiating it out, radiating
metta is one way metta is practiced.
So I might mention the phrases today, but just kind of likely see what works for you,
you can lean into the radiating today, if that works for you, you can lean into the
phrases if they've been supporting you or the words, whatever is supportive.
So there's a lot of permission this last day, you've been swimming in so many different
ways with instructions to see what's supportive for you.
And one thing to remember, and of course I will mention it during the invitations, is
the category of all beings, you are included in the category of all beings.
So if you did, if you imagine there is this orb of light, your heart center, your chest
is shining, shining, loving kindness, shining, goodwill, goodwill, guess who it touches first,
this light, light of goodwill, it touches you first before it radiates out.
So remember this, remember this, as also we've been emphasizing, hanging out with ourselves
as such an important category.
So without further ado, and just to say, if you're having trouble hearing, I think one
person sent me a note, using earbuds or ear, something to put, to connect it to your computer
always helps, always helps the volume, hearing, otherwise the computer speakers may not be
good enough.
So just a note, that's really the best way.
So with that, let's settle, let's settle, let's settle into our bodies.
Always arriving first, arriving in the body, first arriving here and now, arriving with
the breath, the sensations of the body, with kindness, meeting, as if you're awareness
now, as you become aware of your body, touching the earth, your feet, touching the earth,
your sit bones, become aware kindly, your awareness infused with metta, your awareness
infused with goodwill, receiving experience, receiving experience kindly, even if it's
tinged with an unpleasant note, whether it's tinged with neutral, pleasant, or unpleasant,
can we relax and receive experience, receive, bodily experience, the breath, the sensations,
the awareness, the awareness that's tinged, that's imbued with kindness, as if receiving
experience with a smile.
Thank you.
And now, noticing the breath entering your body as if entering through your heart center.
And each breath that is received, this gift of each breath in your chest, in your heart
center, in the middle of your chest, it awakens, it awakens this sense of warmth, goodwill, kindness.
Each breath becomes enlightened and brighter, it's just shining on its own, there's not
so much doing on your part to push it to make it shine or make it glow, you just observe
it, you just observe, yeah.
After this essence of goodness, this essence of goodwill, trusting that it is here, trusting
that it is here, it's shining, even if it may not be felt or too perceptible right now,
it's okay, or it might be perceptible right now, trust, trust your goodness is shining,
your goodwill is here.
Breathing your body, letting this shining, letting this permeating permeate through your body
first, this feeling of goodwill, care, radiating, radiating through your body.
Care, kindness, goodwill, touching, parts of your body that need care especially, and
in all parts, radiating through your chest, your arms, your neck and shoulders, held in
kindness, your arms, your hands, thank you hands, you do so much, you've done so much.
Breathing through your chest, through your heart, your lungs, your abdomen, all the organs,
oh dear body, thank you, you work so hard, radiating, radiating through your legs, through
your sit bones, upper legs, knees, lower legs and feet, relaxing, settling into your cushion,
your chair further, this body held and raised, radiating the rays of kindness, and moving
upward, this rays of kindness, radiating through the neck, through our head, eyes, ears, nose,
our brain, oh thank you, wow, all these organs, this body of life, held in kindness, held
in kindness, this radiating of kindness, maybe it feels like a golden light, or whatever
image is appropriate for you, radiating, radiating kindness, this whole body held in
kindness, and radiating outward, letting it shine outward, let it shine, let it shine,
not so much ever pushing it out, let it shine, rest, rest in the goodness, the goodness that
you trust is here, the good will that is here, however perceptible or subtle it is, I am
here, I'm alive, I walk this earth, this earth being my witness, just because I'm alive,
just because I breathe, I am, as my gift, as my gift of living in this world, because
I live, because I am, as my gift, I let my goodness, I let my light shine, shine, shine
on to this world, in this fleeting moment, my gift
And now, as if there was a curtain around you, and we remove one section, and we remove
one section of the curtain at a time, part of the section that is in front of you, it's
removed, and let it shine, shine, let it shine, and let's, I'm going to say north, just again
I'm combining two different practices here, what's in front with the directionality, so
if you're not facing north, it's okay, imagine it's north, so radiating, letting the rays
of kindness radiate, the front, all beings, including yourself and all beings in front
of you, continuing all the ways, all the ways, all beings, all beings that fly, all beings
that swim, beyond, beyond, beyond, all human beings, letting your light shine through, and
removing another section, another section of the curtain, to your right, all beings to
your right, all beings in that direction may be well, all beings to my right, all beings,
all birds, all two-legged animals, all insects, all sentient beings, may you be well, may
you be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease.
Keep feeling the physicality of the radiating, radiating of meta to your right side, all
beings now, behind you, all beings behind you, removing another section, all beings,
radiating meta through your back side, all beings, all beings, born yet to be born, small
medium or tall, removing another section of the curtain, to the left, all beings to my
left side, radiating through my left arm left side, my body radiating, all these beings,
I wish you well, I share my kindness with you, now all beings above, above, in the skies
above, above, above all beings, in the skies above, past,
radiating kindness and uplift of the heart, radiating up and all beings now in the depths
below you, all the beings, all the animals, critters, insects, below, maybe through and
the other side of the earth, our planet, all the beings on the other side, and fight
it to feel yourself sitting this, radiating, radiating of meta, sitting in it, not pushing
it out, it's just radiating on its own through this body, through your heart, this organ
of care, organ of meta, your heart center, your whole body, meeting all sentient beings
with kindness.
Don't make this practice effortful, if you notice you're efforting, relax, relax, relax.
Relax into it, let it shine, let your light shine, with each breath.
If at any point you lose connection with the beings,
it's okay to bring up categories, all the little children, all the little children around
the world, maybe imagining them in different continents, nationalities, races, colors,
all the little children around the world, maybe you say, happy, healthy and happy, all
the newborns, all the babies, may they be well, all around me, all around the world, this
can be such a fun and joyous practice, have fun with it, all the young people, all the
teenagers around the world, maybe bringing a couple of images into your mind's eye, radiating
your kindness, may they all be well, may they all be well, all adults, all adult beings.
And all older individuals, may they be well.
Male, baby birds, all chicks, may they be well.
Male, adult birds, be well.
Male, kittens, be well.
Just so that we don't incline just to cute animals, may all spiders be well, may all
spiders be well.
Unconditionally, may all spiders be well.
May all fish be well.
May all beings slither and hop be well.
Feel free to make up your own categories, if you wish, when it gets dry.
Keep sitting in the radiating, in the joy of radiating all around you, up and down, in
all directions, with or without reason, see what works for you best.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.

Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.

Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
It becomes too heady, you're thinking about all these categories.
Drop it, drop it.
Let it be embodied, like your body's attuning fork.
Resonating with the songs of kindness.
Or radiating heat, kindness, warmth.
Whatever metaphor image works for you.
Let it be more embodied than heady.
Let it be easy, let it be easy.
Thank you for your practice.
Thank you for your practice.
So, I invite you to have fun with this category.
It can be so joyous, so joyous, delightful to radiate, to metai.
Again, keep it physical.
So, if it gets dry, bring in the categories to connect, to connect with beings.
And then, don't go thinking about all the categories the whole time.
Let it be physical.
And you'll notice, you might notice that there's a sense of when beings, when experience is met by kindness, by good will.
There's a sense of resourcefulness, there's a sense of gladness, there's a sense of, wow, this is good.
There's a sense of resourcefulness that comes out.
So, the more you give, the more you feel, you receive, the more you're nourished.
It's not like you're depleted.
It's a lovely practice.
Hope you discover for yourself.
Be curious.
It's been our theme, let yourself be surprised.
And if you've tried this morning, like, I don't know, it's just, it's all these beings.
Let yourself be surprised.
Let yourself be surprised.
And a couple of announcements.
One is that Tanya has signed up appointments available.
That will open up in a couple of minutes and will be, those slots will be available for sign up until 2pm.
So if you need extra support today, extra support is available.
And there's also extra support this evening.
There is a drop in practice discussion.
If you like to drop in, ask a question or just listen to others.
And that is at 7.15pm and it's offered by Tanya.
So by now you've received all these invitations, all these Dharma talks, instructions.
So today to sit to explore where it's necessary, where it's needed.
All beings, maybe spending some time with yourself or with the being with whom you're having difficulty with right now.
Which might be yourself, by the way.
Have you noticed that difficult person could be this person?
Or the dear being is also this person.
The benefactor is also this person.
And this person is also a neutral being, a stand-in for all of humanity.
There's so much that we can discover through this practice.
So see where it's okay.
Give yourself permission today to explore where you need to explore.
Maybe from the invitations from the talk yesterday.
Which you're welcome, by the way, to talk on forgiveness and self-requiem.
You're welcome to put it in your back pocket and pull it out when it's needed.
And if it's coming up now, maybe that's an area you feel like you want to sit with today for some time.
So you have permission to explore.
But do give a little bit of time to all beings category.
Radiating, physically.
Just this body, this body.
Just because you live, you are.
You can radiate goodness in this world.
It's a very powerful, very powerful way of seeing ourselves and feeling ourselves in this world.
Radiating kindness.
So, thank you all for your practice, for being here, for doing this work.
May you be well.
May you have a good, quote unquote, good day of practice.
And good might mean ups and downs, you know, right?
Purification, purity cycles.
Have a good day of practice.
Take care.
