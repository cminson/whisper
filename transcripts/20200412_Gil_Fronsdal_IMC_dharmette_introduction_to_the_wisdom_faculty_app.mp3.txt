 
 Dharmette:  Introduction  to the Wisdom  
Faculty  
 
Transcribed  and edited  from  a short  talk by Gil 
Fronsdal  on April  12, 2020  
 
 
Good  morning.  I appreciate  the chance  to meditate  here 
with you on this Sunday  morning.  Some  of you have  
been  doing  these  Monday  through  Friday  morning  
sittings.  I appreciate  that you came  back  for this special  
Sunday  morning  sitting  that is partly  being  done to 
support  an online  retreat  that started  yesterday.  I 
appreciate  that there  are so many  people  who are 
interested  in meditation  practice  and mindfulness.  Even  
in this time when  we’re  separated  and aren’t  able to 
come  together  physically,  we are togeth er in heart.  We 
are together  in purpose  and spirit  through  a practice.  So 
thank  you.  
 
What  I’d like to talk about  today  is a background  or 
overview  of the topic  of the Five Faculties.  Tomorrow  
and for the next week,  I’m going  to talk about  wisdom,  
the fifth of the Five Faculties.  The first four are usually  
translated  as faith,  effort,  mindfulness,  and 
concentration.  Wisdom  is a lofty topic  in many  ways.  But 
the way that wisdom  operates  in Buddhism  is that 
wisdom  arises  out of the practice.  It arises  out of the  
 body.  And it arises  out of the support  of the other  
faculties.   
 
As our faith or confidence  bring  us into the present  
moment  – as our capacity  for engagement  brings  us 
into the present  moment  here in this body  – as 
mindfulness  begins  to awaken  our capacity for attention,  
not just as a cognitive  ability  but as an awareness  that is 
also grounded  in the body  – and as our capacity  for the 
focus  that concentration  develops  – we awaken  much  
more  than focus,  because  samādhi or concentration  is 
also very much  an embodied  experience  of wholeness  
or unification.  
 
The Five Faculties  are called  faculties,  because  they 
are capacities  that we all have.  We all have  the capacity  
for faith or confidence , for effort , for attention  or 
awar eness,  for focus,  and for wisdom.  As we begin  
strengthening  the first four, it’s almost  as if it’s natural  
for wisdom  to surface.   
 
You don’t  have  to read books  on Buddhism  for Buddhist  
wisdom.  If you want  to become  wise in Buddhism,  you 
want  to read the book that’s  in your own heart  and body.  
This is where  wisdom  is born.  It’s to have  the ability  to 
come  back  in a clear,  open,  and dedicated  way, maybe  
even  in a deep , embodied  way into our experience  of 
the moment , so that our natural  faculty  or capacity  for 
wisdom  can operate.    
  
This idea is that these  are capacities  that we all 
inherently  have . Even wisdom  is a capacity  that we can 
clarify,  make  strong . That we can let it really  work  in a 
natural  way speaks  to the idea that we don’t  have  to be 
the one who is engineering  our life or our practice.  We 
are not the ones  who have  to figure  it out, make  
something  happen , or avoid  something.  We create  the 
conditions  that allow  this natural  capacity  to arise.  One 
of those  conditions  is a deep  trust that there  is a wisdom  
that arises  out of the whole  psychophysical  system  of 
the body.   
 
A lot of the reason  that we practice  mindfulness  is not 
only to be mindfully  present  and see what’s  going  on, 
but in a certain  way to also get out of our own way, and 
allow  this capaci ty to support  us – rather  than being  up 
in the control  tower  figuring  it out, planning,  and 
analyzing.  “Am I there  yet? Is this the right form of 
experience?  Am I doing  it right?  Am I doing  it wrong?” 
It’s to learn  to soften  and relax  the control  tower  of self – 
me, myself  and I: “It’s all up to me. I’m the victim,  I’m 
having  a hard time. I have  to do it. Look how great  I 
am.” The idea is to soften  and relax  this part of the 
whole  psychophysical  system.   
 
Classically  in Buddhism  this process  begins  with the 
first faculty,  which  is often  translated  into English  as 
‘faith.’  I sometimes  like the word  ‘trust.’  A nice middle   
 way is ‘confidence.’  We have  some  confidence  in our 
ability  to be present.  We have  confidence  in the value  of 
waking  up to our experience  here.  We have  confidence  
in a path of practice  – and that as we practice  
mindfulness  and concentration,  it keeps  opening  up the 
dharma  book  that’s  in ourselves.  It becomes  a very safe 
and supportive  place  to be here in the present  moment,  
to find ourselves  grounded  here.  It’s a process  to get 
there.  It’s not easy,  and that’s  why faith is somehow  
important.   
 
Some  people  react  to the English  word  ‘faith.’  It can 
imply  some  idea that you have  to have  faith in some  
doctrine  that you have  to believe  in, or can’t  believe  in, 
or that is something  you don’t  know.  I love the fact that 
the word  ‘believe’  in its original  usage  a long time ago 
meant  to love something , and to hold it dear.  It didn’t  
mean  to believe  a cognitive  thing  like a tenet  or belief.  It 
meant  where  you put your heart  in, and what  you love.  
This idea of faith is a capacity  for love,  care,  or 
kindness.  Here  is what  I love: “I love myself.  I love to 
wake  up. I love to be able to bring  compassion  and care 
to whatever  is happening  here.  I love the support  of the 
refuges  – Buddha,  Dharma  and Sangha  – and the fact 
that I’m not doing  this alone.  We’re  supported  by so 
much.  So allow  faith to somehow  be here to support  
you. You will know  it’s supporting  you if you begin  to 
rest or settle  into this body.  
  
 The capacity  for effort  in the Five Faculties  is a little 
different  from what  it is for many  people.  When  some  
people  hear that they have  to make  effort,  they get tight.  
It’s work,  and it’s going  to be exhausting.  One of the 
paradoxes  is we can make  a lot of effort  to relax.  So if 
the focus  is to relax,  then we can’t  strain,  push,  get tight,  
or work  a lot to relax.  But we’re  diligent  and persistent  in 
staying  here, relaxing  into the body.  Relaxing  into the 
body  doesn’t  mean  becoming  too limp.  It mean s 
softening  and relaxing  the attention , so that we rest in 
our body  as our body  keeps  us upright.  The effort  is 
relaxing  and softening  – as long as we don’t  fall asleep.  
If we’re  tired or dull, then it’s good  to recognize  that and 
wake  up the alertness  of attention.  There  is a balance  of 
alertness  and relaxation.   
 
Without  the effort  to bring  ourselves  back  to the cushion  
– the effort  to begin  again  when  the mind  wanders  off – 
there  is no practice.  The art of that effort  is how to make  
it something  that you enjoy,  something  that’s  nice and 
supportive , so that every  time your mind  wanders  off, 
you look forward  to the effort  to come  back  in a kind,  
supportive,  and easeful  way. Come  back  in a way that 
you can’t  believe  your good luck that you get to come  
back , as opposed  to thinking,  “Oh no, I wandered  off in 
thought.  Terrible  me, I’m not doing  it right.”  Then  it 
doesn’t  even  feel good  to come  back.  I’ve done  that 
where  I’ve jerked  or pounced  my mind  back,  and it 
doesn’t  really  feel good.   
  
Then  the faculty  of mindfulness:  to be present  for the 
experience , and to trust our capacity  to be aware.  It’s an 
awareness  that is very simple.  If it’s not simple,  it’s not 
aware ness .  
 
And then samādhi, the concentration  faculty . Something  
simple  I’d like to say today  is that samādhi can be 
understood  as a unification  process,  bringing  or 
gathering  together  all of our capacities  to be settled  
here on our body,  our breathing,  and whatever  the 
attention  is going  to.  
 
One way to come to that kind of unification  is the mantra  
“This  too.” It also works  very well for mindfulness,  and 
that is “This  too’” we include  in our awareness.  It’s not 
included  so that we think  about  it, but “This  too” is 
included  in the silent  or quiet  attention  of mindfulness.  
“This  too” is included  in this gathering  together.  
 
To have  all these  capacities  beginning  to settle  over the 
days,  weeks,  and even  the years  of practice  allows  a 
very deep  capacity  for wisdom,  discernment,  
understanding,  and insight  to begin. It’s not something  
that we’re  responsible  for, but it’s something  that 
reveals  itself to us because  all the conditions  are in 
place  for the mind’s  capacity  for wisdom  to operate.   
  
 The wisdom  faculty  will be the topic  for these  next few 
days.  I look forward  to sharing  what  I’ve learned , and to 
practicing  together  with you. Thank  you very much  for 
now.  I very much  look forward  to our next time together.
