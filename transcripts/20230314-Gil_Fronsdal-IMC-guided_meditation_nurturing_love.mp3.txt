 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello everyone. Welcome. And welcome to this now next half hour of... I hope that it's something delightful. A delightful period of meditation. And to introduce it, I want to make the point that we have many physiological systems within us that are fairly distinct from each other, though they also work together. So for example, we have the capacity to hear sounds. I hear the garbage trucks outside, not right now. And some of us can hear. And some of us have the capacity also to walk. And those can be done independent of each other. And they can support each other. So we have psychological systems within us that can be independent of each other and work together. And one of them is partly the protective system that reacts to the threats in the world and responds quickly. But that also becomes reactive to all kinds of challenges, all kinds of imagined challenges, all kinds of things which are not ever present, but may be imaginary or future threats. And so then this reactive system kind of can go haywire. And sometimes what the reactive system is reacting to is thoughts and memories and impulses, ideas in ourselves, and reactivity sometimes reacting to reactivity. And so the cycles of reactivity kind of live in people sometimes for decades. So there is this protective reactive system. And then there's also the nurturing loving system. And this is where we appreciate people. We have good will for them. We respect them. That there's love of all the different shades, all different forms of love. And sometimes the reactive system predominates. When we have challenges, then in particular the reactive mode gets the upper hand and the nurturing mode, the love mode, is forgotten, is pushed to the side. They're always there together and they have the opportunity to cooperate and work together. And they can be done independently. And meditation is a time to relax and quiet the reactive mode. It has a role sometimes in our lives, but also it's really healthy to learn how to quiet it, to let it settle down, to have a break, a vacation from that. Not as being disloyal to it. There's a time and place for it, the reactive mode. But if we can quiet down, settle it in meditation, then we can bring forth the love mode, the nurturing mode, that which feeds us and fills us with healing, loving, soft, dharmic qualities. It's always there, but I think it's often the one that's forgotten, the one that's overlooked, the one that is somehow buried. So to call upon, to tap into the capacity to have goodwill, well-wishing, to view, look upon others kindly. In good will, your words good will, kindly, doesn't have the high bars if we use the word love. It's possible to have good will and look kindly on people who we don't like. Liking and love, not liking and good will, liking and kindness are two different things. And one way to distinguish this is that love, liking, good will, is so good for ourselves. It nourishes ourselves. And it's possible to have this good will and its benefits fill us in a wonderfully inspiring, healing, maturing way. So to sit in meditation and to assume a posture that allows the reactive mode to relax. If you're sitting first thing in the morning, maybe the reactive mode is just a little bit left over from the day before, a little bit of physical tension. Maybe there's reactive thoughts and contractions and tensions in the mind or the heart. But to sit in a way that is going to allow that to relax. And the classic posture of sitting upright can allow for the deepest relaxation. Gently closing the eyes. And then taking some long, slow, deep breaths. And on the exhale, without ambition or trying too hard, relax your whole body and mind. Let things release, let go. To avoid being reactive to your tension. To avoid have any aversion to the tensions of the body and mind. While caringly, kindly, letting things relax as you breathe. And if you could intentionally relax, act on that intention. And see if you can find how the intention to relax can arise from a good will, a caring, a kindness to yourself and to your body. Meditation is a time out from being involved in the challenges of our life the best we can. Or at least a time out from being reactive to them. Trying to solve them or understand them. Relaxing. Relaxing is a form of self-care. And then letting your letting go of actively relaxing. And sit quietly with your breathing. As if you're getting ready to gaze upon breathing kindly with good will, with love for your body breathing. But first, just let breathing reveal itself to you. Let the inhale and exhale arise and manifest as if they want to be known. And whatever way you're breathing is the way that they want to be known. And you just feeling it, knowing it. And to gently, without any worry if you can't do this, and to allow your breathing to relax. Let there be a caring, a good will, a kindness for your breathing. To make room for it to relax or to ease up. So breathing moves in the direction of breathing easily, lightly. Being content with the very slight easing up or relaxing of breathing. Looking for places where the inhale has a softness to it. Looking for places where the exhale has softness as part of it. And then is there a place in your body anywhere at all that you associate with good will, kindness, love, well-wishing of others, well-wishing of yourself, maybe in the heart area, maybe your belly, maybe in your mind, maybe your whole body. And wherever is the place associated with love, kindness, breathe with that, breathe through it as a gentle wind that fans a flame. Gently fans a campfire, fanning the flame of love, kindness. Centering yourself in the kindness, not in the reactivity. So breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. Breathing moves in the direction of the heart. And then to turn your gaze out upon the world to the people around you, your life and your communities, as if you're looking out into the world, whoever comes to mind for you quietly, peacefully, maybe without them needing to know, gaze upon them kindly. An attitude of friendliness, warmth, goodwill. The Buddha likened metta, goodwill, to the sound of a trumpet. You don't see it, the sound travel, but it travels out from the mouth of the trumpet, out into the world, far. So let these words of loving kindness project your kindness, goodwill, out into the world as a loving trumpet call. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And with our love, with our care and friendship, may each of us contribute to that possibility, even in the smallest ways. Thank you.
