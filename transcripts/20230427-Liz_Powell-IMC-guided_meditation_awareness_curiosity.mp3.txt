And we'll start this evening with 10 minutes of guidance in a 30-minute guided meditation.
So as we begin this sitting, what are you aware of just to start with as we begin this sitting?
Allowing yourself time to settle into the sitting with awareness as you bring any ease that's possible to the body, the heart, the mind.
What are you aware of?
What's most obvious?
It can often be supportive to recognize and deliberately release any preoccupations or any tension, anything that might be softened in the body or in the mind, simply allowing that to release.
And also allowing everything that comes to awareness exactly as it is.
There is nothing to change or fix.
Relaxing when it's possible, receiving, recognizing in this moment whatever's most obvious could be hearing,
sensing, smelling, hasting, feeling, thinking.
Allowing awareness to notice whatever is there.
Giving your experience some time and space, allowing what's arising.
No need to rush away from what you're noticing. No need to get caught in it.
Simply being present with it until something else presents itself for as long or as short as you're aware of an experience allowing it at its own pace to arise, present, and pass.
Thank you.
No need to go out looking for experience.
No need to do anything or make anything happen.
Noticing anything that's flowing into or out of the attention or is remaining.
Relaxing, receiving, recognizing.
Allowing any natural curiosity.
This could come up as a question, what else is present?
Curiosity may notice states of mind that are arising that are wholesome or feel pleasant or wise.
And if what is being noticed is unwholesome or unwise, simply noticing that.
No need to take it up or dwell on it. Simply allow it to be received in awareness.
Aware of what is present and any reactions that arise to it.
Noticing what's helpful as well as anything that is not helpful.
Sometimes the mind is aware of experiencing something that is stressful or suffering.
Simply noting it.
What's being known now.
Recognizing the experience without letting it take you away from awareness.
No need to get caught up simply noticing. And what else am I aware of now?
And when awareness recognizes something helpful, receiving that, allowing that.
And recognizing the relationship with that. Maybe one of simple recognition or it might come with some feeling.
Continuing to notice with awareness everything, anything as it comes and goes as we continue the meditation in silence.
