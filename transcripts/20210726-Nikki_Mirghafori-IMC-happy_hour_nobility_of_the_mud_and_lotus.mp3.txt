 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello and welcome everyone to this edition of Happy Hour, practicing together. So before I hit the record button, we're talking about smokes, fires, lockdowns, so much happening externally, internally. So for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to approach the practice of compassion, which is love, needing suffering, love-meeting suffering. And for this edition, we'll be practicing self-compassion, so our own suffering, whether it's physical, whether we have physical pain, suffering, illness, anything that's happening physically, or whether it's emotional, psychological, pain of the heart, not literally, both literally, but also metaphorically. And two invitations tonight, two invitations for our guided practice. The first is to consider that, to consider a meeting, meeting or pain, meeting or suffering or sorrow, surrounding, infusing, holding it with love, complete love, the way we would hold a baby, a newborn, a tender young being, just holding them with tenderness, love, completely engulfed in love. That's one invitation that I will be weaving through. And the other invitation, the second invitation, is considering that our self-sense, our self-sense in the suffering is quite malleable in the story. And of course, there is pain, there is sorrow, there's suffering, and then there are different ways, there's different self-senses. So for example, you can think of the Buddha, who could have, you know, his story, instead of one of nobility, one of nobility and service and strength, awakening, etc. Instead of that narrative, the narrative could have been, oh, you know, yeah, I was a prince, I was, you know, I couldn't get out of this prison of a castle, my dad didn't let me get out and then I got out and, and, you know, and then oh yeah, I couldn't, you know, no one would, would, you know, after I got enlightened, oh, nobody would believe me and, you know, people turned around and like, so, so it could be a sense of, oh, poor me, poor me, which would be funny way, right? I mean, funny way to even think of that story. It's kind of exaggerated. But the same way, can we think of our own suffering, our own pain, our own sorrow, however, shows up with nobility, with nobility, as if this challenge, this sorrow, this pain, we are, we are bodhisattva, just like the Buddha before his awakening, we're bodhisattva, we're offering, we're holding this pain, we're, in ways, maybe we can't quite understand, we're offering it to all beings everywhere for their awakening, for our own awakening, for all sentient beings, bodhisattva, bodhi awakening, sattva, sentient beings, for all sentient beings, including ourselves, this suffering, this sorrow, it's the sense of nobility in enduring and offering, in being, with this difficulty. So that can bring a sense of, again, nobility, strength, power to being with both the sensitivity, the tenderness in the image of holding with love, as if it were a newborn, and the sense of nobility. So these are two invitations that I will work, I will invite us through the guided meditation as ways to consider, as ways to enter. And also I want to give credit to Robert Bay, I heard these two mentioned these ideas as a part of a longer talk and just got me thinking that, oh, this can be a whole practice. And the talk, he mentioned this in, to give it reference is love, healing and emptiness, which I have mentioned before, and that I believe Neil has sent it to the Sangha in the Google Groups mailing list. So, so without further ado, let's start our practice, let's get into our, to our posture. As always starting with settling with arriving. This body, this heart, this breath. Connecting with each breath, in breath out breath. Just landing and arriving for the first few minutes of this practice. In our own pace, in our own bodies. Exiting the floor, the cushion, the earth. Each breath filling our hearts, our heart center, our abdomen, our whole body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Just this breath. Relaxing into this body in this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Inviting awareness to be present with the breath with the body. With whatever is happening the heart. Gently embracing, touching. With your awareness, the body, heart and mind. Thank you. Thank you. Let engage breath, awareness of each breath. Radiate. Feel more expensive. As if our awareness expands, not just through the body but beyond. As if we are sitting comfortably relaxing into spacious awareness. Not so much trying to push it and pull it and expand it just. It's more expensive than we realize. Oh, oh yes, can relax into this gentle spaciousness. Whole body can relax into it. Our hearts can relax whatever they're holding in this moment. Our bodies can relax. Into spacious awareness. And what if this spacious awareness. Spaciousness is also tinged with care, with gentle. With gentleness. Kermating through our body. Around our body. Holding us as if a soothing blanket. As if our aching heart or aching body. Our mind. Is wrapped lovingly. As if a newborn, a baby, wrapped lovingly in this blanket of care. It's okay. It's okay. Breathing in with each breath. Breathing soothing compassionate love. Around this body. It's okay. It's okay. With each breath. Here. It's okay. Soothing, healing, loving, compassionate. Awareness with each breath. Breathing. Breathing. And the proverbial heart center connecting with yourself, holding yourself. This being that is you. Touch can be so soothing. Breathing, healing. It's an experiment, something might open up, unexpected. It's a feeling empowering. Supporting this being sense of empowerment in the care. This sense of empowerment. Nourishing, supporting yourself. Also offering, offering this challenge, this dukkha. For the benefit for the awakening of all sentient beings. As if bodhisattva, you are a bodhisattva, whoever is on this path. It is a bodhisattva. Awakening not for our own sake alone, but for the sake of all beings. All life, all forms of awareness. Offering this gift, this dark gift of suffering. That is opening us up in ways unknown and unseen, perhaps as of yet. Training us in compassion and patience and love for ourselves and the world. Offering, enduring, being with this challenge. For the benefit of all beings. Sense of nobility in being with. Opening to more dimensions of meaning. That we are not alone. Burning with this dukkha for the benefit of ourselves and others awakening. That way it can be transformed. It may be released, transformed into compassion for ourselves and others. Perseverance, love. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Especially exacerbated by the pandemic. No mud, no lotus, offering our mud and the lotus. Of our awakening, growing in compassion as little or as much as possible. Offering it wholeheartedly for the benefit of all sentient beings. May this serve. May it serve. May it be of service. This challenge I have been given. Given the causes and conditions. May it be of service to all beings everywhere. And this being who is me in waking up. May all beings everywhere know their own abundance, their own goodness, their own capacity and beauty, their own magnificence. May all beings be free. Thank you everyone. Thank you for your practice. So, couple of themes, invitations today. The first, the theme of enveloping the challenge difficulty dukkha with love as if a baby. And then with that, invitation to hold our heart center, our heart with our palm. And to bring in a sense of nobility, a sense of self support, a sense of empowerment, supporting ourselves. And then transitioning into this sense of offering the mat, the lotus, or suffering for the benefit of all beings. Finding, changing the self narrative from one of, perhaps, poor me to sense of resilience. So, would love to hear your reflections, what you discovered, what was new, what was your insight, questions, comments for the benefit of all beings or sangha. Patricia Offers, who's joining us from Ireland, middle of the night there, 2am or 3am now almost. Such beautiful practice. Thank you. Thank you, Patricia, for joining and practicing. You can type in chat your reflections. As always, if it's just type to me, I will only say, read the reflection, not your say your name. It's type to everyone, I'll read the whole thing. You can also raise your hands, especially if you haven't shared your reflection in a while. What did you discover? Was there a sense of nobility, a sense of opening up as if, oh, there is empowerment, there's beauty, there's grace, there's, I can endure. How much more here did it unearth abilities that you didn't realize you had? Yeah, question comes up from Casey, what if one is overwhelmed with constant suffering and is tired? Yeah, so the overwhelm is probably happening because of the fatigue, because of being tired and different, different possibilities. One is to come back to the body, simply mindfulness of the body and holding. And the other actually is this, this practice can bring up more empowerment, more sense of not being overwhelmed by it, it can change the narrative completely, it can change the narrative from feeling overwhelmed, it's too much to actually, wow, as a bodhisattva, here I am. There's so much more that this heart can contain, it can expand our conception, our conceiving. So, hang in there, don't give up on it. Victoria says, happy to be back here, and being part of this beautiful practice. Welcome back, Victoria. I was previously familiar with the phrase, no rain, no flowers, really enjoyed this rendition of this so gracious and delicate. Thank you so much. You are so welcome. Thank you for joining Victoria. No rain, no flowers, I like that also. One more reflection coming in, I had a sense of separating and sitting above the physical and emotional pain I've experienced this week, as we worked through COVID. Wow, so being above it sitting above. So this expansiveness above the physical and emotional. Wow. Thank you. To me, that it sounds from what you wrote it was a beautiful experience of transcendence of, okay, there's so much more here, being in the midst of it, overwhelmed by it, rising above it. Thank you so much for sharing that reflection anonymously. Beautiful. I will pause if any more reflections or questions. Now, we'll save some time on the other end when we come back from small group practice, sharing with each other, and also holding witness for one another in this practice. So as always, we'll start with 15 seconds of silent compassion, empowered for ourselves for each other. And then you can share as little or as much as you'd like with with your small group. And again, taking care of yourself, taking care of each other in compassion, small groups is really where the practice where the rubber meets the road. Such an important opportunity to be present for yourself for each other. Slow down, slow down, slow down and listen to yourself. Slow down and listen to yourself. Slow down and listen to one another. This is profound practice. Open the rooms now. Take care of yourself of each other. Okay. Welcome back everyone. We have a few minutes left for any reflections that came up, especially after discussing, conversing in small groups. Feel free to raise your zoom hand or type in chat. We haven't had any, any verbal comments so yeah, raising your zoom hand would be great. Jerry's physical hand. Let's see Jerry here. You can unmute yourself, Jerry, please. I'm dressed. I know it's crazy. I live in Toronto, but it's so hot and humid here that I had to turn the air conditioning on and I have to wear this coat to say, it doesn't make sense. So that's the nature of living in Canada, at least on the East coast. So what I thought about was just at the end of the small group, this whole like, you know, been raining a lot here and humid, but the grass looks amazing and the flowers look wonderful. And without rain, there's no flowers or without mud, there's no lotus. And I thought without without COVID we wouldn't be a head mat in this particular group. And, you know, that was really quite, I didn't sort of thought about it and maybe someone's already said it, but I was like thinking wow, out of necessity, I was born some beauty. Thank you, Jerry. Yeah. Thank you. So true. And Eileen says in Chad, this was a new perspective for me. Nobility in the face of Dukka. It's different from feeling a second arrow in the heart. Yes, Eileen. Well said. Beautiful. And then she asks about the talk I mentioned the talk on Dharma seed is by Rob Berbea, B-R-B-E-A, a wonderful teacher there and Neil already put it in chat. Thank you, Neil. Nicholas, please. Yeah, it's a, it's practice related. So, you might have to talk a little slower. Yeah, I feel like I've just seen very clearly how much life kind of for me centers on the drama of like, it's my Dukka and I have to get rid of it, and I have to figure it out and it has to mean something to me and it's, it's really touching I think the nobility is like it was kind of shining on it, you know, it's like it has my cat's fight in the background beautifully. You know, it's just the nobility it just, there's just that feeling of like the heart just shines on it and it doesn't do anything specific it doesn't outsmart it doesn't beat it. It's just, it's just there. It's so noble. So yeah, I'm very grateful for this practice today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Nicholas. I'm grateful to you for your practice today, and your nobility in showing up for the benefit of all beings, including the being who's Nicholas. That is a profoundly beautiful reflection and this edition of happy hour. Thank you. And thank you all for showing up for practicing with all our nobility all of our month. As Nicholas beautifully said, nobility can shine, not out, not too outsmart. It just shines. It's just, it can shine and transform. So, thank you all. May all beings, including ourselves be well. All beings, including ourselves. Be free.
