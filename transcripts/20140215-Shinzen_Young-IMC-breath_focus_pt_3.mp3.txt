The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So let's open it up again for any kinds of questions, reports, or
comments that you might have. Feel free.
I've meditated for a little while, and I've been a breath counter.
And until recently, about the last year or so, I've started relaxing that.
After reading your article, that seems to be kind of a suppressive technique
to shut down some of the, or at least push out some of the thoughts that might arise.
Any comments on that?
Okay, so breath counting, is it a suppressive technique?
So by suppressive, we would mean that there is an active intention to stop
something from happening, an active intention, as opposed to some other
possibilities, like maybe something might just stop of its own spontaneously.
Now, ordinarily within the context of mindfulness practice, one does not
intentionally stop something from happening.
However, that is not to say that there's some rule in the cosmos that it's
wrong to do that, and you should never do that.
Different things work for different people at different times.
There are techniques, I don't know if you'd exactly call it suppression,
but there is in Tibet among the approximately 10 to the 9 techniques
known to that culture. That's one billion, okay?
Obviously, I'm just making a point here, okay?
One technique out of a gazillion techniques that are known in the Upaya
skillful means package of that culture.
There is a technique, I don't know if you'd call it suppression of thought,
but it's a sort of suppression of thought.
You're supposed to imagine that whenever a thought comes up, you chop off its
head as soon as it arises.
Yeah, it's really violent, and you do it by making a mantra, not a mantra,
by making a sound that would intimidate the thought, okay?
And the sound is, pah, pah, pah, okay?
Now, you're lopping off its head, and you're like, pah, okay?
However, I did that technique, and it helped in some ways, okay?
Now, one might say that's a suppressive technique.
However, it might work.
So, it's not like, oh, there's something fundamentally wrong for all people at
all times and all places to suppress thought, okay?
And in fact, if you're dealing with certain negative thoughts, maybe that's
the best you can do, okay?
So, first, let's say, hey, there might be occasions where it's okay to
suppress thought.
However, a breath counting technique, I would not say is per se a suppression
of the thoughts.
So, what is a breath counting technique?
Well, now we get down to my favorite topic, which is this is to make finer and
more and more careful distinctions.
In fact, there's a number of ways of going about a breath counting technique.
You could say that your main object is the physical sensation, and you're just
using the count to sort of in the background help you keep track of things.
In that case, it's actually not terribly different from what we've been doing
here so far.
However, a person might say, well, actually, I'm going to focus on two things.
I'm going to focus on the sensation of the breathing, and I'm going to also
listen carefully to the count in talk space.
In that case, now the count has become a kind of numeric mantra.
And your object is rather large. It has a somatic component and an auditory component.
Now, I used to, for myself, do breath practice where I would try to listen to the
mantra of the numbers, really hear them, like clearly in talk space.
I would focus on the body, and I would try to visualize the numbers in my mental
talk space, I mean in my mental image space, and I was trying to engage all
three fundamental modalities, visual, auditory, and somatic.
Now, that's done in Vajrayana practice, not with the breath, but with a lot of things.
In fact, actually they do. That's right. There's a mantra, there's a visualization,
then there's the breath.
So that could be a breath counting practice.
So it sort of depends on all of these sort of come under that category.
But none of them are necessarily, quote, suppressive.
And sort of this was everything I just said so far is a sort of preamble to the
main point, which is selectively attending to X does not imply that you're in any
way suppressing Y and Z.
So if you selectively attend to a mantra and give permission for other mental
talk to just be there, you're not suppressing that mental talk, you're
selectively attending to something.
So from that perspective, it's not necessarily a suppressive practice.
So the question, as a general principle personally, even though I did that
Tibetan chop off the head thing, that's not my style to in general encourage
someone to suppress anything because equanimity is sort of the non-suppression
of things.
But when people, but people frequently come to me and are worried, am I suppressing
either because the phenomenon stops happening or I don't know, they're just
worried.
So I always ask a standard question.
Well, are you intentionally trying to make Y and Z stop when you selectively attend
to X?
If they say yes, then actually that is suppression.
They're intentionally trying to do it.
If they say no, it just stops of its own or no, I'm not trying to do that, then
that's not suppressing.
It's selective attention.
So I would say that's maybe a useful distinction for you.
In general, whatever works, I do have, I have my official definition, which you
can quote me on, on the best way to meditate.
The best way to meditate is the way that works.
And different things are going to work for different people at different times.
Now, the next obvious question is, well, what do you mean by works?
And what I mean by that is not so much a concern with regards to what your
experience is when you're on the cushion.
But more my criterion for, or criteria for our practices working is to look at the
impact on daily life.
People typically look at their experience, their cushion experience to say, oh,
this technique is working, this technique isn't working.
But for me, I encourage people not to be so concerned with that, but look at daily
life.
Have you noticed one or a combination of the following five, a reduction of
suffering while you're bopping around in the world, physical and or emotional, an
elevation of fulfillment, greater understanding of yourself, maybe at the
psychological level, but maybe at more general structural or even spiritual
level, better self understanding.
Have there been positive behavior changes in the objective world?
Is there a rising, a spontaneous spirit of love and service?
If you can answer a confident yes to even one of those, any one or combination, and
you can ascribe it to your practice, then the practice is, quote, working.
So that's how I would respond to that.
In the article, you touched on scientific measurement of the effect of
meditation, didn't you?
I probably mentioned that.
And then you're talking about looking at ways of seeing is meditation working.
I wanted to ask about motivation.
Are you saying people should meditate in order to get something?
Or what kind of thing?
When I was in Japan, the teacher there was very into this thing of if you're
meditating, you should be knowing why.
And it doesn't seem like you're touching on that.
I was wondering what you think about it.
This is a deep and involved conversation.
So, the Buddha called what we're doing here, ariya-paryesana,
which in Pali means the noble quest.
So it does sound like we're looking for something from that perspective.
You go on a quest, you're looking for the holy grail.
On the other hand, there's this great book by a modern and very enlightened Hindu
master, or someone at least working within more the Hindu, not the Buddhist,
but the Hindu tradition, Papaji.
And the name of the book is Call Off the Search.
Rinzai Zen masters will tell you, perhaps, that there are exactly
1,750 koans, and you have to pass every single one of them,
and each one is an attainment, and then you're enlightened.
Soto Zen masters will say you're already enlightened, just sit,
and don't sit to get there, sit to express the fact you're already there.
The Catholic Church says that the beatific vision, if you want to attain it
in this life, comes about through a combination of effort and surrendering
effort, grace.
The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church,
about 1,000 years separated, somewhat based on the controversy of how much
role should be given to effort versus how much role should be given to giving
up effort.
The Protestant denominations completely separated from the Catholics
when Martin Luther decided that meditation doesn't work.
He was a failed monk, basically, and he was an Augustinian monk,
and he tried to meditate, and he noticed that he couldn't.
We've noticed that also.
But his response was very interesting.
He says, well, the problem is because I'm trying.
So I have to completely just rely on God's grace because I can't do this
myself, and even the attempt to do it.
OK, so why do I bring up all of these historical precedents?
Clearly, there has been a lot of controversy as to the relative roles
of having goals versus giving up goals, and clearly deeply enlightened
masters have come down strongly on one side or the other.
What does that tell us?
What that tells me is that there's something in this practice about
bearing down, and there's something in this practice about easing up,
and there's something in this practice about, hey, you can do it,
and there's another aspect of this practice that says let go of all
intentions and goals, and that it is undeniable that this practice is
a dialectical process that involves both.
And one teacher will come down strongly on one side.
One teacher might come down on another.
Because they've had their own experience of the problems that come
about if you try the other way of doing it.
But then it's like hugely confusing to students.
So that's one thing I would say about that issue.
I want to say something more.
In my experience of sitting with different teachers,
sometimes the goal is what people are talking about.
Do you sit in order to get along with your in-laws better?
Is that a good reason to do it?
I'm not trying to give you a hard time.
I just think this has played a major role in my practice.
Yes.
Is this okay to have that as a goal?
You're measuring things scientifically, and then there are different things.
I think what I feel is a lot of people when they're sitting,
something gets better.
They get along with the people at work,
or they can not get upset about things so quickly.
And that's good.
I don't think that's bad at all.
I think it's terrific.
But is that okay to be sitting in order to do those things?
Well, there's actually two sides to that question.
The first side is, I think I addressed,
which is some people would say you shouldn't have any goal at all.
So there's that.
But I think the question you're asking is a little different,
which is, is it okay if that's your only goal,
as opposed to some other goals that might be more spiritual
or altruistic and so forth?
I think that's the question you're asking.
Well, that's a very interesting question.
The way I like to address this is by talking about
what in the Buddhist tradition is called upaya.
Now upaya is often translated as skillful means,
but I think a much better translation would be approach.
How do you approach people?
How do you make this relevant to people?
So usually J-Random public is not particularly interested
in the notion of gaining insight into the impermanent suffering
and empty nature of self.
That's not exactly relevant to the needs of the average person,
but they might have physical pain
or they might have an anger management issue.
You know, the things I'm talking about.
They might want to improve their tennis game.
They might want to, whatever.
Well, guess what?
Mindfulness practice can achieve that.
So what do we say?
Well, yeah, mindfulness practice can achieve that,
but I'm not going to teach you if that's all you're interested in
because that's a very limited perspective.
There are people who say that.
That's right.
I mean, if they come, they say, you know, you're not really doing this.
Please go away.
Yes, that's East and West.
There are people that say that.
So that's one possibility.
Another possibility is to say, absolutely,
that's what we're going to do.
We're going to help you exactly with what you want.
But I'm going to also point out to you
how you can use this for other stuff.
Okay?
Now what are you doing?
You're not saying it's wrong just to want that right now,
but you are also informing them that they're learning generic skills
that have wider applications.
And by merely informing them, you are already transforming them
because now their interest may still just be in pain management
or whatever for a while.
But now they know that the very same techniques
and the very same skills that they're learning for this
can be applied to behavior changes
or to being a more loving person, et cetera.
The dots have been connected
between the focus technique that they're doing for their pain
and all aspects of human improvement.
The dots have been connected conceptually.
And then you just leave the rest of time.
That's my approach.
Because sooner or later, people are going to want to start to apply this
more broadly in their life.
You think so?
For sure?
I think so.
Really?
I'm asking.
I think that's going to be a general tendency.
Because things are going to come up.
And when they come up, if you know that you can apply this technique to it,
then that's going to foster that.
So I would definitely, myself personally,
come down very strongly on the notion of teaching this force
absolutely secular goals to very secular people.
We're playing a numbers game here.
It's a statistical forces that are important.
If you average over large numbers of people and long periods of time,
if people, number one, have these techniques,
and number two are continually reminded how they can be used broadly,
there's going to be a tendency over time in large numbers of people
for them to be used broadly.
We have something over here.
So the question I asked previously that you wanted to bring to the group was,
if there's an arising of an emotion or a thought,
do you choose to deconstruct it or you use the equanimity function?
So how does choice come into choosing which approach?
Yes.
So the question is, okay, I'm focusing on the breath
and all this other stuff is going on and it's pretty rich,
perhaps impactful.
Should I background equanimize it and just keep coming back to the breath?
Or should I turn my attention towards it and deconstruct it?
And I wonder if anybody could guess what I'm going to say
because I get asked this question a lot and if you've ever listened to me,
you've probably heard me ask this, someone asked me this question.
I wonder if anyone can guess what I'm going to say
or remembers what I likely say under these circumstances.
In fact, yes to all of the above, but what I actually say is it depends
and depends on what.
It depends on what your focus technique is.
There are many, many focus techniques available from the contemporary traditions of the world.
Each focus technique has a well-defined range of experience
that it has you concentrate on and then you ignore everything else.
So if your teacher or the tradition you're working in says,
we're going to just go the entire path to enlightenment on the breath,
that's what we're doing.
It's going to be all breath all the way.
Then you background to equanimize that stuff
and you never actually turn your attention towards it.
If that is your technique.
One possibility is my technique is breath and breath only
and I'm going to ride that all the way to nirvana.
Not joking by the way.
So that's one possibility.
Another possibility is that your technique actually isn't the breath.
Your technique is any and all sensory experience.
So it's not limited to the breath.
Or your technique is any and all body experience,
but not limited to the breath.
Or your technique is a technique that I call focus in,
like I say if you read my five ways to know yourself manually,
it's described in there.
In that technique, your focus range is mental image,
mental talk, and the emotional body, the core self.
That's a very deconstructive technique.
So in Sanskrit and Pali, there's this word gochara.
And go means from gao and gao sounds like cow and that's not a coincidence.
Chara means to go.
So gochara is a pasture.
It's the fenced area where the cow is allowed to go,
but can't go any further.
So gochara means your object, your focus range,
the things that are within your defined object of focus.
So the answer to your question is it depends on what your gochara is.
But the other word for gochara, there's a really cool word, karma stana,
kammatana in Pali.
It means your workstation, your karma stana, your karma stand,
your workplace.
So it means the same as gochara.
It's like what is my focus range?
Whenever you sit down and do any technique,
you want to be crystal clear what is the range of sensory experience
that you're attempting to be mindful of.
And you constantly come back to that and you bring clarity and concentration
and equanimity to that.
And then there's everything else.
And so the thoughts and emotions are everything else.
One possibility is that you have only one technique,
and if it were to be the breath,
then you would simply ignore all that other stuff for the duration.
Another possibility is that you have more than one technique.
Or so, for example, you like to do the breath,
but you also know how to focus in and deconstruct.
Then you can alternate.
Alternate based on interest, opportunity, and necessity.
Now in my manual, I give you 29 techniques.
Well, that's an awful lot.
And I don't expect people to learn them all,
but they actually make a coherent whole.
They represent an algorithm that loops and branches to optimize your experience.
Depending on windows and walls as they come up,
you actually change the technique to optimize.
Now, the advantage of that is it's very powerful
because you're working with exactly what you need to work with.
But the disadvantage is it can be complex because you have to make decisions.
So the answer to your question is if you only have the breath as your technique
and all this other stuff comes up, then you ignore it.
But you might want to have more than just the breath as your technique.
And that would then give you the option to do what I would consider actually
to be the more classic vipassana practice.
The more classic vipassana practice is a broader deconstruction of the mind-body experience.
Based on the five skandhas, the four foundations, the four great elements,
or my system, the three subjective elements.
So is that enough of an answer to your question?
Basically, the breath practice will either work,
and now you know what I mean by work,
or it doesn't.
If it doesn't, there's a reason why.
The reason why might be that the breath practice is only for you a concentration practice
and is not developing in a strong way the clarity and equanimity components.
Well, we already talked about concentration, right?
Your attention wanders, you bring it back, that's how it develops concentration.
That total acceptance of all the other stuff happening in the background,
that's your equanimity piece.
And when we come back after the lunch break,
I'm going to show you how to bring clarity into the breath practice.
So take a home message for this workshop,
and it's the take-home message for every focus on breath workshop that I do.
I just did one in LA last week.
It was exactly the same take-home message, take-away message,
which is the breath practice either works or it doesn't.
Work means it produces one or a combination of the things I said
and it's accelerating the so.
If that's not the case, then there's a reason it's not working.
One reason would be that it's only a concentration practice
and there's not an explicit component of sensory clarity and equanimity.
So it's not deconstructive enough to take you beyond time, space, self, and world.
So one solution, if it's not working or it's not working fast enough,
one solution is intentionally bring in the clarity and equanimity pieces
so that you actually have a mindfulness of the breath
as opposed to merely a concentration or a calming practice based on the breath.
That's one fix.
The other fix is broaden the focus to something more like
what's actually described in the Buddhist scriptures,
which is breaking the sense of the self down into its components
so that you get insight into anicca, dukkha, natta, and so forth.
Like I say, the right way to meditate according to me is the way that works.
So like it or not, there are options.
But that's good because then everyone can find what works.
So once again, just to repeat what's the take home message.
So I like to define mindfulness as concentration, power, sensory clarity, and equanimity working together.
If there's going to be a cul-de-sac with the breath,
probably because it's just a concentration practice and just a calming practice.
And there's not enough clarity to gain, not enough sensory clarity that you gain liberating insights.
And there's not enough taste of equanimity so that you can actually sense that blockages are being released.
So one fix is, well, bring in the clarity so that you get the liberating insights
and start to actually taste the sacrifice that you're making by letting go of everything other than the breath,
which is essentially letting go of everything.
So you bring in, in an intentional way, the clarity and the equanimity piece.
And then that might be what needs to be done and then you can ride the breath to nirvana.
Alternatively, if that doesn't work or that's not of interest to you,
then you broaden your focus to include other things that allow you to get the insight and purification flavors.
Perhaps by deconstructing selfhood, which, as I say, is actually the core insight in the classic text.
But you see, you can deconstruct the self in the world just on the tip of your nose.
If you bring enough clarity, that sensation is going to, quote, break up into impermanence.
And then it's going to pull everything else with it back to the source.
Say what?
Amen.
Actually, in our parts of the world, we say swaha.
It means exactly the same thing in swaha.
You don't know that one.
That's amen in Sanskrit.
Or sadhu.
Sadhu, sadhu, yeah.
Okay, let's do it.
Oh, not necessarily all of it, but whatever we can do in the next 20 minutes.
Once again, take a moment to stretch up and settle in.
And once again, bring your attention to the breath.
However you wish to focus on that.
If the attention wanders, gently return.
Each time you do so, you're exercising your concentration muscles.
At the same time, allow for all the other stuff to expand and contract to come and go in the background.
All the other mind and body experiences, the sights and the sounds.
That's all okay.
But your selective attention is going towards the breath.
But your equanimity encompasses everything.
And with regards to that breath sensation, try to detect as much detail as you can.
That's your sensory clarity piece.
