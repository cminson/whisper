 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, so welcome. Welcome to you all. Good morning, afternoon, wherever you are. Yes, so my name is Matthew Brent Silver and happy to be with you today. Gil asked me to step in for this week as he is away teaching a retreat. And so we'll sit and I'll offer some reflections after that. As we begin, I just looked to see what Gil had done on Friday. He was talking about two bodies, the body of which we're aware, the body which we're not aware of, the thinking mind that is aware and not aware. And yeah, so we settle into awareness. We just kind of, just as we begin, subtle but enormous difference just to bathe the circuits of body and mind in awareness. So just settle in in this way. Thank you. Thank you. So we relax whatever can be relaxed. The area around the eyes of the jaw. Shoulders are the belly. Relax our hands. And open the hands energetically. Relax whatever can be relaxed and any tension that remains we permit to remain. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For your awareness, you can't stop. Thank you. Thank you. Part of practice is directing our attention. Why is attention appropriate attention. So we directed to the breath or the body to feeling or sound. Sometimes in our choreography of the attention, we miss this dimension of awareness that we don't hold up and we can't stop. That which doesn't require your effort to arise. Whatever can't be stopped just rest there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. suffering typically requires that our attention be glued to something that we be identified with something. So we start to discover that whatever is the case, whatever our life is in this moment when we are aware, awake, something else is always also true. This space, this space makes all the difference, subtle but also dramatic. Just to know one's life as winds blowing through the space of awareness. You you you you you you you you you you you you...... All the familiar ground from which we strategize and fret, is just folded into awareness. We just keep folding our life into awareness.............................................................................................................
