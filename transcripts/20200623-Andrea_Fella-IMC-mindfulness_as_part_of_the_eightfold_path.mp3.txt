The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So in the before coronavirus time, at this class, at this time, I had been
offering kind of a series along series on the fornable truths in the Eightfold
Path and had gotten through fairly well through right effort. I mean you don't
ever get through these things, but and I just thought, you know, I was kind of
inspired to pick up that kind of exploration and in particular, you
know, how these teachings are not irrelevant in this time in our
world. I've had some people ask this kind of question, you know, like how does
being aware in my daily life, you know, how does this do anything for the bigger
problems of the world? And so continuing in right now, I thought I'd start with a
reflection on mindfulness in the Eightfold Path, because that's kind of
where I'd gotten to is mindfulness. And so, you know, how does mindfulness
support us in this time as part of the Eightfold Path? So that's my
intention kind of going forward in this in this session is to kind of just the
way I do this or have done this in the past is to just reflect for a period of
time each week and then there's a little bit of discussion conversation
and I just get as far as I do and then the next week it picks up and I do kind
of collect these into a series so that they're available together. But I try to
make each teaching accessible whether you've heard the others or not. So
mindfulness is part of the Eightfold Path. You know, just to reflect on the
purpose basically, the direction. As a path, I mean, the Buddhist teachings are
often talked of as a path and that they're not a meandering path, they're a
path that leads in a particular direction. So there's an aim, a purpose, a
direction to that path. And so mindfulness in that path is a part of that
direction. And that direction is leading towards understanding suffering so that
that suffering can be so that suffering can be released. And the suffering, this
suffering is all suffering, not only our own personal suffering, but also the
suffering of the world. The Buddha talked about how do we meet all
suffering. The end of suffering, I think, I mean, the end of suffering in the larger
sense of the collective or the larger world end of suffering, I think we'll
only happen when we all have that transformation internally. But that
doesn't mean it's not worth doing that work. Because the patterns, the
habits that lead to the systemic, the suffering of the world, the suffering of
racism, the suffering of oppression, the suffering of poverty, the suffering of
illness, and all of the kinds of suffering that we experience, both in the
larger sense and in our own individual ways, they're based, the suffering that
the Buddha talked about that could be ending, is based in patterns or systems
or habits of greed, aversion, and delusion. And so this is the linchpin,
essentially, that he talked about. He didn't say that, you know, cancer would
end or, you know, illness would end with the ending of suffering in this way. But
the suffering that what we typically call suffering, I mean, what we what we
typically call suffering is related to pain, often. It's related to not having
what we like, not getting rid of what we don't like, and so the that the often we
attribute the suffering to the unpleasantness of the world, of having an
illness or not getting what I like. But the Buddha talked about the patterns of
greed, aversion, and delusion, being kind of the linchpin of how our suffering is
put together and much of the external suffering in the world. Not not all the
illness, for instance, although I'm seeing some some descriptions of how the
coronavirus has been, you know, unleashed on our on our world through the way the
conditions in which the way humans have interacted with the world, the the
destroying of ecosystems, and the way in which we've treated animals in in in
our food source. And so the, you know, it's not it's not separate from, you know,
even illness isn't necessarily separate from the conditions in our mind of
greed, aversion, and delusion. But the Buddha did say that not everything that
was unpleasant or painful was a result of the patterning of the habits of
greed, aversion, and delusion. And so the the the path, the direction of the path
is towards understanding how greed, aversion, and delusion condition us. The
the the, you know, often I think when people think about mindfulness, you know,
it's so broadly, it's so broadly out there in the world, the word mindfulness,
and you know, there are these people who teach being mindful kind of kind of more
like, oh, be in the present moment, you know, just be in the present moment. And
mindfulness isn't just about being in the present moment. It is about being in
the present moment, but not just about being in the present moment, because
there is an aim towards being in the present moment. Sometimes when I hear,
hear that, you know, the people, people talk about or teach, you know, being in
the present moment, enjoy taking a walk, enjoy eating that ice cream cone. You
know, I feel like it's really minimizing what the power of mindfulness is. It's
kind of like pointing mindfulness to, oh, be mindful, and you'll enjoy things
more. And there is a way in which that happens, you know, it's kind of amazing
when we do enter into this world of being in the present moment. Sometimes we do
find the delight of the small things, but it's not the purpose of the path to
find the delight in the small things. The purpose of the path is really to
understand how our minds get caught in suffering, how our minds get caught by
these habits and patterns of great aversion and delusion. And this is a
system at work. You know, this is, we often in, in the mindfulness teachings, we
often talk about being mindful internally and being aware of, you know, what's
happening internally. And as I talked about in the guided meditation, you know,
as we are aware of what's here, what's obvious, we are kind of witnessing what,
how conditioning is unfolding for us. When we don't direct the attention, but
instead just watch what's obvious in our experience, we are watching our
conditioning unfold. And as the mindfulness gets stronger and more
continuous, we start to see, you know, when our attention is pulled somewhere,
you know, when something arises, that's obvious, there's a reason that that's
happening. It's not just some random thing. There is a condition for that.
There's, there's whole history of our conditioning, of our lives that have in
this very moment supported the arising of that thought and that emotion or, or that
physical experience and that relationship to that physical experience. We are
seeing our conditioning unfold. And this is a piece of the, the making
mindfulness or having mindfulness be something more than just, you know,
touching into being with our pleasant experience or, you know, touching into
more pleasantness in our lives. This seeing how conditioning is unfolding is a
kind of a key to understanding how our minds get caught, the systems, the
patterning of greed, aversion, and delusion. And we all have it. It's not,
it's not some kind of, you know, personal failing to have greed, aversion, and
delusion. This is the nature of the way the conditioning has worked. And this,
we, we are conditioned to want to get things that we like, to want to get rid
of things that we don't like, partly through our human system, you know,
partly because our, you know, our, our, our, you know, we, we kind of like to
feel good. We like to have pleasant things, you know, that our, our, even an
amoeba is kind of like designed to gravitate towards pleasant and away
from unpleasant. And so there's a kind of a way in which our system is designed
that way. And yet the, the kind of the way in which that's been reinforced in
our, in our conditioning is, there's so many threads going in my mind right
now. So the way that's been reinforced in our conditioning is that, you know, I'm
not okay if I don't get what I like. There's some problem with that. And also,
you know, an amoeba doesn't actually have a choice. It's, it's more automatic. You
know, a single-celled creature doesn't have a choice. It's more automatic. And in
our, in our kind of upbringing, in, in the way in which we have habitually
engaged with pleasant and unpleasant and wanting to get what we like and wanting
to get what we don't, you get rid of what we don't like, the way we've
habitually engaged with that, we do get a little bit of kind of pleasant
experience when, when something, when we get something pleasant, you know, it's
like, yeah, that feels pretty good. And we get a little bit of a little bit of a
feeling of, oh, figured it out. Oh, can control things. You know, so there's a
little bit of that ease or release, but it doesn't last very long. And so we kind
of end up on this cycle or this spiral of trying to do that again, because
that's the last time I felt pretty good when I got something I wanted or got
rid of something that I didn't want. And we don't often take a step back to
understand the bigger picture, which is actually that spiral of having to get
what I want, needing to get rid of what I don't want in order to find happiness,
is itself a kind of attention and tightness and is itself kind of a
suffering. And so the, the, you know, that, that patterning is a, it's a kind of a
human pattern. It is kind of a human thing that's in our organism. And yet
there are ways in which that human pattern then gets replicated in our systems
of culture and society. You know, that, that, that, you know, the, the whole, you
know, the whole advertising kind of scheme in the US of, of the way things,
products are advertised. You know, get this thing that you want and you'll have a
beautiful face and you'll, you know, have people that love you and, you know,
it's like the whole advertising scheme is based on this pattern. And so it
reinforces it. So there is a way in which our human system is kind of inclined
towards this, you know, get what I want, I'll be okay, get rid of what I don't want,
I'll be okay. But it is also reinforced and, and kind of cemented in a way the
views about that, that's the way towards happiness are cemented by our culture and
our society and the patterns in the systems that are around us. And so the,
the, the conditioning that we can start to see with mindfulness is not only the
conditioning of our organism, kind of the way in which we're kind of like, yep,
get that. Oh, oh, oh, don't like that, you know, kind of the way in which there's
this push-pull. But also we start to see the views and the beliefs that are kind
of given to us by our culture about what's right, what's wrong, what's good,
what's bad. And this includes all of the beliefs and views around, around all of
the discrimination and oppression that happens in our world. This includes
beliefs and views around racism and homophobia and beliefs that somebody
who's poor is not working hard enough or, you know, all of the, all of the systems
that are, that are in the world, those views, those beliefs, those aren't often
taught to us in conscious language, but they are kind of absorbed based on how
people act with each other, how people are with each other. And so this is a
piece of our conditioning. And it's a very important piece to recognize. And so
that, that, that kind of that external patterning, that external, those external
systems at play reinforce the internal movements to do, you know, what, to get
what I want, to get rid of what I don't want, to be confused about what's an
actual, what suffering actually is, actually. That's, that's part of the
confusion. We think suffering is not having what I, what I want, but the, the
suffering is actually more connected to the wanting, the contraction around the
wanting, the contraction around the aversion. And there's the views that
are at play that hold those patterns into place. So mindfulness, you know,
right mindfulness is about, you know, the curiosity, the, the, the right
mindfulness and the Satipatanasuta, the kind of basic definition of it is to be
aware of the body as a body, to be aware of feelings as feelings, to be aware of
mind states as mind states, to be aware of experience as experience, essentially.
And this is a, is a pointing to what I said, you know, being aware of your
experience as human experience. This, this kind of curiosity, interest in being
aware from this perspective helps us to kind of take a step back from it's all
about me and be more curious about, well, this is what's arising, these
sensations in the body, these feelings are arising, these emotions, these moods
are arising. And as we, we explore things from that perspective, again, we start to
see with a more continuity of mindfulness, we start to see how are these moods,
mind states, sensations in the body feelings, how are they conditioned? Where
are they arising from? And some of them are arising from these views, these
perspectives, these beliefs that have been given to us. And so this, I'll just say
one, a couple more things, and then open it for conversation, and I want to keep
these reflections a little on the short side.
So the, the witnessing of our own internal patterns of greed, aversion, and
delusion, as we see that, and that's the only, that's what we can see, you know,
it's like, we can also see, the Buddha does also in the Satipatanasuta talk
about observing externally, and so we can also see externally how these patterns
play out. There is less ability, although that, you know, the kind of like what
happens in this, it's, it's like a cycle, right? It's like there's a cycle of the
the patterns of the systems, let's say, of greed, aversion, and delusion. There's
whole systems of this at play in our, in our internal experience, but also in
how internally and externally we interact. The, the systems of greed, aversion, and
delusion that we internalize, then we start to act out on, we believe, we engage
with, we reinforce by believing that this is the way toward, this is what's, how
we're supposed to engage, this is how we're supposed to act, this is how we're
supposed to be in the world, and so we reinforce those things through our own
actions, our own choices, our own decisions. And that, in turn, re-emphasizes or, or
kind of cements more the patterns in the world. And so it's, it's not only, and I
was thinking this morning about dependent origination, kind of often talked
about it as describing how suffering arises moment to moment internally in
our experience, but also thinking that it possibly can be explored as, you know,
where do these mental formations come from that shape our minds? Well, they, they
don't only just arise in a vacuum internally, they arise in relationship to
our culture. And so the, the, the systems of greed, aversion, and delusion that are
at play in the world, that we just simply often unwittingly reinforce by acting on
them, by not seeing the greed, aversion, delusion in our own hearts and minds. That
cycle continues. And so how can we stop that cycle? By not, by being aware of the
greed, aversion, and delusion in our own hearts and minds, and recognizing the
suffering that it is creating internally and externally, and shifting our
relationship, changing our patterns of behavior no longer at times, hopefully,
and that's certainly not until, until that's, that patterning is completely
released internally, we'll still probably continue to act out of some of those
patterns. But the less that we do that, the less that it does support those
patterns externally. And actually, it not only doesn't support those patterns, you
know, the habitual patterns of greed, aversion, and delusion in our, the
systems in our, in our societies and culture, but, but the change, our own
shift from acting from greed, aversion, and delusion to acting from love and
compassion and wisdom, and patience, that shift creates its own ripples in the
world, creates new patterning in the world. And so this, I do think that this,
these teachings in particular, you know, being mindful, being aware from this
perspective of curiosity, what is this human experience? Because as we ask that
question and explore what is our human experience, we begin to understand the,
that, that greed, aversion, and delusion, mind states based in greed, aversion,
and delusion, and there are thousands of them, irritation, annoyance, pride,
arrogance, wanting, confusion, there's so, there's, there's thousands of them,
these emotions based in greed, aversion, and delusion, that as we open to those
with mindfulness, we see that, that is painful, not only internally, but that it
results in engagement in the world, that puts pain into the world. And so we see
both internally and externally, this awareness of the habits, the patterns of
conditioning, helps the mind to, to kind of, at a certain point say, the mind
begins to say, wisdom begins to encourage us to not act out of those things, and to
act in another direction, to act more from kindness and compassion and love and
wisdom. So I think that this, I guess the last piece I want to say is that, changing
ourselves, changing our minds, finding inner peace, inner freedom from these
patterns of greed, aversion, and delusion, it's not independent of the world. That,
that freedom internally does have a ripple effect externally. And I do think
that the, the awareness of these systems, these patterns internally, kind of like
seeing how, you know, it's like everything inside of us, or much, much of what's
inside of us has been absorbed from the patterns and systems of the world. And a
way to begin to change those patterns and systems is to release that internally. And
yet it, I think it's also, you know, not necessarily the only, the only thing, you
know, that can support changing those systems. It's, I think, one very powerful,
one very powerful tool. Our own inner transformation does feel necessary to
support the transformation of the world. And there are other forms of helping
people to understand that conditioning. Protests and education, you know, helping
people to writing books and offering, you know, podcasts on people's experience,
you know, that these things too can be very powerful to, to help us to understand
that conditioning. And sometimes some of that is in some ways necessary to help
us see the inner kind of patterns that have come to be. You know, to hear something
of others' experience and the ways in which, you know, the delusion that's
involved here in, in these systems of greed, aversion and delusion. Delusion is
at the base of it. And it is hard to see delusion. And so sometimes as, you know,
the, not only seeing things internally, but hearing some information about how
those systems are at play can help us to see how we have been unwittingly
participating in them. So the right mindfulness in the Eightfold Path is
informed by this perspective of wanting to understand suffering. That's the work
of right mindfulness is to understand suffering. The understanding comes from
witnessing the patterns at play in our own minds, seeing how they're conditioned.
Not from seeing it happening and saying, oh, I shouldn't experience that. Let me
stop feeling greed right now. Let me stop feeling aversion right now, but rather
to open to the suffering or the pain of that pattern. And then the, because our
system, our organism wants to move in the direction of well-being, seeing that
will begin to allow the mind to want to let go of that direction, of acting out
of greed, aversion and delusion. It's a slow process. It is a slow process. And yet
I do think it is a fundamental piece of, it is, it is the fundamental piece in
terms of our own awakening, in terms of our own understanding internally. And I
think it is a fundamental piece in terms of supporting the world to change the
systems that are based in greed, aversion and delusion. So those were some of my
reflections on mindfulness as part of the Eightfold Path.
