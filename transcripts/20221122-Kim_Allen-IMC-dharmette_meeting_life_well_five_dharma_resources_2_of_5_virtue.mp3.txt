 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. Okay, so this week the theme is called Meeting Life Well, Five Dharma Resources. And this is to meet life well both on and off the cushion. So we're talking about five qualities upon which the heart draws in order to meet situations, whether they are dukkha type situations, challenging, suffering, or whether they're what's called nusukha, the opposite, tsukha type situations of happiness or ease or appreciation. And today we are moving on to the second one, which is virtue or ethical conduct. You can choose the term within that realm that works for you. The Pali word is sila, sila. And there's some classical language around this from the suttas. So I'll just read it. The Buddha says here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. So you can recognize these as I think the I think you can recognize them as the classical language of the five precepts of not killing, not stealing, not sexual misconduct, not lying, not intoxicating the mind or the body. So typically lay people would try to live by these principles. It's an interesting question though, why, why we are following the precepts, or some kind of ethical conduct in the world. And, you know, some people do so I think without too much reflection or experiential understanding of what is going on with virtue or sila. And in cases like that, you know, it's just following rules then. So the encouragement we have here is to view sila as a practice and to actually investigate what is going on. And, you know, I'm sure at a top level we all can see that it feels better and goes better in our life when we engage in these kinds of behaviors. But there's even more to discover if we investigate what's going on with living by these particular actions. And it might be that until we do some kind of investigation and practice in a formal sense with virtue. It may not go deeply enough into the heart to serve as what I'm calling a Dharma resource this week, which means something that we can rely on to come forth when we meet the world, especially if we meet a challenging situation. We want that sense of virtue and understanding of ethical conduct to be rooted deeply enough that it's just what comes for. So what happens when we do some investigation. One thing that we'll discover is that acting ethically is more compatible with mindfulness than acting unethically wholesomeness is pretty easily compatible with awareness, whereas unwholesomeness has a way of obscuring the mind in a certain way. You can check this for yourself. Let's consider just the area of wise speech, for example. So the precept, in particular only mentions false speech, but there are expanded descriptions in other areas of the suttas, and they expand the description of unwise speech to include speech that is false, but also that's divisive or that's harsh, or that's meaningless. It's translated as gossip, but I think it goes beyond that. So we'll discover for ourselves, we can just observe that when we're speaking well, it's pretty easy to stay in attention and to stay grounded in the body, and to be relaxed, and to be focused on the person that you're speaking to. And that is when we're speaking unwisely, you know, we're lying at that moment or we're speaking harshly or not really paying attention. Then our inner vision literally gets kind of occluded in the mind, narrows in and we don't, we actually don't focus as well on the other person. I've noticed that when I've been in situations of somewhat tension with somebody else, if I allow myself to get sucked into a sense of aversion or defensiveness, I literally feel my attention sort of drawing down and I'm not as connected with the other person. This is the effect of actually an unwholesome pattern in my mind. It has this impact. So, most of us have a mindfulness practice, if we're sitting here in the mornings, so that means that we value mindfulness in our life. That's something that we're trying to cultivate. So in that case, it would make sense that we would also be strengthening virtue in order to support our ability to be aware. You know, when I'm mindful, even if it is a tense situation with someone else, if the mindfulness is strong enough, that in itself is a wholesome quality and I notice that it's easier to be aware and then if I, you know, if I can, in addition, try to say something kind, try to say something honest about how I'm feeling, something like that, the mindfulness stays right there and I can stay in my body. So virtue and mindfulness are very connected. So this is a deeper reason to practice CELA than just following rules or just doing it because teacher says it's a good idea or something. So then another discovery that we can make through investigation is that virtue is a powerful condition for a kind of happiness that endures even when conditions change. So when we're acting and speaking ethically, we experience what's called the bliss of blamelessness in the text. That doesn't mean that we're 100 percent perfect, but at least we know that we were present and we did our best. And so there's no basis for feeling guilt or shame or disappointment in ourselves. And the world really needs people, by the way, who have a genuine positive regard for themselves, not the fake positive of denial or ignoring things, but genuinely possessed of well being and ethics does this for us. So again, we have a deeper reason to practice ethics. We want to support this, let's say, loftier form of happiness that's better than just, just sensual enjoyment. So I want to expand a little bit on this clear link between mindfulness and ethics. One time when I was returning from a trip, I arrived at the airport at night. And at that time I lived close to public transit, and I figured on taking the light rail back to my apartment. And I knew that at night, the trains only ran about, they ran every 30 minutes. And when I arrived at the station the train was there. And so I hopped on before the doors closed so I wouldn't have to wait in the station for half an hour at night. But you can't buy tickets on board. And so I was riding without a ticket. And I noticed that I felt some mild anxiety about that during the ride. But I did manage to get to my station without the ticket person coming to ask for tickets. So in a sense I got away with it. But as I exited the train, I noticed that I still felt some tension, even though the anxiety of getting caught was gone. And so I found myself walking to the ticket machine, buying a ticket, and then throwing it away so that I had bought a ticket for that ride. I didn't think about that I didn't plan it out. It just felt natural as I got off the train so mindfulness pointed me toward that particular action. And I was willing to follow it to follow the kind of situational ethics of the moment, you know, because there was, you know, there's no one making me do that. So meeting life well can mean that when we're not sure what to do, how to manage a complex situation, we can default to whatever develop whatever ability we've developed to serve ethics in the moment. Another British teacher I know calls this serving what is true. So rather than gaming all the nuances and possibilities, just be aware, be clean and how you act or speak, and accept any consequences of that as better than the alternative of not paying attention. So, but what does it mean to be clean and how we act and speak. Often we think it means keeping principles in mind, right I read the five precepts so rules to follow, we have these rules to follow and then we figure out how to apply them, how to follow them. And that's fine that's how we do it, a lot of the time. But in the moment, this might be too slow. We can't take the time to go through the cognitive mind if something is coming right in the moment. So we need something embodied. And it has to be strong enough that it can override any reactive emotions that are coming up like anger, or greed or envy or fear. And so how do we train in that. So one way is to trust this connection between mindfulness and doing the right action or the wise action. And so the idea of Goldstein said it this way, see what you do, or we say see what you say in the case of speech as a way of exploring Selah. So this turns things around sometimes from how we often practice ethics. So, you know what we usually do is start from the principle and try to practice doing it. So we start from the idea of not speaking falsely and then we willfully try to be true truthful. And it can be a little bit forced at times, or not spontaneous enough. So an alternative is to simply speak as we normally do, but be very clear and precise with mindfulness as we do it. And if we start straying into speech that doesn't align with the situation that we're in, we'll feel it, because we're being mindful. For example, if we're listening to a friend talk about a workshop that they attended and we get excited because we've also attended a program on the same topic. And then we leap in and we start telling about our knowledge and experience. You know, we might have assumed that our intention was wholesome to connect and say something meaningful with our friend, but we can feel in the moment that what we're really doing is asserting our own knowledge. You know, the ego has crept in. They're saying they did this workshop and we say, Oh, I know about that too. And it's not quite, you know, it's not quite. It's okay, but it's not quite in tune. So we can feel that if we're mindful. So feeling in our body and mind can be more powerful than if we had controlled our speech from a cognitive place. This is something from Ken McLeod, who's a teacher in the Tibetan tradition. Many people try very hard to always say the right thing. There is a common misperception that we can know how to say the right thing, that we can have it in mind. And then when we speak, the words will come out correctly. This is the common idea of right speech. And most of us fail at it over and over again. The words don't come out as we thought they would. Or if they do, the tone of voice is wrong or something else happens. It rarely goes as we planned. That's the point. We cannot plan the future. We cannot plan our speech any more than we can plan our next thought. How then are we to practice right speech? The most effective effort is to listen to ourselves as we are talking. This effort brings attention to our speech. When we do this, we will hear when what we say doesn't fit the situation, when it isn't what we intended to say or how we intended to say it. We will hear with our own ears the different emotional patterns that take over our speech. We will hear how what we say doesn't fit with our intention or how it comes out of our confusion. And when we make this effort over and over again, we will find that we begin to speak with attention. This is how we practice right speech. And we can do a similar practice for action, like what I did with the light rail ticket, where I sensed my body moving to the ticket machine to buy the ticket. And I thought, yeah, I could feel in the moment that was a correct action for that moment. So ethics or virtue becomes an inner resource or a form of inner wealth or strength when it's freed from the cognitive mind and its focus on ideas and ideals and abstract principles. Virtue becomes embodied when we meet life with mindfulness and the intention of non-harm and we let actions and speech emerge from that. So it's a training. We won't be skilled in it immediately. But it takes our ethics training to a deeper level of Dharma practice. There's a story from the suttas where the Buddha is speaking with a prince named Prince Abhaya, which means fearless, by the way. And he asked the Buddha whether the Buddha plans the answer to Dharma questions in advance. And the Buddha asks in return whether the prince considers in advance how to respond to questions about the parts of a chariot. And Prince Abhaya says, no, I'm very skilled in the parts of a chariot. And once someone asks me about that, the answer occurs to me on the spot. And the Buddha replies, so too, Prince, when people come to me and pose a question, the answer occurs to the tathagata on the spot. So he's saying that he's understood the Dharma so deeply that he can always come up with an appropriate response. So we may not be quite at that level ourselves, but I would suggest that we can try taking our ethical conduct to this deeper level through experiential practice. And then it will become second nature to speak and act in non-harming ways, even in stressful situations. So then it's become a reliable resource in our heart. So we have confidence and we have ethical conduct as two resources and we'll keep moving on as we go forward. Thank you so much.
