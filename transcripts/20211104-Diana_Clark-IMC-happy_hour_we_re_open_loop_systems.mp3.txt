 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome. It's nice to see you all. And I'm happy that we no longer have Mrs. Zoom kind of announcing that everything's getting recorded. Even though I know you guys all have to click the so you acknowledge that it's being recorded. So today I'd like to talk a little bit about something that I stumbled upon earlier today that I guess all of us know this. I want to be new, but it's just maybe recognizing that it's measurable, quantifiable and maybe even knowing this, knowing about it might influence us. And that is this idea that I guess maybe the formal description is emotional contagion. And I didn't realize this, and maybe some of you know this. Well, we all know that emotions are contagious. Right. If some if you're around somebody who's really sad, maybe it kind of lowers you. Maybe not to or if someone's really happy or upbeat, you know, that we can feel it. And apparently this some time ago, experiments for them where they would put complete strangers, I guess they would take their emotional state as well as some physiological measurements, blood pressure, heart rate, maybe respiration rate. I'm not sure. Complete strangers put them together like three people put them together in a room where they face each other and don't speak. And probably these experiments were done before everybody had a little phone in their pocket so they weren't fiddling with their phones either. But I don't it was not very long before everybody's mood kind of like stabilized to be the same mood, as well as some of the physiological measurements, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. Complete strangers, not speaking. So just this recognition that moods are contagious, but also, you know, the scientists have this expression that our neurological system, we might say, our nervous system is an open loop system that is we tend to think that it's closely bright that we have. There's it's entirely within ourselves. But they're saying, no, no, no, it's absolutely has this big part that's dependent on our external environment. If we think about this evolution, I really it makes sense. This is how a parent can sue the child, right? Just because these kind of emotions are contagious and we need we need for that to happen. But then how does this affect how we understand ourselves today and now? Just thinking about loving kindness practice that can be a support recognizing this open loop system and that feelings emotions are contagious. One is can help us have some resilience. If we're in the presence of others whose emotions are not helpful. Let's use that that are kind of their can tinker us, for example, or just irritable or something like this. So they can help us feel a bit more resilient so that we are experiencing that. And maybe I should say also that the emotions that are the easiest to spread. You won't be surprised to learn one is laughter. When people start laughing, right, even if we don't know why they're laughing, we start laughing. But cheerfulness and warmth are easily spread. And irritability, not as much. But depression is was like the least of all to be spread. So loving kindness practice. I was thinking about this thing we've all heard that's attributed to Matt McGondy. Be the change you wish to see in the world. If you wish to see some warmth and some care, some lack of it will lack of hostility. And our communities. We can just show up with some warmth and cheerfulness. And it's also simple that if we were to just fake it, maybe there has to be some authenticity there as well as some alignment or honesty there. But just this recognition that we do affect others and others affect us. And that kindness practice helps us to have some resilience if it's not helpful the way that others are affecting us. And maybe we can help spread some warmth, kindness and goodwill. Sometimes the Buddhists have this expression for the benefit of all beings. And then precisely we could understand it this way, right, that we do this practice, and maybe those we come in contact with, experience it and then those they come in contact with and on and on so on and so on. So emotional contagion. And noticing, recognizing that we are open loop systems. Okay, so with that as a introduction, let's do a little bit of meditation practice, can sink into some warmth, some kindness, not only for our benefit, but for the benefit of all beings, right, those that we come in contact with and, as I said, we spread from there. So, in a meditation posture. And with some warmth, with some care, just checking in, how is this moment, how is this body was the mental frame. An invitation it's all welcome, whatever's happening. We don't have to try to, well maybe having pleasant experiences or whatever's happening. Can we have some welcoming attitude, even if it is unpleasant. Even if it is not what we would prefer. So, a little bit of a body scan to help us get connected to the body, help bring some greater ease. And we're feeling into the face, place where our emotions are often expressed, but also where tension can be held. And then we're going to come up to the eyes on the jaw. Neck, lining the head over the shoulders, the ears over the shoulders, that the neck is not too far leaning forward. And our shoulders, letting the shoulder blades slide down the back, feeling into the upper back and the lower back. And feeling into the chest. Is there a way that the chest can be just a tiny bit more open, maybe the shoulders go back, such a small movement. Somebody looking at you wouldn't even notice. The pressure of the chair, cushion, couch, bed, wherever we're seated, seated. Putting the pressure against the body, the buttocks, the legs, the lower parts of the legs, the feet. How about that. Right arm. And the left arm. Let your tension, rest on the sensations of breathing. When the mind wanders, no problem. We just bring the attention back to the sensations of breathing. Just a reminder, you can always come back to this practice. For whatever reason, loving kindness practice doesn't feel right for you at this time. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Bringing to mind a lovable being starting where it's easy. Somebody, some being for whom it's easy to feel warmth, care, respect, love, kindness, choose whichever word resonates for you. And connect with this person in whatever way makes sense for you. And to support our cultivating loving kindness. We can repeat these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May be imagining how it would be if in the experiments I described earlier, there's be strangers in a room, not talking but the emotion is contagious. Or would it be like if you wanted to share goodwill, that loving kindness, care. May be radiating it. May be repeating these phrases in your mind. Then let's extend the loving kindness to a good friend, bringing them to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. We find our mind wandering, just very simply begin again. We don't have to make a story about it. We just connect the good friend and send someone in kindness. We find our mind wandering. We find our mind wandering. We find our mind wandering. And then to extend the loving kindness to ourselves. Of course we include ourselves. Sometimes some people it's sometimes a habit to overlook taking care of themselves, having loving kindness for themselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Can we have the manner in which we practice match what we're practicing that is. Can we have some warmth about when we discover we're lost in thought or trying to remember wait, what am I doing here. Maybe relaxed, easeful. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. And then expanding, expanding our loving kindness a little bit further. Those we don't know. Somebody we don't have a relationship with. Maybe somebody on this Zoom call that we haven't met. Somebody we see in the neighborhood. It can be helpful to choose a specific individual as opposed to the generic collective. Somebody we don't know. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May we have some warmth. May we have some warmth. May we have some warmth. Bring into mind that neutral person, somebody we don't know. Maybe a little bit slipper. This can be such a rich place to practice. Complete stranger. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May we have some warmth. May we have some warmth. May we have some warmth. Wishing others. Safety, health, happiness, ease. And also feeling the way that it supports us. Some kind of way in which this warmheartedness eels. And some of the unfinished business of our hearts.
