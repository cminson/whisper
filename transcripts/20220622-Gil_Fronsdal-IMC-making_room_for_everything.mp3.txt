The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

To paraphrase the Buddha saying,
To be deluded is to assert oneself on all things. To be awake is to make room for all things.
So what we do with our attention is one of the most precious resources we have.
And many other things follow in the wake of attention.
But sometimes we use our attention as a tool or a vehicle for what the saying applies is asserting ourselves onto the world.
So we have an agenda. We want something. We want something to go away. We want to have something.
We want to prove ourselves. We want people to see us a certain way. We want something from other people.
And sometimes it's clearly an operation of conceit that we have some kind of self that we're kind of asserting and proving to other people.
And we're the agent. We're in charge. We're going into the world to do something.
We don't feel like we have much agency, but to the degree that we have agency we are pulling away from the world
and hiding in ourselves or shutting down or something.
And without being so conscious of it, awareness is being used in the service of that.
Awareness is directed to paying attention to what we want, don't want.
It's directed to what we're trying to avoid, the direction we're trying to go forward or backwards or whatever it is.
So we're asserting ourselves. We're taking kind of, this is me. I'm the one who's doing it. I'm charging.
And sometimes when people do mindfulness practice, they understand the instructions,
but they interpret it through the filter of themselves, asserting themselves,
or taking charge, being in charge of everything and making something happen.
Finally, I've found out what I can do to be something of X, Y, or Z.
How I can make myself more relaxed and calm or something.
An alternative in the path of the Dharma is to see that what we're doing is that we're discovering how awareness,
we can take our awareness and make room for everything.
So it kind of makes space. That awareness is giving, breathing room, giving space to what's happening here.
And it's a kind of space in which something then has a chance to breathe,
something has a chance to grow, to evolve, to unfold.
That is very different than if we're asserting ourselves.
When some things feel claustrophobic, they're shut down. They feel manipulated.
They are manipulated with. We're changing things. We're making things different.
We have our agenda, an idea of what's supposed to happen, and therefore we're going to make it happen.
Another approach, this awakening approach, is to make room for everything
so that things can evolve, things can change from a very different place,
where we have some trust that there's a deeper wellspring of health that wants to come through if we make room for it.
So if someone comes to us, and maybe they're angry with us in a way that's not appropriate,
that to assert oneself on that is to maybe be angry back, maybe, or all kinds of things.
But the awakened approach is to make room for that anger,
and so that in a sense you're helping that anger of the other person feel safe.
It's okay. I've told people in my role as a Buddhist teacher
that I try to be someone with whom it's safe to be angry.
So that's kind of like an intentional goal, is to be someone that's safe to be angry at me.
And sometimes people get angry with me.
And I think anytime you're in a kind of central role, like a spiritual teacher or something,
there's a lot of projection, a lot of needs, a lot of things that go on.
Sooner or later people will be angry.
And then the one time it happened to me many years ago where someone was really angry with me.
And I was responsible for something.
All I did was I had a meeting with her, and I forgot to meet with her during a retreat.
So there were lots of other times to meet on retreat, but I just forgot.
So he sat for an hour with her having a monologue telling me how terrible I was.
And I sat there, I was sitting across the leg like this, and I was just like, wow.
I wonder how long this can go on. I was just like amazed and just sitting there and letting it happen.
I didn't take it personally, I just was there making room for it.
And then the end of the afternoon the bell rang for supper.
And saved by the bell as a saying they have in Buddhism.
And so I said to her, there's the bell, I have to go. So she let me go.
And the next day she said, that was so helpful, Gil.
Everyone else runs away from me when I'm angry.
She'd never had the experience of someone who stayed present.
And something shifted for her in that it was like a gift for her.
That's something she was held or accepted or allowed to be how she was.
So she can see herself in a different way.
Conflicts between groups of people.
Sometimes we're not to assert ourselves in the situation.
But to make room for it, stay present. This is where we use our awareness.
Everyone sees we're paying attention. Everyone knows we're there in the middle of it.
And we're not shutting down, we're stepping forward in a sense, I'm here.
What's happening here? But without asserting anything, without trying to change anything or do anything,
it can make a huge difference to do that.
Someone is hurting in some kind of way. All kinds of ways in which people hurt.
And sometimes it's a fantastic medicine for them to have someone who sits with them
and allows the hurt, the sadness, whatever it is, just to be there
and isn't trying to fix it or make them go away or override it in some way by telling jokes.
Who knows what, but just making space.
Again, I'm here with you and you show that you're comfortable with it.
You're comfortable with the anger. You're comfortable with the sadness.
You're comfortable with whatever it might be.
And you're there to kind of give the space of awareness to it.
And that allows other people to have space.
There are people in our society who don't have a real experience with pausing,
slowing down and giving kind of an open space and time to the unfolding of things,
to the revealing of things, to some other process to unfold
besides the process of, it's up to me to shut down, run away, attack, fix, solve, do something.
And so it's learning to trust this other process of making room for things.
And to learn to do this and appreciate this, it's both learned in meditation
and it supports meditation.
Because when we don't trust that there's something that can evolve and unfold
and deepen and move to health, then of course it's pretty natural
to want to think our way to solve our problems in our life.
And so people spend a lot of time thinking in meditation, thinking and thinking
because that's where they think this solution is going to be.
But when we start having a trusting that there's some deeper process that's available to us
that doesn't involve thinking, but involves giving room and space,
then the conviction that thinking is where the solution is going to be begins to fall away.
And then if we don't put all our hopes in thinking,
then it's easier to put it down and make room to feel, to sense, to be present for ourselves
to allow some deeper process within ourselves to unfold and move through us
to allow things to process themselves, to allow sadness to process itself,
grief to process itself, anger to process itself, joy to process itself,
the whole shebang and everything, conceit to process itself.
And so all these things don't become a problem, don't become a source of shame
or self-criticism because we know there is something, there's a,
they're all doorways, they're all the means.
It's one more thing to open up to, to make space for, to allow for
so we can let this some process to unfold.
And it might be only, it might be as simple sometimes as making space for what's going on
and we realize we're carrying a lot of tension in the mind and the body.
And it's because we made space, we recognize that and shoulders let go finally
or the stomach releases are, you know, realize how much contraction,
constriction there is around the eyes or the forehead, around all this thinking.
Well, I had no idea.
And so then that calms down.
And then something begins shifting in very important ways
when these physical tensions begin to abate.
So delusion is asserting oneself.
Awakening is making room for everything.
Giving space, making room.
Whether it's such a, one or the other world is probably not accurate.
But most people err in the sight of the first, asserting themselves
and don't really know much about making room for things,
letting something to unfold and open up.
And if you get some experience with that and trust and value of it,
then you can find your way to the hybridting of these,
bringing these two together, the middle way between the two,
which is also needed for this life that we live.
So those are my thoughts today.
And may you experiment with giving more room to things to see what happens.
