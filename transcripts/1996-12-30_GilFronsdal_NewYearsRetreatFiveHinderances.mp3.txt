 a teaching, a sermon that has been recorded as titled the turning of the wheel of the Dharma and this is in this scripture he describes the insights the understanding he tries to formulate put into words the understanding that he had the insight he had the night of his enlightenment and in some sense this first teachings of the Buddha the first sermon he gave is the beginning of Buddhism as a teaching as a as a teaching and at first it's recorded the Buddha was reluctant to teach after his enlightenment that he felt that no one would get it and and he spent quite a bit of time wondering what to do and it was finally convinced that indeed there were people in the world who had but little dust only little dust covering their eyes the spiritual eyes and that there was a possibility of clearing that dust of them to see clearly this world that we live in and and so then he went about and started to teach but I think we can easily understand his reluctance because part of I think what waking up is is coming to rest coming to understand the boundless sense of presence that we are that is within us and how do you describe presence it's it has no inside and outside and he had really point to it anywhere but we have a sense I believe what it's like when there's presence when we're presence something when we have full presence right here and now and what's beautiful about the word presence the experience of presence is that presence does not cling there's no clinging in presence there's no fear in presence there is no hostility in presence presence is just a state of being that perhaps is our birthright but how do you describe that how do you point to it how do you help people to understand it and to rest in it was what the Buddha grappled with the night of his enlightenment not the night but after his enlightenment after his enlightenment so he gave this first a sermon called the turning of the wheel of the Dharma and in here he taught the four noble truths and the four noble truths was the first way in which he tried to formulate his understanding of freedom and it was also has become down through the ages the core teaching of Buddhism almost all Buddhist traditions will point back to the four noble truths as being very important in Central to varying degrees though they emphasize it some traditions will give it lip services being core but don't really explore all its implications and meanings and it said that it's easy to understand the four noble truths you know anybody can kind of read a book and in a few sentences get the basic gist of it but to understand the depth of it the application of it in our life is considered to be quite difficult and or not difficult but only someone whose spirituality is fully mature understands the four noble truths in their entirety in their full impact in our life and I like to tell a story of a friend of mine who when she was growing up as a teenager in the Palo Alto area around 1965 was kind of beginning I guess of flower power and hippie dumb and things like that and she was fourth to fifteen I think and and she had heard that there was a Zen master Suzuki Roshi up in San Francisco who could teach you how to get high without drugs so she thought that was pretty good so her and her friends went up there to find out how to do this and he was delighted to see them and he ushered them into the ceremony ceremony room at the temple and then proceeded to give them a talk on the four noble truths which these 15 year old girls had not come to get and it wasn't exactly what they wanted however the way in which Suzuki Roshi talked about the four noble truths there is such thing as suffering in this world that desire God forbid is a cause for suffering that there's a possibility of freedom from suffering and there's an eightfold path the way he talked about it was so full of joy and happiness that they juxtaposition of talking about suffering and and being so full of joy caught this woman's attention and she went on now for 30 years to be a Zen student starting there when she was 15 so the four noble truths in formulating his teaching according to the four noble truths the Buddha was borrowing from what was what was at the time a medical model a medical kind of way in which people talked about illness and treatment and recovery it seems to be at medicine at the time of the Buddha doctors would recognize the problem would recognize the cause of the problem would recognize the prognosis of the possibility of a cure and they would recognize what the prescription was what to do and the Buddha simply adopted this and to formulate the four noble truths kind of you know Dharma therapy but I think it's very significant that he chose a medical model because a kind of therapeutic model because it avoids metaphysics and as we all know religions and philosophies of the world tend to be imbued with a lot of metaphysical beliefs cosmological beliefs that sometimes are required to believe in or for the rest of the system to make sense and metaphysics you know anyway the Buddha was quite skeptical skeptical of all metaphysics and maybe I don't know you know if it's necessary to be as skeptical as he is but but certainly he was very skeptical because he felt you couldn't really prove it things you couldn't prove you couldn't know you know why hold to them but more importantly he would have felt that metaphysical speculation was of no real help to understanding liberation understanding our freedom so he avoided that he avoided so he avoided dogma he avoided belief systems and rather he offered offered practices and he offered insights that you can verify for yourself not just to have to believe in so he offered that therapeutic model for understanding spiritual life he didn't offer offer a metaphysical model for understanding it and the four noble truths you know they're kind of a very simplistic formulation and as I understand them we should try to understand what is behind the formulation and then personalize it for ourselves find our own words our own concepts at work work in this fourfold therapeutic model when it says there is suffering the first noble truth simply says suffering occurs okay fill it in what kind of suffering do you have you know fill in the blank that's what it basically means you're having anxiety you have fear you have you know you name it and then the second noble truth there's a cause the cause for for suffering is and the word is not desire that trips people up and inevitably would be a question saying you mean all desires wrong or how can Buddhism be so negative and the the word is not desire but the word is literally thirst or can be translated as clinging or craving but that's again it's just to kind of you know fill in the blank kind of thing what kind of shape and form does your craving or clinging take and it there's a whole wide repertoire of things that you feel in that blank pushing away holding on addicting hating craving defending building up becoming there's many many ways you could fill in the blanks and then there's the possibility of ending suffering of entering the ending this kind of suffering and you fill in the blank and what is that like for you and you and your own discovery as you go through your life in a simple way in a day-to-day way as you understand your suffering the cause how do you understand what the release from suffering is like and then how do you understand the steps you need to take to attain that kind of release that kind of freedom that kind of happiness so the Four Noble Truths and the longer I've practiced I remember some 20 years ago I went to see an old friend of mine and she asked me you know I just started kind of I started being involved in Buddhism only few years earlier and she asked me you know you know what does Buddhism have to teach and I hadn't read much about Buddhism but I was involved in practice quite a bit and so I told her the Four Noble Truths and I left her walking through the streets of San Francisco feeling kind of how inadequate my answer had been how simplistic it had been here I'd reduced in a huge wonderful religious tradition of the world to these four little phrases you know how could I've been so simplistic I should have something wiser to say about Buddhism and the longer I practice the more I've come to appreciate the Four Noble Truths and their value in our life and applicability for helping us clarify our life if we can take it really seriously so the first noble truth is it's basically it says suffering occurs it doesn't say which some people think Buddhism says that life is suffering maybe sometimes you feel that way but it's not what the Buddha said he simply said suffering occurs and it's hard to argue it with that some Zen students will argue when he's saying suffering doesn't exist suffering doesn't exist it's empty you know but but you know you look at them carefully and you see their suffering so so it's hard to argue against that suffering occurs so it's you know not a particularly profound truth but anyway it's something we find and there's different ways of understanding this word Dukkha suffering and you know many Buddhist words like Dukkha like Dharma like many many of the words that Pali or Sanskrit words have multiple meanings and so we have to be sensitive to the nuances the context in which something is being talked about to understand its meaning if we just simply say you know translate Dukkha suffering all the time we actually will miss some of the nuances of what's being implied so in the context of the four noble truths I like to distinguish between what I call inevitable suffering and avoidable suffering unavoidable suffering and avoidable suffering unavoidable suffering and optional suffering and Buddhism is entirely about optional suffering and that's what we have to understand how it's optional the mechanisms by which it's optional how it comes in to be if it wasn't optional there would be no possibility for spiritual path so so there's the inevitable and there's the optional the inevitable is the kind of stuff just comes with being any being human being being alive we stub our toe and it hurts our back goes out and as some of you know I'm quite fond of reporting that the Buddha had a bad back so you know it's not like you know a Buddha as someone who's free of all possible illnesses and problems a Buddha has those kinds of sufferings also full enlightenment doesn't mean you don't get a cold so there's the kind of physical things that happen and there's also emotional pain that is inevitable if you're open to the world it's reported the Buddha his homeland where he was born during his lifetime was attacked and many people were massacred he was conquered and and he felt grief he felt you know it hurt him to see that happen there's empathetic pain there's a feeling you know other people suffer around you and we sense we're open to every feel it and it feels unpleasant it feels like you know we suffer ourselves sometimes and that's inevitable if you're open being his part of being human being to be in relationship and to feel what's going on around us and those kinds of things are not the kind of suffering that Buddhism is trying to make you free of now maybe that's a disappointment to hear you want to you want to refund but but there is such things and just being a human being I like to think of Buddhist practice is just helping us be more fully human so then so there's that now there's suffering we add to the inevitable suffering so you know you get a cold and then you get self judgmental you say well how could I have gotten a cold I must be responsible I do this to myself and what do we do wrong and this and that and then we attack ourselves or we attack something else or we feel empathetic suffering or the world around us and we get angry or we get sad or we get depressed because we react to it with aversion with clinging with justification with condemnation all kinds of ways we react and we add to it all kinds of complications and what we want in a sense is to have uncomplicated suffering pain the kind of inevitable pain is it possible to experience it in a straightforward uncomplicated way it's a life is a lot easier if it's inevitable a lot easier if you don't fight it so there's that now the four noble truths is not really about in that kind of inevitable kind of pain that might arise just being in the food the suffering of the four noble truths a dukkah the four noble truths has to do with a kind of suffering that occurs the kind of pain the kind of distress that occurs the kind of anxiety that occurs through the way in which we choose to relate to what's happening in our experience so I call it sometimes relational suffering but I got in trouble once because I used that word it in a class in Buddhism at Stanford that I was teaching and the undergraduate student wrote home to her father who was a Buddhist and said this guy thinks that all relationships cause suffering you know something about inevitable suffering so but it wasn't what I had in mind and but rather relational suffering has to do with the ways in which we choose to be in relationship to stuff when we when we cling it's painful to cling when we try to hold things at a distance and push it off it's painful to do that and there's there's an infinite variety of ways in which we do that nuances of ways and it's that kind of suffering which is optional now the way to take the four noble truths seriously and Buddhism seriously is to be very is to be very interested in your suffering and many of you are interested that's why you're here it said it actually said traditionally in ancient texts and all that no one comes to Buddhism except through suffering that somehow or other you might not know it even but somehow the contact with suffering is what brings people to practice so we're all in some ways interested perhaps in your suffering many of us are interested in not you know just interesting getting rid of it we have something in it we want it but to study your suffering to get it to know it and if it's strong suffering was strongly motivated but I find it myself and I find in many people that we don't pay off and I pay attention to the subtle sufferings the subtle anxieties subtle distress the subtle complaint you know when you feel you're complaining complaining I believe comes out of this the suffering when you complain isn't there I don't think you become you're complaining if you weren't suffering some way suffering in and of itself is suffering is a kind of complaining is it's kind of suffering it might be very subtle are you interested to understand and see the suffering there Buddhism offers a kind of very radical form of therapy or spirituality and if you were interested in following through in the radical list of it the full spiritual potential of it you want to be take serious all your suffering to understand it even the most subtle to see you know to understand it be present for it to allow for it to be open to it to see it to understand it the word Dukkha which we translated as suffering you know it's closely connected to the word sukha which is the Buddhist word for happiness it has the same root ka but that root ka means and etymologically the hub of a wheel and do means kind of like a bad bad hub of the wheel and su means a good but what it means etymologically dukkha it means a wheel out of kilter out of center and what is it that brings us out of center and then that's a second noble truth what the Buddha called desire or he didn't call the desire that's our Western problem we keep calling it that he called it clinging or craving literally thirst Tana there's some kind of hanging on to experience hanging on to objects or what we objectify or and hanging on also means pushing away and it could be very subtle and it could be very gross and it could be quite invisible it can be almost hidden from view at times because we don't necessarily have the presence yet or the awareness yet to see exactly how it is we're contributing to create the kind of relational suffering that's occurring in the present moment and I think you know we don't see I think that you know you should be troubled when you hear this I think you should feel challenged when you hear this kind of teaching and because probably it doesn't exactly jive with some of your ideas you have about where your pain where your suffering comes from what it's about I think it's good to be challenged and to think deeply Buddhism as you know puts a tremendous focus on the present moment and part of the reason for that is that suffering only occurs in the present moment it isn't simply that it occurs in the present moment but the cause of suffering occurs in the present moment so there's a second time this retreat I made reference to another religious system I apologize maybe you shouldn't but you have in Western Judeo-Christian traditions there's at least certain strands of it the idea of original sin and as I said earlier Buddhism has opposite belief more belief in original sinlessness original purity but there is a notion you find some strands of Judeo-Christianity that original sin is something you carry with you through time and it's because of something happened in the past that we're sinful now Buddhism is really absence of this the causes of our suffering in the present not causes the conditions the kind of stuff that comes together to create it might have just might have started in the past there's no denying that at all but you only suffer in in the present moment because the suffering is being created in the present moment by some variety some variation of grasping or pushing away and so the emphasis on the present moment is to try to understand clearly what is actually happening the present moment that involves grasping or pushing away what into the in the present moment is the seeds and the release the cause and the release for suffering now it's often quite invisible to us because it's happening at a level that we're unconscious of we don't see yet it's out of sight or it's very buried or whatever but that's where it is that's what the Buddha taught it's happening now our suffering is now the causes of our suffering is now so understanding the present moment understanding is really the place we will understand the Four Noble Truths we're not going to understand it in the abstract but in the present moment so when we do this practice we first try to stabilize ourselves a little bit in the present moment try to kind of be gentle and kind to ourselves and try to kind of be fall the breath maybe be in the body and listen to sounds do something that brings us into the present moment more fully and sometimes we can do that and sometimes we can but if we can then we try to do that because once we can be a little bit in the present moment then we can begin exploring what is actually the causes what is actually the suffering here and how what is the tightness what is the holding what is the pushing away that might be the cause of it and sometimes what I see happen is that often we we're very sometimes in practice we're very selective in how we're looking how we're focusing in such a way that we're bypassing our suffering so for example say you're how you're feeling frustrated in your practice so you think well I better try to get in the present moment I think I'll hang on to that breath like it's the end of the world and just you know not let it go but that's not really acknowledging your suffering and as long as you try to stay with the breath you don't really acknowledge your suffering and you might never see then that this the frustration there at that moment is caused by a judgment the judgment that you're you're supposed to become and that and that and you're holding up this idea holding literally maybe clinging that you need to be a calm person for whatever reason you're not really an adequate or person you're not a perfect person yet you can't really go talk to the teacher and present yourself until you've gotten the modicum of calm you know and and so that you know that's that's that's the holding behind the frustration so to see this clearly sometimes we need to kind of back off from the breath back off from the selectivity of what we're looking at and see what is actually going on here there's something different going on and sometimes you want to have the widest possible posture widest possible angle lens because that's where it's really happening sometimes you'll have a very very focused lens to see the very minutia the detail of what's going on so Buddhism has a lot of lists and there's a list of the four kinds of grasping the four kinds of thirsts and these are the number the amount of different kinds of grass means you're allowed to have so I thought I might be interesting to go over the list and I like to change the order because I have a sense that if I announced I'm gonna go kind of list go over to a list of the four grasping the four things we attached to that some of you are going to go oh my god Buddhism is so down of a religion here they're gonna take away this from me and that for me and it's just all about you know what's problematic and and not to give up something I don't want to give up whatever it's gonna protest my go up so sorry I'm going to sorry we do the order because the first one the first thing in the list the first one in the list is precepts and practice ethics and spiritual practice so it sounds like we're in a good footing here it isn't that you're supposed to let go of spiritual practice and ethics it's one of the places where human beings tend to grasp the whole hold and then because that grasping tend to cause suffering and grasping onto practices and ethics also causes a lot of suffering people around you but but grasping onto precess and practice and I see it a lot in all of us I include myself grasping onto practice in order to whatever in order to be freed from being able to have any kind of suffering at all grasping onto practice in order to prove who we are grasping onto practice to have an identity grasping onto practice to to run away from our life grasping onto practice same thing for ethics grasping onto precepts and ethics and it becomes sometimes practice becomes a veil from really letting us be fully present I think we need to be very careful that our practice helping us become present rather than actually paradoxically taking us away from presence which it happens sometimes and I think you know it's some kind of attachment around practice is quite common I think all of you have experienced it in these days because it's fairly common at some point or other to maybe feel a bit frustrated with how your practice is progressing here it's not progressing fast enough or the right kind of experiences are not happening these is to have ideas attachments around the practice itself so the second one which is maybe the I'm thinking these days it's maybe one of the most important ones because maybe it encompasses some way to all the others is grasping to the traditional word is views ditty but I think it means grasping to any kind of stories and one of the things that you become becomes clear and clearer as you practice is a degree to which the stories in our mind the evaluations the thoughts we have about things how they how we react to them how we believe them how emotions arise out of them how a sense of self arises out of them many of the emotions we feel not all of them but so many of the emotions we feel in our life arise because there's some kind of evaluation which was there first and evaluation is a story is a view so say that one of you decides to give me that's red Ferrari is done at the end of the retreat now that's nice enough you know I might feel kind of contentment to whatever nice and happy however my macho self my identity will just feel ecstatic that ecstasy comes from the valuation come from the story that I need to need to be a certain kind of human right if I didn't need to be some kind of great human for all of you you Ferrari Volkswagen who cares what you give me but the degree in which I hold the story he meant story to that degree I can feel ecstatic so one of the ways that we have lots of ecstasy in your life is to be really successful in choosing the right story kind of anticipating what might come your way however you know then what happens one of you out there in the parking lot you know you know you're coming quiet and going really slow not so you know you're kind of present but not so present you're backing your car out and just inordinate amount of fear arises as you're heading for backing up towards the Ferrari and the degree to which the fear is there has something to do with again this identity of being a human I mean imagine if that for I was banged up I would be embarrassed to go downtown Santa Cruz so there's a threat to my identity so some of the fear arises from that threat or anger so you know you threaten to bang into it but you take your Volkswagen and you ran right into it and I get angry how much of that anger is come the good strength of it comes again from the fact that what's been attacked is not so much my Volkswagen my Ferrari but what's been attacked is my identity that I'm holding on to boredom often is related to identity sometimes so so so I'm not saying this is the source of all emotions but a lot of our emotional life arises out of some evaluation some stories some idea that she's there first so you might at some point as you as you practice mindfulness become aware of your thoughts and your stories the meaning you impose on experiences the proverbial story of someone coming late for an appointment not showing up for an appointment I give this example already maybe I did in an interview you know someone comes late when you know for for it doesn't show up for an appointment and all you know in the present moment is you're out of the date you had the time you're standing in the street corner and it's cold you know it's wet or whatever whatever and the person didn't show up that's all that's that's all that's happening literally the person did to that we add a story we ampute meaning this means that the person doesn't like me this respects me is this and that about me so he decides oh this this person disrespects me I asked him to come on time they always late I asked him this time is really important the person didn't come on time here's another example the person disrespecting me and once you have that evaluation anger arises anger doesn't arise simply because you're standing on a street corner and you had a date and you're standing there sweet corner no one shows up anger rising because of the valuation that was there the story and we often then we fixate on the story we attach to the story and the clinging and the attachment the version arises out of that story and maybe the story is true and maybe the story is not but the story is just the software we confuse the software for hardware in the computer of our life it's just software we need to hold it very lightly because it might not be true and you know this pre-verbal stories maybe the person was in a terrible accident and you hear you know they're you know they're in the emergency ward clinging on to their life and suddenly feel all this regret and sadness and forgiveness for what you know how you felt for them because you realize you know we have no basis in fact that they were disrespectful for you until you know you don't know until you actually talk to them or find out you have to hold your story your evaluation very likely otherwise you know spin out I love the story that Sylvia Borstein tells of deciding to go and retreat at the Zen Center in San Francisco kind of personal retreat self-retreat and so she called up and said I would like to you know sign up for a room make reservations and make a self-retreat and the person answered the phone said oh yes but you have to talk to Robert the the guest manager and he's not around right now he'll call you back so Robert called her back later but she wasn't home so Robert left a message saying this is Robert the guest manager and return your call please call me back so she called back later and no Robert wasn't around at which point Sylvia said I think this means that I'm not supposed to come to Zen Center and the person on the other line the phone said oh I think it just simply means Robert's not here right now so stories our views our opinions we hold on to them so preciously so cherishingly for all kinds of reasons so that's another form of attachment we have of a clinging holding that causes suffering a variation almost a variation on this kind of view kind of a kind of view that gets its own category and of these four grasping is grasping to self and self is just another idea again it's just a view but it has a view that's very powerful for us and we have all these ideas of who we are and who we need to be or who we shouldn't be but maybe we are and we're afraid or whatever we have all these ideas of what the self is the self and has needs so you need this need that the self has you know identities it wants to become something there's tremendous difference in Buddhism between having an identity and identifying you're welcome to have an identity if you happen to have one you know Buddhism is not going to try to take it away from you you know if you're a woman I mean be a woman if that's what you want to be if you're a man you're fine if you want to be a certain kind of man you know fine whatever but but identify so identity is just kind of what's there in a sense identifying is the creation of an identity and then holding on to it or taking identity maybe already have and imputing meaning to it and importance and then holding on to the identification what we creating out of it rather than just simply allowing you to be the way you are it's interesting to me that we talk a lot it's not like they're part of the dogma of the Pasana movement in America are terrified Buddhism we talk endlessly about the three characteristics and permanence no self and suffering but I seldom hear actually people express the nuances of these teachings the the Pali formula with three characteristics is all dharmas in this case you might as well say all things are impermanent all things are without self but then it does not say all things are suffering all dharmas are suffering the formula gets changed and it says sabesankara dukkha all sankaras all constructions sankaras literally means constructions formations mental formations are suffering when we construct an entity we construct how we have to be and hold on to that that is suffering again you see the relation of the optional when we get involved with something rather than letting ourselves be just the way we are I mean it's fine for me to be a man right I mean you're not going to deny me that are you but look all the suffering it creates when I become a human and I have to be it and I'm frightened when I'm not and I have to defend it at all costs and and it's just you know it's exhausting the amount of the expense of the gym not to mention that you know the clothes and the gold watches and and the repair costs not Ferrari that you it's a lot of work to to maintain an identification to maintain an identity cost a lot of work to have an entity is free to maintain it takes a lot of work the fourth which is actually the first but if I said the first I said the fourth first then you know you have to be this is maybe this drop of enthusiasm but now it's maybe safe the fourth grasping is sensual pleasures sensual desires it isn't that sensual pleasures is wrong you're welcome to have all the sensual pleasures that life brings you the it's a source of suffering to grasp on them it's one of the great places we grasp is sensual pleasure and we talked about that some I talked about the hindrances who has memorized the famous Blake poem about the joy that flies by maybe no little poor little quadruple little four-line poem that Blake has no you know it oh well so much for that something like he who pass he who grasp the joy that passes by suffers he who kisses a joy that flies by lives in eternity's sunrise it's poetic loses something in a translation so the attachment to sensual pleasures the need for sensual pleasures and it's pervasive in us that in that we many of us feel that something is wrong with things are unpleasant and something is right when things are pleasant when I'm having a lot of unpleasant experiences something about me is wrong and I better do the best I can to get more pleasant ones unpleasant sensations is just unpleasant sensations there's no story involved in it there's do we add a story evaluation to what it means so the attachment to to to pleasure is often an aversion to discomfort is it necessary to have a version to discomfort is actually a push it away to hate it or is it possible to find a kind of a piece that is not or happiness is not connected to what is actually happening to us one person anyway to realize is a kind of happiness that's not connected to objects of desire objects of pleasure so we grasp to that so the call of the Four Noble Truths is to become familiar with suffering to be interested in our suffering not to be morose or morbid or depressing but because it's better to become awake to it and learn to mature beyond it than it is to remain numb and so many of us are numb to our suffering unwilling to look at it or running away from it and then to become interested in the grasping the holding the attachment the evaluation the judgment out of which it might arise and to do this with tremendous compassion and kindness to ourselves because it's very I think it's very difficult to be a human being and it's very difficult to be in the forces of our society and our family and our own mind and all the judgment and expectations and fears and loneliness and depression and feelings and that inadequacy and lack of self-worth and all the things that we feel and we swim in and are painful for us it's very painful and it's easy enough I think to take something like the Four Noble Truths and use it just as another thing to feel bad about used to feel bad about ourselves oh it must be because I am causing my suffering I am hanging on I'm clinging to something and now I'm being worse than I was before I knew about the Four Noble Truths overcome any bitterness that may have come because you were not up to the magnitude of pain that was entrusted to you like the mother of the world who carries the pain of the world in her heart each of us is part of her heart and therefore endowed with a certain measure of cosmic pain you are sharing in the totality of that pain you are called upon to meet it in joy instead of self-pity overcome any bitterness that may have come because you were not up to the magnitude of pain that was entrusted to you to be tremendously kind compassionate accepting and forgiving we don't have to be perfect we don't have to do it right there's no you know I didn't know when they showed me yet the owner's manual of being human being says you have to do it right and the Third Noble Truths is the possibility of liberation with a possibility maybe more exact the exact expression is this is the possibility of the seizing of your particular suffering of your suffering and you can see it if you see your suffering and you see that suffering arises out of clinging it's almost directly immediately you'll see almost simultaneously you'll see that if suffering arises out of clinging you see oh yes there is a possibility of not suffering when there's no clinging there this is the positive message of Buddhism the enthusiastic message optimistic message the message that within us is as pure luminous being this great beautiful essence the Buddha nature Buddhism has a tremendous trust for our self for our Buddha nature for the possibility our innate possibility of opening up of being a human being of waking up fully it recognizes the suffering and it recognizes the great that even in all of us no one's excluded has the possibility of becoming free becoming awake freedom from suffering sometimes you use the word nirvana nirvana in negative terms freedom from suffering is a negative way of saying it part of the reason for that is that it's very difficult to say what our experience is when we're freed ourselves entirely from clinging and also because if we give it a positive formulation oh it means you're totally happy then we become attached to it see you become attached to a thing then make it into a thing so the Buddha tended to be net offer negative definitions for what this freedom was like and one of the negative definitions is non clinging Buddha defined nirvana nirvana is a state of non clinging and non clinging is the most bizarre highest ideal that any religion perhaps could offer because you can't find it try pointing to it where you know there it is just what you know it you know you know where is it even when you feel like there's you know it's not a you know if you're in a state of non clinging is it something is it a thing is not clinging a thing is something you're doing it's an absence of doing right a certain kind of doing so you can't find it it's not a thing it doesn't exist so here isn't it bizarre religion the highest ideal doesn't exist well maybe it's not so maybe it's not particularly original some people would say a lot of religions their highest ideal doesn't exist but that be as it may apologize so and that's the beauty so non clinging but I say it now to encourage you maybe give some thought and priority to this invisible thing called non clinging because we tend to be so caught up in objects of things which is going to do it for us you don't know how many retreats I've gone to instead of the beginning of the retreat said repeatedly in the retreat it's not about becoming calm it's not about getting ecstatic joyful it's not about getting concentrate necessarily it's about how you hold your experience your relationship to the experience what kind of relationship you formed you if what's happening if you're really scattered and busy and confused how do you hold that experience you judge it or you simply hold it with great open spaciousness so I say this it's not about getting calm you know it's about how you hold your experience and then someone will come oh it's so terrible I'm not getting calm or they'll come in and say hey guess what I got it I'm calm well it's nice information you know if you're calm I'm happy for you it's nice I wish it for you but but you know we we we we take the an object a thing to be the point of the practice rather than being this rather I see it's better to take this non-existent thing you much you'd be much happier if you take a non-existent thing as the goal the non clinging non-clinging don't cling to your happiness don't cling to your sadness don't cling to your pain don't cling to your joy and to learn to appreciate this thing non-clinging I think it really takes an appreciation for what it is but it's not something we naturally I think we naturally learn growing up or you know no one teaches us in school you know and non-clinging and but learn to appreciate the value of it and it sounds like how you know how boring you know it's nothing you know non-clinging what's that it's the door through infinite potential of who we are in the state of non-clinging you're open to a lot of potentials and openness to to possibility possibility of freedom of choice and nothing else possibility of new inputs new experiences it's very very rich the state of freedom from suffering and these four noble truths is not about some distant goal you know if I can do this for you know for a certain length of time and do this and put all these pieces together then I could finally perhaps have the ultimate bliss of nirvana or something but beginning to seek it is possible now right now what's the discomfort right now am I talking too wrong that's not suffering that's just some guy up here kind of ranting and raising just talking away how do you relate to it it's stuffy you're tired that's not suffering it might be it might be unpleasant unpleasantness is not suffering you hate being uncomfortable you can't stand it it's optional to suffer it's not optional whether you feel it's hot and stuffy and tired that's just kind of what's happening you're sitting here so it's in the moment it's now what's happening now however having said that in a very idealistic way we should always be very leery idealism and the fourth noble truth is where the idealism kind of becomes more pragmatic or practical the fourth noble truth is a description of a path that leads to the freedom from suffering the relinquishment relinquishment of holding of attachment and again I recommend you this is kind of fill in your blank kind of thing but Buddhism does offer these eight different steps eight different aspects that can help us it's the recognition that it's very hard actually to develop the presence the clarity and understanding the compassion the kindness the mindfulness to see well enough to really help us with our suffering it's possible but it's you can't just simply expect to do it overnight sometimes you can and sometimes you can't and so a realistic view then is that there are things that support and encourage us in trying to understand our suffering the causes of our suffering and the relinquishment of it and one of those things that support it and one of these one of the ways I like to talk about the eighth-fold path the fourth noble truth is that it's partly those behavioral things that is useful to do to change your life to help you create the conditions that is possible for spiritual maturity for many years when I was a Buddhist as a Buddhist student I didn't think I had to change at all I thought it was all about just sitting in meditation and having some great insight and seeing something and becoming free and I could just do whatever I want outside of meditation and perhaps idealistically you know I was a young you know you forgive young for being idealistic but that's it was kind of so but as I get older I appreciate more and more deeply the eighth-fold path that the eighth-fold path that we need to sometimes very useful pragmatically useful it's unnecessary you know there's no law of books that you have to do this but it's very pragmatically useful to pay attention to your speech how do you speak how do you what kind of livelihood you make how do you live your life how do you spend your money how do you earn your livelihood how do you what what kind of actions do you follow the precepts you live by the precepts what are kind of butcher behavior like what are the intentions that motivate your life to understand very well your deepest intentions your priorities what are the stories the views you know you can't really do without stories so we have to have stories but what are the stories that we live our life by are they are there more accurate stories more useful stories views right to you so to begin putting these pieces together understanding in our life what we can do to make it easier for us to see clearly really the source of our suffering and the source of our freedom so a simple example if I may um if I'm driving down in rush hour traffic and stuck in rush hour traffic I might suffer and I might not but if I suffer it's my cause I'm causing it so I can pay attention what's causing my suffering here it's because I am really attached to really to arriving someplace on time or I'm attached to speed or whatever there's something I'm holding to some ideas and some something I'm holding on to and the slow traffic is interfering with my attachment with my whatever so I see that very clearly hopefully and seeing that attachment I can see the possibility of relinquishment and then I can see well maybe I can't let go of it so easily immediately but now that I understand what the mechanisms are one of the things I need to put into place so I can maybe next time not be so caught by rush hour traffic well maybe I'll choose a different freeway a different time maybe I'll try to leaving you know a little bit earlier so that I don't not pressing you know up against deadlines all the time and so maybe there's more spaciousness so I can maybe have enough composure to see a little bit more clearly attachment arise so understanding how we can change our life to help support our life is what the eighth eightfold path is finally about so this is what the Buddha said this is the Buddha offered us as the core teaching for in the Buddhist spiritual life I hope that you appreciate the Four Noble Truths I hope that you reflect on them I hope you're challenged by them perhaps if you get upset with some of the things I said that's good because it means that maybe you're challenged and grappling maybe you'll come up with a different maybe Buddha left one out but to really take seriously every level of suffering within us even the subtle anxieties I like to end with two quotes if I may one is the person it said in Buddhism the person who becomes enlightened attains a certain nobility it's the word nobility itself in use translation to English usually nobility and we shouldn't get too caught up with that means but I thought this was a nice interesting quote curiously people resist the noble aspects of their shadow more strenuously than they hide their dark sides to draw the skeletons out of the closet is relatively easy but to own the gold in the shadow is terrifying it is more disrupting to find that you have a profound nobility of character than to find out you are a bum of course you are both some people may suffer a severe shock or illness before they learn how to let the gold out in this poem by may Sarton now I become myself it it's taken time many years and places I have been dissolved and shaken worn other people's faces run madly as if time were there terribly old crying a warning hurry you will be dead before what before you reach the morning or the end of the poem is clear or love safe in the walled city now stand still to be here feel my own weight and density now there is time and time is young oh in the single hour I live all of myself and do not move I the pursued who madly ran stand still stand still and stop the Sun now I become myself so I hope you can use the four noble truths to become yourself
