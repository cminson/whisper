 So, Nelson. Okay. So then, good morning. And it's nice to be back. So most of you know that I was more or less away for the month of March helping to teach a month-long retreat at Spirit Rock. And the retreat was back-to-back with a month-long retreat offered in February, so that some people stayed on. I think about 23, 24 people did both months out of about 75, 80 people who were there. So there was a lot of continuity of people who had been practicing a lot. And then there were another group of people then who came for the second month as I did. And it was quite a remarkable retreat to teach. I've taught month-long retreats before, and this one felt kind of qualitatively different. I don't know what to say. Quantitatively, qualitatively. It felt there was a much greater depth of practice and insight and also personal healing that happened for people, different things for different people. And it was also a very joyous retreat overall. A lot of joy experienced by people meditating. It probably helped that we had good weather. And so I'm still very much filled by having been part of this retreat. And I was wondering what to talk about today coming from the retreat. And I thought I would like to try to do, what I'd like to try to do is to give a kind of a description of what mindfulness of breathing can be like. So mindfulness of breathing is a very basic topic for mindfulness meditation. It's relatively central to our way of meditating, getting centered and grounded on the breath, entering into the meditative mode through focusing on the breath. And it's something that I do a lot of. It's my main practice is focusing my breath and practicing mindfulness there. And I thought kind of to talk about a little bit and also describe what might happen and why the breath can be so significant as a place to practice. I read somewhere once that we breathe something like 23,000 breaths a day. I haven't gone to the trouble to count completely, but it seems about right. If you have 15 breaths a minute, it comes out about that, give or take a few thousand. And that it's apparently equivalent to about 4,500 gallons of air every day that goes in and out through our body. And it's quite an exchange. We drink a lot less fluids than that, probably a couple of three, four quarts of fluids every day we take in compared to, you know, 4,000 times that in terms of air. And also a lot more compared to the food we take in. So it's a significant activity that we do, the breathing. And we see that in many cultures around the world, the word for breath and the word for spirit or something like spirit or spirituality are the same word are very closely connected. And you see it certainly in English coming from the Latin word spiritus, which means spirit, is closely connected to our English words, respiration, to respire, the word spire in there comes from the same root, spiritus, spirit. The word for breath and the word for spirit are closely connected. And you find that in Indian culture and Chinese culture and many different cultures, this tremendous intimacy, closeness between the breath and spirit or inner vitality or inner life. And you probably know that in the Bible, they're just, I don't know the quote so well, but at some point, God shapes Adam and Eve out of clay, and then he breathes life into them, his act of breathing in the spirit or what animates us, what brings us alive. A lot of people, enough people wonder what's the big thing about focusing on the breath and meditation. It can seem very mundane, it can seem uninteresting, it's just a physical thing, the chest goes up and down, diaphragm goes up and down, you know, and air goes in and out, it's a mechanical thing, right, that goes on. And it can seem quite boring. I've had people tell me it's really boring, what's the point? I've been following this breath now for a few minutes, a few hours, a few days or however long, it's just boring, it's just a mechanical thing that happens. I'm just sitting there watching it, nothing happens while I watch it. I know that I sympathize because there are times even to this day that sometimes I have what I call cardboard breath, and it just seems like cardboard, just like, you know, the dullest thing in the world. And I just have, I have the wisdom now to know that that's how it is sometimes, and I know that I shouldn't get derailed by that or make any judgments about that, but it's just something that happens periodically as people meditate, that sometimes the breath can seem quite dull or plain or cardboard-like. But one of the things that's happened in my years of practice is that I've learned to appreciate the awareness of breath more and more, and that continues. I've been doing this in the mouth for some 30 years. And my appreciation of mindfulness of breathing continues to deepen. So rather than overall getting more and more bored by it and thinking that, you know, now I've gotten it, you know, and let's move on to more advanced things, I find that staying with the breath, being mindful of the breath, just deepens and deepens and the experience of it, the intimacy of it, the effect it has on me, the wonderfulness of it. So far from being something that's boring, I find it something that's actually very vitalizing, brings life and spirit and a lot of joy and happiness to my life. So, but for people who are not familiar with being meditation on the breath, it can seem very strange, the idea that the breath can open up into a whole world of inner experience, a very rich world. So this is what I want to do today. So try to bring that alive for you a little bit. It will mostly be through describing to you my own experience of breathing, at times, how it can be, and with the kind of warning that everyone will have their own experience, what it's like to do breathing meditation and what unfolds as you do it. So I'm not offering my experience as a standard by which you should measure your experience, how it unfolds for you. But in offering you a little bit about my experience, it might give you a sense of the possibility there and a rise in you, a evoke in you, a greater interest in doing this exploration on your own, exploring what's the breath for you, what's it like, what can it do for you, and what happens as you engage in it. And engaging is really one of the key words to really engage with the experience of breath. Mindfulness is, I think of mindfulness at times as being an engaged practice. You really want to engage your whole life, your whole being, in the act of being present, of being mindful, of inquiring into what this experience is like. And in the same way that, to the point of getting absorbed in the experience that you're engaged in, to really absorb yourself in that. So in the same way as maybe you would be absorbed in reading a good book. And now you might not notice how quickly time goes, or you might not notice how much else around you, or might not notice you've gotten hungry, or various things. Because you're pulled into this book, you're absorbed in it. And someone might even come and you know, call out your name, and maybe you don't even hear it because you're so absorbed. Or there might be other activities that you're familiar with, where there's some level of absorption in that activity. If you have a hobby, or play music, or a variety of things that we do. So part of it with the breath is to find a way of connecting to the breath, so that there isn't just, so that we get absorbed in it. We get engaged in it enough that we get pulled into its world, we get involved in it. To the point that the other aspects of our life begin falling away, temporarily. So if you're thinking about taxes now that April's coming up. When you sit down to meditate, you're so absorbed in the breath, so engaged in the process of breathing, so interested in it, that perhaps you're concerned about taxes falls away. And that's not going to happen. It doesn't happen maybe if you read a good book. And so it's reasonable that maybe that shouldn't happen when you're meditating, you're engaged in this process. You're reading the book of your heart, or the inner book. So that's kind of the direction to go. And what we try to do in meditation is to use all our intelligence, or all our capacities, to engage ourself with that process of breathing, to get absorbed in it. And there are many different kinds of intelligences we have, as psychologists now like to point out. I don't know them all. But very popularly, that's people talking about in the last years, is emotional intelligence. And there's cognitive intelligence. There's all kinds of intelligence that we have within us. And the idea is to kind of use them all, whatever is available to you, to help you engage and be present for the experience of breathing. So as I sit down to meditate, I begin connecting to my breath. The first thing I do is I'll take a few deep breaths, feel my breath in a deep way, and kind of see what's kind of to connect and arrive and be here. Kind of use the deep breaths, kind of massage my torso a little bit to feel the tensions of the day or what's going on. I breathe deeply, it gets more oxygen into my system a little bit. And then, and to remind myself to kind of feel the breath and be there with it. And then I let my breath kind of return to normal. And then the beginning of my meditation, and this might be very different for other people, I couldn't tell my meditation teacher in Burma, this is what I did, so it's not orthodox. But actually in the beginning, I tend to be somewhat casual about being with my breath. I stay with my breath and I'm kind of light about it at first. I'm there with the breath, letting it be there in the awareness. And while I'm doing that, I kind of in a light way begin to familiarize myself with what else is going on for me in my experience, in my physical and emotional and mental experience. Kind of taking stock of where I'm at, what's going on right now. And I've learned that if I kind of rush in to be with the breath in a tight way, like, okay, I'm going to be this great, you know, I'm going to, you know, do the equivalent with mindfulness of breathing as, you know, a car that can go to zero to 60 in five seconds, you know, I'm just going to lock in there and just kind of be there. It just doesn't work for me. I tend to, I tend to create strain and stress, and it tends to create kind of a division within me between that, which I think I'm supposed to be paying attention to, and all the other aspects of my life, which are then kind of push, push aside, and don't pay attention to deny or ignore. And the last thing you want to do when you do mindfulness practice, I believe, is try to push anything away or deny something. The process of absorption, where things fall away, is a very different process than that of pushing things away and say, I'm not, you know, or fixating the mind on something so you can not aware of the rest of the world. That's not healthy either. So when I first sat down, there's kind of a light awareness of the breath and a kind of a somewhat light awareness, kind of exploring, taking stock of where I'm at, what's going on with me. And so I'll notice things like what I'm concerned about, my preoccupations. I'll notice a little bit what I'm feeling emotionally and in my life, right then I'm sitting there. I'll notice a little bit about what's going on in my body, the tensions in my body, the way my body feels that day, tired or tense or tight or relaxed or open or however it might be. So just feeling kind of more open in a casual way, what's going on all the while, kind of just lightly being with the breath, kind of casually being with the breath, kind of some breaths I miss, I might miss a series of them. And I don't worry about that. And I come back and now with a breath for a while and stay with it. Sometimes I can stay with the breath pretty consistently, but it's a kind of light touch because I'm kind of like maybe 20% of my awareness is kind of with the breath. The rest is kind of just being with what else is going on. And I find this very important to do because one of the things we're trying to do in getting absorbed in the breath or in the meditation practice is to overcome the ways in which we're fragmented from each other, from ourselves. And there are ways in which there's a lot of momentum of fragmentation within our mind and our hearts with our preoccupations. And so we might have a lot of things that we're concerned about. We're concerned about things which are not here at this time in this place. We're concerned about things elsewhere. We're continuing to have conversations with people. We have fears about our finances. We have concerns about this and that. And so the mind is ready to kind of spin off into its concerns quite easily. And that's spinning off into its concerns and thoughts lends itself to a kind of fragmentation of the mind or the psyche, where the mind's kind of racing off on its own momentum into these different areas of our life. Often it cross purposes to itself. The mind can be concerned about two or three different things kind of at once, so in the same general time and place. And so the mind is not harmonized with itself, but going in different directions. Sometimes we're even in conflict with ourselves, another form of fragmentation. We have something that we're, it's going on with us and we don't like it. We're opposed to it. We're in a positional mode to it. I don't like this part of me. We judge it. We're critical of it. We feel this is not the right thing to be happening right now. I'm supposed to be absorbed in my breath right now, so thinking about my taxes is not a good thing to do. So we fragment ourselves off by a variety of different ways. Often there's fragmentation in the body. Maybe it's not the best word for it, but if you have a lot of carrying a lot of tension in your body, then the tension in your body kind of, the body is not a harmonized unit that works together. The shoulders might be tight, so as you breathe, the shoulders don't move with your breath. The diaphragm might be tight, the stomach might be tight. Different things going on in the body. Where the body is kind of having to deal with its own tensions and the efforts to hold tight and release and the pains of it. And it keeps kind of the, you know, it's like we sit down to a really good book and you can't really get yourself absorbed in a book because you have, you know, all this physical tension that you've been carrying for the day doesn't want to fall away. So there's a lot of, emotionally there might be things that kind of emotionally keep us fragmented a variety of ways. So by taking stock at the beginning of all that's going on, there's trying to create kind of a larger container, a sense of harmony or a sense of permission for all that to be there and to realize all that stuff with who I am, my full humanity, nothing left out, is what is the material and the food for the process of getting absorbed on the breath. So all that stuff is going to be kind of corralled, is that maybe the right word, corralled in or invited in or harmonized so that all those faculties of the mind that are concerned about thinking about different things or feeling different things or whatever are all kind of beginning to kind of unite together to all be interested and involved in the process of breathing. So kind of a casual light wave being with the breath, kind of taking stock of what's going on here and then I'll start being, bringing my attention more closely to the breathing, focusing on it more carefully. And as I do that, I often become then much more acutely aware of some of the main themes of activities in my mind or my emotions that are keeping me fragmented, what we often call the preoccupations. And probably all of you have had some experience of preoccupations, you sit down. And for me often there's a strong physical element to the preoccupation of my thinking. So I start thinking about different things and I'll start tuning in then while I'm staying with the breath, feeling the breath often, unless it's really dramatic. I'll stay with the breath but I'll start also being aware of the physical tension or pressure that goes together with my thinking mind. Because if it's a strong preoccupation that keeps coming back again and again, I'll feel there's some kind of tension somewhere. And lately I've been feeling a lot in my face. I feel it in my eyes, I feel it in my cheeks and jaws and my nose even, kind of in my whole face area. Sometimes I feel it elsewhere in my body, sometimes I feel it in my neck or my shoulder, sometimes inside the head as kind of pressure. Sometimes I feel the tension in my body is connected to a certain kind of preoccupation in my stomach. Partly is dependent on the emotions that are connected to those thoughts where I feel in my body. And so I stay with the breath, being with the breath and I begin feeling those tensions and I begin to soften them and let them go if I can, relax them. I relax my eyes a little bit and if I can't relax it easily then I'll just hold it in awareness, keep it in awareness as I stay with the breath. So my attention is a little bit split between the breath and this tension maybe in my face or my eyes or in my stomach. And just if I can't relax it then holding an awareness tends to be relaxing in itself or tends to keep it from being a distracting force rather than a force rather than something that can help me be present. And so there's a lot of emphasis on feeling my body as I do this and what's going on in my body and kind of using kind of feeling how the body is kind of in a sense fragmented. And as the body relaxes the body becomes more united, more harmonized, more relaxed together in the flow. And again this is what I'm saying, what I'm saying is we want to get everything together lined up together so it works harmoniously so there's no wind drag. What I mean by that if you're riding a bicycle and you're going down a hill and you want to go as fast as you can or you want to bring all your limbs in maybe even duck your head so you have as little wind drag as possible. You want all your physical body harmonized and working together so it helps you to go in that direction you're going. Well in meditation you have the same thing you want to kind of bring everything in or you want everything lined up so that everything's kind of going in the same direction so there's less wind drag. And so you want all your faculties everything involved pointing in the same direction as being with the breath. But you don't want to force yourself to do that. You want to do it in a very compassionate and accepting way of all the forces which are taking you away from the being with the breath. Hold out in awareness soften around it see it clearly. Sometimes you I'll stop paying attention to the breath entirely and just hold in awareness something else that's very compelling that is making it very difficult to be with the breath. Part of the function of being with the breath is to really help us to see what else is going on in our life that's really important and needs attention. So sometimes if I'm trying to stay with the breath all the time when something else really needs attention then I create kind of a split which is not very helpful for me. So occasionally I'll just let go of the breath entirely and give permission to whatever else is going on emotionally or cognitively or physically and just hold that in awareness while it's there and just kind of explore it and be mindful of that. But at some point I can come back to the breathing again and feeling the breath arising and passing. And then as my what what often happens is as my thinking mind begins to quiet down and that's no longer kind of an distraction so much with the breath and I'm able to stay with the breath more and more carefully and fully then I enter the breath more fully rather than 40 percent now maybe 60 percent with the breath more fully kind of like the percentages of being with the breath increase as I kind of get more deeply into the meditation. And then I become more aware of my body in a different way and now I become much more acutely aware of what the experience is in my body of being breathed. The how the experience of breathing affects my body. The different places in body that move as I breathe the expanding and I tend to pay attention my breath a lot in my torso and my belly and my chest area my rib cage and so I become becoming aware of this expanding and contracting movement in this part of my body. And I become aware of the ways in which the breath is not relaxed or full, ways in which maybe there's some contraction or holding to the breath. I breathe in and I can't really breathe in completely because there's a little bit of tightness maybe in the upper chest or I can't really breathe out fully because of some holding there perhaps. And so I become aware of the different places my body that seems to be somehow held in check as I breathe and then I don't try to let go of them so aggressively but I try it's almost like a massage where as the breath moves in and out as my body expands and contracts I become aware of the places of holding and I massage it with that experience with the breath with the movements breathing in and out feeling what's going on and that has two functions. One function is that it helps to soften and relax like a massage those places where they might be holding and also it has a function of keeping me engaged in the breath. I find it actually more interesting to be with the breath if I'm kind of with the breath feeling the places of tension and kind of breathing into them and out of them and into them out of them. So there's this kind of physical aspect that's going on paying attention to the body as I breathe and what happens. I'm also very interested in the outer reaches of how the breathing influences the body. It can be you know if you're paying attention to the breath and the torso it can be quite large the movements of the chest perhaps or the diaphragm or the stomach but then beyond that the experience in the body is more and more subtle and I might feel the experience of alternating pressure or pushing a little bit down in my groin area down to my hips you know it's very subtle at times or maybe in my lower back or my spine the green movement that's connected with the breathing or up in the chest area kind of aware of kind of the wider more subtle ways in which the breath kind of fills my body and removes to my body and comes back. Some people claim that they can feel the influence of the breathing right down to their toes and into their arms and movement in there and I've never had too much success experiencing the flow of movement or energy of the breath down into my legs but some people say that they can do that quite beautifully and so maybe that's a possibility for you too. Now in this whole process there are also times when my emotional life is not particularly suitable for staying with the breath where my emotions are quite strong about something and maybe I feel irritated or angry or I feel excited about something that's going to happen or I feel regrets about something that happened or maybe a little bit sad or you know your whole range you know the gamut of emotions that people have and sometimes I find it very important to kind of really give permission to those who be there feel it and be aware that they're also in the field. Sometimes I'll stop, mindfills are breathing entirely to be aware of those emotions but sometimes I continue with the breath and kind of imagine that the breath is kind of holding those emotions or the container for those emotions or I'm aware of the breath and aware of the emotional life of what's going on so that both of them are kind of in the same container kind of together in awareness so I'm not splitting myself off or ignoring something that needs attention and sometimes it stays that way maybe a whole sitting and sometimes more often if I hold an emotion in awareness it actually changes quite quickly through your mindfulness of emotions and then with time emotions that tend to be not related to the breathing tend to relax or fall away from my experience and to soften and then as I continue to engage in the breath this marvelous thing begins to happen where emotions connected to breathing begin to arise. Did you know you had emotions connected to breathing? Is that a strange idea? A sense of well-being, a sense of pleasure or joy can begin to arise in connection to being with the breath. Maybe some of you had experience of feeling a certain kind of joy or delight when you're absorbed in a good book, a certain kind of physical well-being. I don't know if this is a good example but when I used to go and get my you know the barber for haircut or I still don't go anymore but now still my wife buzzes my hair periodically but I still I really like the attention I get of someone kind of cutting my hair you know someone kind of kind of you know fussing around up there you know a little light contact and touch and you know maybe I'm weird but I kind of you know I kind of I feel I feel very comforted by it and when I go to the barber I used to like to I don't want to talk to me you know talking because I close my eyes and I just take it all in it feels like kind of a wonderful comforting safe kind of places to be there and take it all in and it's just this physical stuff like this contact clip clip clip but there's a kind of sense of well-being of being an intimacy of closeness that kind of kind of settles into my body as I do this or perhaps for some people the analogy would be sitting maybe in a rainy day and coming in and having a hot cup of tea or something and and on your couch and maybe even wrapping your blanket and the fireplace if you have one and there's a kind of you know just fire and just warm tea and it's not much right but the whole thing kind of lends itself to kind of change inside your being a sense of inner well-being inner glow inner something so the same thing can happen as you're with your breathing there can be a development of this inner well-being inner glow inner sense of something that develops within you as you get yourself more and more involved or concentrated on the experience of breathing as you allow the breath to have its influence on you so this is what I find and so I find it quite wonderful the sense of intimacy well-being that comes with being with a breath it's one of the great pleasures of my life is that kind of experience that rises from that and as I feel that those kinds of emotions or sense of well-being that comes with the breathing then it becomes actually easier to be focused on the breath and more interested you know the breath now has become an interesting thing because it's much more interesting to feel that well-being that comes from concentrating on the breath than it is to think about my taxes which you know doesn't you bring me a lot of happiness so so I begin kind of it kind of becomes kind of like a bio feedback system that kind of keeps me focused in interest in the breath and being focused you know concentrated on the breathing and and so then I get more closely involved with the breath feeling the breath more carefully and as I start feeling the breath more more carefully I start paying attention to subtleties of the breath the subtleties of the sensations what actually happens maybe in one area of my body whereas earlier I might be aware of the breath in kind of more globally the expansion interaction of my whole torso as I get more concentrated my attention narrows to smaller smaller area and and usually I stay in one little spot maybe a little spot in my stomach sometimes a little bit higher up and diaphragm area sometimes I feel in my chest area but I tend to be at one little spot in in feeling very constantly very continually as best I can as continuously as I can what's happening there with the breathing the different sensations that arise since the pressure and release of it the movement the tautness the release of the tautness there's a whole series of sensations that begin happening that one little area and as I do this one of the things that begins happening is that the breath becomes calmer and calmer and the breath becomes more and more still as until I almost there are times when I feel like I'm almost not breathing at all and in fact it's occasionally at times where I seem to stop breathing entirely you're staying there staying there and that's has a number of reasons why the breath becomes more and more still as you as you get concentrated one of them I suspect is that as the mind gets more concentrated and all the kind of preoccupations in the mind and excitement in the mind concerned by different things fall away you need a lot less oxygen I'm not a physiologist but I've read that a huge percentage of the oxygen you breathe in is used for the brain and so once your brain doesn't need to use that much because it's not so active anymore so busy thinking about taxes then you know you don't have to breathe as much anymore also I think a sense of harmony in the body that comes with breathing where things are all harmonized and working together composed together also lends itself to needing less oxygen and so I think physiologically it's you don't need to breathe as much and there might be other things going on why the breath becomes more and more subtle and quiet and why at some point you have almost no experience of breathing at all another aspect another reason for this is that as the breath as we get more and more concentrated with almost any object of concentration but also more concentrated on the breath and there's a sense of well-being that comes together with it a sense of softness a sense of relaxing then the experience of the body tends to become softer and softer tends to become more and more lighter and in fact at times the sense of having a body can parts of body can fall away when you're meditating I've sat in meditation and even wondered whether you know have I disappeared and then you kind of use cheat right you open your eyes and you know I know it's still there and and I think a lot of this some of this softening and disappearing of the body has to do with a harmonizing effect of meditation as all the different ways we've fragmented from each other and we're cross purposes with each other fall away then the body gets softer and more harmonized and until it becomes at some point kind of a flow of vibration sometimes when I get really concentrated in the body becomes softer and softer sometimes there's one or two places in my body that are left that's feel kind of hard and someplace maybe some tension or holding or something that's still there someplace and so then it's interesting to bring attention to that and just hold that in the awareness until that softens and that quiets down also and becomes a subtle hum vibration and sometimes the whole body disappears in addition to the the breath seeming to disappear the breath doesn't have to disappear in meditation and the body doesn't have to disappear in meditation but it's one of those things that can happen when there's this full absorption in the experience of breathing well before the experience of the breath seeming to disappear you know getting very very subtle you can't even a hard time finding it as we stay with the breath and see you know I try to see are there ways in which I can kind of bring more of who I am on board with this experience of breathing so my body for example can I bring more of my body into this experience of breathing sometimes I pay attention to my posture because posture actually has something to do with this for me so am I composed in my breath and my body sometimes if I leaning forward too much in my meditation or slumping too much I might be getting absorbed in the breath and getting concentrated but actually not all of me is not kind of quite in it it's part of me it's kind of my body's a little bit unconscious in a sense and I find it sometimes more helpful to sit up in a more aligned way and have my chest a little more open have people more balanced in my spine and that actually helps me with the process of bringing my body on board with the experience of breathing so I've talked for a long time I don't know maybe some of you have convinced you by now that's really boring maybe this has been boring for you to listen to going on and on about the breath so I apologize if I bored you but my intention was to try to inspire you to inspire you the way this fire has the word breath in it to to take a greater interest in your breathing and that's one of your capacities one of your intelligences is interest so you want to bring that on board also and be interested in your breath and then as you do that you want to pay attention to make sure that your interest is not too interested you know if you get too eager and you know and then that doesn't work there has to be kind of a light relaxed touch but you don't want to be too relaxed some people some people bring the intelligence and relaxation too much to bear in meditation and then you get too relaxed you don't want to be too relaxed either you don't want to be too make you don't you don't want to apply too much effort and you don't want to apply too little effort and you want to bring your effort along in a harmonious way the word for there are often the word samadhi is translated in different ways than concentration sometimes translated into english as a collectiveness or unification of mind and heart and body uniting of the different faculties of who we are so again underscore one of the themes of the talk today is that mindfulness of breathing as it develops involves a harmonizing and bringing together collecting of all aspects of who we are so it's all aligned and working in harmony for the process of being engaged as fully as possible in this experience as you do that you'll learn a lot about yourself because you can't bring everything on board to be aligned and working in the same direction unless you understand all the things that are taking you away from that and you should be very welcoming about all the things you'll learn about yourself in that process it's really great and that's one of the functions of mindfulness of breathing is to learn about all the aspects of who you are that keep you from being concentrated on the breath so even if you so even if you can't get concentrated on the breath the meditation practice still works fantastically well if you pay attention to what it is that makes it difficult for you to concentrate on the breath that's all you're asked to do oh taxes and then not just taxes anxiety or whatever it might be right so um it would be nice maybe if we if any of you have questions if we can have one or two questions before we stop for lunch for clarification yes the body likewise um do you have a particular focus that you stay with so that you know easy to get out of that sometimes when I talk about focus embrace I live with breath yeah if um if um if I'm getting really absorbed and engaged in the breath very closely and the breath begins to kind of get quieter and calmer my tension tends to go in one particular place in the breath and for some people know it's up here and for me it tends to be somewhere in the torso often in this area below the belly and sometimes sometimes sometimes it's a little bit higher go up to up to the area kind of center the chest sometimes where I feel it's almost almost the more quiet and subtle the breath gets the smaller and smaller the area is of where the the attention is going yes um yeah okay so okay so a few things and then we'll stop for lunch um so if you want to ask is um you know in addition to that kind of insights that your understandings that arise but all things that keep you from being focused in the breath are there insights that come actually from the concentration itself um so I just want to say one more thing about the understandings about ourselves that come as we get concentrated that the more concentrated a person becomes the more we tend to flush out the deeper and deeper kind of core aspects of who we are which which might keep us from being really centered in a peace with ourselves so you know if you first first sit down and um and you notice that the mind is so distracted by taxes my suggestion is taxes is not a very profound aspect of our psyche but it but it's kind of like what's there first and you become aware oh I'm really concerned about this but as that falls away and you get more concentrated and calm then you might notice that deeper down there's some deep fear about uh you're about being in relationship with other people and then if that settles after a while you might see a deeper down that is a deep fear of or deep kind of attachment to life being a certain way or you know there's a deeper and deeper core issues that tend to surface get flushed out the quieter and quieter the mind gets and uh and so just appreciate that process of flushing things out and learning how to wisely and compassionately hold everything that comes the um as the as we get more concentrated uh being concentrated in the breath is not an it can be seen as an end in itself but traditionally it's not an end in itself it's a means eventually to develop have certain other kinds of insights and develop other kinds of freedoms um and um and at some point in the meditation practice there's a shift from insight into that which is uh has to do with that which is of personal nature to that which is more universal and so initially it's all you know things that keep you from being concentrated and settled are a lot of personal things personal issues um and um and it can be a lot of understanding and how i you know we are how we function individual what makes us tick oh i didn't know that's why i tend to always do this you know oh and now i understand why that this triggers me you know it's all about you know it has to do with you as an individual having to do with your own biography your own life history and various things that you know you're conditioning but at some point um as all that falls away all that gets harmonized part of the advantage of all that falling away is then we can start tuning in or noticing that which is more universal and that's universally true for everybody and part of the so part of the function of deep concentration in buddhism is to begin having some deep insight into what's more universal in human or human experience and the the the teachings of the buddhism are that um the deeper forms of freedom that can come are not freedom from only our personal kind of hang-ups but um as freedom from the kind of aspects of our psyche which we're born with and that um only only will free uh only um aspects of freedom that only comes when the psyche begins tuning into that which is more universal
