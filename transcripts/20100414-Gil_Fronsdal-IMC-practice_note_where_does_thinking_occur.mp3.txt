Occur ?

Something you might want to explore today  is how 
letting your d iscursive thinking become quiet  can help 
your practice. It’s pretty obvious that spending time 
thinking abo ut anything but your meditation  gets in the 
way of the meditation. T o be thinking about the future, 
the past , anything at all – especially if it’s discursive 
thinking – pulls you away from the involvement with 
your breathing, or your walking, or your present moment 
mindfulness.  
 
Some people find it helpful  to locate where their 
discursive thinking occurs. So for people who think 
verbally, with words, where’s the loudspeaker in the 
head that’s p rojecting those thoughts? Where doe s that 
verbal activity occur? Maybe you won’t find a place , but 
where are you hearing the inner voice , or where is that 
inner voice being spoken?  
 
And som e people might find that some place in their 
brain, that’s where it seems to happen.  Sometimes you 
can feel  the blood flow is into certain parts of the brain . When you’re in a lot of discursive thinking, you can feel 
that a certain part of the brain is act ivated, a ce rtain part 
of the brain that  has some pressure or tension.  
 
Or it could be that, if you’re listening to the voice of 
someone else speaking, where’s that voice coming 
from? Where’s that place?  
 
Sometimes, if you’re able to locate and then brin g your 
attention right there, and perhaps if you’re breathing  
with an awareness of that, see if you can quiet  that 
voice. And as it becomes quieter, see if y ou can 
appreciate or enjoy  the absence or the quieting down of 
discursive thinking . So rather than just letting go of it , 
and coming  back to your breath, see if you can actually 
appreciate and enjoy the changing texture, the c hanging 
sensations  or feeling tone, in the thinking mind that 
comes with the mind becoming quieter.      
 
Some people think more with images . And it can be 
helpful to see where  the images are projected.  Are they 
projected a little bit in the front of the mind? Are they 
projected in the back of the mind? Is there a screen 
some place in your mind? And can you locate that 
screen where the images actually occur?  
 
In locating where the voice is speaking , or where the 
loudspeaker is for thinking  verbal thoughts, or where 
you’re seeing the screen  or the projector for images, you’re shifting the focus fr om the content of your 
thoughts  or the images themselves, to something about 
the process and the experience itself , and to the 
mechanism  of how that is happening. You begin to 
distance or disentangle yourself from the actual content 
of the images or the words. And without some 
distancing, it’s very difficult to meditate because the 
thoughts can seem so captivating.  
 
With the quieting  or dimming  of the images , hopefully 
that’s nice for you. B ut see if you can find something to 
appreciate, something that’s satisfying or pleasant w ith 
the stilling of that activity of thinking or imaging . 
Because if you can feel the the pleasantness of it , then 
it can feel more attractive to go to that place of stilling.  
 
And actually it’s possible – I don’t know whether it’s true 
for everyone, but certain ly I can feel it – that you can 
actually feel that not having discursive thinking is so 
much more satisfying and pleasant than having 
discursive thinking. And without sensing and feeling that 
difference, it’s very easy to want to go back into the 
thinking because thinking is so compelling.  
 
You might want to explore that, and as you do so , you 
might explore it with some attention to  your breath, in 
the background  or in the foreground  – as if you’re 
floating on the ocean . You’re aware of yourself on t he 
ocean when the waves are coming through ; you’re aware of the waves lifting you up and down, up and 
down, and the breathing is there , supporting this whole 
exploration.  
 
In any case, if that doesn’t make any sense, you can 
just forget it , and enjoy yours elf. Thank you.
