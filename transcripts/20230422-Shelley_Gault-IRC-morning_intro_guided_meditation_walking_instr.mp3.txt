Well, it's 9 o'clock and I'm sure probably a few more people will join as we go on.
But since it's 9 o'clock, which is our official starting time, I thought I'd say hello, welcome
to everyone.
Good morning, good day, whatever time it is in your particular time zone.
There are a few of you, I can see there are two screens, so I have to like switch between
the screens to see everybody.
But there are some of you who I know from, you know, in person, I've met many times in
person and there are quite a few of you who I've met on online during, you know, the online
retreats and practice discussions and classes and those of you I don't know, I'm really
looking forward to practicing with you today and I welcome you, I sincerely welcome you
and I hope that what I offer you today along with the practice that you do is really beneficial
to you, is onward leading.
So for those of you who don't know me, my name is, as printed on the little rectangle
on your Zoom screen is Shelley Galt and I live in Santa Barbara and I teach and serve
on a small sangha board down here, the Open Door Sangha, it's a Buddhist Insight community.
And Santa Barbara, for those of you who don't know, it's a few hundred miles south of Redwood
City and Santa Cruz where IMC and IRC are the retreat center are located and it's on the
coast of California.
And I also teach and volunteer in many ways for both IMC and IRC supporting yogis in other
ways as well and doing some administrative work as well as the teaching and supporting.
And I think I hope all of you are aware that everything that happens at the Insight Meditation
Center and Insight Retreat Center is supported by volunteers where there's no paid staff
here at all and that's, I think, a really wonderful thing and of course we can always
use more volunteers.
So before we begin the formal part of the day, I want to turn you over briefly to another
volunteer here for Rana who is our manager for the day.
And for Rana, I want to mention that she did triple duty for this retreat.
She serves as both the registrar and the retreat mentor who kind of puts together the website
for the retreat, which you accessed in order to get here, in order to have all the things
that you need.
And she's also, she's the manager, the retreat mentor, and she was the registrar as well.
So thanks very much for your Rana.
She has a few announcements for us.
Hi, everyone.
My name is Prerna.
I'm just going to go through a quick logistical announcements for the retreat.
So under the Joint Meditation Hall link on the retreat homepage to the right, you will
see a Zoom info and phone instructions link.
It might be helpful to save those instructions in case you have internal problems during
the day and need to join the Zoom meeting on your phone.
If you're not in the US Pacific time zone, you can set your time zone to display the
schedule in your time zone.
Just click on your name in the upper right hand corner of the webpage and then click
settings.
Time zone setting will be at the top.
In Zoom meetings like these, you have two view options, the gallery view, which allows
you to see all the tiles of your fellow retreatants.
If you'd like, you have the teacher's view at the forefront while Shelley's offering
teachings.
You can switch the view to speaker view.
You can do this by clicking on the view button at the top right corner.
We will have two Q&A sessions for this retreat.
If you have a question, you can submit it by clicking on the question for Q&A on the
retreat page.
Alternatively, you can also ask questions by raising your Zoom hands and waiting for
your turn.
Please keep your questions concise so that there's time for more people to have their
questions answered.
Also, it'd be great if the questions are related to the theme of today's teachings.
And lastly, please, as far as possible, do not send chats to the teacher because it can
be distracting and she won't be able to respond.
You will be able to send Zoom chat to me, but it might take some time before I can respond
because I might be busy with some other retreat tasks.
And please only send a chat if there is something interfering with your ability to participate
in the retreat.
Otherwise, you can bring all your questions related to the practice of the teachings to
the Q&A sessions.
Thank you.
Thanks for Rana.
So here we are.
And as we begin, I really want to encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to
practice for a whole day, you know, a whole day.
A period of intensive practice, meditation practice, even just one day, can be really
beneficial, allowing us to settle much more deeply and see more clearly than is possible
in our, you know, a single period of daily meditation, sitting meditation.
So I, you know, I hope you'll be able to follow the schedule today.
I know you're, you know, you're all in your living spaces, probably.
So sometimes that's, that's a challenge.
But if you can sit and walk and hear some Dharma reflections as we go along and not
spend a lot of time doing other activities, that's terrific.
But even if there are tasks that can't be put off, I suggest you not think of them as
interruptions.
This is something that we always focus on in these online retreats, that the invitation
is to make everything that happens during the day a part of our practice to fold it
all in, as we say.
We can be mindful, we can be present in any activity that we're engaged in.
It's a great way of integrating our practice into our daily lives.
And I think of these hours, these, these hours that we'll be practicing together as
a, as sacred, you know, a time to be very present to our inner life, the life of our
minds, the life of our hearts, to be intimate with ourselves, to be kind to ourselves because
mindfulness has kindness in it, to be present to everything within us that presents itself.
Everything is welcome in our practice, no part left out.
And that's, that's something sacred, I think.
When I teach daylongs for my local sangha, I like to incorporate as much formal practice
as possible because I know that many people who participate and find it difficult to come
to a retreat center or to take the time to sit a multi-day retreat at home.
And people sometimes ask because of that for more teachings during, during these daylong
retreats, but my sense is that a great deal of good dharma is available online and in books,
if you remember what books are, physical books that people can access, but an extended period
of time to devote to simply exploring our inner experience, our inner lives, the mental,
physical, excuse me, emotional experiences that arise in every moment of our life, in
each moment, the, to spend a long, nice long chunk of time to really become intimate and
to see more deeply into our mental processes, that kind of time is really in short supply
in our lives, many of our lives.
And to share that exploration with others in this way, you know, gathering together in
our kind of virtual meditation hall is really supportive, really supportive.
A few days ago, I read a quote from a Chan master in my magazine article, the tricycle
magazine by a, excuse me, by a Chinese Chan monk that I thought was really apt for our
meeting in this virtual meditation hall, and what, what that quote said was, I can find
it, although places for the practice are like the reflection of the moon and water.
We establish them wherever we go, like the reflection of the moon in the water and maybe
online places are a little bit more ephemeral than actual physical retreat centers.
But I am so glad that we have learned to establish them.
So today I plan to keep the formal teachings that I give short.
And my intention is for the teachings I offer to really support your practice more than
to supplement it.
So if you'll take them in that, in that way, in that style, so I'm not so interested in
increasing your conceptual understanding of the Dharma, but more on your awareness of
Dharma principles, how Dharma principles can play out in your lives, can play out in your
practice.
You'll see there are two Q&A sessions as Prarana mentioned on the schedule, a short one before
lunch and a slightly longer one in the afternoon.
And I'd really appreciate if you use the question basket for those.
And then of course you can raise your zoom hand during the Q&A if we cover all the questions
in the question basket.
So today's retreat title is Meeting What Comes, and Mindfulness Practice, that's what
it's all about really.
It's a training in meeting what comes.
And over time we learn more and more to meet our moment to moment experience in a way that
allows us to stand steady, to be balanced.
The awareness that we cultivate is open and it's kind, essentially, eventually, it's a
wise regard.
We see through the context of wise view and formed by deep insight.
And something that is necessary as part of the cultivation of that wisdom is balance.
So that's really, that's the theme for the day, balance in practice, it's a really essential
part of our practice.
Often it's spoken of in relation to one specific area, like, but the idea of maintaining balance,
it really permeates pretty much everything that we practice or encourage on our Dharma
path.
It's there from the very beginning, starting with our posture, you know, when we first
learn to sit, and it continues right through to the end.
The first time you encountered mindfulness meditation practice, you've probably heard
an instruction about having a posture that is both upright and relaxed.
And I'm sure I'll remind you about that when we get to the meditation.
And alert and relaxed in the mind.
So this combination of alertness and relaxation of ease and energy, that's a balance that
continues throughout our entire life of practice.
So I'll talk about finding balance in regard to different mental factors, different qualities
of heart and mind.
But for now, I'd like us to begin by settling in with a period of sitting meditation.
So if you'd like to assume a meditation posture.
If you're sitting in a chair, you know, it's really good to have your feet flat on the
floor, not not would you just your if your feet don't touch the floor.
That's not good.
You have a pillow or something underneath them so that your knees are not creating the
backs of your knees aren't creating pressure on that on the chair, which can become uncomfortable
relatively soon actually cause a lot of restlessness that might not need to be there.
So flat on the floor if you're if you're in a chair, if you're on the floor, make sure
your back has a slightly, you know, a little little arch in the back with your with your
spine upright, let your arms hang loosely at your sides.
Your hands can be in your lap or on your thighs.
And it's really good not to have your your your for your elbows ahead of your torso in
front of your torso, keep your elbows next to your sides.
That's that alleviates any tendency to develop tension in the trapezius muscles up around
your the tops of your shoulders and your neck.
And then you might spend a little bit of time just doing that kind of a body scan looking
for areas of tension, starting with your forehead, maybe there's a frown there or a
squint, seeing if you can just let that ease up, let that relax a little bit, just inviting
ease into every area where there's a little bit of tension, maybe some residue from the
activity that you were in before you joined the retreat, maybe some tension just in anticipation
of practicing today, just letting the body rest the balance of ease and just enough effort
to keep yourself upright, softening everything that doesn't isn't necessary to keeping you
upright, so there's the balance of ease and effort in our posture and also in the quality
of attention.
You might invite a receptive quality in your attention, it's allowing experience to come
to you rather than reaching out for it, trying to grasp at it.
And now I'll suggest using the breath, the sensations of breathing as the anchor for
our practice, but if that isn't a good anchor for you, please don't feel obligated to use
it, you can use another sensation, another bodily sensation, perhaps the feeling of
your hands, wherever they are in your lap or on your thighs, the feeling of the buttocks
on the seat, the solidity there, whatever physical sensation is useful to you as an
anchor, so you gradually let the body soften, while still maintaining an alertness, so
sometimes it sounds like that's a paradox, but actually it's something we really learn
to embody, a relaxed alertness, letting the wheels of thinking gradually slow down, gradually
come to rest as much as possible, if the breath is a good anchor for you, I invite you to
turn your attention towards it, you can attend to the sensations wherever they're most prominent
for you, the nostrils or in the throat or in the chest and belly, or perhaps just follow
the whole flow of the breath as it comes in and as it goes out, whichever is most conducive
to staying present to what's happening right now.
And as you sit, why don't you just ask yourself every few minutes, is there ease and is there
awakeness, am I alert, am I relaxed, as relaxed as I can be, no straining, it's staying present,
it's staying present.
And again, just checking in, is there tension, is there tension in the forehead, am I straining,
is there tension in the jaw, throat, anywhere, just let that ease up, no need to strain,
the breath can be numb, you don't have to go looking for it, nice and easy, you're still
awake.
Most minds have a tendency to go off into fantasy or thought, maybe solving problems,
maybe planning many ways to get distracted from being present to what's happening right
now in our moment-to-moment experience, and when we notice that in our practice, we very,
very gently just let the attention return to our breathing, to what's arising now,
right now, as we sit, and again, just check in, is there tension, is there tension maybe
associated with thinking, or with straining, to stay connected, and just see if you can
let that ease up, and if the opposite is true, if there's dullness, vagueness, try to bring
a little more interest into the mind, interest in the details of breathing, the details of
physical sensation, there's a way of bringing awakeness to the mind, always tuning ourselves
to that balance, the sweet spot.
Thank you.
So I, I, uh, I'll turn off this and see.
I ended the meditation a little bit early because I want to, excuse me, give some walking meditation
instructions before our first walking period.
And if, for those of you who've done a lot of walking practice in the, in the past and
don't want to hear anymore, it's fine to just, you can turn off your, your, uh, video and
go start.
I would really encourage you to do that.
But if you'd like to hear, um, I'll just give a few instructions.
Normally, um, the way we do walking practice, which is just, it is mindfulness practice
as we're walking, um, the way we do it in this tradition, the inside tradition is to
choose a, uh, a path, um, about 20 to 30 paces long, um, anywhere inside or outdoors, um,
and to walk back and forth mindfully.
And some people like to walk very, very slowly, just lifting and moving and placing each foot
in succession very slowly, and some people will walk at a more kind of ordinary pace,
walking pace, and it depends, do you know, the speed you choose depends on what keeps
you mindful, what keeps you connected to the activity of walking, often we suggest that
people pay attention to the, uh, the movement of their feet, the sensations in the feet,
the sensations of movement, the sensation of pressure when we put the foot down, each
foot down.
But, um, I also personally, I really like to key into, uh, the movement of my legs,
the bending of the knees and the hip joints, you know, as the thighs raise, all of the
whole movement really kind of connects me in a, in a lovely way, and sometimes to the
whole body, the sense of movement through space.
So the, what's important is not what particular area of sensation of movement you pay attention
to, it's that you stay connected to the sensations, to the, your present moment experience.
And of course, when we're walking, usually we have our eyes open, so there's a lot more
opportunity to get distracted by something that's interesting, especially during spring
time right now in California, it's absolutely exquisite, so, you know, we haven't had rain
for so long, we had such a rainy winter, it's beautiful, so it's very easy to want to look
at the birds and the butterflies and the flowers, and that's okay, as long as you recognize
now I'm looking, now I'm seeing, and it's good to stop at that point, stop, look, and
then begin to walk again, attending to the sensations of movement.
And it's, you know, what we're trying to do is to build a continuity of mindfulness,
a continuity of attention that goes through both sitting and walking, and all the other
activities of the day.
And if you need to do some chore in this next period, that's okay, that also can be a meditation
and whatever we do can be a meditation, paying attention to the sensations in the body, movement
of our limbs, the attitude in our mind, if we can include that as well, it might be good
to stay with the movement of the limbs, especially this early in the day.
And if you have a movement practice, that is a mindful practice, something like, you
know, Tai Chi, Yoga, Chi Gong, it's fine to do that also, instead of the walking practice,
just maintaining it as a mindfulness practice, and so that we're really connected, you're
very connected to present moment experience.
So I think that's probably enough for now, we'll have a bit of time for questions about
both walking and sitting practice before lunch, so if you have questions, you can put them
in the question basket or ask them then.
And we'll be coming back in 20 minutes at 10, 20 for the next sit, so please be ready
to meditate in the seated position again after you're meditating in another posture during
at least 20 minutes, so I'll see you then.
So once again as we, in a formal sitting session, it's always useful to pay some attention
to the posture that we take for meditation, to reestablish that balance of alertness,
uprightness, and ease.
Sometimes we talk about sitting like a mountain, you know, with a strong foundation, a sense
of subtleness, and a kind of internal attitude of respect, so what we're doing is really
worthy of respect, so once you've found the posture that really supports your ability
to stay connected to your present moment experience, and you can turn your attention
to the breathing, and if you'd like to expand that awareness to other physical sensations,
that's fine.
If you have a long-standing practice, it's fine to practice in, you know, whatever way
that you normally do, but being aware of whatever you choose to be aware of, but checking in
occasionally to see what's the balance of alertness and ease that's in my body and mind
right now.
It can be helpful if we do find ourselves tending to strain, to frown, or kind of furrow
the brow in a kind of over-efforting.
If we just put a little bit of a smile on the face, just a very, very subtle smile, it's
almost impossible to frown and smile at the same time, and it takes a lot less effort,
there's a lot fewer muscles involved in smiling than there are in frowning, so it can be a
way of softening any tension that's there in physical, which is usually a reflection
of mental tension.
And we can look directly at the mental tension.
He said Gil Franzal often says, you know, relax the thinking muscle, you know, there
isn't really, of course, a muscle involved in thinking that we know of, but I think
the metaphor works really well for some of us to be able to actually kind of key into
the sense of slight tension that all thinking has within it, and to be able to just let
that soften up a little bit.
So again, as we said, I might point you to physical sensation from time to time, and
to that balance, you know, to the sense of any straining that might be occurring, or
any falling into a kind of vagueness or disconnection from the meditation, from the present moment
experience of whatever is arising in this moment.
So settle, tune in to physical sensations of breathing, other sensations if you like, staying
connected to what's happening now, and maybe with that little bit of a smile, especially
if you're prone to straining, sensation is always happening within our bodies, even when
we're just sitting still, and nothing is happening, and there's no pain in the body,
there's still always sensation, and as we tune into it, it can become more prominent
or noticeable, just turning attention right now to the hands, might be tingling, pulsation,
just little sparks of sensation, and there's no need to strain
in order to feel the sensations, they can just be received as they arise, and then persist
for a while, and then probably change.
It's useful to notice the effect of our attention on our state of mind.
Is there a quality of tension in the attention itself, in the way that we're looking?
If there is, we can ease that up, just let it soften, look with an easy gaze.
Whatever is arising, the sensations of breathing, other sensations, whatever it is, it can be
an easeful awareness, again just checking in, is there awareness, awakeness, is there
ease, relaxation, bringing the two into balance?
Yes.
