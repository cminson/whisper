Dharmette: Q &A – Habits , Anxiety, 
Mental Decline  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by 
Gil Fronsdal on May 1, 2013  
 
 
My preference or intuition is to try to respond to 
some of the questions you might have. If you 
don’t have any questions, then we will figure out 
something else for  these  fifteen minutes. What is 
on your minds about practice?  
 
Participant 1 : I am looking at some 
circumstances, things I need to do. I am thinking 
about how I feel about them , and w hy I feel that 
way. I have habits about them , and I think the 
habits are who I am. I need to go to New York 
next week to take care of some things, but there 
are other issues around it. I am comfortable 
enough now with ignoring the habits , or breaking  
the habits. I am not exactly sure what I am trying 
to ask here. I sort of know what I want to do , and 
think is the right thing to do. There is some 
discomfort . There are some fears , but they 
aren’t really as strong as they might have been a year ago. I don’t know if I can tease a question 
out of this.  
 
Gil: What is the question?  
 
Participant 1:  I gue ss to make it a question , I 
can say that I don’t want to just react , and say 
that this is a habit I am going to do one way or 
the opposite way. I want to do this skillfully , and 
am looking for the means , or how to place 
myself in the circumstances.  
 
Gil: I can appreciate this. One of the great 
supports is always to be honest. So to be honest 
to yourself as best as you can be. To other 
people around you , you can be honest and say, 
“I have this habit ; I have this reaction ; I have this 
response around certain things , and the 
pressure is building up. This is what is 
happening again.” Just lay it out on the table  for 
yourself . The more fully you can acknowledge it 
to yourself , the better. Write it down in a journal 
in big letters. It’s happening – just describe it. 
There is something very powerful about being 
honest. If other people are involved in the whole 
scene , and you trust them enough, tell them 
know what is happening fo r you. Sometimes that 
kind of honesty shifts your relationship to it , and gives you clarity about what is going on. That is 
one thing.  
 
Another thing that occurs to me is that 
meditation practice is very helpful and important . 
One of the functions of medi tation practice is to 
be the place where you put down your habits 
fully and thoroughly . Then you have a reference 
point for what it is like not to have the habit 
active. The more fully you can put down your 
habits in meditation, like thinking  and reacting in 
this way , the more this will highlight  how it is 
when you are stuck in the habit.   
 
Then you can  begin to  have more choice. Even 
more, you can come to zero in meditation. The 
more you can become simple in meditation , the 
more you can  just be. You have t o let go of a lot, 
and so the muscle of letting go becomes 
stronger. Then when you come up against real 
life situation s where habits kick in, y ou have 
more ability to let go , and that’s  what is called 
for.  
 
Those are my answers to the question.  
 
Participant 2 : Speaking to th is question, I find 
that if I try to go against the stream – my habits are more obsessive -compulsive than anything , 
so I try not to dot those i’s and cross those t’s, 
and be less impulsive. This  brings up some 
anxiety. When I a m meditating, if I can relive that 
in this very relaxed situation, it helps.   
 
Gil: It helps to relieve the anxiety?  
 
Participant 2: Yeah  – provoke it by imagining a 
situation.  
 
Gil: So when you provoke the anxiety, but don’t 
act compulsively, h ow does e voking that anxiety 
benefit you?  
 
Participant 2: Doing it in a relaxed situation is 
sort of like desensitizing a phobia.  
 
Gil: Ah, great. So, later when out in life again, 
the anxiety might come up , but you are familiar 
with it, less likely to be tripped up by it.  
 
Participant 2: Yeah, this is sort of a relaxation 
response.  
 
Gil: So rather than taking the habit as a given, 
you are looking behind the habit, behind the 
conditioning to see the emotions and feelings that might be the soil out of which it grows. Then 
you are bringing your attention to that , settling 
something , and deconditioning yourself. Great. 
Lovely.  
 
Participant 3 : I think my question may dovetail 
onto this a little. In terms of being aware of my 
habits, I am pretty good if the stakes aren’t too 
high, but when the stakes become high, the 
anxiety kicks in , and then I want to control 
things. So those seem to be the places to look at  
and let go . 
 
Gil: So you are saying that when the stakes  are 
high, there’s more anxiety and the habits kick in 
more . And when the stakes are higher, the 
anxiety is higher, and those are  the important 
place s to bring  into your practice. Perfect. Yes!  
 
Participant 3: How do you do that? [laughter]  
 
Gil: How do you do it? Here is a little mantra that 
you could  say to yourself , and see what that stirs 
up or highlights. The mantra is : “When there is a 
lot at stake, repeat to yourself a few times : 
“There is nothing at stake.” ” See what happens. 
Is there pro test? What do you mean there is 
nothing at stake? There is a lot at stake. Well, what is really at stake? What is behind the 
stake? Listen to your protests, your arguments, 
and say it again, “There is nothing at stake.” 
What is the wisdom of that stake? Th ere might 
be things at stake , but maybe that is only one 
side of the coin. Maybe there’s another side of 
the coin – the nothing -at-stake side. So try that 
mantra. See what it does for you. Look for 
situations where there is a lot at stake  so you 
can use th e mantra . 
 
Participant 1: I just started a book study group 
this week. The book is titled I Am That . One o f 
the mantras the author uses  that seemed to 
bring him to some level of liberation is “I am not 
that.” When  looking at everything  – my habits, 
my perceptions, the traffic , whatever it is  – 
instead of responding in the usual way, you just  
acknowledg e, “Okay,  I am not really that  traffic. 
I’m really not this conflict (or whatever it is that 
might be coming up ).” I am working with that . It 
is kind of a comforting thing to hold onto , going 
about the day.  
 
Gil: Beautiful, a lovely thing.  
 
Participant 4: I have a practical question I want 
to ask your advice on. I have a grandfather who is having some safety challenges  driving. He  
lives in a state where lega lly he is allowed to 
drive until the age of 100. So I am the person in 
the family responsible for hav ing some kind of 
compassionate conversation with him about our 
concerns. I am afraid I might come across too 
strong , and end up hurtin g his feelings. I just 
want  to ask your advice.  
 
Gil: So you are the grandchild? His kids are no 
longer alive?  
 
Participan t 4: Actually they are alive , but they 
have had their own difficulties in having this 
conversation.  My grandfathe r hit a cyclist. 
Fortunately, no one  was hurt , but my 
grandfather  wasn’t aware , and did not choose to 
stop. It feels lik e I need to be a bit more stern 
now.  
 
Gil: If he continued after hitting a cyclist, then it 
is very serious. In most states it is hit -and-run. 
Wouldn’t the police or the court system get 
interested in an old man’s m ental state? Can 
you talk to the police? They might have an 
important role.  
 A relative of mine needed to stop driving , and it 
was a doctor who said what had to happen. A 
doctor can give written orders through the court 
or the DMV. There may be other , non -family  
ways of doing this . Some p eople are eager to 
offer ideas after it is over.  
 
In terms of how to have that conversation, I had 
a conversation like this  with a family member 
recently. The person agreed , but didn’t believe it 
was necessary. He kept saying, “I am only doing 
it for you.” It takes a lot of skill to have th ese 
conversations. You have to know the person 
well: what is effective with them, what i s 
meaningful. Then make the point in a caring, 
compassionate way , but also a way that is clear. 
I wish you luck with that. It is not easy.
