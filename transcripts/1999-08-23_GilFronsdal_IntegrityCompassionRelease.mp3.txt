 Green Gulch, Zen Center. I spent the week there. And I met a, I talked for a while with an old friend of mine who was one of the senior priests there. He was about to leave Zen Center after living there many years and kind of go off on her own. So in the spur of the moment I asked her, well after all these years, no I asked her a number of questions, but I asked her, after all these years at Zen Center, what have you, how has it affected you? How are you different? Seems like a really good question. I was going to reflect back on all those years. And she gave a nice answer. She said, I think I'm much more tolerant of others now than I used to be. Much more open-minded and broad-minded. I like the answer. But what it did for me also, it stimulated me to ask the same question of myself. How all these years of practice that I've had, how has that affected me? And a kind of immediate train of thought was I came up with three stages in a sense of what my practice and how it affected me. And I thought that it might be somewhat interesting to take these categories and talk about them a little bit. And I came up with kind of three broad stages. The first stage was a period of my practice, was primarily about developing, I didn't use the word, this is the word back then, but now integrity, discovering what integrity is. And the next phase was a lot about discovering about love. Loving kindness, love, compassion, tenderness of heart. And then the third phase was discovering something about release, which is my favorite word for liberation or awakening in the Buddhist tradition. And I spent some time after that thinking, well, what about this later years now? There must be some other phase that's development after that. What have I done? I thought about, I couldn't come up with a good one. And I thought, well, maybe that's enough. And rather than thinking that there's supposed to be something above that, what it is now is just do it over again and do it deeper and more thoroughly. It's kind of an endless process of discovering deeper levels of integrity, of love and release. When I first came, started doing Buddhist practice, I was doing Zen practice and I was in college and I started practicing pretty seriously. After initial kind of introduction to Zen practice, I thought, I kind of came to start doing Zazen, Zen meditation. It felt very much at home in it. And the sense of being at home in that Zen meditation, even though it was very difficult and very painful, was something which I had never experienced before in such a, I never had access to it in any kind of sustained way in the way that I could just through meditation. And so I felt very strongly drawn to doing more meditation. And I had some, it took me about two or three years of kind of doing various things and getting my life a little bit in order. I had enough sense when I was 20 that I had to get my life a little bit better in order before I could really devote myself to a spiritual practice. So rather than throwing myself in before my life was in order, I spent three years getting in order. And so after three years, I, so the first year I didn't do much sitting, but the second two years of a three-year period, I started a daily meditation practice at home and I meditated twice a day, 40 minutes each time. And I was very strongly drawn to do that because, partly because I was unhappy in my life. I felt that kind of annoying kind of ache inside of me. Something was wrong with, was wrong. Something uncomfortable, some dissatisfaction. I felt lonely, I felt a little bit out of place. And I felt somehow that meditation practice was going to help me with this kind of angst or anxiety or achiness that I had. It'll make me a better person and it helped me how to get more friends because I wanted, you know, I felt kind of lonely. I thought, you know, I, I seem like somehow I thought that was a good way to make more friends and sit quietly in my room by myself and meditate. Did it work? Oh, did it work? And what happened after some time was that those concerns evaporated. And so rather than, rather than that those concerns were solved per se, the concerns or the source of those concerns disappeared for me. And I've said to all this story many times, but I found it very strange that after those initial motivations to meditate disappeared, that I kept doing it anyway. And I thought it was very strange that I should do something then without any reason. And I spent a lot of time reflecting because I was kind of, I'm kind of a rational kind of person who needs reasons for what I do. I used to, used to very much so. And I kept, was doing this thing without any reasons. I thought it was very, very peculiar. And I found out that after some time the best understanding I could come to for myself was that my daily sitting practice was the deepest form of self-expression that I had available to myself. And nowadays when I look back at that, I understand it to be a deeper sense of integrity, of wholeness, of being at home in myself, the deepest sense of being at ease, not just with the world necessarily, but deeply at ease with myself. So that the normal, you know, preoccupations and anxieties of the small mind, of the egotistical mind, wasn't operating so much in the quiet of meditation. My fears, my insecurities, my ambitions and desires, my defenses of how I want to protect myself and my concerns about how people saw me and my concerns of being liked or not liked and my concerns about, you know, school and I was in college then. They all seemed to kind of recede from me, kind of like, kind of like falling off as I sit down to meditate. It's kind of like, you know, and I was left with some kind of state of contentment or ease. It wasn't very dramatic, but somewhere those kind of things weren't operating so strongly. And I was very strongly attracted to that state, kind of in an almost subconscious kind of way, kind of pull towards this way of being. And so the only way I had access to it was through my sitting practice. And so I sat every day to touch into that. And I felt lucky, I think I was lucky that my first years of meditation practice, I knew actually very little about meditation. In Zen tradition, they don't teach you very much practical stuff. They don't have five-week introductory courses like I teach here. I teach you to kind of mess people's minds up by telling them so much information. So I didn't have much instruction and so I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know what I was doing as a meditator. I just sat there and I had some notion that sitting there meant just sitting there accepting myself, accepting the situation as it was. And I didn't know about concentration, so I didn't burden myself with the notion that I was supposed to get concentrated. I didn't even know any clear idea about supposed to be in the present moment. Exactly, I just knew I was supposed to accept what was here right now. And so my mind wondered a lot, but that was okay because I didn't know I wasn't supposed to. And so from one point of view, I was kind of a dim-witted meditator. But another point of view, it was actually very wise. I was kind of beginner's luck because I didn't have all these ideas of trying to get something and accomplish something and that I should be different than who I was. And so I was just able to sit there two times a day for 40 minutes and just let all the various activities of the mind, which was always trying to improve on the situation or get away from a situation or protect myself or all those things kind of, and let them kind of just unwind themselves. And very much the experience in the early years of sitting for me was experience of unwinding all these habits and reactions of the mind, which for me was very much fear-based. And from that place, a sense of, or I call now a sense of integrity, arose. And I understand now over the years as a sense of integrity or purity of heart, it tends to become stronger for me. That really feels to me as one of the greatest treasures that I have. It's the greatest wealth that I have, one of the greatest wealth. It counts for me much more than financial wealth or material wealth, and I would be quite willing to sacrifice my material well-being sooner than sacrificing any sense of this inner sense of virtue or integrity or wholeness or this place in the heart that I know. And it was very interesting to me to watch how in meditation practice I could touch into some sense, it wasn't a very dramatic sense, but some sense of integrity. And you have to realize, the reference point for whatever little sense of integrity I had was my completely neurotic, anxious 21-year-old mind. It was completely confused and upset and anxious. So the difference was quite huge. So it wasn't like I had any great accomplishment, it was just that I had relaxed a teeny bit. But it was quite different, the state of my being, my heart, my mind, in meditation and in my daily life. It was very interesting for me to watch, to notice and track the difference and how it would go back into my normal life for my meditation sessions, and how quickly my preoccupations and anxieties came flooding back. It was also very interesting to notice how my sense of virtue or morality or ethics or my integrity varied depending on how close I was in touch with this place I discovered in meditation versus how far away I was from it when I got completely lost in my anxieties, concerns and busyness of my life. And in fact, there were things that I simply wouldn't want to do. It felt like a great transgression against myself when I was in touch with a place of meditation that I was willing to do almost unconsciously if I was kind of harried and running around being busy and full of preoccupations. And I started to have tremendous respect for that sense and sense of integrity or contentment or ease that I touched in even lightly in my meditation because I saw the difference in my morality and the things I said and would tend to do depending on the state of mind that I was in. And maybe many of you have had the same experience. It's best not to talk ethics with people, ethical ideas when they're harried. You know, wait until they're really calm and settled and really kind of in touch with themselves. And then you can listen to them. You can have a much more sincere conversation, much more deep. And then in that early years of my practice, part of my motivation to keep practicing and the decisions I made to further my practice was not the opportunities to go deeper in meditation, it was the opportunities to extend that sense of integrity into my daily life. So there wasn't such a big gap or separation between the two. And oddly enough, I looked for Buddhist meditation centers as places where I could do this integration work. So I went to meditation centers not to do intensive meditation per se, but I wanted to be around other people who were trying to do the integration work also. And so I could start learning how to speak with people and not be full of my own ego trips. That is the word I had back then about how I speaking based on how I wanted people to see me versus just speaking what needed to be said. And that was a very hard lesson for me to learn. And I wanted to be around people who could support me in that effort. So I moved to San Francisco Zen Center and found it very helpful. And after being there for some time, I wanted to do it even more thoroughly. I could see them how I wanted to do it more completely in my daily life. And so I wanted a more intensive situation where it's kind of the whole situation, the whole context of the training situation was focusing on being mindful and present and practicing all day long. So first I went to Green Gulch, lived there at Green Gulch Farm. And then I went down to for about two and a half, three years to Tassajara monastery. And really the motivation to go again was not the fact that they sat, did much more meditation at the monastery. It wasn't really the motivation. The motivation was here was a setting where the whole day was organized around trying to live out of this place in integrity. And that's what I wanted. I wanted to have experience of living the whole day that way and not kind of losing touch with it because I was running around being busy and all that. And so that was kind of my first phase. And then I would say it was kind of semi-conscious all this. What I find peculiar when I look back at my years of practice is the important things that were really happening to me in retrospect, I was not aware of while they were happening. And so many of us are measuring our progress and how well we're doing. And we have this idea of what's really important for our meditation practice and our spiritual life. And we're measuring that iota of differences in concentration from one day to the next or whatever, and or calmness or whatever. And it might have actually absolutely no importance at all how concentrated you get. It's important that you try, but how concentrated it might not matter. It would matter perhaps as you becoming more compassionate or you're just discovering a sense of kind of ease of heart or contentment or subtleness or self-acceptance. And you might not see that this is happening until years later, as in my case. So the next phase is especially this way. So I was there at the monastery doing my practice and loved it. I was very happy in the monastery. And you'll think the next statement is being very peculiar. But my sense of living at the monastery was this was the perfect lifestyle. You think of that. I just thought it was a perfect lifestyle. It wasn't like a matter of, you know, I just I didn't want to live any other way. It just seemed like a perfect way to live. Getting up at 4 30 in the morning. And I continue with my practice there. And what slowly started to happen there in that context of a more intensive practice and feeling my life with the Dharma is some of the places of metaphorically on my heart that were guarded or held or protected, resistant to the world of people around me or just simply too distracted to have it in my heart to be sensitive enough to people in the world around me. I started to become the shield started to drop and the preoccupation started to disappear. And this sensitivity, a tenderness and a sensitivity of heart, which is probably the best way of describing it, started to kind of blossom in my chest, in my being. It felt like very much like my chest area was kind of becoming more and more expensive and almost open and like someone had taken a shield off. And I felt tremendously sensitive to the people around me and thrilled with kind of a love and compassion and delight and kind of a feeling of wanting, kind of naturally wanting to respond to people. My first summer at Tassajara, I was I spent a lot of my free time, most of my free time, working in the garden. And I remember I'd get up in the morning and when I had a break and I would just walk around the garden and it was very difficult to be a gardener because I wouldn't want to work. All I wanted to do was walk around the garden and look at all the plants and see how they're doing. I just felt this, you know, tremendous kind of heart connection with each plant. I just wanted to look and see. So, you know, plants are plants, nice. But there was that sense of kind of maternal, the word I used was kind of maternal care, a sense it was arising inside of me in the monastery. And from that also came a tremendous capacity for me of feeling, maybe the word heartbreak is a good word, heartbreak for the suffering of the world. I remember sometimes reading some newspapers or magazines of the times and just feeling this tremendous pain of the world because it just felt that was happening to me or happening. And, you know, this is, you know, endless examples of this kind of situation, but because of the particular time in my life when I was so open, there was this Israeli bombing of Beirut in the early 80s. It was quite dramatic and I'd been to Beirut as a child. So it was kind of, I'd grown up when the part of my growing up was in the shores of the Mediterranean in Italy. So I felt like it was, you know, in my backyard, kind of I knew the place and they were bombing it. I remember opening up Time magazine and seeing photographs and reading it and feeling tremendously a pain and grieved by this and feeling it was so right for me to feel it. Not that it was right things to be happening, but just it was the suffering of the world. This kind of suffering has gone on since the beginning of humanity and will continue for a long time still. And the fact that it's happening, it felt like it was, you know, I felt that the first time that I was a participant in this suffering in the world, in these kinds of atrocities, I wasn't just someone, you know, deep in the mountains of California in isolated monastery, but I felt like I was a participant in those events. And it's very, it was very shocking to me. It was very deeply moved by that. And I remember feeling all this, you know, tremendous openness to people around me and feeling a lot of love. There's a stage of practice that some people describe where it's a little bit dangerous, a stage of practice. And that's a stage of practice, it's too easy to fall in love. You just fall in love with everyone. And, you know, you have to be a little bit careful about how you fall in love. And some practitioners then will confuse falling in love, which is a wonderful thing, with kind of romantic love, which is maybe a different kind of love. And so if people aren't clear about the difference, then you can get into trouble. But you know, falling in love with everyone was just really great. And I didn't know, I didn't have any sense that this was supposed to be happening in practice, I just knew it was happening. It wasn't my intention for it to happen, it wasn't planning on happening. I didn't know, I didn't really have any idea that it was supposed to happen, but it was what happened. It was great. And I remember also as part of this feeling, this sensitivity, openness of heart, this love that was happening, I felt it was also born inside of me a movement of response. I remember one of the Zen Center teachers came, one of the abbots was there one day, and I hadn't seen him for quite a while. And I was passing him in the pathway and I kind of whispered to him and I said, you know, I think I'm becoming a response machine. And I meant that, machine is kind of a cold word, but what I meant was that I would kind of start feeling the situations around me, both with people and just with the kind of thing where many of us have, you see litter on the street, and you don't think about it particularly, but you maybe pick it up and put it in a trash can. You just kind of do it, just, you know, no one's watching, so you're not going to get any credit for it, you're not doing drug reason. So it was that, I kind of, the world opened up in that way. It seemed like the world was full of things needed responding to. And I was just there in a present way and it just felt like I was just there to respond. And it wasn't like me, there wasn't the self that was responding, it just had to be done. And it came out of the sensitivities, open heartedness, this compassion and love that was arising inside of me. And it was great. And I use these words like great adjectives. I want to be careful and tell you, and warn you, it wasn't that it was like it was great experiences of love. You just have to realize where I was coming from. So you don't set me up with some pedestals, you know, like Gil was just full of radiant love and, you know, and, you know, it just with the contrast was so great that I can talk about it. And so then I stumbled my way in a sense into Vipassana in Thailand, kind of by accident, ended up on a Vipassana retreat. And the context, and in doing this mindfulness practice in a very intensive way, in my first long retreat, I got much more, much quieter and stiller, more concentrated than I ever had been before in my life. And in that depth, really, I felt like I just dropped into a deep, deep, deep, deep quiet, deep place inside of me, the core of what I was, was a sense I had. And in that place, there seemed to be some sense of self, like some core sense of self that just, we all have some sense of self in a kind of generic way, but some core kernel of sense of this is, you know, a sense of self. And you're still being somewhat naive Buddhist. I didn't have any idea that was wrong. You know, people learn too much Buddhism, listen to me Dharma talks by Gill or something, will have this idea that Buddhism is about no self. And so if you find this core seed of self inside of you, you know, you're wrong. But I was lucky. I didn't have that idea. So I just found this little sense, this core, core sense of self in that retreat. And then I left the retreat. And what was peculiar was it became essential for me to go and touch that place again. And I had never touched this place and I had no sense I was supposed to get rid of it, but I knew I had to go and find that and touch that place, that deep, deep place of the kernel or seed of self. And it became kind of a dark night of the soul time for me in my practice. Because nothing else in the world had any importance for me compared to coming back and touching that place. And it was peculiar, you know, I had no particular reference for this need, this compulsion almost, this burning desire, motivation, but I had no other choice but to somehow go back into the situation and touch that place again. And until I had the opportunity, it was kind of like I was actually somewhat depressed and and out of sorts. And finally I got the opportunity to go back to Southeast Asia. I went to Burma and practiced there some more. And in the context of practicing even longer in Vipassana, in my practice of Vipassana, I discovered the next phase of what I call, you know, these three three phases, integrity, love and release. And I discovered something about the nature of release of perhaps what the Buddhist tradition calls liberation or awakening. And it was very, it turned out to be very closely tied to this core sense of kernel of sense of self that I felt. And that the experience of release is an experience where the simplest way of saying it is that where the last or any remnants of clinging, of possessiveness, of clinging, of resistance to the world are released from our consciousness, from our awareness, from our presence. And that released consciousness is kind of unique because it's certainly a normal way of kind of experiencing the world is to have, we have awareness and we identify that awareness with something as being the self. Some people will say that my body is myself or my feelings myself, my thinking is myself, my kind of generic sense of self is myself. But all those are actually objects that exist within our awareness. And it's a kind of way in which we shackle our awareness and we identify strongly to something as being this is who I am. But to be released is to have that awareness in a kind of funny way without it identified to anything in the world as being itself, including itself. So it's kind of like if you ever had the experience where I don't know if this is a good example but maybe a big glass window is really big and it's really clean and you think it's a door and you just walk into it and suddenly you realize it's there. It's kind of like trying to use your right hand to touch your right elbow. You know, consciousness which doesn't have an object for itself, doesn't relate to anything as being itself, you can't really get to it because it's like how do you get to the elbow. So, but the experience of release to not to have an experience of, I don't even like to use the word experience because that is seemingly too closely subject to the conditioned world. But to have the, maybe just simply to have the release of our clinging, to have the release of all the subtlest forms of, the grossest and subtlest forms of holding a fear of attachment, of holding some idea of who I am, some assumptions of who we need to be, is really one of the most marvelous things that we can experience in life. And in some sense it can be a culmination of the earlier two stages of the development of integrity and development of love. And I think the Buddhist tradition itself stresses that the ultimate goal is this release and it's very important not to confuse integrity or love for the ultimate goal, the goal of release. And it can be so satisfying the experience of integrity, the purity that comes from having a moral heart, that a person can just simply take that to be the goal of the spiritual life. And it can be so satisfying to be filled with love. And a person, people who meditate tend to experience love much more powerfully than any other people because the strength of love is very much dependent on the strength of your concentration. The greater the concentration, the greater the capacity for love is. And you know it's possible to be frozen in your tracks because the love is so powerful. You simply can't move. Kind of waves of waves of cascading, a sense of joy and delight and love just kind of moving through you. And it's very easy to kind of think well that's great, you know, love, you know, some people hold love as being kind of the ultimate good. But in both the sense of integrity and in the sense of great love or great compassion or great kindness, great concentrated states, there can still be very subtle forms of clinging to I'm making, to making some sense of this is who I am. To say oh the love is who I am, the capacity to love is who I am. Or something else, it kind of has some sense of I'm making, to create some sense of self out of that and to hold on to that. And as long as some sense of, and also a very subtle sense of not really wanting to see reality for what it really is. The very subtle shifting the gaze away from really understanding, really seeing deeply what's really happening here in our hearts. And the experience of release is really, ultimately this experience of releasing this any notion of identification, any notion of assuming anything as a self and holding on to that or possessing that. But to have a mind that doesn't waste any time, have an awareness, have a presence, that doesn't waste any time assuming what it is. Isn't that great? Wouldn't it be great to go around life and not have to assume who you are first? So, and then I thought kind of very roughly these, when I first thought this is not enough, to have these three stages, I had to have them another stage. Then I remembered, oh, but the Buddha had three stages also for practice and they were awfully comparable to kind of things that spontaneously arose in my mind. The first is ethics, which is the same as integrity. And the second is concentration, which I think states of deep concentration, rather than being kind of a willful force, kind of intense feeling to them, often come with a great expansiveness of being, of presence, of heart, and can often come with tremendous joy and delight and love. And then release, which is the Buddha talked about the wisdom, so ethics, concentration, and wisdom. The wise mind is the mind that has been released, understands release. And then for my own sake, having gone through these, I don't feel in any kind of way that a Buddhist practice has finished cooking me. And I'm still being cooked and cooked alive. And it's kind of like I have to do it even more thoroughly and do it again and refine all this more. And there's more for me to discover and more for me to realize and purify and release within me. So I continue on this path of integrity, of love, and release. And I believe that they are our greatest treasures that we can have inside of ourselves. And if you have those three as your treasures, as your wealth, not much else happens that happens to you in your life will make that much difference. The path of love, I just kind of wanted to say this earlier, the middle section of love or compassion remains and was very important remains a very important part of me, because it provides a great deal of the motivation for me for continuing to practice. Because I don't practice just for myself, but it seems that sense of responding to the world and the world of suffering around me is very important for me. And that sense of responding is an act of compassion. And my choice to kind of go and to throw my life fully into the world of dharma practice is just, you know, that make basically my livelihood from that and make my life, the whole life that was a motivation based on this experience of compassion. And the experience of release tells me it's very important not to stop just to be compassionate, but the compassion has to be informed by the experience of release so that we don't get it. All kinds of problems can arise if you don't understand release. We start identifying with our compassionate acts. I'm the one who's doing this. It's being done. So that's my talk. I hope that was okay to give a personal talk. There's a tradition in Buddhism for dharma teachers. It's more in Asia. You won't notice this in the West so much. But in Asia, dharma teachers not to talk about themselves. And so it's kind of interesting to reflect on why they might not want to do that. But anyway, in the West we seem to talk about ourselves a lot. May all of America be released from self. Thank you all very much.
