Dharmette : The Dharma  Rains on All of 
Us

It’s raining today . I want to offer one of my favorite 
stories or similes from the Buddhist tradition  that has to 
do with the rain. It’s from the Mahayana Buddhist S utra 
called the “Lotus Sutra .” It talks about how when it rains 
in the fo rest, it rains on the big trees, the small trees, the 
bushes, and  the little plants in the ground. Each  
according to its need takes up the water it need s to 
grow  and thrive on. The big trees soak up a lot of rain , 
and the plants take up a little bit , each according to its 
need. It is the  same  with the Dharma . The Dharma  is 
raining on us all the time. Each of us takes up what we 
need. Some of us are big trees ; some of us are little 
trees ; and some of us are bushes. Each of us is 
different . Perhaps  I shouldn’t use the idea of big and 
small , but each of us is unique and has our own way. 
So the Dharma  is really vast , and each of us takes in 
what we need – what’s appropriate given our 
circumstance  and life.  
 
One of the reasons I like this story is because  there’s no 
sense of obligation. It isn’ t like we have to rush out now and gather all the possible rainwater – the Dharma  – 
and get it and hoard it . The Dharma  – the teachings, the 
practices, the nature of reality – is available  to each of 
us according to our own need . No one is requiring us to 
drink any of it , but it’s there. First we’re  soaking it in , and 
we take up what we n eed. In different circumstances, 
different times and different days, we might need 
different things. Sometimes  we need a big dose  of the 
Dharma , and sometimes we just need a little  bit to 
provide the support to keep us going . When we hear 
teachings, we take in something, and maybe a week 
later, we remember those teachings and take in 
something else.  
 
In the Buddhist tradition, there’s  many ways o f listening 
to a Dharma  talk. One interesting way is to sit and 
meditate. You don’t think about what you’re hearing . But 
just let it come through , like the wind coming  through an 
open door, trusting that whatever you need to hear will 
stay. Otherwise , you just let it go right through. The 
Dharma  comes like rain, and you  take what you need.  
 
We need different things at  different junctions of our life, 
because we’re  addressing different issues. Sometimes 
the issue we’re attached to is food. At other times we’re 
dealing with work, grief or strong emotions. Maybe there 
is a tremendous clinging to self, and we’re  trying to 
understand the nature of this self-attachment . The issue  
might be fear of death . It might be difficulties in relationships,  or that life is not providing us with  what we 
want  – because it usually doesn’t. Maybe  you have 
some kind of limitation due to an accident. Now you 
can’t do what you’re used to doing, and possibly  you 
can’t do it for the rest of your life.  At different times , 
we’re up against different issues that we have to face, 
and t he Dharma  comes along  like a huge  rain.  
 
The Dharma  is really vast  – so, given the different 
challenges that we’re involved with at any given time, 
what part of the Dharma  do we find useful and pick up?  
Sometime s it’s the teachings o n loving -kindness, 
compassion or forgiveness  that have the most value . 
Sometimes it’s the practi ce of discipli ne, forbearance  
and just keeping at it that’s most useful. Sometimes it’s 
the teaching s on acceptance  and equanimi ty that are 
helpful. Some times it’s particular teachings of  Buddhist 
psychology that help us  to question or to look more 
deeply at our own psychology and how we work. For 
example, we may understand something about the 
nature of self-identity : how it works, the activity of the 
mind that creates identity , and how we wrap up around 
it. Sometimes it’s deep inquiry into  the nature of clinging 
or the nature of fear.  
 
Depending on where we are in our life, there are many 
different things  that dealing with. The idea is that  the 
Dharma  is raining on all of us , and we  take in what we 
need. That’s true , but it really helps if  we’re like a dry sponge. If we’re already completely sopping wet, then 
maybe  we won’t take much in. I’m chang ing analogies. 
Can you do that  in the middle of a Dharma  talk – to go 
from plants to sponges?  [Laughter]  Maybe  it helps to be 
like lichen or  moss that absorb water when they’re  dry. 
So if we’re filled with our own ideas , preoccupations and 
concerns, maybe  we won’t take it in. 
 
A very important part of mindfulness practice is to make 
ourselves  a receptacle to recei ve the Dharma  and the 
teachings, and to engage in the inquiry  and the  
questioning. To some degree, it helps to let go , to settle 
down and  get calm . Part of the value of meditation 
practice is a time where we try to empty and relax our 
mind. We try to relax  the tension that we’re carrying. As 
we do that, we ’re less preoccupied, and then  we 
become more receptive to what  the Dharma  and reality 
has to offer. We’re also more receptive to learn from it 
all.  
 
When  I say the Dharma  rains on all of us and we take 
up what we need, I don’t mean Buddhism and Buddhist 
teachings. The Dharma  is usually seen as being the 
part of reality that supports us. A big part of that is our 
own capacity for inquiry, questioning and opening up to 
love and compassion. So as we become beautifully 
empty like a sponge to receive what’s there, part of 
what we receive comes from within us and part of it 
comes from  without. But, each of us gets exactly what we need, especially if we’ve prepared ourselves. I think 
mindfulness, meditation  and concentration practice s 
help us to let go of our preoccupations and make  us 
more able to receive the benefits of the Dharma  in our 
lives. It’s amazing the goodness that will come in and fill 
it, if you make yourself a good r eceptacle – a good 
sponge.  
 
May all of us be sponges on this rainy day. The Dharma 
rains on all of us.
