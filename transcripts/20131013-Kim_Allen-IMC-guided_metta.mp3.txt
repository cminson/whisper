So if you could please take a unmeditative posture. 
And just close your eyes gently. 
And come back to the center. 
To your breath, to your body. 
As you exhale, feel your body relax. 
There may be some energy remaining from speech, just gently allowing that to settle out. 
Feeling the breath in the body. 
Touching into our own heart. 
Our intention to be here today is to learn about the Eightfold Path to practice. 
A common way that we practice and develop our intention is to wish well for ourselves and others. 
So we can begin with ourselves. 
Just gently touch our own heart and wish, May I be happy. 
May I be safe. 
May I be healthy and strong. 
May I live with ease. 
May I be happy and peaceful. 
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm. 
May I be healthy and strong. 
May I live with ease. 
And then we can extend this goodwill outward to encompass those in this room. 
May we all be happy. 
May we be safe. 
May we be healthy. 
May we live with ease. 
Letting go of our smaller sense we can let go and wish all beings well. 
May all beings be happy. 
May all beings be safe. 
May all beings have health. 
And may all beings live with ease. 
May the goodwill and good intentions that we've developed here together today be shared with all beings. 
Everyone will meet as we go out. 
The people will speak with when we get home. 
The people will see at work. 
The people we communicate with by email, spreading outward. 
May all beings be happy. 
May all beings be peaceful. 
May all beings everywhere be free.
