The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Good evening everyone. Welcome. Last week Diana asked me if I would give a talk
this evening since both she and Gill are teaching a week-long retreat at IRC.
And it's been several years since I've given a talk. So a little rusty, so hopefully you'll
bear with me. I thought tonight I would talk a little bit about what brought me
to practice, what brought me to IMC, and also what keeps me practicing, what
supports the continual practice. So I'll start with a little bit of history. I came
to IMC in January of 1998 when we were meeting in Palo Alto. And the reason I
came was because there was an inescapable unsatisfactoriness in my life. I had
good friends, I had a good job, good health, and yet there was something that
just seemed off. You know, I couldn't put my finger on it. I couldn't quite get any
of the usual remedies for dissatisfaction or unhappiness that are offered by our
culture to really work as well as I'd like it to. And so a friend of mine had
told me about Spirit Rock, a meditation center up in Marin County. And I looked
at their website and one of their links was to this place in Palo Alto, Insight
Meditation Center, which was only about 10 minutes from where I lived. So I went
there and on the very first night Gil was just finishing the last of a four-week
series on the Four Noble Truths. And in, I'll summarize those rather briefly, he was
talking about how there's this thing called dukkha. Sometimes translated as
suffering or stress or dissatisfaction. One teacher translates it as bummerness,
the bummerness of a life. So it can come in all sorts of forms and intensities, but
basically this dissatisfaction, which I was feeling. And the teaching around that,
calling it a noble truth, was that rather than trying to push it aside or cover it
over or replace it with something else, the instruction was to really pay
attention to it, that there was some value, something important about
investigating this unsatisfactoriness, this dukkha, as he called it. So it was
both the first noble truth was both a description, but also an encouragement
for action to really recognize it when it was operating. It required some action
on my part or on the part of a meditator. The second noble truth was that
there's a cause for this. And the cause is clinging, trying to hold on if it's
a pleasant experience, trying to hold on to the pleasantness, hold on to something,
or if it's unpleasant experience, trying to hold on to the absence of this
experience. And of course the problem with that is that the things that one
often tries to cling to are unclangable, if that's a word, that there are
things that you just can't cling to because they're going to change. They
come about by conditions and they disappear when conditions change. And so
it's not that we can make our experience just the way we want it, but it's how
we're relating to this experience, this taking this attitude that we're
going to try to hold on for dear life to something that can't be held on to. And
the action associated with that is to release the clinging, somehow, to release.
The third noble truth has to do with experiencing the ending of dukkha, the
ending of suffering. And that's something to be realized. And this might not even
be a once-and-you're-done experience. It might be that the clinging ends and the
suffering ends for a second, for a minute, for an hour. However long, undoubtedly
you'll start clinging again, but just having that, recognizing that
experience of at least temporarily being free of the dukkha is something to be
experienced. And then finally the fourth noble truth was that there's a path to
be developed so that this recognition, this release, and this
experience of freedom can come more often. And when I heard that talk, I knew
this is the place for me to be. Gil was talking about exactly what I was
experiencing and offering a certain, I'll say a certain hope, that through practice,
through actions of my own, I could lead a life with less dissatisfaction or
maybe more satisfaction or happiness. And that was just transformational for me
to hear that talk. And so I found him inspiring. Now at that point I didn't know
I had heard about this mindfulness meditation, but I had really never learned
how to do it or what it was. That first night I had, over the previous six or
seven years, I had learned transcendental meditation. So I did that the first
night. And then fortunately the very next Monday there was an introduction,
introductory course to mindfulness meditation, a 45-minute course. And it
was taught by this woman, Margaret. And she explained to us about paying
attention to the very simple experiences of life, you know, of the breath, of
bodily sensations, of emotions, of thoughts. And the thing that struck me was
just her presence. She had, she was kind, she was thoughtful, there's a serenity
about her. And I remember after the end of the first class that I took with her,
thinking that if she's the product of this practice, this is what I want to be
doing. I want the qualities that she's expressing. And even though I had taken the
course, then the next month I took it again, just to have more of that same
experience of being in her presence.
So the inspiration from Gil and the clarity and the cognitive experience of
hearing his Dharma talk. And the following week having this experience of the
presence that Margaret displayed really let me know that I was on, I was where I
wanted to be, or at least starting a path, starting a practice. And in the coming
months, about half the time Gil would have a guest speaker, often people from
Spirit Rock or from San Francisco Zen Center, some various monastics, and some
people that came from, I don't know where. But they were all inspiring. And one of
the things that I also liked about I am seeing that in those first weeks and
months that I was there was that people are just left you alone. It was fine to
just come in, sit, listen to the talk, and then just walk out into the night, you
know, luxuriating in what I had just heard, you know, just reflecting on it,
thinking about it, feeling what it felt like to have heard these teachings that
I had never heard before. And I didn't have to stop and chit-chat, I didn't have
to put on a social persona or explain why I was there. And I didn't
have to explain myself, I could just come and go and people left me alone. And I
really valued that for a number of months, I don't know exactly how long. And I
really saw it as a solitary practice, like this is something that I'm doing for
me. It's my happiness, my tranquility, my peace of mind. And in some ways that's
true. I mean nobody, nobody can meditate for you, nobody can listen to talks for
you, nobody can have the insights that come from this practice. You can't job
it out. It requires your own inspiration, motivation, determination. You know, there's
some part of it that really takes your commitment, and your time, and your
energy to do the practice. Over time, I don't know, maybe within four to eight
months roughly, although it's a little hard for me to remember back then, I
noticed that I wanted to talk to people about the practice. I wanted to talk to
someone. And I found that my non-practicing friends, although they would
be patient with me, they'd listen, they just couldn't figure out what I was
talking about, or why, you know, why would you pay attention to dissatisfaction?
Why would you pay attention to suffering? It just didn't make sense to them. And I
was new enough that I couldn't really put this in words that that maybe made
sense. For example, when I talked about doing meta, loving kindness practice,
where you wish well for someone, even though they they're not wishing well
back for you, you know, this sort of unilateral well-wishing for other
people, you know, wasn't the usual transactional well-wishing that people
were used to. You know, they said, well, if the person doesn't wish you well
back, I mean, how long is that gonna last? You're gonna give up pretty quickly. So
that was just one example of the kind of thing that I was learning about that
just didn't connect. And so about the time that I was wanting to talk to other
people, a couple of people that were also Monday night regulars started coming up
to me and saying, well, I'd like to have coffee, you know, like how about if we
meet for a meal before the Monday night sit? And let's talk about this. And so I
formed a few informal friendships that way and, you know, started to have a few
discussions. And I also thought, well, if I want to talk about this, what I really
need to do is talk with a master, the maestro like Gil. And so I went to him and
that, you know, I think I asked him if he would meet with me once a week to have a
discussion. And, you know, he was like, well, he, you know, he wouldn't do that,
but I could schedule interviews with him. And so for a time I met with him about
once a month. And those were useful for me. Although I didn't find that maybe not
consciously or not so consciously, I really wanted, I wanted to look good in
his eyes. I wanted to be a good Buddhist. And at some point he related to me this
story that when he was a young Zen practitioner at San Francisco Zen Center
that one of his teachers told him that much of what he was going to learn about
Buddhism, he was going to learn from his peers. And when he told me that, I sort of
thought that it was a polite brush off. I didn't, you know, he's like, yeah, you know,
talk to some of these other people. But I took him at his word and I found that
that actually was true, that I, that there was a way that having these
discussions about the things that I didn't understand, I'm not sure that I
believed or had experienced with other people really helped the practice. That
it, that it wasn't just about learning facts or learning from somebody that
already experienced things, but it was the talking to other people about it,
questioning that really helped clarify things for me. And so the next year I
did a 10-day retreat with Gil and two of his friends, John and Mary. And on that
retreat I learned several things. Those teachers started to say more than once
that we don't do this practice for ourselves alone. Now, I kind of thought
that I was doing this for myself alone. You know, I didn't, it was fine with me if
other people benefited from it, but I didn't, that wasn't my motivation to, to
support other people or to, to benefit them in some way. But on that retreat I
noticed what support I was getting from the other yogis. We weren't talking to
each other, but just the fact that other people were showing up and sitting, you
know, session after session was inspiring and helped me keep sitting, even
though it was a, you know, periods of, of, of pain, you know, to just sit for 45
minutes at a time. One person in particular who was inspiring to me was,
there was a woman that was sitting the retreat who was, I think, eight months
pregnant. Now, from what I understand, at that point in pregnancy, you're probably
uncomfortable all the time. The body just, and yet she was just sitting there so
still with a serene look on her face. I just thought, wow, that is, that was
inspiring to me. You know, and that she was doing it not only for herself, but I
imagined doing it also for this soon-to-be-born child. And so there was a way
in which my heart opened by being around the other practitioners. And after that
retreat, I, I found myself making friends with some of the other yogis on
that retreat. Andrea Fellow was on that retreat, Jen Lemus, and some of the other
people who are now teachers. And so I did start to get that sense of, oh yeah, maybe,
maybe there is something that is going on beyond this particular body, this
particular heart and mind. And then less than a year later, that the following
spring, I did a 14-day retreat with Gil. And because so many people had
cancelled, it turned out it was just Gil and 12 yogis at this little Zendo
Jikoji up on Skyline. And there was such an intimacy to it. It rained the first
12 of the 14 days. It was cold. We just had a couple little wood stoves to keep
us warm, in which, you know, one person, this guy, Peter, would just like every,
between every sitting, he'd put more wood in the fire, he kept us warm, he took
care of us. The water system broke, so we had no running water. We had to bathe in
the pond and carry water from the creek for other dishwashing. And the local
fire department brought in drinking water for us each day. But there was
something about, about that particular retreat that made me feel so close to
these other people, I mean, these other 11 people, well, 12, including Gil. Yeah,
that it's a retreat I'll never forget. I mean, it was, it was the antithesis of
some of these golden palace type retreat centers where it's, yeah, it's warm and
it's comfortable and every, you know, the lights gone and off on their own. This
was really just pretty primitive. But, but because there were so few people, Gil
would give us interviews every single day. And at the end of that retreat, I was
invited by a couple that was on it to join what they call the Kalyana Mitha
group. Sometimes it's translated as spiritual friends or beautiful friends.
People that wanted to talk about the Dharma and about their experiences and
create a sense of community. And so, I didn't know what this, what this was, but
since they invited me, I thought, well, at least go a couple of times and see, see
what's, what's up with it.
And it would always start, we'd always sit together for 45 minutes, we'd have a
meal together, so there was that sense of community from sharing a meal. And then
we did this thing called a listening circle where we'd set a timer and each
person had something like about maybe four to six minutes to say whatever it
was they wanted to say. And everyone else just listened. There was no questions or
comments or advice or clarifications. One person just said whatever it was that
wanted to be said, including nothing at all, and everyone else just was as
present as they could be. Just listened. And at first, you know, I would sort of
plan, well, what am I gonna say and what's, you know, what I need to, I need to
get this, I need to rehearse what I'm gonna say. But over time, I came to trust
that what wanted to be heard from me would emerge. I didn't need to plan it, I
didn't need to, you know, somehow have some agenda that as we trusted each other
and the listening deepened, that I learned to trust myself. I learned to
trust that what wanted to be seen would emerge. I also learned that four or five
minutes can go by pretty fast and so that it was important to really, in some
ways, get to the point, you know, to not waste time on things that weren't so
important, but really kind of, you know, what's really going on, you know, some
deep honesty. And so that was very helpful for me, you know, particularly
talking about what was working for me in practice and also what wasn't, what, you
know, where was I stuck. And that group lasted about two years, roughly, and then
the couple moved away. And then I was invited into another group and that
group I still meet with. We've been meeting now for about 20 years. And then
over time there were some neighborhood groups that I was in. There's one that
I'm in right now, in Mountain View. Each group has a somewhat different
structure, different way of doing things. But the commonality is that willingness
to listen to each other and trust that we can talk about what's going on in
practice for us. One of the things I like to say is it's a great place
to talk about how you fail as a Buddhist, you know. There's a lot of times when
you, you know, you like to think of yourself as this well-practiced Buddhist
person. And there's value in that, but there's also value in seeing, you know,
talking about what, you know, kind of what things aren't working, what, you
know, what have you done that you regretted. And that's, for me, that's
really been a way to grow in a way that I don't think I could do just on my own
if I was just sitting at home meditating and listening to talks and
reading books.
For a while I was in a group that was supporting somebody that was dying,
somebody that had cancer, and we thought was only gonna last a few weeks. And he
ended up blessing a couple years. I started another group thinking about
peers since I'm a senior age male. I started a group of other senior age
males. And so we could talk about, you know, what it's like to have a body that's
breaking down, you know, that's starting to, starting to fail, and how, what do we
still aspire to, what keeps us practicing, how to, how to become, not
resigned to, but in accord with our mortality. So those, those are some of
the things that came out of that group. I was also in a social group called the
Dharma Friends, where we would go and see movies or go for hikes. There's a book
group that's started back in the 90s that's still meeting here once a month. So
I'm telling you all of this because my belief is that, that it's, there's a real
value in connecting with others in this practice. There's a saying that I've
heard over a number of times about how one of the Buddha's disciples had one
time told somebody that noble friends and noble conversations are half of the
holy life. And the Buddha corrected him and he said, no, it's not half of the
holy life. It's, it's all of the holy life. So are the way we respond to, support,
are in community with others, is integral to this process of becoming
free. I don't really know if it's possible to become free on your own. So I'd like
to encourage people to start, well, so first of all I want to say I know the
value of solitude and, and that was really important to me being able to
practice without being involved in social interaction that was unwelcome. And I'd
also like to encourage people that feel like they're at a point where they want
to be able to connect with other people to look for ways to connect. I know it's
been difficult over the last couple years with the pandemic. You know, at one
point we used to have like 60 or 80 people in this room on a Monday night.
You know, now we've got a handful. But there are, there are virtual ways of
meeting. Sunday mornings there is a zoom after the Sunday talk. People are
starting to meet out in the parking lot outside of IMC on Monday, a Sunday
mornings. There's a lot of small group discussion that goes on through the, what
is it? Oh, the happy hour groups Monday through Friday. It's the way of meeting
people through either day-long classes or there are some even like eight to
12 month classes that are being offered now by IMC and other places. Just this
afternoon I was in the Dharma Mentor Training Program where we, we meet once
a month and split, split off into small groups to talk. I think Gil and Diana are
offering some courses on ethics as enlightenment and two others that, that
they rotate through. So I can't give you an exhaustive list of how you might
make the kind of connections to support practice through dialogue. But if you, I'm
sure if you start looking around you'll, you'll find ways. So, so I appreciate
your tuning in tonight to this talk and I'll be available for questions or
comments for the next couple minutes either from those of you who are here at
IMC in person or Nancy will monitor the chat on YouTube if you want to offer a
question that way. So, thank you.
Jim, this is Nancy.
Can you say more about the groups that you are part of? Are those ones the
neighborhood groups that you can sign up through the website or did you create a
group on your own? Yeah, that's a, that's a good question. This was, I think the
first group was maybe 10 or 15 years ago and about every three years IMC would
put out a call for if people were interested in joining a group that they
could send in their contact information and their zip code and they would be
matched with other people and usually those groups started out with a kind of
a fixed agenda, you know, readings and things like that and then might over time
deepen. I don't know whether they're doing that right now but if you're
interested I'm sure that if you send an email to the main IMC email site that
they could let you know what's available. Some of the groups, the first group that
I was in lasted for maybe four years and then disbanded. Another one that was an
existing group that was already ongoing invited me to join them and that one I
imagine going for some time so I think if you contact IMC they could let you
know what groups are available. I know that there are links on the IMC
website for individual practice discussion with a teacher and then group
practice discussions and I believe that you need to email to get hooked up with
a neighborhood sangha that meets regularly. I think that's right and the
Sati Center also is teaching a number of classes that Gill and a number of other
teachers have small groups. Oh one other program that IMC has is this eight-fold
path program. It's the eight-fold path is a nine-month series and that has small
group interactions every month for each of the elements and if you want you can
sign up to get a mentor so you can have somebody to talk to once a month that
can offer encouragement and sound you out that way. The current cycle I
think is just coming to an end right now but it usually starts again in the fall
maybe September. Jim one other thing is that there is a new beginner meditation
program that's starting in August that will be meeting in person at IMC. Okay
that's supposed to be on the calendar already. Okay so that what you said that
was in August. Yes so there's also an introductory meditation course in-person
course that's starting in August so that's another way to make connection.
Do you see anything on that? Thank you very much. I appreciate what you had to
share definitely identify with that dissatisfaction and bummerness so I guess
I'm in the right place too. Yeah it's about it's about finding your own path
and I'm trying to figure out how to how to do that so all of these
suggestions are of lots of different things different ways to start down a
path is is a little overwhelming but also very helpful so thank you on that and
then I hear a lot from people that practice about you know letting go and
I imagine that's letting go of the suffering or I don't know what that
means when people say oh you know it's all the first step is letting it let
him go okay let I get the concept of clinging but if I'm already just kind
of softening yeah and what what does it mean to let go yeah well that's an
excellent question I mean you know I'd start with just saying that that's an
what does it mean to let go I'm trying to remember there was one of the one of
the monastics said that something like 80% of the time they're sitting in
meditation knowing they need to let go and can't so I don't think that it's
strictly something that the ego or the intellect can do I think it's to a
certain extent it's seeing the suffering and seeing what is it that what is it
that we're just not you know if you can see the connection between what you're
clinging to and the suffering then the clinging may dissolve on its own but you
I don't I believe you can't make it happen and you can't definitely make it
happen on your time schedule you know it's it's kind of it's kind of like
sitting with it until so don't just knock three times and turn around yeah yeah so
okay okay well it's one minute to nine so thank you all for your attention and
if this has been helpful then stay with it and if it's not helpful just let it
go thank you
