The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
I'll start by offering some practice notes.
So the invitation in this next couple of hours is to really let yourself think in, settle in, relax,
allow this time to support a calm, clear presence. Perhaps a couple of images might
support that. Take more of them. Imagine yourself walking on a path just for the
enjoyment of the walking. Beautiful day, clear sky. You come to a mountain lake,
comfortable spot to sit right by the lake under the shade of a tree.
And you can imagine sitting there,
settling in, lowering yourself into this cool mountain lake,
just like you might settle yourself into your body.
You can see the clear sky above and allow the mind, the heart to open to a broader awareness.
So settling into the body, comfortable, easy, below all the surface chop or winds of the day,
the thinking, and allowing the mind, the heart to let anything and everything flow through
all kinds of weather.
Staying simple, settled back like the sky, not touched by any of it. No need to pick it up.
So enjoy your walking, enjoy your sitting.
And you have 45 minutes for walking now. Thank you.
