 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. One of the hallmarks, characteristics of this practice of mindfulness is simplicity. In some ways, simplicity is one of the great teachers for us doing this practice, to have the idea of simplicity as a reference point, maybe to consider how we're complicating things unnecessarily, but also as a reference point for a simplicity of being. How can you be simple with what's happening? And maybe that's not always possible, but to have that question close at hand is very useful. There was a wonderful Indian vipassana teacher named Munindraji, who was well known here in the West for saying, if it's not simple, it's not vipassana. And when I was visiting with him in India, I was somehow taken advantage of by some people on the street that was tricked out of some money. And so when he, when I told him about it, he said to me, Gil, it's important to be simple, but don't be a simpleton. So simple, simple and wise. The, I know that there can be very powerful forces at play that inside of us insist that we have to do something and say something and be busy and get going and maybe even multitask, do many things at once and rush around and everything can seem so important. And we end up being the opposite of simple. We end up being complicated. And if we want to congratulate ourselves for that, it isn't just that we're complicated, we're sophisticated and somehow praised for being able to do many things at once and whatever. But there's also something lost if we do too much at once. When I was a cook at the Zen monastery on the kitchen crew, that timing was such that the way it was set up, lunch had to be served exactly on time, like by the minute. There was a whole choreographed way in which the food was served up in the meditation hall to people who had been meditating and being in the meditational for a while. And there's all this chanting that led up to the food being brought and served to people. It was kind of important. The expectation was, yes, exactly. I don't know what time it was, but it was exact. This is the food had to be ready because people came down to pick it up and bring it up to the meditational. But it was a lot of work to cook. And so I remember trying to get everything ready in time and kind of being a little bit maybe frantic or working hard. But there was a practice in the kitchen that no matter what was going on, 10 or 15, I forget what it is, minutes before it was time to serve up lunch, everyone in the kitchen had to stop working and had to chant the heart sutra, chant this chant in front of the little kitchen altar. And many times I said to myself, you've got to be kidding. We're behind and getting everything out and we have so much to do and we can't just stop. But you had to, it was the rule. And so we would stop and chant. And every time we stopped, afterwards it seemed we had so much more time. It seems like there was lots of time to finish and there was more creativity and intelligence in how we finished. We got simple, we relaxed, the chanting kind of settled us. And then it was kind of like all the space was created in the mind and the hearts to do the work better. And that became a principle that I've continued into the rest of my life. That sometimes when I'm feeling frantic, like there's too much to do and I can't do it all, and I get that feeling, I use that as a cue to stop doing and take a break. Sometimes I'll take a five or ten minute nap or sit and meditate for five or ten minutes. And I still discover the same thing, that after a short period of meditation or a little nap, there's lots of time. The sense of pressure and time is partly a construct of the mind. But when we're in the middle of it, it seems like it's the construct of reality. This is the true nature of things that we have to do all this stuff and everything. But maybe we don't. And maybe we do things wiser and better if we become simple, if we become calm or settled, whichever one of those words you prefer. One of the images I have is if you're standing on your tippy toes, as tall as your capacity could be, and then try to jump, you're not going to jump very far. To be able to jump high, you have to crouch down, bend down, have your feet firmly on the ground, and then you have a chance to jump. Or you have a spring then. And so it's just, I think, the same way that if we can become simple, if we can stop, if we can pause, get settled, then it can seem counterintuitive, like, no we can't, we have all stuff to do. But unless we stop and become simple or relaxed or calm, then we're like standing on our tippy toes trying to jump. And so yes, we have to go in reverse. We have to stop what we're doing and do less. When it seems like the pressure is to do more, it's counterintuitive to do this. But over and over again I've seen that it's for the better. I come back and do whatever has to be done better. I can jump, or I see more clearly, or I begin to find my way through the weeds between what really needs to be done and what I thought was needing to be done. And so I can then I can prioritize better. And okay, this is what I focus on now. And I don't want to tell you that this is always the best thing to do, that you'll never find yourself in a situation where you're too busy and too much going to do and you have to run around and take care of things. I don't want to say that because people, if I say that, people get too busy protesting. That, you know, I need to, I have to. And it's tremendous kind of force inside of us. We have to, we need to and all that. So I won't say it should never be the case, but maybe it's rare that we don't really, you can't just really stop and pause. I mean, if your neighbor needs to go to the emergency, don't pause. You know, just go, be busy. Don't worry about yourself. Later to take care of yourself. But, you know, in reasonable situations. So to be simple. And then the way that simplicity being simple becomes a teacher is once you start getting a sense of feeling for what a simplicity of being is, you know, no matter what it is, it's okay. Okay, this is how I am. This is what the situation is. Be simple with it. So if you're anxious, for example, just be simple with anxiety. That's the time to pause. If you're simple, if you're angry, that's really a time to be simple and pause and just be simple with the anger a little bit. Like crouch, take that backward step. Prepare yourself. Don't just barrel ahead. Stop. Be simple. And as we become simple, we see the impulses better. We see the beliefs we have better. We see the complexity we add unnecessarily to the situation. And this is a powerful way that simplicity is a teacher. It highlights what we add to the situation that's not needed. What we add to the situation that makes it more complicated than it needs to be. What we add to the situation that makes it worse. I think it was Sunday I said one of the great principles is, when you go through your life, whatever you do, don't make it worse. Maybe you don't know what to do, but at least don't make it worse. Carry that with you. And so this idea of simplicity. If you know what that is, it has to be simple. Take a deep breath or two or three and just stand on your two feet and kind of feel your weight against the ground or close your eyes and sit in your chair. Whatever you have to pause, to settle down, something. Then you might be in a better position to engage in whatever needs to be engaged with. With more clarity, more stability, more wisdom, more kindness, more compassion. Because all those things are resources within us that get drowned out when we feel frantic and in a rush and hurried and afraid that we're going to miss the bus or whatever we're going to do. And the best in us can come forth with this idea of simplicity. So to finish this little talk, to say that one of the places to discover this simplicity is in meditation. And sometimes people are very complicated with meditation. They have too many agendas, too much they're trying to do. And sometimes it's really good just to not try to accomplish anything, do anything, fix anything, but just simply be simple. What does it mean to be simple with this? This is uncomfortable. This is unfortunate that I should be this way. But given that's what's happening, what would it be like to be simple here? And how would being simple maybe shift the ecology, shift something useful? So may you discover the blessings of simplicity. Thank you.
