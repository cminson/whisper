The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, and it's the audio. Okay. Alright, so hello and warmly welcome to PR
everyone. Lovely to see you, lovely to be with you. So, so for the theme for, for
today, this morning, this evening, whatever your time zone might be, the theme
is self care, self love, self forgiveness, it's a blend of those, it's a blend of
those. It's really an invitation, the theme tonight is an invitation for
examining how we often respond to when we make mistakes and when mishaps
happen. And of course, we're human, it's error to be human, we say things that
later we think, hmm, that was not very skillful, or we do things that are not
helpful, or, or maybe even hurtful to ourselves, or, or to others in an
intentionally inadvertently. And in those moments when we're all when, or we
even do things, I don't know that later, it seemed like they were not the best
decisions in retrospect. And so do we kick ourselves? Do we berate ourselves? Oh,
you are filling the blanks, stupid, terrible, mind mindless. Gosh, do we be
raid ourselves? How do we treat ourselves in that moment? Oh, you should
have paid more attention. You should have, could have, should have like, Oh,
how do we treat ourselves in those moments? And these moments, there may be
plenty of them. Because again, to err is to be human these tiny not huge
mistakes, not, but just tiny little mistakes throughout the day or mishaps
or, or decisions that are not ideal, if we had to spend more time, etc. So, so
how, how do we, how do we, what is our, the way that we hold ourselves? What if,
what if in that moment, because we've already, you know, been hurt, say by our
decision or lack of attention or lack of awareness or, or whatever it might be,
we've already been hurt, right? It wasn't an optimal decision. Like, Oh, what if we
say, Oh, sweetheart, sweetheart. Oh, I'm so sorry. This is hard for you. I know
this is hard. It's okay. It's okay, sweetie. This is hard. Yeah, this is, it's
okay. It's okay. I still love you. I accept you. It's okay. And it's all right.
Let's, let's learn from it. Let's move on. And I forgive you. It's okay. It
happens. It's, it's, it's human to err, to err is human. It's really okay. Do we
extend that acceptance, that love, that sense of forgiveness to ourselves? And in
the guided meditation, I will invite you to try these different perspectives on
and see how they feel physically in the body. How do they feel in the body, in
the mind, and see for yourself which one is more conducive to, to actually both
recovery and also learning and also maybe more mindful behavior later. There's
some research results also. Well, maybe I'll share the research results as I'm
sharing as I'm sending the space right now. But there, there is a couple of very
interesting studies. One is that for people who actually have, who have made
some kind of mistake or maybe transgression in this, in the study was a
moral transgression that they tested. If they, if they were primed towards
self-compassion towards care for themselves, they actually took more
responsibility instead of taking less responsibility because there was a sense
of, oh, yes, it's okay. I, it's just, it was a mistake. It was it, but I'm not
wholly bad. It was not the sense of throwing the baby out with a bat or
bathwater. It's the sense of, it's okay, I made a mistake and learning from it
instead of if you don't have that cushion of self-compassion, then there
might be pointing the finger to others. Oh, it's their fault. That's why this
happened, right? Because there's no kindness towards oneself when there's
kindness, compassion towards you. You can accept that, yeah, you screwed up. It
wasn't optimal. And it's, it's okay. It's really okay. There is that cushion to
take responsibility. Whereas when there isn't that cushion, when there is the
harshness of you should have done better, you idiot, then, then somewhere deep
down inside that we don't want to take responsibility because if we do, then
we're bad. We're awful. There's no recovery, right? So then people point
fingers to others. Oh, it's their fault. It's, they, they did their, you know,
right? Et cetera, et cetera, whereas actually kindness to oneself allows one
to to take responsibility. So, so, and one last thing I would say is that, as you
know, compassion towards oneself and towards others, it's not, it's not just
the sense of care and warmth and softness, gentleness. It does
have those aspects to it, but also there's an uprightness,
there's a sense of power, there's a sense of goodness,
there's a sense of fierceness. Yes, yes, there was a mistake,
and it's okay. It actually makes you feel stronger in your
morality and your intentionality. So it has the both softness,
the gentleness, as well as a sense of uprightness and the
the energetic fierceness in it. So you'll hopefully all become
more clear as we practice together. Alright, I've said
plenty to set the stage. So let's begin. Let's begin. Let's
begin. So I'd like to invite you to land in your body, to
arrive, to arrive in your body, here, here. And allow yourself
to feel your feet planted, rooted on this earth, on this
precious earth, this precious body on this precious earth.
It's okay. It's okay. Releasing, releasing. Whatever the
body is holding energetically, unto the earth, through your
feet, through your sit bones, onto the cushion or the chair.
Releasing your shoulders, your neck. As if you're releasing
the burdens that you have been carrying around the
proverbial weight you've been carrying to release in this
moment, it's okay. Taking refuge, taking refuge, the
simplicity of this moment, it's okay. It's all right. Releasing
any tension in your jaw, in your eye socket, letting your eyes
open. Letting your forehead relax.
Your cheeks, your chin, your ears.
Inviting your heart center, your proverbial heart center,
inviting it to relax. Center of your chest, whatever emotions
are present, it's okay. It's all right. It can be here just as
they are. Releasing any tightness or pushing away or
clinging to. It's okay. Relaxing all of that.
Relaxing, releasing the abdomen. Sit bones, upper legs, knees,
lower legs and feet. As well as the arms and hands,
this entire body.
Bringing awareness, relaxed, spacious awareness to the whole
body. Present, pulsating, sensing, breathing, the whole
body breathing. This miracle of nature, letting the breath be
received in the abdomen, lowering, lowering the center of gravity.
And so we'll spend a few minutes just letting this body be
breathed, bringing awareness, receiving the breath with awareness. In the body,
in the body.
Calming, soothing breath, one breath at a time.
Calming, soothing breath, one breath at a time.
And if the mind is wondering, resting on thoughts, it's okay. It's
all right. Simply seeing, observing, noticing, it's a
rising. With a smile, as if it's a beloved puppy that has
wondered about her beloved child, you won't beat them up. It's okay. It's the nature of
puppies and little kids to wonder. Gently, ever so gently,
claw them back. Come back, sweetie, come back. Releasing, it's okay.
And finding ease, comfort, seclusion of the mind that's nourishing,
healing, just here with the breath in the body.
Can awareness be imbued with appreciation for this breath in this moment?
The breath being known, the abdomen, the kindness with a smile, greeted with a smile,
inner smile.
Now I'd like to invite you, if you wouldn't, if it feels okay.
To gently bring to mind, maybe something that recently you considered a mistake,
something you did or said, that later you wish you had done differently. You regretted,
you were upset, you were disappointed. Be very gentle as you call this into your heart,
not into your head so much, we don't want so much of a story.
Bringing the memory back, maybe a misstep, stepped off the curve, twisted your ankle.
Oh, I wish I had looked or had been able to look more carefully, whatever it might be.
And seeing your body, what the habitual response might feel like, just to explore,
what does it feel like to have the habitual response you tend to have?
Of course, we'll bring compassion in the moment to compare, but for now.
Is it disappointment, sadness, anger?
Whatever it might be, how does it feel? Or maybe it's too hard to bring it up,
and so don't try too hard, it's okay, it's all right. So what's available?
Just recognizing, just a tiny bit of it is okay, the tinge of that reaction, reactivity.
All right, wish it hadn't happened, or how could you, whatever it might be.
And notice how tight that might feel,
sense of tightness, contraction, physically that that brings perhaps
in your heart center, the center of your chest,
maybe in your belly too, maybe in your jaw, maybe in your shoulders.
And see where you feel it, forehead maybe? So see where is the contraction for you
around the should have, could have, would have. Just to feel it, I know it doesn't feel good,
so we won't linger here too long, just to get a sense, comparison.
And now, opening, opening the heart wide, as if
there are these warm arms that are embracing you, holding you, lovingly,
acceptingly, compassionately, sweetheart, it's okay.
Maybe putting a balm in your heart center, or wherever there's a contraction,
the balm of acceptance, of recognition, of forgiveness, it's okay, sweetie. Yes,
yes, it's okay, this was hurtful to you, you've already been hurt, dear. You don't need to add
insult to injury, don't need to add salt, poor salt, on a cut, it's okay, it's all right,
sweetheart, it's already hard enough. This injury, this suffering, this pain,
this difficulty, as a result of the mistake, you don't have to add to it, it's okay.
Holding, holding yourself
as if a warm, gentle, accepting embrace, it's okay.
To err is to be human, you're only human,
found ball, just like anybody else.
Where you see, you hear, you cognize, you decide, with limited information, the process,
it's all limited, it's okay, it's a part of being human, dear, it's okay,
it's all right, it happens, it's okay.
Okay, letting yourself feel held, acceptance with forgiveness,
and if you need, if it feels supportive actually to put a hand in the middle of your chest,
as if you were putting this ball, was this arm putting, this hand putting ball,
soothing, accepting, compassionate ball in your heart center, please try that, see what that feels
like, experiment with it for a moment, can be powerful, self-touch, can be quite powerful.
Give it a try, even if you've tried it before, see what it's like in this moment, it's okay.
You did your best, you did your best in that moment,
you've done your best, if you could have done any differently, any better, you would have,
of course you would have, of course you would have, there's no doubt you would have,
given all the causes and conditions in that moment, internally, externally, so many different things.
The causes and conditions gave rise to it happening the way it did.
If you could have done differently, you would have, so trust, trust,
and forgive yourself and the causes and conditions that came together.
Forgive those two, and the part that you played, it wasn't just alone you,
it was other things too, so recognize those, recognize the causes and conditions,
forgiving them, forgiving yourself,
loving yourself, holding yourself with care, with love, you're already hurting,
you've already been hurt, not kicking or hitting yourself,
as if it'd be love the child or a little puppy, it's okay, you've done your best,
letting go of the contraction,
releasing, there is no use, there is no use to feeling contracted,
especially if there is shame or challenging emotions, no use, we can have remorse, learn
from what went wrong in the sphere of compassion, the sphere of care.
I'm just holding yourself with care, with kindness,
you are both mother and the child, there's the sense of power, uprightness,
forgiveness, courage, grace, that you can extend to yourself, both give and receive,
both the mother and the child, sense of energy, fierceness, uprightness, powerful love,
that holds the hurt, that holds the tenderness.
It's okay sweetheart, it's okay.
And as we move closer to the end of this sit together,
releasing, letting go of whatever arose or did not arise,
letting there be a sense of appreciation, we showed up, we did our best,
for so many causes and conditions, can we forgive, can we hold with care, with love,
this being who is us, doing their best, could do any better, could have done better, we would have,
it's all okay, appreciating, appreciating ourselves, and all who are practicing with us
in community, appreciating them, their goodness.
And this way, creating wholesome karma, if we bring love, care, forgiveness,
to what might have been challenging or difficult, unskillful, at least we're planting wholesome
seeds of kindness, forgiveness, wisdom, instead of war, anger, aversion, disappointment, self-flagellation,
and sharing this goodness, sharing this goodness with generosity, with all beings everywhere,
may all beings everywhere, all us beings, all us humans who make mistakes,
may all of us be happy, be healthy, be safe, may all of us at ease, may all of us be free.
Thanks everyone, thank you for your practice.
So we have a few minutes for reflections, what you might have discovered, what came up,
and you're invited to share, whatever you would like to share, for the benefit of others,
for the benefit of Sangha, offering a gift, you're offering gift through your reflections,
your questions, maybe what went wrong, what didn't work, it's all okay, and you can
raise your zoom hand, if it's your physical hand, I will not see, because we're multiple pages,
on my zoom, and you can type them in chat, Charasly says thanks, thank you Charasly,
thanks for your practice, you can type them to everyone, in which case I'll read your name,
or just to me privately, in which case I won't read your name, it'll be private, so
so gifts from the Sangha, discoveries,
did you notice a shift, what was it like at the beginning with the habitual way that you
respond to the mistake, versus when you brought in the embracing hugging arms,
and the balm, did you notice the difference, what happened?
And holding space of silence is perfectly fine in this community, we know that, so it's all good.
I'll share something with you as I wait, not wait, but as I hold space for any reflections
that might come up from you, for me as I was doing this practice, yes, there's definitely,
it's so interesting, just a little bit of contraction, and for me it's more in the
heart center, oh, I wish that didn't happen, and then oh sweetheart, it's okay, it's okay,
and then there's a sense of strength and uprightness, really, as I lead you guys, of course,
I'm in that space with you, I'm in that space with you. Elaine says, I appreciate it taking the
time to be gentle, and have deed forgiveness with myself, thank you, Lily, and Jamie, I do
see your hand, please. Well, I want to thank you for the invitation to both give and receive
a mother's love, I hope I'll remember to revisit that again.
Yeah, cis man and a father, yeah, I've never given a mother's love before, and it was really
amazing to try it, thank you. Thank you so much, Amy, thank you for sharing that, so beautiful,
yeah, thank you for exploring that, and lighting up for you, as you said, as a cis man as a father,
beautiful, thank you, I'm so touched, yay, yay, made support you and your journey as a human being,
as a cis man as a father, beautiful. Sarah says, I like that notion that the more self-compact
passion we have for ourselves, the less we need to blame others, yes, yes, isn't that great?
Isn't that wonderful, and see it for yourself, just the study is pretty cool, and I wonder if
that came up for you experientially, also in this practice, like, oh, it was their fault,
they should have done it this way, or that way, maybe, like, oh, well, it's okay, it's all right,
right, it's okay, I didn't see, or something like that, so yeah, pretty cool. So, how about we turn
into practicing in community, in small groups of three on Zoom, and holding each other with
compassion, with care, and as always, we only speak from our own experience, or you can be silent,
you don't have to say anything, you can hold space, when it comes to your turn, you can say
pass, be present, it's perfectly fine, and you're invited, if you like, to share what came up for
you, what did you discover, and even if you fell asleep, or distracted, that's okay too, no problem,
that that's what you can practice within the moment, well, usually I would beat myself up,
because I fell asleep, but no, it's okay, sweetie, you didn't get a lot of sleep last night, right,
can you practice in real time, with these instructions, with these invitations,
and so, in small groups, the invitation is, one person will share one nugget of their experience,
and then the next person, and then the next person, and they'll come back to you, and then
they'll go around and around until the time is up, and again, please only share from your own
experience, authentically, as much as or as little as you like to share silence is fine,
and not managing, directing, probing others, let them have their own experience, just holding
space, this is part of the practice, holding compassionate space, well, all of us humans
we're doing the best we can, doing the best we can, so, so with that, I'd like to create the rooms,
the breakout rooms, which I haven't yet created, here we go, and see if there are any invitations
that I usually give, which I forgot, and I think that's it, so here we go, I'm going to open the
rooms, be kind to yourself, be kind to each other, what a fantastic way to practice in Sangha, here
we go,
okay, the rooms are closed, so I'll come back everyone, now we have just about a couple minutes,
if there are any reflections, questions, comments, after having practiced in small groups, so
Katrin, please, it's really grateful for this practice, it's very very apropos for me,
I've had this question, and maybe you can't speak to it in this short amount of time,
but it really troubles me, which is like the thing, if we could do, if we could have done
something different than we would have, and, but like, how does that work in the present moment
when we are trying to make a decision, it's not a philosophical question, because it's really like,
how do I make a decision, if that is the case, I feel responsible, but then it couldn't have
happened any other way, yeah, it's part of a greater issue of decision-making for me, but
oh, it is, yeah, yeah, I appreciate, yeah, it is given the 30 seconds left, I'll try to do with
justice, here we go, it's a big philosophical question, think of it this way, or feel into it
this way, that, you know, there are a lot of causes and conditions that are external internal,
and think of it as probabilistic, right, because really the question you're asking brings in the
question of free will, free will, do we have free will, or do we not have free will, like if I can
do any differently, why am I, but I do feel like I have intentionality, I want to have intentionality,
so all of those really come together, it's really the weight of, and the idea of karma is that it's
not deterministic, karma isn't deterministic, or causes and conditions aren't deterministic,
it's just that the probability is kind of stacked this way, right, it's stacked this way, but if
you really work hard, and you know, you can shift and change it, but if it's really stacked in a
particular way, like oh yeah, that's the way it would have gone, it would be really hard to change
it in that one, but it doesn't mean that I can keep trying and shifting and setting the intention
so that it becomes more likely, so in the example that I gave with, you know, stopping, stepping
off the curve and getting, you know, a sprained ankle, like oh yeah, you know, maybe, you know,
glasses were fucked up from wearing a mask, and it's like all these causes and conditions, like
oh yeah, okay, and yet, and yet, I know, I can't change the karma, like okay, now I know wearing
the mask, like this is what happens, like I will change it, I can, but in that moment that's the
best that could have happened, because it's just as simple, so there is free will in, well anyway,
that's a bigger question, I don't want to say that, but anyway, just does that help hold both of those
for you, both the past and then present? Yeah, and it's a, yeah, and it's a forgiving perspective,
that's like, that's evolutionary, it's like oh yeah, like things change, like yeah, it makes me
think of life as that, you know, sort of a practice and an experiment versus like a constant test of
getting things right. Right, right. So I appreciate that. Beautiful, I appreciate you putting it
exactly, it's just always, yeah, with kindness, forgiveness, we're going to keep trying, keep
trying, intending, turning, turning, keep turning, adverting, changing the stream, keep trying to
change the stream, and yet when it's, there's so many forces, it's okay, it's okay sweetheart,
so yay, what a rich hour, thank you all for your practice, thank you for your practice hanging in
here, thank you all, beautiful, dedicating the merit, may all beings be well, may all beings be
forgiving, may all beings be free. Thank you, take care, be well.
