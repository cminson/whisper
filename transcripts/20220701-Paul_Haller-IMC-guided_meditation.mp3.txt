 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. It's a good morning from another cloudy day in San Francisco. And I hope whatever time zone you're in, that there's something about it you can appreciate. You know, practice is an amazing thing. In a way, we could say we're journeying from an unaware reactiveness to our life, to a state of awareness and compassionate responsiveness to life. We're journeying from a persistent dissatisfaction to a sense of appreciation. And with all that in mind and heart, I'm going to start with a little piece of a poem by David White. The sound of the bell still reverberating, asking you to wake into this life and inviting you deeper into what waits. As we start to meditate, can we in a way just marvel at the proposition that mind is constructing a sense of me, a sense of reality, and then there arises a response to it, sometimes a reaction to it, sometimes a deep appreciation. In all of that, arising in response to the experiencing, each moment, experiencing what it is that's happening in that moment. As you start to sit, to let that sink in, that's the proposition of this human condition. That's the proposition of this practice of waking up, being aware of discovering a compassionate response, maybe even a responsive gratitude. And then just starting to notice, in this moment, what's happening? What's happening in the state of mind, in the mental activity that's constructing this moment's version of reality? Can there be the wisdom of, it is what it is? And then the response to what is associated thoughts, judgments, remembering, concluding. And again, the response is what it is. Can we embody it? Can we draw it in to our physical being? Almost like an antidote to the mind, just being, all that's really happening. Can we create the reality of physical being with our own body, with our breath? Physical body is a constellation of physical experiences. You can close your eyes and just note the physical experience of body. You can note the constellation of all the senses, the sounds. And then with the inhale, the surround of being is taken in, and there's an intimate connection. And then released with the exhale. Can we let the body and the breath be a foundation, be a way that we stay in the here and now, in a way in which we allow the very process of thinking and constructing reality to become evident? And as the mind is starting to settle, just noticing and acknowledging how all that's unfolding. Is the mind of now cloudy, sunny, windy? Is the body soft and spacious, or creaky and a little achy? Is the breath flowing or a little congested? Just noting and acknowledging. Is there a generous acceptance of what's arising? Or is there some struggling, some dissatisfaction with how it is? Just today's weather. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And if you discover that your mind is wondered, you're already aware. Just let that moment be acknowledged. Let the here and now be rediscovered. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for your attention. Remember when the twelve people are now, can you breathe in? Let it be recognized by the REM. details of this moment. And then release it with the exhale. And release it with the exhale. And release it with the exhale. you you you you you you you
