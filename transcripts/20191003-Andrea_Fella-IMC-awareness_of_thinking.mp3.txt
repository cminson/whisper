The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
That was a nice quiet sitting. I was just appreciating the stillness in the room.
The topic that I thought of exploring this evening is more of a meditation topic
to explore an aspect of experience that happens in our meditation practice for everybody,
and that is thinking. So I did in the guided meditation point a little bit to exploring
being mindful of thinking, and this is often a place in our meditation where we may come
into meditation with this idea that being in a meditative state means that I'm not thinking,
that that's the goal actually to get to a place where the mind is quiet of thinking,
and it certainly is pleasant when that happens, and it does happen sometimes,
but it is not, that is what tends to happen when we practice what may be more of a
concentration practice, but with mindfulness practice when we look at what mindfulness
practice actually is doing for us, it is really helping us to be aware of everything that's
happening in our bodies and our minds. We can be aware of whatever is going on for us,
including our thoughts, and so if we have this idea in our mindfulness practice that
thoughts are kind of a problem that it means that we're not being mindful when thinking is happening,
then it kind of means that vast swaths of our daily life are off limits to mindfulness,
and it is not true. We can actually be aware of thinking. So that's the kind of place
I'd like to explore just a little bit this evening, just a particular aspect or area of
working with thinking. I'm not going to cover the entirety of it by any means,
but just to begin to point to this possibility, and as in the guided meditation, I suggested
that in the moment when the mind returns after we've been wandering in thought, that's a great
place to begin to get familiar with being mindful of thinking, because often that going off
when we've gotten, when the mind has been wandering off, we have been thinking, and often what
happens when we return, when the mindfulness returns, we become aware that we have been
thinking and actually usually are still thinking, and so that moment is actually a demonstration
of the possibility of being aware while thinking, but often what we have in that moment is a
relationship that we feel like it's a problem to be thinking, and I'd say that maybe that
relationship happens partly because thinking is a very powerful habit that tends to take us
away from the present moment. It's a habit that where, let's say when we're thinking
habitually, we don't tend to be mindful, but it doesn't mean because we don't have the,
because we, it doesn't mean that because we have the habit of not being mindful while
thinking that that is not possible to be mindful while thinking.
So that's a little bit of a shift of our mindset that we can begin to at least even hold the
idea that it is possible to be aware of our thoughts. So I just wanted to speak to this
a little bit, and one of the big pieces that we need to recognize or get, become aware of
is what is the difference between following thinking, where we're kind of following a thread
of thought and lost in it, and the awareness or waking up to know, oh, this is the mind
thinking. There's a vast difference between these two, and initially it's not so easy to
notice this, but when we are following the thinking, essentially when we're going along
with the thinking, our subconscious tendencies or what's motivating that thinking is kind
of in charge, let's say, when we're not aware of the thinking. It's just our mind is just
kind of charging in its habitual mode around that particular thought pattern. And as we
become aware of thinking, we can become aware of these kind of subconscious tendencies and
begin to have a little bit of a choice. Do I follow them? Or do I get curious about what
is the experience? What is the experience right now of being aware, having been thinking?
And that's a good place to begin, actually. So taking some time potentially to get familiar
with this difference of kind of charging with the thoughts, you know, following the thoughts,
being lost in the thoughts, and being aware this is a thought happening. And the moment
when we return from wandering is an ideal moment to begin to notice that difference. Because
as our mindfulness returns, there's often a little bit of a lingering kind of awareness
of what had been going on. And if we'd been charging off and thinking about a, you know,
a situation with a partner or a co-worker, there's a kind of an energy that's there that
we can remember. And noticing the difference between the kind of sense or feeling of that
energy and the sense of being, oh, here I am now, knowing, knowing that that kind of
pull or that energy is there. So it's useful to notice this difference because when we are
not aware of it, as I said a moment ago, when we're not aware of it, we're kind of at the
mercy of our subconscious tendencies and habits around it. When we can become aware of it,
there can be a little bit of choice. Is this something that's useful to keep thinking about?
Or is it not something useful to keep thinking about? So tonight I mostly want to just explore
this possibility of where we can start to become familiar with this experience of thinking in
our meditation. And starting with these moments of the mindfulness returning is a great place
to begin. And what I'd like to start with is just kind of two different kinds of thinking,
two very different kinds of thinking that we often, that we can notice in that moment.
And they're not the only two kinds of thinking that we have. I just want to highlight these
two as very common ones that seem to happen for us in meditation and are kind of maybe
some of the easier ones to start to recognize. They're what I'd first call active thinking,
which is where the mind is really engaged. It's picked something up and it's chewing on it.
It's kind of got some energy behind it. And the other, a kind of what we might call drifting
or daydreaming, just kind of a floating almost quality of mind. Sometimes this comes with
dreamlike images or something like that. So these two different kinds of thinking, there's
different, it's useful to notice the differences between them. And there's some different ways
to explore working with them. So I'll just to bring each of these two in. And I'd say often
early in practice, this active kind of thinking where our mind kind of charges off, well,
both kinds of thinking, we often think this is a problem. It's like when we're drifting off
and daydreaming, we come back, it's like, I've just been daydreaming. I've got to bring more
effort to not daydream. But there's some other ways to relate to that. And so I want to kind
of talk about these two kind of in counterpoint different ways to work with them.
Because I'd say these two are some of the more common kinds of thoughts to take us away from
the present moment, and beginning to be aware of them can help us to not get lost in them,
but actually know what's happening with them. So with the active kind of thinking where the mind
is kind of picking something up and chewing on it, churning about it, often this comes
with some energy. It can feel like the mind is really, sometimes I've seen the mind just
get really convinced this is important. So it's got that quality to it. The mind really
has bought into the importance of thinking this thought. And that can be some of the stickiness
of it. So it's like this thing, I've got to plan or figure out. And then there's a little
bit of awareness of, oh, I'm planning. And yet the intensity of the mind believing the
importance of that almost just submerges us right away again. And so it's kind of like
noticing, if we can start to notice, oh, this is that pattern happening, even just a little
bit. Oh, this is that habit. This is that planning habit or that remembering habit or that
arguing habit, that arguing thought or that remembering thought. If we can even just name
it. And so this is one tool that's useful. It's just if you can kind of identify a particular
category of the thought. When you come back, that can help the mind to kind of distance
itself from the stickiness of the thought. And so that can be a very simple tool, just
kind of recognizing the category of the type of thinking. This serves different purposes.
I mean, first of all, it does help get a little bit of space from the stickiness of the
thought. But it also can help us to see that our minds tend to potentially habitually engage
in common themes or patterns. So if we begin to recognize the mind is doing a lot of planning
or a lot of remembering or a lot of self-justifying, boy, that was a big one for me. Like, yeah,
I'm right. Yep, I'm right. I know that I did that right. So those kinds of thoughts, there's
lots of different ways that happens about many different scenarios. But then we begin
to see, oh, this pattern around self-justifying, this seems to be an important pattern in the
mind. It's a sticky pattern in the mind. And so if we can kind of come up with a way to
identify that, oh, this pattern is happening that can create a little distance for us in
the mind in that moment when we recognize that kind of thinking. So it helps us to recognize
familiar patterns. And it helps us to step back from the content a little bit. We are
acknowledging kind of a little bit of content there and that we're acknowledging the type
of thinking. But we're not acknowledging, oh, yes, what I'm thinking about is that person
who did that thing the other day, and boy, I was really mad about that. That kind of
acknowledgement of thinking can just take us right back into the kind of charge of it.
But if we can acknowledge, oh, yeah, the mind is doing its justifying thing again. Okay,
that's what's happening. So that's a first kind of step in exploring this kind of active
thinking. And then the next piece that I like to suggest, and I recommended this or suggested
it in the guided practice, when you recognize a particular, especially active kind of thought
and a particular pattern, get curious about what has the effect been? Like we may have
gone wandering off in thought for two or three minutes, maybe longer in our meditation. And
we wake up, we come back, and the mind has been thinking about that thing for two or
three minutes. What it's been doing in that time, thinking about that situation or that
scenario or what we had to do or needed to do, that has had an effect on us. Thoughts
are a very, very powerful conditioning factor in the mind. When we think things, it creates
experience. And we kind of know this, because, especially in meditation, we can kind of see
this, we're kind of sitting here calmly. Some thought, maybe what happens, we can kind of
begin to see with looking at thoughts too, this kind of cause and effect or conditioned
nature of our minds. We're sitting, breathing, hearing. And then we hear a particular sound
like the train. And that train triggers some memory, some image. And then we're thinking
about that image or that memory, that time when we were with someone on the train. And
what happened in that situation? And then when we kind of come back, there's like a lingering
sense of maybe the emotions that had happened when we remembered that situation. So that's
the constructing power of thought. It is not actually that that memory kind of comes entirely
with all of those memories, all of those feelings. The mind actually recreates them through thinking
about it, through remembering it. And so this, this is the constructing power of thought.
I'll just do a little bit of an experiment here to give you a taste of the power of thought.
I've done this in this group before, so many of you may have experienced this before with
me. Let's just take a moment, say 30 seconds to close our eyes and settle for just a moment.
And what we'll do is after a few moments, I'll just drop some words into the room. I'll
say some words and just notice what happens for you when I say these words. But it'll
be a few minutes or a few moments before I do that.
Struggle.
Confusion.
Calm.
Peace.
So did you notice anything happen with the different words? Is there any, any experience?
Anybody willing to share or say anything about what you noticed? Maybe just a quick show of hands.
Did anybody notice a change with the words? Okay, that's a good start. It doesn't always
happen, but often there's something. Anybody willing to share just a few, a few sentences?
Okay, great.
The first one that you brought up was struggle. I got a surprising image. I saw a Rockwell
Kent image of a person bound to a mast. And it was like, whoa.
So an image popped up. An image popped up. It was an image. And it was like, wow. So that
sort of derailed me from the meaning because there was a surprise reaction from that. And
so that was sort of interesting. When you said confusion, I felt a great fondness. I
recognized it. It's like, oh, hi, confusion. It's, it's when you said peace, that almost
was, it felt big. It was like, oh, this piece is big, you know, just very little primitive
reactions in me rather than a reaction of peace or a reaction of confusion.
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. So just little, little shifts basically. Yeah. And sometimes they're
small, sometimes they're large, but given that, you know, I, I, most of you experienced
something, you know, so, so these were just three words, four words that I dropped in
to your meditation. And there was something that happened for you. We are dropping words
into our mind constantly all day long. And there are effects of those words on our system.
And so this is the kind of thing that we can be curious about in the moment when we return
after we've been thinking. It's like, what has been the effect of that thinking? Don't
just jump over it and think, oh, I'm back. Let me come back to the breath because that
experience of the mind wandering has created something that almost like it's, it needs
to be acknowledged as the mindfulness returns. And so give yourself some space to like, you
know, even just be, be curious and like, okay, what's here now? You know, I don't, I
don't, you don't have to go looking for it. But this, like I was talking about letting,
you know, letting your system show you your sensations in the guided meditation kind of
similarly. It's like just, okay, asking your system, how, how has the system been affected
by that? Maybe there's some tension in the body. Maybe there's some thoughts or images
that arise with, with what's happened. Maybe there's some emotion that's there. So
give yourself a chance to kind of take in the effect of thinking. This is a powerful
practice and it's one that helps kind of translate into our daily lives because, you
know, there's so much of thinking going on in our daily lives and we are kind of being
carried along by these waves of, of things that are being constructed, emotions and
images and thoughts and all of that's happening for us in our daily lives. And if we can be
curious as we're going through our lives, okay, well, here's a thought about this person
and this situation. How is that affecting me? Because there's a lot of information in
our kind of organism about how we feel about things, how we relate to things that often
we skip over or kind of, it's kind of underground. We're not really so consciously aware of
it. So it's a, it's a helpful curiosity to just kind of take in, okay, well, give yourself
a few moments as you return from being lost to take that in. What has been the effect
of thinking? We also start to see, I mentioned a few moments ago about seeing kind of cause
and effect and this is, you know, basically these thoughts arising. Often they are, they
are caused or conditioned by something else. So I mentioned, you know, the sound of a train
might be an associative link to a thought arising. And we can start to see that. It's
not like thoughts are random. There's something. We don't always get to see what the kind of
cause and effect or conditional relationship is, but we can see, okay, there's something.
There's something that is triggering or conditioning the arising of this thought. And then this
thought arises and that conditions an arising and an emotion. And then that might condition
the arising of another thought. And so we can start to see how this is just a process at
work in our minds. This process of thinking, it's a natural process. I mean, it happens
for us. It is not like our eyes see, our ears hear. Our eyes are designed to take in sight,
light, form, color. Our ears are designed to take in sound waves. Our mind is also designed
not only to kind of know thoughts, but also to create them, produce them. So it's a little
more complex than the other sense stores that we have. Because our eyes don't create the
form and color. They do. I mean, our system does actually participate quite a lot in creating
what we see, what we choose to see, how we choose to see it. There's a lot of kind of
activity in our minds around the sense bases. But our eyes are not creating the light and
the color. In our minds, our minds are responsible both for creating the thought and knowing the
thought. And so it's a little more complex. It's a little more a challenging experience
in our meditation. And so this is kind of place to begin of just knowing in the moment when
our mindfulness returns, we can get a little flavor for a few moments of, okay, I can know
the mind is thinking, I can know the effect of these thoughts on the mind. And then it can be
really useful, especially early on, if you've not done a lot of practice with mindfulness of
thinking, to then set it aside and come back to settling with the breath or being aware of the
body, but not like trying to take a left turn or right turn and ignore all of the sensations
and emotions that have been created. So that it's almost like, okay, we can acknowledge with
this thought came these emotions and these body sensations. And then in returning to the breath
or returning to the body, we can kind of allow that to encompass or include the feelings and the
emotions that had been there. So that we're not trying to skip over them. You know, if we in
coming back from being lost, we just go, oh, I'm back. Okay, come back to the breath. We are
missing so much that has been going on. And often if we kind of skip over that stuff, it's like, I
think I said earlier, it's like that stuff can kind of come in from underneath and pull us back out
because it may have some power to it or some stickiness to it. If it's not acknowledged or
connected with or actually consciously recognized, oh, this is what's happening. The mind is
frustrated by something. And so if we don't notice that frustration, it's like that frustration
can then begin to get attached to being mindful of the breathing. We find ourselves frustrated
with being with the breath and not really understanding how that happened. So we start to
see this conditionality, you know, a sensation, a sense base, a sense experience, creating the
conditions for a thought arising, the thought creating the conditions for an emotion arising,
the emotion creating condition for another thought arising. Sometimes people ask, you know, what
comes first, the thought or the emotion? And there's no, it's like a chicken and egg, you know, it's
kind of like the, sometimes we can see a kind of a pattern of something like the sound triggering a
thought and that thought triggering an emotion. And there we can say, okay, well, the thought came
first. But then the emotion may then kind of spur, kind of, we have with emotions, we often have
a whole, it's like we get dropped into a pool of associative things with that emotion when an
emotion comes up. So, you know, we, the feeling of frustration arises and it's like we get
dropped into the associative connections of frustration and it's like, oh, and that person,
and that person, and that thing. And so that can kind of generate, kind of dropping into an emotion
can kind of then tumble us into a whole series of other thoughts. And so there's not really, you
know, it's not always the same way. Sometimes an emotion comes first and then thoughts follow.
Sometimes a thought comes first and emotions follow. So just curiosity, being curious about it.
And as we get curious about it, we gain some skill in not getting caught by the stickiness,
not getting pulled into the habits and patterns. We gain some skill with recognizing, oh, this is,
this is, this is the experience of Andrea being really, you know, kind of hooked to the,
got to get that done. That kind of the mind kind of pulled into, oh, that thing I've got to do,
and this, and this, and this, and this. You know, there's a way to kind of be aware of planning
and thinking. It's like we need to plan. We need thoughts to live in daily life. You know,
if we think that our ideal in meditation is to have a thoughtless place. I mean, it can be very
pleasant. It definitely can be pleasant to shift into a place where the mind kind of drops under
the kind of bubble and chatter of our kind of normal surface mind. And it can be a little bit of a
relief to have that experience of the mind letting go of thoughts. But it is also possible to,
you know, and so like that situation I was talking about is like the mind picking up something, oh,
I've got to do this. And the kind of the mind that just kind of picks it up and jumps on the train
of it and runs off into being lost in thought. It's like what that picks up there, at least in
my experience often, is it picks up a lot of tension. It picks up a lot of anxiety and agitation
associated with all of that thing. Oh, I need to do that. And if I don't get that done, what is
possible to do if we can bring some more awareness to it is to have the thinking around that
planning be a little more calm. Oh, okay, yes, I can be aware while I'm thinking, oh, that needs to
happen. Oh, and there's some emotion with that one. Wow, that one is kind of scary to think about.
Okay, well, let's just let that go for a while. And oh, there's that part. Okay, that one, I can get
that one done. And then, okay, and that one. And okay, that can go. Oh, there's another scary one.
Okay. And so we can kind of find our way through thinking, being aware of the effect of the thought
and being aware of where the like landmines are. That can support us in navigating this and daily life.
So that's a little bit about working with the active side of thinking. And there's a lot more to say about
that. But I want to kind of counter contrast it, because often in talking about working with thought, we
kind of gravitate to or kind of assume or think about, it's always the difficult thoughts are the ones
that I get that are sticky, the ones that are charged, that are, are what I need to learn to work with. But
there's also something that often happens in our meditation, that as the mind starts to calm down, we
find ourselves in this kind of Drifty Daydreamy kind of place, where we're not aware. It's kind of more
like the mind has just got these random images, maybe, or just the mind kind of floating, maybe thinking,
nothing really charged at all, but just not really present. Any of you experience that in meditation?
Yeah, it's kind of like spacing out, exactly. I mean, the mind just kind of goes poof. It's not, it's not
aware, but it's also not really charged, right? It's, yeah. And sometimes it actually feels kind of pleasant
that spacing out. So we often have a kind of a conflicted relationship with that and might think
spacing out, you know, spacing out. And often it comes with a particular kind of thought, you know, it's
kind of a daydreamy like thought, or maybe just like random images, or just the mind kind of bopping around
from thing to thing, you know, this thing and that thing, but not really, you know, picking up on much.
So it does sometimes come with some thought, but the overall feeling is kind of that spacing out.
And we might think that spacing out, that state of mind where the mind is kind of bopping around from
thing to thing and daydreaming images, we might think that that is inherently a non-mindful state,
that it would not be possible to be mindful while the mind was in that kind of drifty, dreamy kind of
place. And what I'd like to propose actually is that it is a habit of not being mindful in that state,
but it is not necessary to not be mindful in that state. We actually can become aware of the mind
spacing out. And part of this, what I'd say the way we can start to do this is by in that moment of
remembering, you know, when you wake up after spacing out kind of wander, first of all, kind of make a note
of, oh, this is that spacing out kind of wandering. This is different than that active kind of thinking.
So notice the difference. Very often the experience, at least in my experience, very often the experience
of spacing out tends to be kind of pleasant. It's like the mind is just let go of its habitual kind of
jump on the train of doing something. It's kind of, you know, it's kind of relaxed. But it's just relaxed
without mindfulness. But in that moment that the mindfulness returns, if you can kind of acknowledge, oh,
this is that Drifty kind of mind. That was that Drifty kind of thinking. In that moment, let yourself
take in, so acknowledge it, okay, Drifty, or daydreamy, or spacing out kind of thinking was happening.
And then notice, as with the active thinking, I suggested noticing the effect. Notice the effect on your
system of that experience. Often there's quite a lot of pleasant experience in the moment. There's
relaxation in the body. The mind feels pretty balanced. So it's a kind of a great, and this was like a
great gift for me when I discovered this, because it's like this has been, often spacing out has been
our mind's way to rest and relax before we learned how to meditate. And so, you know, as the mind
kind of begins to settle in meditation, it's almost like the mind goes, oh yeah, I know this, we do
spacing out here. And it's not a problem, but it does, you know, it can create the conditions, what the
spacing out can do when we're not aware, you know, in bopping from thing to thing, you know, like, oh, this,
and that, and this, and oh, that, oh, that, oh, that. And so we can end up stumbling into something we get
into in that place. And so if we're not able to be aware in the mind kind of in that kind of drifty
place, then we can end up caught back in something else. But the other piece is that, you know, it's kind
of like, this has been a strategy, this spacing out, this drifting, this daydreaming has been a
strategy of our minds to help us find a way to relax. And so if that is what you're waking up into, if you
are waking up into that kind of daydreamy like space, let your mindfulness take in, oh, this is, this is
actually the experience of this system relaxed and at ease. We can be mindful of that. We can be aware of that.
So I had an experience, a couple of personal stories around this kind of spaciness or daydreaminess
that were really helpful to me in my meditation. And, you know, as the more, the more, the more I meditate,
the more I see this kind of place that the mind shifts to, it tends to happen as the mind settles.
And so as, so what I often will notice is that if it feels like the meditation has been pretty settled
for a while, and then I find myself just like drifting off and lost and thought, it's like often what's going
on there is that the mind is dropping into a quieter space and didn't quite see that shift. And so it went
into its habit of drifting. And so what I often will see is when I find that the mind goes into this kind
of drifting place, there's something, some kind of shift in the mind that's worth being curious about.
Not, not what's not useful I've seen is when we see this kind of drifting or spacing out to have the idea of, oh,
I need to try harder to stay mindful. Because that is, you know, it's kind of like what the mind is wanting
to do is settle. It is settling a little bit with that drifting. And if we kind of bring in, oh, I need to try
harder to stay present, it's like we're taking the energy level of the mind back to a more agitated place
or a less settled place. And so the place that I've learned to explore there is like, let the mind kind of
shift into that daydreamy place. And then be curious as the as the mindfulness returns. Okay, what's this?
Where's the mind now? What I've seen is that it kind of begins to reveal this more expansive space, or this
more calm space. It kind of is a pointer to something more settled and more calm. And so, you know, letting the mind
go into those drifty dreamy spaces, and then kind of allowing or being curious, can the mindfulness begin to meet
that? Can the mindfulness begin to meet that? So that's one piece that I've seen. And way more often than I would
have originally thought, in returning from the wandering mind, there is more subtleness in the mind than there was
before the mind wandered. It's almost like the mind is saying to me, you've been working really hard. Let me show
you how to relax. And it's like trying so hard to stay mindful. And then the mind just kind of lets go of that.
So sometimes this mind moving into this daydreaming is a little bit of a pointer or a gift to help us see something
about letting go, about more relaxation. So that's one kind of experience that I've seen in my meditation. And the gift
of in the moment of remembering, you know, to let go of the idea that it's always going to be something, you know,
difficult or challenging, because way more often than I expected, it is this pleasantness, this more
relaxation. And so that we can actually use that. We can use that to help the mind settle and connect. And you know,
our mind has been in that drifting space, our mind has been settled and calm, and we haven't been getting the
benefits of actually being fully aware of it. And so this is an opportunity to become more fully aware of, oh, that's
that mind. That's that experience of ease and peace and relaxation. So that's one piece that has been really fun
exploring in the meditation around this drifting kind of thinking. The other the other piece that this is more of a
specific story. One one day I was at my table eating breakfast, and I was practicing trying to be mindful while
eating. And what I had was this idea of what that meant. It meant being mindful of the eating process. And so I was
trying to be mindful of lifting my spoon and chewing and tasting and all of that. And what I kept noticing was that
the mind kept spacing out. So there was, you know, I would be trying to be mindful of the of the eating. And then
I'd noticed myself kind of waking up in this spaced out state, it kind of felt like the mind kind of hovered above
my head into my right to the right just kind of appear somewhere. The spacing out mind was feeling like it was
sitting up there somewhere. And I would notice that at some point the the mindfulness came back is like, oh, spacing
out what I'm doing is being mindful of eating. And so this was that leaping over that I talked about, right, I was
leaping over what the mind was actually doing, which is spacing out, and had the agenda, I'm going to pay attention
to eating. And so that's what I came back to, bringing the attention to the eating and the spacing out happened
again. This happened enough times that I began to get curious about, well, okay, the mind is spacing out. So let's
see, can I know the spacing out? And I was able to kind of let them let the mindfulness almost like follow that
sense of the mind kind of hovering in space up here somewhere. It's like, oh, oh, this is the mind that's just
like, well, this actually is relaxing. That's what what the experience was is like, as I let the mindfulness
like, okay, well, the mind is spacing out, let's see if the mindfulness can kind of follow that. And it was able
to kind of follow the feeling. And in that place of spacing out the mind reckoning is wow, this is restful. This
feels restful. This feels easy. And wow, the mind is really tired right now. I had been unaware that there's
there's been a kind of exhaustion in the mind. And basically, you know, I had been like yanking my mind back to do this
task. And the mind was just like not having it. It's like, you know, we're tired, we're going to rest, we're going
to rest whether you want to or not. And, you know, you come along with us if you want to, which I finally did, you
know, it's kind of like, I finally let the, let the spacing out happen with awareness. It's like, oh, this is what
needed to happen. The mind needed its rest. And when I let that happen, it was like maybe a minute. I just let it
rest. I let it kind of space out. And that experience of spacing out was one of feeling a little withdrawn from sense
experience. There was the resting feeling. There was a seclusion from sounds and a seclusion from body sensations.
There was a kind of a peacefulness there. That lasted for a little while. And then it was like, it was almost like
being in a fog, you know, like I was in a fog. But there was awareness in that fog. The fog is not necessarily
non-aware. So there's a sense of being in that fog and knowing, oh, this is a fog. And actually, this feels pretty
good. It feels pretty restful. And then what happened is the fog cleared. The, the, the spacing out ended, the
tiredness ended. And then there was just a very, an alertness. It's like all the senses like came back online. Seeing
came back and body sensation. And there's a real alertness. And so in this case, you know, it's like I wasn't letting
the mind take its opportunity to rest or do what it needed to do. And it was just, you know, I was, I was forcing it.
The agenda of I want to be mindful of this thing was overriding or trying to override that tiredness. And the
tiredness just basically kept arising. And when I finally let the mind rest, it only needed to rest for about
a minute before there was alertness again. And so it's, it, it was just like such a fun exploration to, to let the
mind be curious about these kind of, you know, spacing out states or these states of drifting or daydreaming.
There's way more possibility of being with that kind of experience than we give ourselves credit for. And a lot, you
know, we do have to kind of let our mind slip into it. And in the moment of waking up, we begin to see, we get a taste of
what it is to be with that state. So we wake up into spacing out. If we're, if we're jumping over and saying, oh,
better pay attention to the eating, then we miss that opportunity to, oh, this is being mindful of that spacing out.
This is being aware of that fog. And all of the kind of qualities of mind and that can come with that sometimes the ease
or the rest or the, the peace or the ease. So those are just a few thoughts about those two particular kinds of thinking.
And I want to open it for a few minutes for comments or questions. If there's anything that you'd like to ask or share.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So when you spoke about waking up from active thought, when you wake up and you're in the middle of a very intense thought that is
associated with a lot of emotion, can you bring it also from the mind into the heart a little bit and talk about how do you,
the couple or how do you kind of, when you're really stuck.
Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's a couple of different things to work with there.
You know, when you're really stuck, sometimes trying to be with that or trying to be aware of that, it just pulls us right back in.
You know, it's just like, it's so sticky. It just pulls us right back in.
And sometimes what we do have to acknowledge the power and acknowledge the, the kind of the real stickiness of it and recognize when is it time
to say not now to those thoughts and have some kind of alternative to like change the channel or give yourself something to step away from.
And that's not even always possible. Sometimes we just have to do the best we can.
But, but so at one point I was working with a lot of thoughts with anger, you know, anger thoughts.
And I began to realize with this particular person, with this particular anger thoughts, trying to turn my attention to be with the anger.
I would just find myself lost in the anger and it'd be like, you know, many 15 minutes before I'd resurface.
And it's kind of like, okay, that's probably, it's probably not the time to try to be mindful of that at that moment.
So you need to have some discernment about that.
And what I did in those situations is I began to cultivate something that would help me to just say, okay, not now.
And there was a real kind of acknowledgments like, yeah, I see you and I see, yeah, you're really strong.
And I see you really want some attention, but I can't give that to you right now.
It's almost like I would deal with a young child is like, okay, you know, I'll get back to you.
I promise I'll get back to you.
But right now I'm going to take a walk and put my attention in my feet.
And that really kind of helped me.
Something really obvious, neutral, something, you know, that I could just connect with really helped me to step aside from it.
So that's one thing that sometimes we have to do.
But the more, you know, in coming to the heart, which is kind of what you were asking about, you know, another exploration can be, you know, as you see that,
as you see that, you know, that challenge, that stickiness, then sometimes if you, again, it's kind of like we need to cultivate some strategies that we can have as go-to strategies.
That one for me of going to my feet with the anger was one with a strong emotion.
Sometimes we can also recognize or have a movement of compassion for ourselves.
Like, wow, this is really hard.
And let it be there.
But, you know, let there be a kind of a wrapping it in the, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Okay, kind of like you said, like, sweetie, oh, I see you confusion.
Oh, there you are.
You know, kind of like being, you know, having a sense of being able to hold it with something, you know, recognizing, yeah, there it is.
It's there and it's conditioned.
So sometimes I find recognizing or remembering, you know, this compassion, the compassion is supported for me by some recognition of, oh, yeah, that pattern.
That habit, that stuck thing, that sticky thing.
It's not my fault so much.
It's the conditions of life that created that.
And anybody having those conditions would have that.
And so that kind of recollection of, oh, of course this is happening.
That helps me find the compassion to kind of recognize that this is just the conditions.
This is just a condition thing that's happening.
That's a doorway sometimes to the compassion.
So, you know, sometimes it's not that we can always just find, oh, let me find compassion here.
Sometimes we have to do some like reflection to help us find our way to compassion there.
And it might be reflection about, you know, something somebody else is doing depending on the dynamic.
It might be that there's something somebody else is doing and you might have to do some reflection on their conditioning.
Oh, right.
They had that happen in their, you know, in their last three weeks.
That's what they've been dealing with.
That's why they're doing that thing.
And then some compassion might be able to come with that.
So sometimes bringing in some, so this is a way actually another whole topic of thoughts,
which I'm not going to get into because it's time to stop, is how we can use thoughts to help us.
You know, we can actually bring in reflection skillfully like this, you know, reflecting on,
oh, right, this person's been dealing with this or, oh, right, this has been my conditioning
that can support the arising of more of those heart qualities to help us to have some balance.
And it is time to stop.
So thank you for your attention.
