Thank you so much for your practice and you know there's times of course sitting in the
retreat hall in person and looking out from the teacher's seat into the hall and just
looking at everyone it's really an incredible view and it inspires me to pay attention when
I'm going off and likewise here in this zoom hall I prefer to look at the gallery view
so I can see a little bit over half of you I have one of these computers can get 49 people
on the screen and I have a pretty large monitor so you're not like postage stamps but it is
very inspiring to see you all and your commitment to the practice so I really want to just thank
you the Buddha speaks about that the community is the whole of the holy life and so here we
are being in community together supporting one another with practice and so yes thank you
and we are here in the midst of a lot that's going on as we all know in the midst of a
worldwide pandemic my 91 year old mother says Bobby I've never experienced anything like this in
my life and I say you know that that's right mom because you were born in 1929 and the last
major worldwide pandemic was like 1917 18 with the Spanish flu and actually my mother's grandparents
both her mother both her grandmother and grandfather both died in the Spanish flu and and so my
mother's mother would grew up with her grandmother and actually she was alive when I was born I had
great great grandmother still alive for about six months but my mother mother never experienced
a worldwide pandemic and we certainly are and it's getting more intense as of midnight tonight
pardon me there's going to be a lockdown in the Santa Cruz area and the California actually the
whole California just about and it'll be like this till early January and in the midst of this
there's also racial and political unrest to extraordinary degrees made much more known
and vocal and visible climate change there's lots that we are all holding and yet I really am so
touched with you all being here coming on this retreat and I also know that Mary Grace spoke
about this earlier that in the first day of practice the often the first day of practice for many
of us is that our minds can be all over the place and it takes a little bit of time to settle and
so I just want to really help normalize maybe with a show of hands you don't have to do it
electronically but anybody's mind been wandering today yeah I think it's pretty universal and so
this is just part of our practice and we're in training and I'm very fond of a quote from
Bante Gunaratana he wrote a number of wonderful books one of them very well known as mindfulness
and plain English that is just really down to earth and very well done but he says it's
somewhere in this process of meditation you will come face to face with a sudden realization you
are completely crazy and that your mind is a shrieking madhouse on wheels barreling down the
hill utterly out of control and hopeless does that sound familiar yeah but he goes on to say
it's not a problem it's not a problem you're not any crazier than you were yesterday perhaps it's
always been this way but you just never noticed so I love his kind of levity here you're not
any crazier than you were yesterday so this is a training and both Mary Grace and JD as well as
myself have been inviting us in our attitude of how we work with the practice to infuse it with
a sense of kind attention loving awareness holding ourselves lightly payment children
offers a wonderful metaphor of training a dog and a puppy and you know when you get a puppy
often you know they need to learn to sit to stay to come and stop so forth and sometimes you can
train it in a very harsh in a very rigid in a very fear-based way and in time the dog often
learns those type of commands but often the dog's temperament becomes somewhat skittish or neurotic
or confused and by contrast you could train a puppy with a lot of patience a lot of kindness a lot
of repetition again and again and gradually in time that puppy will also learn these commands
though of course I we have a dog that's 10 years old and she has selective hearing with some of
those commands and then you know I kind of accept her unique ways but training with with the sense
of patience and kindness often supports an attitude that one begins to grow with greater
confidence and flexibility and I love that like and and and how we can bring this to our meditation
practice to practice in such a way that it helps us to grow with greater confidence and greater
flexibility when things don't go our way this is actually a wisdom quality but is there a way that
we can begin to train ourselves with this kind attention and I know that for some of us it goes
up against our conditioning and last night was very powerful for some of us that share it about
this inner conditioning this self-critic that that doesn't stop so I really want to just invite
we begin to bring some kind attention the attitude that perhaps this is a part of wise
effort the wise effort that knows when to exert when this exertion is needed and can be done in
a kind way and knows when we're over-exerting and backs up a bit using our wise and kind
attention with our effort tonight I look today I'd like to speak about what brings us to practice
and inspiration and clearly what brought me to practice was what is this life it's really to
me mysterious you have a son who's an astrophysicist in his area of study is dark energy and when I
ask him what is dark energy he says we don't know and of course but but what they do know
about dark energy said it's expanding the universe and they use supernovas or exploding stars he
calls them their buoys so we're talking about big big big type of looking so the supernovas are
buoys and they help show how fast the expansion of the universe is going but then I asked him
also says well I mean how can you know the I mean that where's it expanding into isn't
they're just universe after the universe he's like we don't know so I used to have a Zen teacher
Bishop Nipo Siako and used to have this wonderful saying I loved him and he used to say every day
I know less and less someday I will know nothing and I kind of you know like when I look at it
when I'm younger I felt like I maybe knew a lot more than I do now but the bishop also saw
something in me and I'm still working with this one and only he could say this in a way that was
so loving that I wasn't insulted those gonna sound very insulting but Bishop Siako used to say
Bob you are the stupidest person I've ever met my entire life and I and I look at him and go what
do you mean and he would say and I felt that he was looking beyond the skin the flesh the bones
and beings he would say you are already fully enlightened but you don't know it and the way
that he said it it wasn't just I felt that he believed that I'm still working with that one as
a practice he was a student of Nagarjuna Majamika Karika the sense of awakening is already within us
but I love sometimes the image and we speak about this in mindfulness space stress reduction that
is more right with you than wrong with you and that inside us are potentialities of great
freedom and perhaps is you know this is more we really don't know what was in Michelangelo's
head but some say you know the statue of David was already in the mark the block of marble and
all he had to do is chip chip it away it was already there that's one way perhaps that's that Buddha
that knowing within us of awakening that beautiful quote from Carl Jung that I quoted last night
about who looks outside dreams who looks inside awakens but I want to just just pause and just
to honor the mystery crowfoot blackfoot chief and elder says what is this life it's like a flash of
a firefly in the night it is like the breath of a buffalo in the winter time it is like a little
shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself into the sunset these were the supposedly the
last words of crowfoot blackfoot chief it's mysterious and Rod McClava he says why do we
exist 50 trillion cells make up the human body and each of those cells in turn consist of atoms
countless millions and billions of them depending on the function of a specific cell the atoms they
consist mostly of empty space protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons empty space just as the
universe is mostly empty space the human body this entity of mostly empty space is a space held
together space unified even for only a little bit by a life force and this life force needs a purpose
and perhaps we're sitting here we thought what is this purpose of this life the atoms existed
before the human body they made up and they'll be here after this life is gone and in the
meantime in the short interval the atoms are held together by an indescribable and unknowable force
this downright mysterious so when I was young I I had you know probably very similar questions
that many of us had about like what is this life why is the sky blue what happens after death
mean so many questions I still the night look out at the stars and the stars look back at me
twinkling this mystery in early in life I realized and I know that some of you have heard the story
so I won't go into it in detail but I at four years old I had a rude awakening and the awakening
was that I was going to die and that everybody was going to die and that it could happen at
any moment and that was the first time I actually realized about this the truth of life and death
I I don't know where it came from I don't know why I thought that but I knew it unmistakably
that this was not going to last my mother responded to me after I told her about my
discovery she said don't worry Bobby it's not going to happen for a long long time and I could
tell that she was trying to make me feel good and not to worry but I also knew that wasn't the
truth because I don't know what a long time is anyways and and well we'll just think about it
later but I remember was asking my beloved meditation teacher blinded Seattle on his
80th birthday and I asked him Seattle how long has 80 years been to you you've experienced a lot
and he looked at me and he smiled and he went like this 80 years 80 years 80 years no doubt
there's been some water that has come along though it's way in this journey of life but
I'm into going into my 67th year I think about my mother she's 91 she lives by herself in Boston
pretty isolated I call her every day she lost her husband my father many of her friends
you know I when I'm younger I can think about I have a whole life to live at 67 yeah I've lived a
lot of this life and you know maybe there's hopefully it's gonna be morbidly there's no
guarantee whether it'll last even till five minutes from now maybe I'll be the first person to
die on zoom giving a Dharma talk who knows hope not but we don't know and I think about my mother
at 91 like what's up ahead for her she also has some dementia so I'm not able to like I'd love to
ask you like what do you think about this vista that you're on now at 91 and what does it look
like having lost so many people and friends and yet still wanting to live and what what gives you
meaning and what do you think about life what do you think about death I'd love to have that
conversation with my mommy I don't know if I could have that now but at 91 what how much more is
there I did ask my teacher lined it said I was mentioning earlier the one that said 80 years
like this my last trip to Burma was many years ago and I had one last question for him and I asked
Seattle he'd been a monk 70 years at that point he died at the age of 98 and I asked Seattle you've
been meditating all your life you're into you know what are you going to do when death comes and so
he sat there for a while and and then I started his cheek move up and down I lived with him for
eight years and I knew that a cheek moving up and down I was going to get an unexpected comment
and he said to me Bob are you afraid to die and I said Seattle I didn't ask you that question I was
asking what you're going to do when you when you die and he looked at me and shook his head
because you need to meditate more and I said that's right so I certainly do so I sat there and took
that in for a while and then I mustered up the courage again to ask him again the same question
I said Seattle what are you going to do and he said something incredibly wise oh my gosh
he said if I see something I'll be mindful of seeing if I hear something I'll be mindful of
hearing if I feel something I'll be mindful of feeling if I smell or taste something I'll be
mindful of spelling and tasting if there's different mind states that are rising my mind I'll be
mindful of these mind states this is how I will die and this is how I want you to die
it's a very beautiful teaching I even told us once to my grandmother who lived to 103
and she said Bobby that's not a bad idea I love that my 103 year old grandmother thought that
would be actually a good way to go to be aware Jane Kenyon she writes I got out of bed on
two strong legs it might have been otherwise an ah cereal sweet milk and a ripe flawless peach it
might have been otherwise I took the dog uphill to the birchwood and all morning I did the work
that I love and it noon I lie down with my mate it might have been otherwise and we ate dinner
together at a table with silver candlesticks it might have been otherwise and I slept in a
bed in a room with paintings on the walls and I planned another day just like this day but one
day I know it will be otherwise one day I know it will be otherwise in the last year both my
wife and I bought a grave this green cemetery near Half Moon Bay in fact from time to time we go
there and we'll just sit there like this is where actually be the only place only time we'll ever
have an ocean view but we'll be about six feet under so we won't see it but it's powerful to go
to a place like this is where my bones are gonna my skin is gonna dissolve bones are gonna melt
one day I know it will be otherwise and this was the awakening that Siddhartha Gautama experienced
Siddhartha Gautama who later became the Buddha nearly 2600 years ago
Siddhartha Gautama was a prince destined to become a great king and in his 29th year of life having
lived the life of a lot of pleasure and sport and wealth and sensual fulfillment of all degrees
and this is teaching of when he for whatever reason he seemed compelled to go out into the
kingdom and in the four different times he went out where he saw for almost like the first time
he woke up out of this dream world of pleasure and sport and so forth and realizing the realities
of what's known as the heavenly messages of aging illness and death and perhaps he was
somewhat aware of those before but that was way in the background and in the foreground was all
this peachy rosy nice stuff but somehow in these travels out into the kingdom there's
these piercings of the recognition that he encountered a person old probably someone
who looked like me almost or person yell or a person who had died and these pierced his heart
and recognizing that the path towards becoming a king was no longer in his heart and that there
was a fourth heavenly messenger that called to him where he came across a sadhu a wandering
ascetic a holy person that was dedicating your life to understanding the meaning of life and
when Siddhartha saw this person and asked Chana was kind of his helper assistant his chariot
driver and Chana said this is a person that's dedicating their life to understanding the
meaning of life and when Siddhartha heard that there was a glimmer of hope there's a
possibility maybe there's a way to understand this life my sense is for every one of you here
you have already met these four heavenly messengers you may not have thought about in this
context and actually after when we go into walking meditation after this talk I'd love
for you to reflect upon these messengers and how they've touched you the messenger of aging the
messenger of illness the messenger of death the messenger of of maybe there was someone in your
life or a book you read or somebody and how they live their life or that somehow inspired you that
this maybe this more if I begin to turn inwards who's been your heavenly messengers that brought
you to the path I trust you've already experienced that you may not have put it in that type of
context but I don't think you could be here unless you've been touched in this way otherwise why
I come here in front of a zoom computer for hours on end I love the story of the Buddha and I won't
go into it fully but it but just to say shortly it's just so adjourn of understanding these
fragilities of a life and then beginning to turn awareness and tension towards understanding this
meaning of life and it is said that after he left the kingdom he practiced very diligently all
these different types of concentration meditations and became a master of them so much so that other
teachers would say or invite him to come and teach with me but Siddhartha still didn't quite understand
what is this life and then he turned his attention towards he had heard about self-mortification as
a spiritual practice the punishing of the body and he began to do practice in this area limiting
his food intake was the one particular practice he very much deep until eventually limiting his
food down to one grain of rice a day and still no awakening happening and fearing now at this
point that if he lasted much longer doing this he would certainly die as he put his hand down
his abdomen could almost feel his tailbone becoming very skeletal and realizing this is not the way
for me and then choosing to take in some food in a middle path into nourishing the body
and then coming to a tree and taking his seed underneath this tree and making a very strong
determination I'm gonna stay here I'm gonna sit and that you know perhaps because he'd travel first
six seven years and been to so many different teachers so many different teachings and realizing
as he was taking this commitment his determination underneath this tree that he what that he's
seen so much practiced so much learned so much from different teachers was time to rely on his
own direct experience and it is said that as he began to practice his mind wandered to a memory
when he was a child sitting underneath another tree on a very glorious day just like perhaps this
day was he was sitting in now many years later and and memories began to just bubble forth into
him of a day that he felt oneness with the world sitting a tree looking out in the countryside
he was experiencing this as a boy he was recalling filling up oneness with the world and perhaps
because his sensitivity was so heightened he began he also looked at another area of the field
and there was some farmers there and some oxen and plow maybe again because his sensitivity was
so heightened when he saw the plow blade digging into the earth he almost had this sense of hearing
the cries of the worms and he was touched with such pain and the just a position of this world
of that there can be the sense of oneness and the other sense of I don't know the word heart
breaking comes to me heartbreaking qualities of this life that they're both there and it's
said that something about that memory maybe it perhaps contributed towards the orientations
meditation practice which as I mentioned was oriented towards oneness and stillness the
development of tranquility samadhi concentration unification which is a very important part
of meditation practice because it helps to part of me calm the mind bring the sense of
tranquility and serenity and greater degrees of absorption but there was somehow that memory
of the heartbreaking quality of those worms crying and agony that something happened
during his meditation practice that he was developing the concentration but then began
to shift it to the changing nature of the breath beginning to penetrate this mark of
impermanence and he had never done this before and actually at that time very prevalent in
the meditative traditions was the development and the goal of profound serenity and absorption
but he used that concentrated mind to his beginning to penetrate this understanding of the nature
of change and this led to profound understandings and realizations about wife the most sobering
realization began with this recognition that suffering or dissatisfactoriness that this
pain in life and there's kind of like a sobering and humbling acknowledgement of this and then
his interest began to turn into investigating causes causes this and within him another
penetrating insight realization grew and developed was his understanding of misconception of
ignorance of that leads to craving that these were profound causes of suffering the craving
for sensual delight the craving to be something to create something to be someone and third
the craving to feel nothing led to these powerful realizations and understandings and seeing
that perhaps again in these cravings for sensual delights is looking for happiness and pleasure
outside of ourselves we are sentient beings and we do experience pleasures but perhaps
it's really beginning to penetrate that that these pleasures don't bias the ultimate happiness
I remember working with a gentleman there was an engineer and he was kind of conditioned
to believe that you know if he got a good education and got a BMW and gets a house and
gets a boat and whatever all these things would bring him to happiness and when I met
with him he said I got all of these things when I'm not happy who am I what is this life
so this perhaps is developing a wiser relationship with our sensual delights and you know I'll
be the first one to admit I love losing myself into pleasure too at the same time is there
a wisdom and I love and there's a Thai forest teacher a chun cha that speaks about one time
he gave a whole Dharma talk on how much he loved his his tea mug and he was going on
and on about his tea mug and how much he loved it and finally someone had the courage to
say what's this about you and the tea mug you've been talking about the craving leads
to suffering and he laughed and laughed more and said oh yeah I just love my tea mug but
then he went on to say that I love it because I enjoy it and it's a utility and I like the
look of it but I also know it's broken but in the meantime I'm going to enjoy it as
I have it and so I thought that was kind of an interesting perspective the craving to
be someone to continue on is a is a really powerful area for us to explore related to
last night a few of you were talking about this critic and being hard on ourselves being
judgmental on ourselves sometimes I almost think that the craving to be someone is rooted
in an old country western song of I'm looking for love in all the wrong places and of course
the craving for the central delight is I just can't get no satisfaction no matter how much
I try but it's looking for love in all the wrong places like what does it mean is craving
to be someone but how many of us have had the experience of feeling like we're not
enough that we wish we could belong to this group or to that group or to be seen to be
loved this is a great cause of suffering for a number of us is this this longing looking
for love outside of us we're actually it may be inside that if we grow up in such environments
that we are fed to believe that we are not enough it becomes an actuality so coming back
to our conditioning is so important our identity the good news is what is learned can be unlearned
if we become awake this is the possibility within all of us but all this conditioning
feeds a sense of identity and it happens at such a time part of the matrix of our identity
is that it happens from from our early childhood we develop the sense of self it's really
I felt very blessed that in our household I'm living with a five almost six month old grandson
his name is Silas and no doubt there's some conditioning that he's already developing
and of course from the Dharma point of view there may be a lot more conditioning but but
you know relatively speaking of you know four five six month old baby you know they're pretty
pure in some way like the other day I was holding him holding him his feet were in my
lap and I was holding him this actually happened twice in the past ten days and he pooped as
I was holding him and he's just looking at me and I'm just holding them and he's making
and and and it was like like there was absolutely it didn't even occur to him to have shame
or humiliation or embarrassment he was just being himself and when he laughs he laughs
and when he cries he cries when he vomits he vomits when he farts he farts when he pees
and he poops and we all came from this place I can almost cry because when I look at sixty
seven years of conditioning oh my and of course last night there was another person saying
eighty one years of good like we have a lot I I'll speak only for me a lot of conditioning
I have indeed but we came from this place and through our upbringing and conditioning
we get developed and we get shaped and we become who it is that we become and if we
don't see it we just keep on becoming who we become and everyone around us is of course
reinforcing that so we begin to believe it I grew up with the cartoons one of them was
Popeye the Sailor Man and Popeye used to say I am what I am because that's the way
I am I'm Popeye the Sailor Man and you know Popeye's got you know as long as I am what
I am and that's the way I am and I'm Popeye the Sailor Man there's no way to begin to
look inside on one hand it's beautiful is marveling on his own sovereignty as Popeye
but on the other hand maybe some of this conditioning has blinders in it my near six
month old grandson has no racial political bias whatsoever in him not yet we all came
from that we didn't come in hating we learned that I was four years old and one day a friend
of mine called me a name I didn't even know what it meant and I went home to tell my parents
and I said the kid across the street called me a kike and then I could see the look on
my parents face of oh my oh and then they had to explain to me what it meant and I was
like but I can't quite understand like I couldn't understand that the gift of the Dharma is what
is learned can be unlearned if we're willing to be able to bring awareness to our body
to our thoughts to our stories our emotions these narratives and you know it's very powerful
there's a very beautiful reading a quote from the Buddha upon awakening is sometimes
referred to as the lion's roar and supposedly he said through many a birth I've wandered
in samsara seeking but not finding the builder of the house and sorrowful it is to be born
again and again oh house builder thou art seen thou shall build no house again all the rafters
are broken the rich pole is shattered my mind has attained the unconditioned achieved is
the end of craving and ignorance my mind has attained the unconditioned was very beautiful
and wise and powerful about this is that if the Buddha tamed the unconditioned it's speaking
about you can only know the unconditioned through a condition and the condition is our story
is our narrative is our identity beginning to see through the conditioning this obscuring
of misconception the belief that I can find my happiness through outside of me through
the central delights the belief that somehow I can be okay by others telling me that I'm
okay and the third one the belief that if it's penetrating through this belief that
if I just disappear if I just annihilate if I just not hear if I'm just frozen and just
that this craving to not feel anything is beginning to see through these conditionings
we can say that the heart of the Dharma is the lessening that leads to the potential
greater lessening to potentially the end of greed and hatred and ignorance and all we
have to concentrate on is the lessening part from the Buddha cycle psychology the most
deepest sources of all suffering is greed and hatred and ignorance and it's wonderful
to reflect upon the opposite of those that sometimes we don't do so much of but with
it the lessening of greed what arises is the increasing of contentment contentment is very
underrated it's something money cannot buy contentment to me is the greatest of wealth
my teacher like it said oh had such a profound will of contentment that just being with him
and listening to his breath would take me to the far reaches of the deep forest the opposite
of greed is contentment the opposite of hatred is love heart the opposite of ignorance is
seeing through the misconceptions the stories the narratives the understanding of suffering
its causes in the path to its lessening so here we are these conditions that are coming
up for us as we said these stories of my own deficiency and maybe it's not so pleasant
to become aware of that but actually it's goodness because it's showing us the places
where we actually can bring attention to and to begin to investigate and begin to perhaps
understand that this is not all of me this is part of my conditioning that led me to
feel that I'm so and so of a person we are more so maybe we'll just pause here for a
moment without just to sit for a few moments breathing in and breathing out and what would
it be like with these breaths in and breaths out perhaps one breath at a time to just experience
for a few breaths the lessening of greed and inviting in a sense of contentment in ease
within our being it's the skin the connective tissue the muscle the bone organs are being
just just breathing in and breathing out experiencing a sense of contentment we don't
need anything don't need to push anything away or get anything just as we are all the
stories can begin to just fade and breathing in and breathing out the lessening of hatred
aversion not wanting and the heart's becoming open friendly kind compassionate and breathing
in and breathing out developing greater clarity dispelling the ignorance and misconception
of things this understanding of the places where we get caught seeing through the conditioning
seeing greater freedom clarity understanding wisdom
I'll just end with some words from some copper he says the human body at peace with itself
is more precious than the rarest of gems cherish your body does yours for this one time only
the human form is one with difficulty and it is easy to lose all worldly things are brief
like lightning in the sky this life you must know is like a tiny splash of a raindrop
a thing of beauty that disappears even as it comes into being the human body at peace
with itself is more precious than the rarest of gems
Thank you for your attention and this will be a time for a half hour of walking practice
and I would love to invite you if you feel inclined this invitation of these messengers
that have brought you onto the path illness aging death and perhaps there's a person
a book a figure in history someone you heard of or something that just inspired you that
yeah I could begin to look inside so this inspiration brings us to the path thank you
so much see you in 30 minutes
