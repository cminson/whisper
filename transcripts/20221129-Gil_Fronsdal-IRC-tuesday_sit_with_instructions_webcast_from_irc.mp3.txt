 First of all, I just want to offer a deep bow to each of you for your sincere and wholehearted practice showing up in the midst of everything that may be happening within and around you. I often reflect that I come from a country of 1.4 billion people. Very few had opportunity to practice and engage in a practice like we do here. We're truly blessed, quite lucky, really lucky, very fortunate to be able to have this kind of opportunity for ourselves and for each other. And we're all practicing together here as a community and such goodness. I just really touch my heart and so I want to offer this maybe as a way to ever so slightly uplift or brighten our hearts a little. This is a really blessed endeavor we're in. And tonight I want to share a poem that's inspired by Gil's Dharma Talk this afternoon. And this poem is pointing at this unfolding journey that we've been talking about and that in meeting Dukkah while we have an opportunity to begin to have new perspectives on how we relate to them. And in this unfolding and so miraculous and that in this whole unfolding and there is uplifting joy, uplifting happiness and peace along the way to prepare for this new perspective. And this poem is written by a Japanese Zen monk, Ryokan. And his writing about coming out of temple and going for Omshran, Omshran for his daily meal and he ran into a whole bunch of children. He just wholeheartedly began to play with the children and other people are looking at him, laughing at him being full. And yet he was not limited by what other people thinks about him or believes about what the monks supposed to look like. And so there is this kind of freedom from what might be limiting him. And this was what Gil was pointing at as well this afternoon. And so here it is. So first the days of spring the sky. It's translated by Stephen Mitchell. First the days of spring the sky is bright blue, the sun huge and warm, everything turning green. Carrying my monk's bow I walk to the village to beg for my daily meal. The children spot me at the temple gate and happily crowd around dragging to my arm till I stop. I put my ball on a white rock, hand my bag on a branch. First we braid glasses and play tug-of-war. Then we take turns singing and keeping a kickball in the air. I kick the ball and they sing then they kick and I sing. Time is forgotten, the hours fly, people passing by point at me and laugh. Why are you acting like such a fool? I nod my head and don't answer. I could say something but why? Do you want it to know what's in my heart from the from the beginning of time? Just this, just this. And so just this, just this. Maybe just the listening, just the sitting, just the walking and the simplicity of our being, the wholehearted way of a being, allows the emergence of something new from each of us. So may this be an inspiration for all of us. Thank you everyone.
