 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So again, welcome. I'm just going to do a very brief settling in, some very light guidance for this first meditation. Starting by turning the attention inwards, softening your eyes, softening your body. And if it feels safe to do so, please close your eyes to go inwards. If that feels unfamiliar to you, it's fine to have them open, cast down, about 45 degrees, looking at nothing in particular. Perhaps the carpet, the floor in front of you. And then inviting your tongue to soften. And checking in, acknowledging how it feels to be here right now in your body. Noticing the weight of your body and the floor or chair supporting it. And allowing your body to settle in, be supported by the surface and by extension by the boundless support of the earth. It can be helpful to start with a couple, three intentional breaths. Maybe a little bit deeper or slower than usual. In through the nose, and out long and slow, either through the nose or through the mouth with pursed lips. Inviting the system to relax. And then at the end of those few slightly deeper breaths, allowing the breathing to return to however is natural in this moment. Perhaps simply noticing the out breath a little bit more than the in breath. No need to change anything. And as we begin this period of meditation, attuning, tuning into your deepest aspiration, your deepest wish, for your meditation practice and its effect on your life. Just one or two words within. It could be healing or freedom or something else. And then with that wish in mind, setting the intention to meet all that arises in the practice, in this day, with kind interest, kind awareness. And now the invitation is to connect. Connect more deeply with embodied experience. Noticing the feeling of your whole body sitting. Checking in with your posture. Both feet grounded. Your sit-spoons rooted where you're sitting. Allowing a posture that balances ease and comfort with relaxation. So noticing your spine and inviting your spine to be erect, straight, without forcing retention. The head balanced over the shoulders. And perhaps the sternum slightly lifted to invite more air in easily. And from that place of uprightness, inviting the body to soften. Softening around the bones. And then starting at your feet. Allowing awareness to fill your body like water fills a sponge. Being aware of the feet from the inside out and inviting them to relax. Moving upwards through the ankles, lower legs, knees. Noticing the vibrancy, any tingling or pulsing, tension or relaxation. And allowing the calves and ankles and knees to soften. Inviting the thighs and hamstrings to rest. Softening the muscles around the bones. And filling all of your legs and hips with awareness. Tuning into the belly and the abdomen. Noticing the movements there of breathing. Allowing your belly to hang loose, soft. And noticing all the little movements as you invite the breath to relax. Allowing the awareness to fill the whole torso. Noticing the flexion and movement to the ribs or chest. Inviting relaxation of the muscles between the ribs, the pectorals. Inviting the viscera, the organs, to soften. Allowing all of that, the motion of the breath, to invite the muscles in your back to relax around the spine again. Softening the hands as well, the arms and shoulders. Filling them with awareness. Allowing the breathing to be felt in the throat, in the neck. Inviting the neck, shoulders, jaws to relax. And including your whole head. Softening the ears and the eyes, the lips and the tongue, the scalp and the temples. Allowing awareness to fill you from the tippy top of your head to your toes. This whole body. And then allowing the attention to settle with this kind awareness. Wherever feels most natural for you. The awareness of the whole body, the field of sensations. The whole breath, the whole body of the breath. Or simply at your hands and feet and seat. Or the act of hearing. Settling into the sensations of now with kindness. If you have a loving kindness practice, you're also welcome to do that. Anchoring your attention here. Anchoring your attention here. Anchoring your attention here. Anchoring your attention here.UI Where are you? So welcome, welcome again to this half day of practice. A few logistical details for those of you who joined us mid meditation. There's a schedule on the donation box, the Dhanabaks, by the front door that you came in. We will be, after I finish talking, we'll be doing 30 minutes of silent walking meditation. And if you're going to walk inside, ask that you walk the short way in the community hall so more people can fit. And you're also welcome to walk in the little parking lot just adjacent to IMC on this side of the bushes. Please don't walk in the dentist's parking lot or in any other parking lot. And if you're walking on the sidewalks, take care not to block driveways as you walk. Let yourself go inside and notice your body as you walk. And stay a little bit aware if you're outside of the surroundings and the context. So there is also a sign up sheet at the end of the stage here for optional practice discussions. If you would like to take part in those. I will be meeting with people in the room just on the other side of this wall, the conference room in the corner here. You access it by going out into the community hall through the library. This door will remain closed for silence during the sits. And after 30 minutes of talking, there'll be a silent sit for 45 minutes, another walking period and a final sit. I may say a few words in that and then a little darmette. If the weather permits, you're welcome to stay for lunch outside. A few of us may hang out under the overhang in the front, even if it's drizzling. So just a couple of thoughts for your practice. Yes, Marianne, do you have an announcement? I wasn't planning on it, no. We don't really have time if we do lunch, so thank you. So we have a nice chunk of time for practice this morning. The invitation is, again, to tune into your intention. Go inside and tune into your intention for this time of practice that you've given yourself. What is your aspiration for the role of meditation in your life overall? And to set the resolve, the determination that in this day, this formal time of practice, to meet whatever arises with kindness, compassion. To cultivate at least that intention, even if the emotion, the attitude isn't possible. And to connect with whatever practice, whatever form of anchor of attention works best for you in these hours. You're welcome to practice formal metta, breath meditation, or simply being aware openly as you sit and walk in these times. So thank you for your practice. Marianne will ring a bell in about half an hour to call people back to the meditation hall. Now is the time for formal walking. Thanks.
