 it as we all will. But I want to talk first just a bit about this walking meditation that you see on the schedule. Some of you I imagine are quite familiar with it and others not so much. And it's relevant to talk through the basics of how we do this. Even if you've heard it before it might be useful and of interest. So walking meditation is a formal way of bringing our awareness to other aspects of our life besides the sitting meditation. We can't sit all the time anyway. But in addition there's value in learning to bring our awareness to times when our eyes are open and when our bodies are moving because we do that a lot during the day. So walking meditation is a formal way to train ourselves in this more integrated way of being aware. And in addition it has its own kind of unique value as a practice that I hope you'll discover over time. I do acknowledge that walking meditation is for many an acquired taste if you will. And it might be something that the first few times you do it or the first few years that you do it it's less appealing than the sitting meditation. And of course there are others for whom walking is immediately dynamic and valuable. For me I can say it was a bit of an acquired taste. But we'll talk through what we do. So in walking meditation generally the awareness is going to be in the legs and the feet where we're kind of where we're making contact and the parts of the body that are moving the most. So that changes the object from whatever you were using in the sitting posture such as the breath like we did today to this aspect of the body. And let me say one more general thing before we stand up and try which is that the walking meditation period is also a time when you know it's a good time to go to the bathroom or get a cup of tea or a snack if you need. But please don't cut too far into the walking meditation. It's helpful to keep that as a formal time. So maybe planning to do your other activities at the beginning or the end of the walking period and having a full block of time that you devote to walking just as you would to sitting. Okay so why don't we stand up and try it together if standing is okay for you of course. So just coming into a simple standing posture and it doesn't matter if you're on your mat or not at this time but you'll want to be able to feel your contact with the floor and just bringing the attention downward to where the feet are touching the floor and maybe even shifting a little bit just to find a central balanced point and then allowing your body to just naturally soften into that standing posture and this would be how you would begin at the beginning of your walking path. And what we do in walking meditation is not that we're walking around like walking around the property that would be a different practice. So in walking meditation we have a formal place where we walk maybe 10-15 paces something like that and the idea is that we'll walk and then turn around and walk back and so it's a way of having a simple space where we don't need to think too much about navigating it or making choices while we're on it like we would in a regular walk. So that allows the mind to be more settled it's more like a meditative exercise. So just to get a feel for what it's like to bring awareness to the feet and the legs as we move maybe just shift to the right side so that your weight feel the weight going on to the right leg. This would be as if you're beginning to take a step with your left foot and then go ahead and raise your left foot and just move it forward a bit and feel it placed down and then shift the weight on to the left leg. So you can feel perhaps even in just such a simple movement there's quite a lot going on in the body and so it's not that we would need to track all of that micro attention although that can be a great way to do it. But just noticing that there's actually the body and take another step if you want or you could step backwards and just having a sense that there's a way to walk simply back and forth with the attention on the feet and the legs generally. So the next question people tend to have is how fast should we do this? And the short answer is that we walk at the pace where we can be mindful. So that means having some awareness of how fast your mind is going at this moment. I know that when my mind is going very quickly and is energized, sometimes restless, walking at a slow pace aggravates that because I'm going, I'm not aligned with how my mind is. So you might start by just walking at almost a normal pace back and forth, normal walking pace. But then there comes a point where if the mind is more settled it begins to feel like that's too fast, that's agitating. And so you might want to slow down then and it might change throughout a walking meditation session, throughout a day, throughout the retreat. So this is another area for mindfulness. How fast should I be walking such that mindfulness can be maintained pretty well? And as with sitting, if you find that you've gotten distracted as you will, that's okay. You're already back. So just, you can stop if you want or just pick up again where you are. So that's relatively brief instructions, but you could always check in with your teacher in a practice meeting if you would like a bit more about walking meditation. But we'll go ahead and do that now for the next 45 minutes. And I hope you will enjoy your day. Thank you.
