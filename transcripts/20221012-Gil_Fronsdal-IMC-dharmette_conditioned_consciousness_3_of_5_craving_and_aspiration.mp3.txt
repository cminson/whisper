So, come to the third talk. 
That's a series called Conditioned Consciousness. 
And the idea that the way that we perceive or experience or construct the sense of consciousness is something that is conditioned. 
It's constructed or influenced by all kinds of other factors in our minds and our hearts and in our life. 
And that as we start understanding some of these conditions, some of these influences for how we put together the idea of consciousness, that we can appreciate how much some conditions create a consciousness which doesn't feel so good, and others help produce one that feels wonderful. 
And so today I want to talk about the range or the distinction between craving and aspiring. 
Craving is considered to be a form of suffering in Buddhism. 
It's a craving that has a compulsion to it that kind of, if it's strong, has us by the throat or by the nose pulling us around. 
And we're not very free. 
The only freedom we can find with intense compulsion, there's two kinds of freedoms you can find. 
But with the craving itself, there can be a sense of freedom when we give into it. 
But it's kind of just going along, giving into attachment so it has free reign. 
It's not a real freedom. 
The second kind of freedom we can discover is we can have craving, but we don't succumb to it. 
We don't give into it. 
We have the ability to see that we're craving and not pick it up, not get involved. 
Enough so that we have a broader sense of awareness, of presence, of attention to it. 
And part of the effect of craving, it tends to, like other tensions, it tends to narrow the range of consciousness. 
Attention tends to be focused now on the object of the craving. 
And so it could be a laser focus. 
It could be a narrowing of the field. 
Things get smaller and tight and kind of both tense and agitated. 
Sometimes hot, sometimes there's a feeling of pressure that comes with craving. 
Kind of like it's saying it has to be now. 
But craving, relatively shallow, as powerful as it can be, is a kind of a shallow segment or level layer of the mind that keeps us somehow alienated from ourselves, disconnected, partly because we're constantly looking outside for the object of craving. 
And so we can't settle back into ourselves. 
As we settle back and relax and really find a place to rest inside where we're free of craving, free of that compulsion, agitation, contraction, with time we can start discovering that there are wellsprings of desire, of wishes, of aspiration that arise from in that it can occur without any compulsion. 
And that those, because they're kind of a wellspring that wells up, the influence they have on our sense of awareness is to support it, is to buoy it. 
It's almost like it can, if you're a practitioner, know something about being present and mindful. 
The underlying welling up of this aspiration to be free, to be compassionate, to be, you know, whatever it is that comes from the depth of who we are, that it's almost like it spreads and expands the sense of consciousness, the sense of awareness, rather than contracts it and narrows it. 
But this aspiration has to be expectation-free. 
It has to be free of a certain kind of conceit, all of which kind of tighten up again and narrow the scope. 
An aspiration that a wish that is not compulsive doesn't need to be fulfilled even. 
It's just like this is what the heart's wish is, and if it's possible, great. 
If not, it just arises, like the exhale, it just kind of can just flow out. 
And you don't necessarily lose aspirations like that if they don't get fulfilled or don't get acted on anymore that you lose your exhales just because you exhaled once. 
Another exhale will come. 
Another aspiration, but it's a sincere deep aspiration, it'll be there and come as well. 
And so part of the advantage of sitting in meditation, being mindful, and really kind of learning to settle below the layers of agitation, layers of tension, layers of craving, is to come to a place where we have these deeper wellsprings of compulsive-free desires, expectation-free, where the expectation doesn't have to come with a sense of need. 
This needs to happen. 
And so this idea of noticing the difference between craving and aspiration is a very significant exercise. 
I think some people don't have much sense of what an aspiration is in the way I'm talking about. 
Maybe they've never kind of been pointed to it. 
And for me, I grew up without ever having any sense of what that might be. 
But it was through doing this Buddhist practice that I came to appreciate that there's this kind of. 
. 
. 
I call this sometimes a biological drive, sometimes a biological kind of desire. 
Because it didn't seem to be connected to the ordinary cognitions of the mind, the ordinary kind of surface thinking and concerns or the surface emotions. 
They seem to be kind of more built into kind of the depth of the whole operating system here. 
And so biological, if I use that word in a sense that it's deeper than cognition and thinking and those things. 
This kind of aspiration can feed into our cognitions, our desires, our dreams, our imaginations, all kinds of things. 
And they can really enrich a person's life phenomenally to come from this place. 
So to begin noticing a difference between craving and aspiration and noticing a different way in which it affects you, physically, emotionally and conscious-wise, how does it switch and change the sense of being aware depending on which one you're operating from? One of the things that I believe is often the case is that with craving, there's often a feeling of discontent. 
That craving can often come from a sense of lack. 
And so that sense of lack, we're trying to crave to fill it, we're trying to assuage it, we're trying to soothe ourselves or distract ourselves or entertain ourselves. 
So we don't have to feel the pain of a sense of lack, emptiness that we might have. 
And with aspiration, there's a contentment, there's a sense of no lack, a sense of fullness. 
Because we've learned to take whatever lack, discontent, there might be and bring our attention right into it and kind of massage it from the inside out, turn it inside out and fill it with something that's profound. 
Fill it with ourselves, fill it with awareness. 
Fill it so that the tension of lack, the tension inherent in this kind of feeling of vacuity or pain or loneliness begins to relax and soften, begins to settle. 
And so I associate craving with discontent and aspiration with contentment. 
And the funny thing about discontent is that when we're discontented, the mind is kind of contentful. 
Discontent churns up thoughts and ideas and desires and aversions and projections and fantasies and all kinds of things. 
So discontent actually is kind of a busy, agitated mind, so discontent is a mind that's contentful. 
Contentment, on the other hand, allows for settling and quieting of the mind and the heart. 
And in a certain kind of way, contentment is content-free. 
There's space and room for inputs, for things to arise and be there and feel more deeply what's going on in this world. 
Craving tends to create very little room because it's so contentful of all kinds of churning stuff. 
Contentment tends to be content-free in that there's room for us to feel not only the world, be aware of the world in a significant way, but also to be aware of ourselves. 
And to be aware of really what's going on, to be able to be sensitive enough to start living from and feeling something that's more the depth of who we are, the fullness of who we are, rather than this funny thing of lack, which tends to be, yes, a sense of lack that feels empty, but then becomes kind of contentful or something. 
So I hope that this wordplay between lack and fullness and contentful and content-free points you to something that's possible that allows you to begin seeing more clearly the difference between a world lived from craving and a world lived from aspiration. 
And so may aspiration be your guiding light that supports you in living with desires in a way that's phenomenally free, compulsive free. 
So thank you very much and I look forward to being here again with you tomorrow.
