 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. We continue today in the talks about mindfulness of mind. Also, it could be called mindfulness of attitude or in the purity of it, the mindfulness of recognition. And that's the theme from Tuesdays, is recognition. And recognition is a powerful factor. If it can be simple, if we can simplify our recognition of all the baggage, all the associations that it comes along with it. So, for example, if you maybe look around wherever you are, sitting, and can you find something to look at, where you can recognize what it is, but that it's very neutral. This doesn't evoke any ideas of for and against, I want that, I don't want that. It's just there in a simple, very, very simple way. And so for, my eyes now are landing over the far wall, there's an electrical cord to a clock. And I see the electrical cord, and it's just there. I don't have any reactivity to it or preference around it, or for, against, it is just there. And then if I look, turn my eyes up now and look at something that I find that I like, there's a statue, a Buddha statue near the electrical wire. And now I find that there's a kind of a liking and wondering and engagement with it. It's more not just recognizing it, but now there's appreciating, remembering the history, where it came from, who gave it to us, all kinds of things. And then I look down and there's some tape on the floor here at IMC. And I have a little bit of an issue about the tape on the floor because it's a long piece of tape to mark a spot on the floor, but it's crooked, it wasn't laid down straight. And so I think, oh, I should, should I change it? And can I use the same tape to throw it away? And so suddenly my involvement is much more simple, much more complicated. And I look at the electrical wire again and it's just very simple, just a wire. So if you could look around in your space and you could see the different ways that you can recognize something there, how simple can it be, just recognizing it, and how much is it that are coming with preferences, coming with judgments, coming with for and against, coming with commentary. It's in meditation and other times the movement is towards becoming cleaner and cleaner, simpler and simpler with recognition, so that we can see things as they are, not as we want them, or not through the lens of what we don't want there. There is a time, there is a place for preferences, for desires, for things we don't want. There's definitely a time and place for that. This is not doing away with that forever. But there's also a time and place to learn the art of very simple recognition. And it's so simple that it's not, the recognition is not distracted by our desires and our thoughts, our commentary. It's just we recognize it's so simple, just there. There's an in-breath, just an in-breath. And it's so simple that the in-breath isn't tied to, connected to notions of time. Oh, if I need to get concentrated, I need to stay here so that in the future I can be concentrated, so that I don't, so that I'm present for the next exhale, which is coming in the future. I lost it, I lost my attention to the breath a few minutes ago, a moment ago, a few breaths ago. I can't have that happen again. I have to kind of be able to stay with the breath. All those ideas are complicating the simple act of recognition. For this moment, I'm able to recognize this inhale as if there's no before and no after. It's that simple. And if your mind wanders off in between, and at some point you come back to the next inhale, the past is gone. Just this inhale, just that recognition. And at some point, as the simplicity of recognition is there, just this breath, this step, this chewing my food, this sitting in a chair, this walking down a hallway, in the simplest possible way, then at some point what we recognize is recognition itself. We recognize that recognition, as we're recognizing, we see that recognition is simple. We see that recognition is free of association's commentary, preferences, desires. And then, wow, there's this thing called recognition. There's this thing, this experience, this movement of recognition, of knowing, of being aware. And it becomes its own kind of object of awareness. And it starts being kind of special. Wow. There's this clarity, there's this openness. It's kind of like awareness now becomes a guest house, that all travelers are welcome to come into the guest house. But the guest housekeeper is very gracious and allows everything to have its room, so it can rest. So it can be left alone, so it can be accepted as it is. Nothing's needed, no judgments, no nothing. So this idea of recognizing recognition, aware of awareness, knowing that we're knowing, can seem like a hard thing to do, challenging, you know, and even nonsensical to some people. But one of the ways we come to that is that we begin recognizing, as a guestkeeper, welcome, we start recognizing that we are seldom aware, simply. There's all kinds of things we bring along with the recognition. We recognize something and we recognize that we don't like it. We do like it. We want it to be a little bit different. It should be sitting over there, not there. Can I have that? We go into a room of people and we start recognizing what's there. But it's not just simple recognition. Who is it nice to sit next to? Who should I not sit next to? Is it safe here? Where's the good snacks? I think that's what I want. And so there's all these preferences and agendas going on that, and our awareness, our recognition is being used by our agenda. It's being driven by it. Now, of course, this is normal and healthy to do that in many circumstances. It has to be that way. But meditation practice and mindfulness, one of the potential it has is to start recognizing how we complicate or engage awareness, use awareness in the service of our agendas, our preferences. And sometimes it's wise choices we make, what we pay attention to, when we're driving, pay attention to the road. But sometimes our attention is hijacked by things that we don't really, if you thought about it, you would say, I don't want to do that. Focus on that again. I've had the same complaint about my neighbor down the street. Now it's probably a thousand times I've had that thought. And I feel lousy after I have it. It doesn't feel good to have it. And it kind of hijacks my attention. And whenever I drive down the street and see that neighbor or see that house, I get contracted. My attention, I feel my awareness looking and I pull away from the house. So all kinds of ways in which to see how awareness is being used and hijacked and influenced as it's being used. When we do that in mindfulness meditation, sitting in meditation, welcome at all. Don't add judgment on top of judgments. But there's an art to welcoming it, allowing it to be there, which is paradoxically a movement towards simplicity of recognition. When we're not for or against things, then it can just be itself. And there's a room for us to recognize it as it actually is. And then as I've said, this kind of very special time comes when we start recognizing recognition itself in and of itself. That recognition is this jewel, is this amazing capacity. And this ability to recognize or to be aware or to know, depending on how that attentional faculty is showing itself in any given time, can become its own strong presence, its own strong entity, I don't know what the right language is, its own feeling of strength, its own territory, it feels like a guest house, it feels like it has a room for things. And it's okay for things to arise. And the idea of welcoming is too much. I just allow them to be there. Why do this? It seems like maybe then you're just victims of the circumstance, just things come and happen. Because when we can keep our attention very simple, just recognize, just recognize the thing that's happening, including just recognizing how we complicate recognition, how I have desires and aversions. We just keep doing this simple recognition, being the guest house, allowing it to be there. Then the best in us begins to come forth. That which needs to rest, that which needs to relax, that which has a chance to relax. It's not being fed, it's not being egged on or encouraged on. And as the simplicity of recognition of awareness starts happening, then it's almost like there's space then for us to hear ourselves. There's space to know ourselves in a deeper way. There's space to start recognizing that there is goodness here, there is wholesomeness here, there is space begins to be cracks in our, cracks in our, maybe our hearts, so that we can see where there's kindness and love and care, generosity, goodness that resides. The simplicity of recognition, the simplicity of awareness is a key to recognizing our own inner beauty. Because we just welcome all the inner ugliness. It's okay. Come. I'm a guest house for all of you. And it's in the guest house, in the space it makes, in the allowing that there is this welcome, this generosity, this goodness that allows something to settle and relax. And I suspect you'll be surprised by how much goodness exists within you through this simple act of recognition. So all along in mindfulness practice we're practicing recognition of the breath, of the body, of emotions, of thoughts, and everything I've been teaching before still applies. But at some point, as we continue this practice, at some point it's appropriate to start recognizing recognition itself and recognizing that the way we're aware of breath, body, emotions, and thoughts is not neutral. It's not welcome. There's an agenda. There's complications we bring to it. And so it's turning around and being mindful of the mind, mindfulness of awareness, of attitude, begins to free awareness from all this extra baggage, all this extra stuff that we add to it. And goodness has a chance to grow. So thank you. And may you, for this day, may you practice being a guesthouse for all things that come along. And maybe look for, you know, remind yourself, look for particular appropriate places where try being receptive and welcoming instead of maybe the usual habits of mind of how to be with things. Thank you very much.
