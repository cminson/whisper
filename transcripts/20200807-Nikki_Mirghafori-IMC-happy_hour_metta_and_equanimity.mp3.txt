The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, so welcome everyone, a warm welcome to happy hour, wherever in the world you are in this moment.
Happy you're joining us for practicing together in community.
I've been reflecting how happy making happy hour has been for me, sharing it with you.
Whatever arises, regardless of that just being together and practicing is a cause for joy.
So the theme for today for this practice at this hour is continuing or perhaps concluding the exploration we've been doing together with exploring meta-loving kindness, warmth, care, love, kindness, goodwill,
so many different ways to translate this beautiful word from Pali, Metta, N-E-T-T-A to English,
so many different nuances for this feeling of the heart, for care, for friendliness, goodwill to ourselves and to others.
So we've been exploring the relationship between Metta, kindness, warmth, friendliness
and the ten paramis, the ten beautiful qualities of the heart that the Buddha teaches.
We've been going through them, exploring the relationship between Metta and these various qualities.
For example, we did patience, we did virtue or non-harming rather, and the tenth parami, which is what we have arrived at for tonight, is the quality of equanimity.
And tonight we'll be exploring in the guided practice and the guided meditation that I will lead, no experience whatsoever needed.
We'll explore the relationship between cultivating the sense of care, warmth, appreciation, together or one as the precursor of the other.
Metta and equanimity, this quality of expansiveness of the heart and mind.
And I'll just say a couple of words about equanimity.
You might be asking, what is equanimity anyway? It sounds so mighty, equanimity.
The word in Pali is upeka, upeka, and roughly translated from Pali is having an expansive view, having a wider perspective.
And I usually like to relate to equanimity as if you had a bird's eye view on your life, on the world, all the happenings, all the causes and conditions.
So feeling that in your body compared to having a small whole of a perspective on your life on something that's happening where we get so caught and so tight, so afraid.
Instead, when we expand our perspective, the sense of spaciousness, the body, the mind, the heart can relax,
all the causes and conditions that have led to whatever is happening.
And with that sense of perspective, as if you're sitting on a top of the mountain and watching what's going on, there's a sense of spaciousness.
There can be a sense of equanimity in the midst of it all.
And to say equanimity sometimes, people think that it is aloof or it's cold or it's distanced from what is happening.
Not so, actually.
We will explore tonight.
It is related to metta.
In fact, both equanimity, upeka, and metta, kindness,
are part of what's called, what are called the Brahma Viharas, the heavenly abodes, these four beautiful practices of the heart.
They also belong to a different list, which is Brahma Viharas, heavenly abodes of the heart, as well as the Paramitas.
They both share, they're both on these lists.
But what I wanted to say is that they are on the Brahma Viharas list together because they're related.
And when we practice equanimity, we realize that actually the sense of aloofness and not caring, like, oh yeah, things are as they are.
It's not true equanimity.
It's a sense of lack of care.
It's a disconnection.
True equanimity has warmth, has a sense of care.
If we didn't care, we wouldn't be holding witness, we wouldn't be staying with, we wouldn't be holding witness.
And seeing all the causal conditions and all that's arising, we wouldn't be staying with whatever is arising.
So there's a sense of care, warmth, steadiness of the heart, a sense of metta, already in equanimity.
And to say that also equanimity needs to be a part of metta.
Because if there is no equanimity, if there is no steadiness in metta, then we can veer into attachment.
We can veer into wanting and we really, really want something.
We really want the person to be happy or well, we want ourselves to be happy.
There's a sense of tightness.
A tightness arises around metta, whereas we cultivate this practice of friendliness without any attachment with an expansiveness of the heart, which is part of equanimity.
So I've said a lot of words, let the words go, we'll just explore together now.
So I'll invite you to let go of all the words and settling, settling in your posture.
Choosing the posture that's comfortable for you, that you can sit comfortably for about 30 minutes or so in this guided practice.
If you need to lie down, if that's what your body needs right now, that's fine too.
Just decide if your body needs actually to sit up a little, sit up a little straighter with more energy.
Or if it needs to relax and soften some more, to be responsive and see what is needed right now.
Softening and relaxing.
Letting go, letting the breath breathe you for a few minutes.
No need to do anything.
Let there be a sense of ease, relaxation, softening, letting go of your entire body, the muscles.
Ah, relaxing, binding.
Letting yourself be breathed.
With each in-breath and out-breath received in the abdomen, landing more fully, more deeply.
Relax.
Relax.
Feeling your body, seeing the breath, each breath.
A sense of spaciousness, landing with each breath.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
One breath at a time.
Settling.
Relaxing.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Maybe when you go for a walk, you see someone who just looks up and smiles.
Going to the store or cashier, just a sense of goodwill, a sense of goodwill that's available to you, offered to you.
Someone by people you don't know very well and conjure up, bring to mind a few examples, a few felt sense.
When you smile, they're offering you their goodwill.
When they open the door for you, whatever it might be.
Very simple, not complicated.
Just having this sense of goodwill that's all around you.
Don't make it too complicated in your mind.
Maybe it's the simple goodwill that you offer others, the simple goodwill of non-harming.
Again, simple, very simple.
As you sit here, wherever you are sitting and breathing that.
As if it were the fabric of the universe, this simple, subtle scent, perfume.
Goodwill wafting around, surrounding you, through you, offered to you and you offering it to others.
Sitting and breathing for a few minutes.
You can imagine your friends and relatives true if it supports you.
Just keeping it simple, light touch.
Let yourself feel as if you're breathing this in, breathing this out, this sense of goodwill.
Don't get too intellectual about it, what that means.
Just drop it in, try it out.
Again, goodwill, breathing out, goodwill, offered to you, you offering it to others.
Goodwill wafting around.
Goodwill wafting around.
Imagining, considering that actually people who are sitting with you right now,
in the Zoom room on YouTube, you offering them your goodwill, your support by being here,
breathing your support, them offering it to you, a sense of goodwill in this community.
Breathing in and out this goodwill.
Wishing goodness, all these beings while they wish you well in this moment.
Receiving the goodness, breathing it in as it's offered to you.
May you be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease.
May all of us have safety, feel safe, be happy and joyful, be healthy and strong,
and have ease in our lives.
Breathing in, breathing out this goodness, offering it, taking it in.
Goodwill wafting around.
Goodwill wafting around.
Goodwill wafting around.
Goodwill wafting around.
Goodwill wafting around.
Now this easy light touch of care, goodwill for yourself and offered to others.
You can continue with this if you like, or if you wish.
I want to invite you to bring to mind, maybe something from earlier in the day,
or if you're in an Asian time zone right now, maybe something from yesterday that happened,
just some event from your life.
If you're watching a movie of your life, you're sitting in this comfortable, spacious movie theater,
with a sense of goodwill, receiving and sharing goodwill in your body and your bones,
surrounded, held with goodwill, going through you,
offered through you, washing through you.
The sense of goodwill is you're breathing it, offering it, receiving it.
So don't lose touch with that.
And watching in this theater, this comfortable theater, watching a scene,
from something on your life, about your life on the screen, with a sense of care, goodwill,
but not too caught in it.
A sense of expansiveness, your body relaxed.
You're seeing yourself in other people.
There's care for you, there's care for others.
There's a little goodwill.
It doesn't have to be a charged moment.
It's just something that happened.
Maybe you're on some Zoom meeting earlier today or yesterday.
Just imagining a scene, anything would do for this example.
Just watching it from this perspective of care.
Goodwill for yourself, goodwill for others.
An expansive perspective.
See what it feels like while you experiment.
Don't lose touch with your body, with the breath, with the sense of goodwill.
And if you feel, find yourself getting entangled in the story.
Let go of the image.
Turn off the movie for a moment, just as you're sitting in this movie theater.
Settle in your body again, receiving, sharing goodwill with the community around you.
Receiving, feeling held in goodwill.
Sharing your own goodwill.
And it feels like you're more stable, embodied, grounded in goodwill and in your body.
And you can bring up another scene perhaps, just a simple scene.
A sense of goodwill for yourself and others, watching the scene, yourself and others, interacting.
A sense of spaciousness.
Not being caught with goodwill.
A sense of care, watching this movie and yet the spaciousness, not being caught in it.
And support feeling into the practice of equanimity, which has a sense of care, presence, but isn't caught.
Holds with spaciousness the erisings and passings of your life and of others, the events.
And there is care, as you feel, there's goodwill, there's connection.
Lack of, with lack of being caught or tight around it.
As if you're seated, comfortably seated in your chair, in your seat, not toppling over into the scene,
but also caring for the protagonists.
Feel free to experiment and adjust and feel the connection between equanimity, the spaciousness and meta-goodwill
for all the participants, all the protagonists.
And not separate from each other.
Feel free to experiment and adjust.
Feel free to experiment and adjust.
Feel free to experiment and adjust.
With watching the movie with all the protagonists, let yourself have a sense of goodwill, appreciation.
Care for all the causes and conditions that have brought these various beings, these people to this moment,
interacting in this way, so many causes and conditions.
Historical, genetic, upbringing, educational, their own perspectives,
holding this all, this sense of spaciousness and awe, appreciation and goodwill.
And maybe even appreciating all the suffering of all the people in their entanglements, yours included,
your reactivity, yours included, without getting caught in it, in this moment.
Feel free to experiment and adjust.
Feel free to experiment and adjust.
Feel free to experiment.
And for the last moment of this period, holding yourself with kindness and goodwill,
appreciation for having shown up in practice, without attachment to outcome, without attachment to outcome.
As if this practice you are watching now on the movie screen, whether you fell asleep, whether your mind wandered,
having a sense of goodwill, having a sense of goodwill for this being that is you who try.
Oh look, this protagonist, mind wandering, falling asleep, or whatever it was, a sense of goodwill, without being caught in the story,
allowing for what was, just as it was, just as it arose.
Thank you all.
I'd like to invite you, if there are any reflections you'd like to share from exploring the relationship between
Buddha and equanimity in this way, we first established ourselves the sense of goodwill, the sense of metta, very light receiving and giving metta,
goodwill, the sense of goodwill and then watching the movie of our lives, a moment of it, something that happened on the screen with a sense of spaciousness to bring up to really connect in a physical way with a sense of equanimity.
And I'll share something from my own practice tonight, which I really enjoyed. I was in a Zoom meeting earlier today with lots of individuals and opinions and discussions and that came up for me to see in the movie of my life.
And having care, having goodwill for every participant, for myself included with my ideas and different ideas from other people, just a goodwill for everyone, sense of, oh, look at all these beings doing their best.
So a sense of equanimity, not being coordinated, but sense of goodwill sharing that. So for me that was quite actually lovely to experience today with this emphasis on the metta perspective.
So you're welcome to unmute yourself and share any reflections or questions that you have or type it in chat. Go.
Also, your reflection might just be one word or phrase, something that's coming up for you. You're welcome to put that in chat. Thank you, Bill.
Feeling love balanced by perspective. Balance. Beautiful. Thank you, Bill. Appreciate that. Yeah. It's really metta and equanimity. They're really both parts of each other. They are inseparable, completely inseparable.
And it's just as you describe, feeling love balanced by perspective and a bigger perspective. Thank you for that. Other reflections, what's coming up for you? What came up for you?
So equanimity felt lighter than metta. You know, I'm not quite sure if that's the right word. You know, I mean, it didn't feel as entangled perhaps.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's great, actually, because that's how metta needs to feel. So your metta probably needs more equanimity to balance it so that it doesn't feel so entangled.
And of course, with the practice of metta, entanglements will come up, will be purified, the mind and the heart will work through them.
But when metta feels pure, it does feel unentangled, it's just offered freely. So really appreciating that you observe that new.
That difference is really important to remember how that felt, love without entanglement, or care without entanglement. Yeah, thank you.
So I've heard an analogy. Metta is like the first time you hold a new puppy. You feel all the, well, all the emotions.
And then the puppy starts playing and you're delighted at how much fun the puppy is. So your delight is participatory joy.
And the puppy hurts a paw and then squeaks. And you feel the pain and you want to help, so you go help. So that's compassion.
And then you give the puppy as much food as is healthy for him to have at that time. But he's all mournful and wants more and he's sad.
And you care, but there's nothing to do about it. So in this analogy, that's equanimity. What do you think of that analogy?
Yeah, it's a fun analogy. And in terms of equanimity, there are lots of different ways to relate to equanimity.
And in a given limited time, equanimity sometimes is related to, can be related to, as yes, when suffering is so great,
that compassion really becomes equanimity, the spaciousness with care and love holding it, but not much can be done.
That's one way to relate to it. But also there are many other ways to relate to it, as well as actually seeing that equanimity needs to be present in every moment of Mehta,
as well as the vicarious joy Medita, there needs to be equanimity and also with compassion, there needs to be every moment there needs to be equanimity.
The other one, otherwise one will get into empathic distress. So equanimity is part of all of these and has this stabilizing caring,
and that all of those are also part of equanimity, this big, bigger picture. So yeah, lovely analogy and it's part of the bigger picture.
Thank you.
Yeah, Erica offers, I don't usually think of causes and conditions in relation to spaciousness. And I think something shifted when to the vastness interconnectedness of everything.
Oh, when you felt the vast interconnectedness of everything. Oh, that's lovely. So the collection, the typo. So something shifted when you felt the vast interconnectedness of everything.
Beautiful. Thank you for sharing that, Erica. It sounds quite profound. The shifting perspective. Beautiful.
If you'd like to add anything you're welcome to, and if anybody else likes to add something, we'll take one more beat, one more pause.
It seems like bringing emphasis to equanimity made the matter feel more sustainable. It's like it gives it a kind of momentum that's de-momentary.
It starts to seem like something, oh, I don't have to try to do this. This is just here, and it's about noticing it more than doing it in a sense. Does that make sense?
Absolutely. It makes sense. Thank you, Laurie. That's great. Yeah, the sense of effortlessness that comes into meta when there's equanimity, when there's no entanglement, it frees up energy, and it's like, oh, it's already here.
I don't have to do it. It's just, I have to realize it, feel into it. Oh yeah, good will. It's here. Available. Beautiful.
Thanks so much for sharing that and experiencing that so that you can, that experience can be moved forward. It's yours now.
It's opened a different perspective, a different door, a different way of relating to meta. That's lovely. Thank you all.
So let's switch to our practice and community in small groups. So tonight's invitation is to be versed, to be stable in your good will for yourself.
Very mildly. You don't have to produce it, right? Just as Laurie was observing the sense of good will for yourself and for others.
The sense of equanimity, or spaciousness, as if this was the movie of your life that you're watching for the next six minutes in these groups.
Like, there's care for you as a protagonist. There's care for these beings, and there's no attachment to what you're going to say, or what they're going to say, or sounding smart, or dumb.
It's like, oh yeah, there's a sense of spaciousness, like, oh, appreciating good will for all the causes and conditions. And this can be profound. So check it out.
Just player in the sandbox and see what it feels like. Maybe you can take this in your daily life.
So I'm going to create these room rooms. And if you're curious, please stay and try it out.
And the prompt is, what did you discover in the relationship between meta and equanimity? And anything you say is fine.
You can say, I fell asleep. I didn't like it. I didn't find anything perfectly fine. There's no right or wrong answer.
Not so much what you say, but how you show up.
And if it's not tonight, breakout rooms or this in this moment are not right for you. It's okay. You can bow out. So I'm going to create the breakout rooms now.
And yeah, let's see here.
Create them again. So this is a moment. Whoops.
This is a moment to practice equanimity.
As I go through creating these rooms with with shifting numbers, ground shifting under my feet. Here we go, I think.
Okay. All right. I think we are ready. Are we ready? Yes, we're ready. So I'm going to open the rooms and remember, stay in your body.
Stay in your body. It's not about what you say. It's about how you show up physically.
Okay, for yourself and others. Here we go.
Okay.
So I'll come back. I would love to hear some reflections either about your practice and community, or from the prior, the first part of practice.
Just a couple minutes. So don't be shy. Please share your wisdom.
I did not get a lot from the sit. I was very distracted and feeling guilty about that. And I think for the first, I think for the first time, just hearing somebody else's really honest experience of when they were really present in the practice.
I felt like it was a practice. I felt like I was totally attentive to the entire thing. And I was feeling bad because, you know, as people were sharing, I was like, oh, that would have been a great one had I actually been present for it.
But then I got it from somebody else. I'm very grateful.
Lovely. Thanks so much for sharing that, Ariana. That makes me so happy. What a beautiful feeling of osmosis, right? From the group. That's profound. What you just experienced. Really profound.
Thank you for speaking up.
Yeah, very profound. Beautiful. Love it. Thank you.
Yes, please. Somebody on the phone. I just unmuted you.
Hi, Nikki in group. This is Michael. And I'm just so grateful for you weaving in the other Brahma Vihara equanimity and I just came from one house to another house.
So I was last week, or yesterday in the previous 10 days, I was at the beach in Santa Cruz and now I'm back in Palo Alto. And usually I feel heavy and just not very peaceful.
But today I felt a lot more full of equanimity and allowing and being grateful and enjoying the garden here as much as I enjoyed the garden there and just really, you know, finding the joy.
And also in your theme of equanimity, I usually do my own thing during the guided meditation, but remaining open and spacious and allowing.
I followed your sweet guidance and, you know, it was really, it was joyful.
And then during our group share, I had Mudita for someone else and it was, I don't know, it was just very heartwarming. So deep bows to you all and deep bows to you, Nikki, for your sweet teachings.
Thank you, Michael. It's lovely to take here from you and have you join us this evening and share your experience with Mehta and equanimity and vicarious joy for someone else in the group.
Yeah. What a sweet, lovely note to end our practice on together this evening, morning, late night, whatever your time zone is right now that you're joining us.
So heartwarming to how all of you join us in practice.
May you enjoy the fruits of your practice and may it be shared with all beings everywhere, equanimity and Mehta.
May all beings be well, may all beings be happy, including us.
Thanks everyone. Lovely to be with you. Take care.
Bye.
