The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good day and happy to be here again. Some of you know about my cataract
surgery yesterday and that seems to have gone quite well. I got one of my
long-time wishes, which is I was able to see the stars last night
without using my glasses, at least with my left eye.
I'm also kind of amazed when I look around with my new eye
that how shiny things are and bright. There's a wonderful feeling of vibrant
stillness in everything. I see things when I'm just looking through my left eye
that everything seems so clear and also very still. It's a wonderful stillness.
It kind of makes me want to, or it brings a stillness to me to see this way.
So to start introducing or start this meditation, there's a kind of a teaching
story of a school where on the wall in the classroom there's a sign that says,
in this school we place the teachings on your heart. And so someone asked,
why do you put the teachings on our hearts? And the teacher said,
we only put it on your hearts. Only life can put it in your hearts.
We put it on your hearts and when your heart breaks open, then they fall in.
So this idea that to be receptive or to have our hearts open,
not necessarily only break open, but to open, to be receptive enough, open enough,
transparent enough, wide enough, so that something can touch it deeply,
something can fall into it. And one of those things that is awakened in that process
as the life touches our deepest heart is a sense of care, a sense of kindness,
goodwill, a sense of wanting to nurture and nourish. Because what's deep inside of us
is both nourishing and nourishable. And this wonderful reciprocity, the very same place
that can nourish the world, nourish ourselves, is also the place that can be nourished.
It can nourish itself, this wonderful reciprocity. And one of those qualities
that come from this place is compassion. And as I've been saying,
there's many different forms of compassion, different ways that different people experience it.
So when someone teaches about compassion, you have to translate it into your own words
or own sense, your own experience. But a place of tenderness, that place that nourishes
and is nourished, the place that wants to nourish, care for a young child or a kitten
or even a plant. When I was a gardener in the monastery, I had very strong parental feelings
for the plants in the garden. I would walk around the garden when the morning work period began
and just kind of gaze upon all the plants for quite a while, just go around and look at them,
check them out as if they were kind of like my children to see if they were all okay and how were they.
I had a kind of tender feeling inside this place of nourishing and being nourished.
And so to feel this nourishing and being nourished surprisingly enough in the presence of suffering,
the presence of knowing and the challenges that we have and other people have,
knowing perhaps accompanying people, being a companion in suffering and the challenges,
sometimes one of the greatest supports we can give someone as they want to find their own way through it.
And a wonderful feeling of being available to help, wanting to help if the help is wanted.
And this feeling of being open and available without a need to help, without forcing ourselves on of other people to help them.
Be available if the invitation is there, if it's clearly wanted.
So all this points to a place inside, a sensibility, a feeling, an intention, an idea, an imagination,
thoughts of goodwill and compassion.
So taking a posture, assuming a posture, and as you assume a meditation posture, do it kindly and compassionately.
This body of ours is where there's a lot of challenges and to dip into our bodily experience with care
and assume a posture for meditation that is right for you.
And gently closing your eyes. And perhaps if it's available to you to connect to your way of being tender or nourishing or caring,
whether it's a feeling or thoughts, an image, and with that sense of care or tenderness to gently take a few long, slow, deep breaths,
as if these breaths are the most important, valuable, caring things you can do.
And exhaling a long, caring, relaxing breath, as if the exhale is emptying you of your difficulties, as if the exhale is connecting you more fully,
solidly, to your body here.
And if it's comfortable for you, taking a deep breath in, exhaling a slow and long breath, and then lingering at the end of the outbreath,
maybe releasing more fully, for a moment in the end of the outbreath, allow yourself just to be.
Maybe you can even feel the physiological drive to care for yourself, that is to begin breathing in again.
The process of breathing is sustaining your life. It's a way in which your body cares for you.
Then to let your breathing return to normal.
And on the exhale, relax in different parts of your body, release the holding.
But as you relax to whatever degree you can, maybe do it with a generosity of caring,
not forcing, not even expecting things to relax, but offering your body a chance to soften and relax,
especially if you can do so with a caring attitude.
And then simply being with your breathing.
Perhaps with a feeling of relaxing or softening, all around the inhale,
all around the sensations of your body, they come into play as you inhale.
As if receiving those sensations around it is a field of softness, of caringness.
And as you exhale, the sensations are returning to a place that invites, that's inviting the exhale,
a place of tenderness, a place that is both nourished and nourishing.
And as you exhale, the sensations are returning to a place that invites,
and to continue breathing, and maybe your breathing with compassion,
with care, a compassion which includes a feeling of generosity,
not expectation, not anything required, a place of tenderness,
a place of thoughts of well-wishing.
As if the experience of the body breathing are like waves of compassion.
The inhale is like waves washing up across the sand.
Exhale, the waves returning to the ocean, waves of compassion washing over you.
Relaxing the thinking mind, quieting your thinking,
compassion, a place of inner nourishment, inner nourishing.
Relaxing the thinking mind, quieting your thinking mind,
quieting your thinking mind, quieting your thinking mind,
quieting your thinking mind, quieting your thinking mind,
quieting your thinking mind, quieting your thinking mind,
quieting your thinking mind, quieting your thinking mind,
quieting your thinking mind.
You might very gently, as you exhale, say to yourself the word compassion
or care or tenderness, both to let the thinking mind become quieter
and to be reminded of this place within, to touch in again to this place within of compassion.
Perhaps allowing a sense of generosity to come with the compassion.
The generosity that allows you to do this just the way it is for you, how it works for you
or that it should or needing to make it look like something.
Just whatever way is easy for you to touch into your capacity for compassion, care.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Saying the word compassion and saying it like you're dropping a pebble into a lake,
middle of the lake and the ripples, concentric ripples radiate outward across the lake.
So let your compassion be the pebble dropping into your heart and concentric circles of warmth,
of care, radiate out from you, out into the world.
Maybe with each breath, each exhale, dropping the pebble, compassion, each inhale,
the radiance spreads outward into the world.
Thank you.
And as your compassion radiates beyond the edges of your body, beyond those edges of your body,
your compassion is no longer about you.
Compassion becomes free from self and self-concern.
And appreciate that freedom of compassion that simply radiates in a way that's no longer about you.
It's free of self, just a radiance.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And then to feel perhaps how the radiance of compassion, that sense of warmth or goodness,
bearingness, that somehow spreads beyond the edges of the body, is nourishing for you.
Because it comes from a place that's both nourishing and nourished.
And how beyond the edges of your body, it's not about you yourself.
It's free of self.
And how preoccupation with self diminishes this nourishing place of tenderness, of care.
Compassion as it radiates beyond, out into the world, can be a form of freedom from self.
Freedom from self-remination, self-preoccupation.
Freedom from self-criticism and self-belittlement.
The simple generosity of compassion, especially compassion for others,
is a freedom from what diminishes us with self-preoccupation.
And to see if you can now turn your attention,
out into the world of people who struggle, who suffer.
Maybe the people struggling with COVID-19.
The people who are sick, some are dying.
The medical staff and other caregivers, for those who have COVID,
and to allow your radiance of goodwill, of tenderness, of care, of compassion,
spread out to all the people touched with COVID-19,
and let your compassion touch them as well.
As if all you need to do is to know them and know they're suffering and challenges.
Be a companion and a ally.
Wishing them well.
May all beings, all people who have COVID-19,
all people who are caring for those with COVID-19,
may they be free of suffering.
May they be free of fear.
May they be free of any hostility whatsoever.
May they receive the care, the best care available.
And more so, may they receive the best love and care, compassion,
that we're able to offer each other as human beings.
May all beings be free of suffering.
May all beings be free of oppression.
May all beings be free of hatred from others and from themselves.
May all beings be at peace, at ease.
May they be nourished by the goodness that exists in this world.
