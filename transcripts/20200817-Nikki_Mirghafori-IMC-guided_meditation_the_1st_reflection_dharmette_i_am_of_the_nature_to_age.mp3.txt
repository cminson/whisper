Greetings Sangha. 
Wherever you are joining us either live on YouTube, this morning, this afternoon, whatever your time zone may be, or if you might be listening afterwards. 
Warm, warm greetings. 
I'm absolutely delighted that you're joining us and I'm delighted to be joining you. 
My name is Niki Megafori and I'm one of the teachers at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City. 
And it's wonderful to be joining such a wonderfully formed Sangha while we support Gil in enjoying nature as he mentioned. 
He's backpacking in the Sierras this week, so I'm delighted to be supporting the Sangha this week. 
So for the theme for this week, I wanted to invite us to explore what are taught to be the five, what are taught by the Buddha as the five reflections, five daily reflections. 
And these are five reflections that the Buddha recommended for monks and lay people, the same. 
As you know, many of the teachings are just primarily for the monks, but the five reflections are for both us lay people as well as monks and nuns. 
The fourfold Sangha, as it is said. 
So these five reflections are supposed to be done every day, all five. 
And I figured let us actually sink into each one of them during the five days of this week. 
We'll start with the first one today. 
And I'll speak about it afterwards, give it a little darn it about the first one primarily. 
And the way we will do this reflection is these are reflections. 
The way we will do it is we will drop in this reflection when we are settled. 
And actually that's another thing I'd like to invite you as a way to relate to how recollections and reflections are. 
To be practiced, perhaps one way to be practiced is to first just get settled with the breath, with the body. 
And when there is a level of spaciousness, there is a certain level of stability and calm, then this reflection is dropped in into the body, as I will emphasize in the guidance, as if you were dropping a pebble or rock in the body and letting it reverberate, not thinking about it, but dropping it into the body and seeing what arises, listening, listening, really deeply listening and letting the reflection reverberate through you and letting it move you. 
So these reflections, recollections are not to really do, to create a lot of mental chatter or to think about, but to drop them in when there's a level of silence and stability and let them move you. 
And then we'll explore together afterwards. 
So the first reflection, as many of you know, has to do with aging, with this body, that we're all subject to aging. 
We have not gone beyond aging. 
It's a very visceral, physical reflection. 
So without further ado, yeah, I'd like to invite you to settle into your seat chair if you need to move to be comfortable. 
This is the perfect time to do that. 
Ah, and landing. 
Landing, landing in this human body. 
In this moment in time. 
Arriving. 
Arriving. 
Each moment, a new arrival. 
Into this moment. 
Into this body. 
And know that you might begin again and again many times. 
No problem. 
Arriving. 
Arriving, landing in the humanness of this body into your bones. 
Connecting with the bones, the hardness, the earth element. 
The presence of solidity, stability. 
And landing, really allowing your awareness to connect. 
With all the touch points where your bottom, your sit bones. 
Connect. 
Connect to the earth. 
Connect to the earth. 
Connect to the earth. 
And feeling really sensing, opening up to the sensations of your feet and your legs. 
Connecting to the earth. 
Connecting up. 
Connecting up to the body. 
Connect to the earth. 
And inviting, inviting the breath. 
And breathing freely through this body, however it wants to move, whether deep or shallow breath, not a problem. 
The breath, the air element, be received. 
Be received in the body that's connected to the earth. 
And it's soft and relaxed. 
The sense of fluidity. 
The water element moving, moving through the body, relaxing, softening, flowing. 
Connecting to the earth. 
Connecting to the earth. 
And letting each breath, each and breath, each other, as it is received. 
Just receiving the breath, this body knows how to breathe. 
Notice I'm not suggesting that you breathe because you don't want to make it into a project. 
Instead receiving the breath, however it happens, you've been breathing all these years, all this time, without any intentionality. 
So allow awareness to be relaxed and soft, rooted, landed in the body, and opened up to receive the breath. 
As if you receive a dear friend who visits you with the same openness, the light, care and curiosity. 
Thank you. 
Settling, arriving, every moment, tilling the soil to drop into reflection in a little bit. 
Settling, arriving, every moment, tilling the soil to drop into reflection in a little bit. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Now I would like to invite you, if you wish, to drop in this reflection into your body as if dropping a pebble into a pond, letting it reverberate in your body, listening to see what arises, maybe something, maybe nothing. 
But it's not to be thought about in this way, in this way of reflecting. 
So staying connected to the body, receiving the breath, receiving the breath perhaps in the abdomen. 
Now dropping this pebble, this reflection in the abdomen too, and the reflection is, just like everyone, I am of the nature to age. 
I am subject to aging. 
I have not gone beyond aging. 
It is inevitable. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
And if you find that the mind is engaged in your rumination and thinking and worrying, simply noticing what's happening. 
Perhaps in this moment, softening the body, offering up the rumination and allowing the awareness to be landed, arrived in the body, receiving the breath. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
I like to invite us to drop in the reflection one more time, dropping it in the body, receiving it like the breath, just like everyone else. 
I am of the nature to age. 
I am subjected to aging. 
I have not gone beyond aging. 
It is inevitable. 
Again, receiving, just receiving, not ruminating, breathing with the reflection. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
We're dropping this reflection. 
What arises, opening up to the truth of impermanence, with stability and grace, with the appreciation of any vitality that is felt right now. 
A level of vitality that is perceived can be known through the movement of the breath, for example. 
Knowing that our vitality will change, does change, has changed, the time is short. 
And how do we want to live our lives? How do we intend to show up? For ourselves? For our loved ones? For the world? For the world. 
Settling. 
How can we align our lives, our actions, with our intentions, so that our vitality can be of service, can express the goodness within us, to benefit self and the world. 
Settling. 
Settling. 
Thank you all for joining for this powerful reflection, these reflections as we will explore them one by one, they're each so powerful. 
So, they can be very powerful, and a lot can come up when you really, really commit with these reflections with these practices. 
I want to say a few words about why would the Buddha suggest this, of course, and also some ways to work with it, some ways to actually not be overwhelmed, but to really use this reflection for waking up to our humanity, waking up to align our lives towards awakening, towards more freedom. 
So, one rationale for contemplating this particular one, then the first three, is to, the Buddha explains in the Sutta that the intention is to overcome the weak and overcome conceit of youth. 
There's a sense of invincibility that one can have when one is young, and I'll probably experience that, I know that I've experienced that. 
And also, if you notice this reflection, and actually the first three reflections which have to be the first one with agent, the second one with illness, and the third one with death, these three reflections correspond to the three messengers, the four heavenly messengers, when the Buddha was a prince in his castle and came out of the grounds, and saw an old man, and a sick man, and a dead corpse, and then, and he was horrified that, oh, this is what's going to happen to me as a human being. 
And seeing that he was subjected to all of these, as we all are, we're human. 
And then seeing a monk who was walking with a lot of freedom and ease, the four heavenly messengers. 
So, these three reflections, especially this first one that we started with, aging, correspond to what he reflected, what really supported him to wake up. 
And this gives us some clue that these reflections are actually a support, even though they might seem overwhelming, but they are the truth of how things are. 
They are the truth of how things are, and they support us towards awakening. 
When we make peace with them, we're not bothered. 
We don't spend so much time and energy. 
Let's focus on the first one. 
We don't focus so much time and energy, anti-aging or lament our aging. 
There can be a sense of acceptance, and this acceptance actually can open, can free up a lot of energy, as well as it's a way of being free in the midst of conditions. 
Of course, of course, yes, this is the way it is, of course. 
There is a sense of wisdom that comes from acceptance. 
And I'd like to share something with you here. 
Let's see. 
It's a little cartoon about acceptance. 
Here it is. 
See if you can see it. 
That's not the one. 
Let's try it again. 
Oh, here. 
Okay. 
So if you can see some technical difficulty on my end, let's try this again. 
Okay, here it is. 
So your little cartoon of what is acceptance. 
I just saw this the other day, and I thought it's a great way to communicate acceptance. 
So on the left, what acceptance is not? It's raining. 
I don't like rain. 
I wish it wasn't raining. 
My day would be better if it wasn't raining. 
My day is ruined. 
My day is like this. 
It's always like this. 
Why does it always rain when all I want is for it to be sunny? That can be like, oh, I'm aging. 
I don't like aging. 
I don't like my back hurting. 
I don't like my vitality decreasing. 
I don't like this. 
I don't like that. 
I wish, etc. 
, etc. 
Whereas on the right, it's raining. 
Yep. 
It's raining. 
It's like this. 
It's raining. 
Yep. 
Yep. 
So similarly, aging. 
Yeah, this is the way things are. 
This is the way things are. 
And not just with acceptance. 
So acceptance is one dimension. 
But the other dimensions, as I was mentioning, is that this reflection can open us up to all of these reflections, can open us up to having a wise perspective. 
Having a wise perspective of how to use our precious vitality because it is going to decrease. 
It has already decreased. 
So how to actually see the alignment, how these reflections can actually allow us to align instead of seeing the feeling that we're going to live forever and have energy forever. 
How do we want to spend the vitality and the energy that we have in this life? What are the best ways to do that while it is still available and it lasts? And another consideration is to actually do this practice both internally and externally. 
And using this practice internally, of course, is what we have done today. 
But using it externally would also be to consider the aging of everyone around you, everyone around you. 
And allow that to open your heart to compassion and care for all of us beings, for all of us. 
We all age. 
This is the human condition. 
There is no escaping it. 
So for today, my invitation to all of us, and I will be doing this practice with you today. 
My invitation to all of us is to keep this first reflection close to our heart. 
Keep it close to our hearts as we are moving in the world, as we're looking at ourselves in the mirror, as we are speaking with others, as we are working, as we are exercising, as we are doing, as we are going through the day. 
Keep dropping, keep dropping it in, because these reflections actually, you just planted a seed this morning. 
Maybe some things came up. 
But as you keep walking with it, walking with it, like a dear friend, not like a bad omen, but walk with it as if you're walking, as if you're holding close. 
You're wearing a beloved locket. 
Keep it close and see how it can inspire you, how it can bring up more wisdom, the ways in which you act, the ways in which you interact with other people, the ways in which you use your energy in the world today. 
You use your vitality in the world. 
And, yeah, internally and externally holding this reflection close. 
So, thank you all for joining this morning, this afternoon, this evening, whatever time it is. 
And, yeah, it's been wonderful to sit together today. 
And I look forward to sitting together and going through the other four reflections together this week. 
Thank you so much. 
Thank you.
