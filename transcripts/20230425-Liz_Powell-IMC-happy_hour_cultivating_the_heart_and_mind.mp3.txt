Welcome to happy hour.
Very happy you're here.
And looking forward to meditating together this evening.
So in the past week, as I've invited reflection and meditation on the metasuta as translated by Gil Fronstahl,
I found it interesting that we learn a whole lot about some of the qualities of heart that bring peace and bring happiness
by being aware when the opposite is present or when there's an absence of those qualities of heart.
In the type of meditation we do during happy hour, we can not only notice the beautiful qualities like kindness, compassion,
appreciative joy and equanimity and those are so valuable to notice when they're present to really allow them and feel them, know them.
And we can also notice when we're not feeling that or when we're feeling we could be feeling rather neutral or we could feel that it's really just thoughts we're thinking.
Or we notice the opposite of what we're trying to cultivate.
All of those are very useful to our healing.
First of all, sometimes it does start with just the thought, just the thought I'd like to cultivate kindness, I'd like to cultivate compassion.
Sometimes it starts with, wow, I'm trying to say this kindness practice for someone or compassion practice and I'm not feeling it.
So those are invitations. They are opportunities to be gently curious when there are thoughts or feelings that come up that are different than what we expect.
As well as when there are feelings that are much more powerful, much more kind or much more compassionate, that welling up is also really wonderful to notice.
So the invitation is to notice whatever experience you're having, not to try to make your experience be different than the one you're having.
I'll have that experience over there, not the one right here.
We really need to be recognizing the feeling and the experience, the thought that we're having right here.
So these words that I've been bringing to you in this translation of the Metasuta kind of highlight some of the things that make us uncomfortable in highlighting things that are beautiful qualities.
They also highlight some of the unpleasant feelings or thoughts that come up in the world that are called aversion or ill-will.
So I'm going to name some that are implied by the Suta and in a couple of minutes, I'll invite you to type any into the chat box that you've noticed.
So these first few lines of the Suta to reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good, should be capable and upright, straightforward and easy to speak to.
Those bring up the realization that when someone is not upright, if they don't feel honest, they don't feel like they're being straight with us, it's harder to feel friendly or goodwill.
If we're expecting someone to take care of their part of an agreement in a capable way to get it done or get it done well enough and they don't do it, it's possible to feel somehow treated badly.
If someone's hard to speak to, if they don't make themselves available or they are reactive when we're trying to share something important to improve our relationship, again, those things can feel not good on the receiving end.
So we can see where unfriendliness happens and that helps us know, by contrast, when we can cultivate friendliness or how we can work with qualities that are not landing well with us or behaviors, I should say.
They're not qualities or behaviors.
So by contrast, what an amazing gift it is when people we interact with get done what they promise to do, are honest, are straight, easy to speak with and deal with and aren't seeming to manipulate us.
So the sutra goes on, gentle and not proud, contented and easily supported, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calmed, not arrogant and without greed for supporters and should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize.
What a relief it is to interact with this person, right, or to aspire to be this person who's not harsh, not always operating as if they were the center of the known universe.
Easy to get along with, not too busy for us or for relationship, not agitated, worried, angry, reactive, but instead calm, someone who's able to access wisdom.
What a delight it is to interact with that person is someone who's not stuck on their own opinions or needing to always be right.
For that matter, not needing popularity to prop up their opinions or their self-worth and whose actions are so well-grounded that others don't complain about them.
People who enjoy a good reputation enjoy it for a good reason, so these qualities are kind of being pointed out in the sutra.
I want to invite you to reflect for a moment on behaviors that tend not to evoke goodwill or friendliness.
These can be even in yourself, things that you feel uncomfortable with in yourself or you regret or something that makes someone else hard to deal with.
Just skip a moment to what's going on, what's present for you in somebody's behavior or in your own behavior that tends to bring up a lack of kindness or unfriendliness.
By calling these things up, this will help us in our meditation tonight because we're going to address these positive qualities, these positive wishes towards these unhelpful habits that are tough for us.
So when we do these loving-kindness meditations this evening, we're going to be setting conditions in motion to respond from the same kinds of skillful actions that are being named in the sutra.
So with that, I'll invite us to settle into our meditation with the sutra.
Giving yourself time to bring some ease or some uprightness to the body but also enough relaxation that you can let go of tension, let go of anything that can be easily softened or treated with gentleness.
Allowing what is already here, perhaps what's already here are those beautiful qualities of heart that feel part of the sangha, that feel kind towards the other people here, that feel kind towards yourself and the efforts that you make in doing these beneficial meditations.
Body, heart and mind, all parts of ourselves and each other with nothing left out.
Giving yourself time to rest and allow to float up feelings about yourself, feelings about others, images, whatever is most present for you this evening.
Recognizing, receiving, allowing whatever is here, whatever is on your heart and mind, whatever the condition of your body is.
And allowing the words of the sutra to meet whatever is present with these kind words.
May all be happy and secure.
Allowing whatever surfaces with those words. Could be pleasant feelings of happiness and security.
Could be thoughts about it, whether it's present, whether it's not present. May all be happy and secure.
May all beings be happy at heart.
Including yourself.
Including people for whom it's easy to wish happiness.
And also including people who are challenging.
May all beings be happy at heart.
Allowing whatever bubbles up as those words come into your awareness.
Noticing how it feels in the body, how it affects emotions, states of mind.
Noticing any thinking. May all beings be happy at heart.
If any hint of anything arises that is slightly less than happy or slightly insecure or even greatly unhappy or greatly insecure.
Receive that awareness with softness, with kindness.
Awareness is simply showing you something that's been present or that is present.
Allowing the feelings, the body sensations, any thinking that go with it.
And sending those feelings, these kind wishes, sending the feeling to your own heart or to the hearts of others in whom you notice unhappiness or insecurity.
Saying to them, saying to yourself, this wish, not a demand, just a kind wish, may you be happy and secure.
May you be happy at heart, right down to your core.
Imagining yourself and others having such a security and such a happiness at heart that there is unshakable as a beautiful mountain.
May all beings be happy at heart, solid, unshakable in their happiness.
Recognizing that all beings, all human beings, all creatures want to be happy and secure and extending these wishes to them.
Naming them, all living beings, whether weak or strong.
Tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, born or to be born, near or distant.
May they all be happy.
Allowing your thoughts in your heart to go out to all parts of yourself and all beings everywhere around the world in all these different ways, all these different conditions.
Holding space for them in your imagination and in radiating this kindness.
May all beings be happy at heart.
Exending wishes for the kinds of conditions that bring about trust, security.
And happiness between human beings with these wishes from the sutta.
Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere.
Allowing your imagination to take in how peaceful the world could be.
Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere.
Let no one through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer.
Even when people make mistakes, when their thinking leads them down very harmful paths.
Holding this wish, let no one through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer.
Holding this kind hope in our hearts, this compassionate hope in our minds that we can heal from that as a human race.
Individually we can heal from the friction that arises and others can heal from it too.
As we continue this meditation in silence, feel free to continue to repeat these wishes in your own words.
May all beings be happy and secure.
Let no one through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer.
Whatever other afflictions you see around you in other people or even in yourself at times, allowing wishes for healing from that, for kindness and compassion to replace those all too human afflictions.
Whatever they are.
