 Oh, please. Oh, please. Okay, so we'll give a talk and I'll try to give a talk. I have a little irritation in my lungs, I guess. And so we'll see how it goes. Can you hear me okay in the back? Do people hear? Two weeks ago when I was here there was some concern about people not hearing me well enough. I remember, excuse me, if the PESHA was quite concerned many years ago about that, but I'm speaking louder now, you can hear me okay. So, but please, anytime anyone feels like I'm not speaking loud enough, please interrupt or raise your hands, wave, do something, and then, or move forward, not just facing the front. I'll try to remember to speak loud enough. Today with my voice being as it is, it'll be a little bit harder than usual. So I wanted to talk this evening about something that could be called the Heart of Buddhist Practice, the Radical Heart of Buddhist Practice, that all of Buddhist practice, a lot of Buddhist practice can be understood as preparations for being able to do this particular practice. And if one really understands what I'm going to say, well, that's all you need to understand in terms of practice. There are a lot of ideals in Buddhism. There's a lot of ideals in spiritual practice of all kinds, a lot of ideals in human life. And people try to live up to ideals, emulate ideals, they try to attain ideals, sometimes they measure themselves against ideals, and we have many relationships to ideals. And certainly Buddhism has its share, but the Heart of Buddhism is not an ideal, but is actually our actual experience. And so the focus is not on trying to attain an ideal as much as it is to choose, learn how to address, how to enter, how to be mindful of what's actually happening in the moment. And this is a very important distinction between the ideal and the actual. And if you have a choice between one or the other, in Buddhist practice we always choose the actual or the ideal. And the ideal, I mean the actual, the actual isn't always so ideal. You know, and that's what makes it so, you know, awkward, difficult. And why many of us would rather not hang out with the actual because we prefer the ideal. And often we make ideals for ourselves or offer them, they're often seemingly much more pleasant and attractive than the actual. And in fact many people come to do Buddhist practice because they have some problems with the actual, the way things actually are, and they're really determined to change that. Maybe it's something, some part of their personality, some part of their way they relate to the world, which they're not satisfied with, is this actual, this is, this part of who I am, that's unacceptable. And so I will, you know, try to live differently. It's not acceptable to go around being angry or afraid. So I'm going to try to be a person who's kind or not afraid. People, or perhaps it's a situation around them that's not acceptable, the actual situation around them. So I got to change situation. I have to resist certain things, I have to stand up to certain things, I have to manipulate things and change certain things. And this is all very fine, but the heart of Buddhist practice is in a sense to forget about the ideal, forget about all ideals, including Buddhist ideals, and learn how to, in an uncompromising way, enter into the actual experience of what's happening right now. But there's a particular aspect of the actual, which is the heart of the heart. So it isn't necessarily everything we pay attention to, but for Buddhist practice, there's a certain very key component part, which is really important. And that is our clinging. The clinging that exists in the present moment, we pay attention to, we bring our attention to bear on the clinging. And clinging is kind of shorthand for Buddhism, for the origin of our suffering, for origin of our sense of dissatisfaction with life. Our resistance to certain things, our pushing away is called clinging, our holding on and grasping to certain things is called clinging. Our fear of the certain things in the abstract is called clinging. And the idea is, in Buddhism, is that the ideal is you can live a life that's free of clinging. But the way to do that is to forget about the ideal, and rather to focus on what you're actually doing. And if in the actual moment you're clinging, the heart of practice is to bring our attention to bear on that clinging, to really take it, to really become really honest about it, and enter it, and look at it, and be with it in a hundred percent. I recently told someone that my practice these days is to concentrate on clinging. As soon as I said it, I realized that I have two meanings. And I didn't mean that I concentrate on clinging better. I bring my attention to bear on my clinging. And the tricky thing is to hold your attention right there with a clinging. And then don't try to manipulate it or change it or push it away or let go of it, but just stay there with it. So I was sitting retreat for the last three or four days, silent retreat. And I noticed some point in the actual experience was I felt somewhat uncomfortable. I was suffering. Maybe suffering is a very strong word, but I was suffering. And it seems familiar to me, the suffering that I had. And I realized that it is a suffering arise, it has arisen periodically from me when I'm engaged in intensive practice, silent retreats. And I also realized, I was familiar with it, but I realized I'd never actually studied it. I never actually looked at it carefully. I knew how it felt like in my body, it felt like a certain kind of tightening, kind of upwelling pressure, kind of yucky pressure somehow in the area where I am. So I brought my attention to bear on that. I just held it there. And I knew I saw a tendency sometimes to want to get rid of it or push it away or whatever, but I just held it there. And it wasn't so clear. So that was part of the difficulty. It was definitely a physical feeling. It was connected to it. It was kind of an abstract feeling. It had kind of nebulous kind of borders. It's kind of like vague, kind of somewhere in this neck, upper torso area. And so it wasn't like I can just kind of easily, as it was something, just put my attention there and keep it there. If I have a sharp pain in my knee, I can just put my attention right there. It's very clear where it is and just stay there with it. So the breath is often very clear for me and I can just stay there with the breath. But this was kind of awkward to hang out with because it wasn't so clear. So anyway, I said, oh well, this is what's happening. This is the actual. So I'll just hang out there and just keep my attention there, be there with it. It was very interesting. And one of the things I discovered was that part of what the suffering came from was, and why it kind of reappeared periodically in my practice, was I had this little sense of kind of pushing into the future and kind of waiting for something to happen. Some wonderful things was happening in practice, the little bangs, the big bangs, some nice feeling of calm. Something was supposed to happen, right? And so I was kind of doing this practice, you know, being present, following my breath, doing things we do. But the little part of me was kind of clinging to some idea of getting something. The ideal, something beyond what was actually happening. And this was causing me suffering, a sense of pressure and tightness. And for the first time, I really looked at it, hung out with it. And there's two things that happen when I did that, or it happens to us when we do this kind of investigation. Just hold it, just hang out there and looking at it. We're willing to hang in there. And sometimes I'd be willing to hang in there a long time with our suffering. Just hanging with our suffering, just great. There's my suffering, I'll hang in with it. How many of you think that you're not so eager to hang in with your suffering? You know, you're quick, you want some kind of, you want to fix, you want to change it, you want to judge it, you want to get away from it. But just kind of patiently hang in there. No practice is accomplished without some fair degree of patience. So I hung in there and I saw these things. So two things happen, besides whatever insight you might have. One is the very act of bringing attention to bear on our clinging is bringing forth the part of us which is not clinging. Attention itself, very clearly investigating attention, holding our attention there, that itself doesn't cling. So we're bringing part of us without shifting the context, we're shifting our relationship. We're before maybe primarily just clinging. To now we have a different relation, clinging is still there, but now it's like we've awakened part of our mind which is not clinging. We've kind of strengthened a part of our presence, part of our character, part of our personality, part of our being, our presence. Which has a capacity to be present for things without clinging to it or resisting it or being afraid of it. Just by being able to hold the attention there, the holding of attention there that does that. So that's great. That should be enough, isn't it? But also what happens is as you hold it there, is that often our clinging begins to relax. It's very hard for clinging to stay clinging if the light of awareness is held there for a long time, patiently, acceptantly without judgment or valuation. If we look at our suffering and are reacting to it, oh my God, why me and not now? It could have been yesterday or whatever it might be. We kind of react and we get upset or we even if we argue with it or we analyze it to death or whatever we do, we do all this stuff with it. As long as we do that, the clinging itself doesn't feel like it has permission to relax. It's under attack. So it just holds on tighter. But there's a kind of a way in which if we look and just hold our attention there, we'll try to do anything with it and have great patience. And miraculously the clinging begins to release itself. And so then it goes away, maybe after a while. And then you say, great. But then you say, if you're practicing well, then you say, okay, where's the next clinging? And part of what practice is the harder practice is, your attention is like a, I don't know what the right analogy is here, but like a mole or a gopher. That is, the expression is to ferret out, right? There's a ferret in animal. It ferret things out, right? So you're a ferret. It's ferreting out, you're clinging. So you start off with maybe the growth of the attention. You start off with maybe the grossest suffering you have, and you hang out there. And sooner or later it softens, maybe even goes away. And then bring your attention to the next grossest and the next grossest. And slowly with time, you get to the more and more subtle layers of clinging, of suffering that's part of you. So rather than looking at the ideal, we look at the actual experience of suffering and clinging as is occurring in the present moment. Now you might say, you know, boy, this is a downer of a practice. I mean, jeez, I never heard anything. Disparing and depressing is just hanging out my suffering. And, you know, and then finally it goes away. I'm told, just go find some more. Once you get a hang of it, it becomes kind of a delight. It becomes kind of a joy to realize you can bring to bear on your difficulties. This kind of luminous, light, clear practice of awareness. And that it really makes a difference. And to realize that you can bring to bear on your difficulties. And to have some real personal experience. That you really do this to yourself. You really, really hung out the hung in there, patiently, acceptingly with some suffering, really to feel it and be with it. And to see that just doing that transforms it. To know for yourself that that's a possibility is really, really important in practice. And if you haven't had that experience yet, I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. If you haven't had that experience yet, I don't really encourage you, go find some good suffering. And hang in there with it in this way I'm talking about. And see if that happens to you. See if you can find that part. And that gives you tremendous confidence. And that confidence then will hopefully give you some sense of joy or delight or satisfaction in doing this practice of looking for suffering. Now, so non-clinging is one of the great ideals of Buddhist practice. So after doing this for a while, you can get personally have a sense of what non-clinging feels like. Or, you know, some idea of it. And this can be a trap. Because what happened to me for some years in my practice was I identified something that I called non-clinging. And then I tried to hold myself to there. And I was kind of a clinging. And it took me some while to realize that it actually kind of made my mind kind of brittle. Or kind of tense, you know, to have this kind of, trying to focus on this wonderful, beautiful, pure ideal. So what I did was I, so I don't do it anymore. I just, you know, focus on like clinging. And it makes me much more flexible. And I much prefer have a flexible mind than a brittle one. And because it really makes my mind flexible, be able to kind of flow and move and go into your clinging. And let the, see the clinging just be released. That allows for the mind to kind of move and flow. To hold yourself anywhere up against an ideal doesn't let the mind flow and move. So this is a very small, maybe silly example of something. Some recently, and recently I was carrying the recycling bins back from, we don't have a curb, but I left one in the main road to back to the garage. And it's maybe 200 feet or so the distance. And these are four big recycling bins and they're kind of heavy. And to save myself the trouble of doing, going two or three or four times back and forth, I put two of them, one inside the other and carry two at a time more in each arm. And it's kind of heavy. I'm not really that strong, you know, so it's kind of heavy. So I was carrying it. It was long enough to 200 feet or whatever. I was carrying it that it began to hurt my arm. And then, you know, with pain comes the normal things like, oh my God, you know, or this is terrible or I hate this or, you know, boy, am I a wimp. You know, I should be a big strong guy. And here I am, I've gotten to the age of 46 and I'm not really that strong and always me. And, you know, it's easy to burden oneself, right? And a lot of things, right? Very quickly, have you noticed? So anyway, I noticed that it was hurting. So I just noticed the burdens I was carrying about it, which was a good practice to do. That's what I'm saying you should do. And I let go of them. And that was very nice. I let go of them. And I was just carrying. I was in pain, but there wasn't any problem. I was just carrying these recycling bins. And then it occurred to me. So this is nice. At first, for a moment, I congratulated myself. I said, oh, this is what I've learned from all my years of Buddhist practice. I've learned how just to hang out with suffering and not make it a big deal. Just not burden myself with anything. And this is great, you know. So that was burdening myself a little bit. But anyway, so. So then it occurred to me, well, instead of just, you know, bearing this, what if I just change my intention when I'm doing here and rather just let it be in kind of intention of carrying the recycling bins to the garage? Why don't I make it my intention to lift weights? It's wrong. And so I started lifting these second bins back and forth. The wrong kind of driveway. And that worked fine. You know, it was quite nice. I was doing two things at once, which we like to do. So it was nice, too. And so I started wondering after that, you know, but how intention can change situation quite dramatically. So the function of Buddhist practice, this is, I think, a very radical thing I'm going to say, and maybe discouraging thing to say. The function of Buddhist practice is to help us not to cling. And helping us not to cling, like opening a gate that we can walk through. And the other side of the gate is the whole world that we have to relate to in some way. And Buddhist practice doesn't necessarily say a lot about what you do when you get through that gate. You can find Buddhists who will say things, all kinds of things to you. I mean, the device is cheap, right? But the main function of Buddhist practice is to make sure that gate is always open. Or if it was not open, to help you open it up slowly. So the gate of clinging is open. There's no clinging. So I went to one of my teachers. And said something like this once. I've gotten so much good at letting go. So if challenging situations come up for me, I can just let go and kind of find some peace or some equanimity in the midst of it. What's really hard for me is to let go. Is situations that require some initiative. Where I have to make a decision and do something. Act. And for example, being a parent. There's a lot of things I have to do. I can't just sit there and notice my discomfort. And let go. So. And. So I pointed this out to the teacher. I was expecting him to give me some. Wonderful advice. About how to do and make decisions and get involved. In some easy way. You know, just give me the key and the secret. And I just live happily after. And he refused. He just said. Just look at your clinging. Where's your resistance? Where's your attachment? Where's your. You know, your fear, you know, just. You know, look at that. I said, yeah, I can look at that. I can like go but. And. And. I realized relatively quickly that. He wasn't going to give me any answers. He was kept pointing me back to the gate. Take really good care of the gate. And. In you to figure out for yourself how you're going to live your life. But at least if you take care of the gate. You don't have the burden of your clinging of your suffering of your. Fear. Of your ambition. In the way of your decision. And the decision making also. Happens hopefully without any suffering. Maybe not that easy to make a decision. It's not easy to know what to do. Maybe you make mistakes. But you don't adding to this. It's adding to the difficulty. The problems arise out of our clinging. Our resistance. So the radical thing I wanted to say was Buddhism, the heart of Buddhism. Is to help us look at how the gates are closed. And to go back to a gate over and over again. And then decide what to do from there. So the example of the recycling bins. Is that. I knew how to get to zero. I knew how to let go of the burdens I had. That I took put on based on the discomfort. And then for some reason I decided to you know lift weights. You know it was a fine thing fine choice to make. I could have made other choices. What to do. Well but. When I done I'd come back to this point of non clinging. And then. That gave me the opportunity. Like to do in all kinds of different directions. In a free way. To make sense. So this appointment disappointing thing. Is that some of you some of you want the religion will tell you what to do. And Buddhism doesn't come can tell you what to do. This is going to tell you except tell you keep looking at the gate. Keep looking at your clinging. Hopefully learn how to do it. So you really enjoy it. So it's a joyful joyful thing to do. And it is can be very joyful. I was delighted sitting there looking also delighted sitting on the retreat the other day looking at the suffering. So wow. Part of the device was well I've had this for a long time. And I just let it exist kind of in the back. Now that I'm looking at it seriously I realize I was always familiar with it. We're always there. But I just never got turned towards it to look at it. So now I'm looking at it great. I was actually kind of happy. So wow this is really something after all these years you think I should have known by now. I'm kind of slow but here it is. I'm doing it now. That's the actual that is what's happening actually. So we choose the actual instead of the ideal. It's like the ideal take care of itself. Another way of saying this is that if we are inspired by an ideal is one of the ways to practice is to really attend to all the things that make it difficult for us to follow through on the ideal or live by the ideal. So rather than making ourselves into the ideal we look at what keeps us from the ideal. Part of the idea in Buddhism is that the idea of some of the ideal qualities that come from spiritual practice are innate in who we are. So if we just get out learn how to get out of the way these things will shine forth. This is one of the reasons why non-clinging is such a powerful experience. It allows what's innate to come forth. Actually I wanted to modify something as I said earlier. Then the teacher I went to hoping to get some wonderful answer about how to make decisions and take initiative and he kept pointing me back to just look at your clinging. If there's clinging there look at that. He wasn't going to add anything more. He did add something else actually. He said also look at your intention. And he in particular was concerned with my intention or the intention. To be helpful to others. So those two things that was all supposed to be a guide. So you know we have to still make a decision what to do. So he gave me a little bit of guide. He didn't just say you know it's up to you completely. He said it's up to you but look at your intentions and maybe if you have some some deep personal intentions that are meaningful for you they can help you with those decisions. So it's not easy to hang out with clinging. But one of the ways that makes it easier is to learn how to identify the manifestation of clinging in our body. A lot of our clinging the way we hold on to things manifests itself in our body. It's tension or tightness or pressure or resistance somewhere. And if you can learn how to find the bodily manifestation and just place yourself right there and look at it right in that place. Makes it a lot easier than just doing it in the abstract. So. Should I stop or should I give you another example of how this works? Okay. That's me. I think they make the decision. I'll make a quick one. I don't know if this is kind of. So I came back to this retreat yesterday and sometimes to these little retreats. There was a lot of concentration and I was somehow energized and I couldn't go to sleep last night. So. I was up to about about three thirty. And then I slept for about three hours. And so I was laying there. Maybe somebody had the experience of laying there middle of the night, not being able to sleep. And then this was the practice that I did was in the practice of looking at my clinging. Because I saw that I was suffering a little bit about the suffering I had to do about clinging to some idea about how I was going to be the next day. I'm not going to be able to function. I'm not going to be able to take care of things. You know, I'll be tired. I'll be, you know, things will be hard, whatever. And in the moment, if I just looked around the room and said, you know, everything's fine right now. Absolutely no problem right now. I'm comfortable. It's, you know, it's, I'm at, you know, except for this concern about tomorrow, I'm comfortable at peace. You know, it's actually quite, quite nice here. And I just looked at that suffering, that clinging expectation and fear, what was going to happen. And by looking at it carefully, I can let go of it. And I also remind myself, oh, tomorrow, maybe I will be tired. Well, I'll just, I'll just look at my clinging then. Because maybe then in the middle of being tired, I'll be worried about I'm not functioning very well. I'm like giving a good Dharma talk. Well, I know how to take care of that. I don't have to worry about the future. I just take care of that when it comes. I look at my clinging. In an uncomfortable situation of being tired, I look at my clinging at that moment. So I don't know if that was a helpful example or not, but it was very, very recent. So, yes. So, yes. I've recently started to meditate regularly. I've been trying more and more just to get to a place of concentration on breathing or counting or something that further thoughts. What you're talking about in terms of non-cleaning, is that something you intend that we should incorporate into this sort of thoughtless meditation or is it something you're recommending is just part of living the day? I think certainly both are useful. And in the deepest, let's see, in the ultimate Buddhist sense, the practices of following the breath and calming the mind, getting concentrated, is so that we can prepare ourselves to do this work of looking at clinging. So we can look at clinging with a very stable and concentrated mind. Because it's actually quite easy. It's very hard for a distracted mind to stay present for our clinging. We'll look at it for a moment and we'll flip off and think about all kinds of other things. So it's a very good idea to develop some concentration, some calm. But sooner or later, you need to incorporate, use that ability of the mind to be quite still and concentrated, to look at the suffering itself. Yeah? Does that mean you're looking at more in the sensations, for example, if it's angering and feeling? And sensation around it. So why am I feeling that? Is there a level of analysis that goes on as well as just experience? There can be some. I mean, if it's pretty rudimentary analysis, it's fine. If it gets elaborately involved in story and your biography, then it may be useful to do that, but it's not something we do as part of the formal practice itself. You might notice, for example, that if you really hang out there with anger for a while and just feel the anger and be with the field and the body, you might notice after a while, the reason you're angry is that you're self-righteously holding on to some idea that you're right, and everyone else is wrong. And so that's what the clinging is, in that holding on to the self-righteousness. So then you learn to let go of the anger, which is a kind of clinging in itself, and look at what's really operating underneath that, and look at that more carefully. So that might be a little bit of analysis, but it's pretty, mostly we kind of let things speak to us rather than us trying to figure it out. It's kind of like feeling our way. It looks like a feeling practice. We feel our way into suffering, feel our way into clinging, feel our way through it. Did you consciously try and let go of the anger once you found the root of it, or is it something... I do both. Okay. It's very useful to have a real solid experience, foundation, in knowing how to look at something clinging, and not let go of it, but let it let go of itself. And that also always be the agent in charge of making something happen. So it's very important training is just to be there and let letting go happen. So our practice is letting be practice, let things be with careful attention. And then with letting things be, things will move. Pasha? I'm thinking, what's the difference between a goal that I have that I really wanted to achieve, and clinging? Is it I can have the goal and if I don't feel upset, and I'm not clinging? I think the best measure for the difference is if you're suffering or not. Yeah, and what happens is the mind gets quieter and stiller. We start noticing more and more subtle layers of suffering or clinging. So a goal which seemed quite innocent, when the mind is quite coarse and distracted, when you actually can look very, very carefully, see actually that goal too, had a little bit of clinging involved in it. But yeah, that's the difference. It's fine to have goals. Please, it's important to have goals. I think you just touched on my question. Is clinging always the negative thing? Is clinging always the negative thing? Your sense of joy or satisfaction that you feel in your practice, that's not clinging. No, no, no. Clinging has to do with a negative sensation. Well, I could cling to the joy. That's a problem too. Sure. All clinging, if you pay careful attention, all clinging feels off. It's not always so obvious, partly because if we're clinging something really enjoyable, we might not notice, we might know 90% of the experiences of the enjoyable stuff. We don't notice in the great brilliant light of enjoyment. We don't notice a 10% behind the scene that's holding on for dear life. But if you could really pay attention, you'd see actually this too, is unsatisfactory or not so pleasant. So all... Yes? I'm curious about your experience. I love that example of sleep-less mind. And certainly I, when I experienced that, will start ruminating. Will start ruminating about 100 feet loud tomorrow. And I'm wondering when you caught that and let it go and then just continued watching what was going on in terms of clinging, was that whole experience restful enough so that in the next morning, the next day, when you have to function, you function better than you expected? You were trying to find out whether there was a good payback. You're going to wonder, I'm guaranteed that... You don't have a wonderful insomnia x2 there. If I do what you're saying, then am I going to feel better because of it? You certainly feel better in the moment. Well how do you actually personally feel today? It's a very coherent question. Yeah, I feel pretty good. I got really tired around three o'clock in the afternoon, really sleepy. And I went to lay down, they got taken half and laid really still for a while. And I don't think I fell asleep. Little bit of suffering, I'm not falling asleep, came up, you know, oh my God, you know, not again. I'm not getting my beauty sleep. But then I was only feeling a little brief moment there. And but it seemed okay. I kind of figured you guys would be forgiving. Yes. Oh, yeah. Evidence on this long airplane flights, I found it very hard to sleep. But if I do meditate, I'm much more rested afterwards. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. So I have a question of how cleaning manifests in your body, and how noticing it and just staying with it. You sort of alluded to that. And I wasn't sure I was following what you were saying. So if one notices a certain pain in their body or contraction or whatever, are you suggesting to kind of penetrate the pain and you'll discover the clinging within that or the pain, the result of the clean? The word pain doesn't automatically imply clinging. There can be pain without clinging. So then there's no problem. Then you try to figure out what the best thing to do is, you know, if you are damaging yourself, then do something sensible with a pain. But if it's not damaging, you know, then maybe, you know, there's no problem. Then if you're there's no clinging. And then if you want, if the pain is the predominant experience, physical pain, that can be the focus of your concentration for mindfulness. But you're not doing it for any particular purpose to get rid of it. That's where you're developing your mindfulness. Does it respond well enough? So, so if the pain was the result of clinging, how would you determine the difference between a pain that's just a pain and a pain that's the result of clinging? I sort of think that I would know quickly, but I'm not sure if you're talking about something more subtle than I'm missing it. No, you don't, we don't always know automatically. It's not that quick. Sometimes you have to hang out with the pain for a long time. Sometimes a really long time to see where the clinging is. But sometimes it's pretty quick. If it's in meditation and you feel a strong physical pain, and you're not sure if it's physical or structural or, you know, comes from your clinging, when you get up from your sitting, if it persists, then it might be something structural, something you need to attend to more seriously in terms of making some physical change. But if you get up from your sitting, it's gone. And it's probably not something structural. It's probably something you can, you can, it's okay to hang out with longer. And you hang out with longer until it becomes clear. And it becomes clear either way, maybe. It was not so, you know, black and white. I mean, you know, my friend, a Zen priest who had knee pain, and he would get angry at his knees for giving him pain. So he would sit there and he would push into his knee. Kind of, you know, get back at it. And so eventually I think he needed knee surgery. Pretty dumb thing to do. But, you know, so he was, you know, augmenting the pain. And, you know, physically by doing something physical and causing more physical damage. But the genesis of that damage, I would say, had to do with his resistance, his anger, and hostility towards the pain. And it might not be so obvious immediately for him that if he focuses on the physical pain itself, you know, that there's just an hostility that's part of the complex. So that's the example where the hostility, the clinging that's going back, shows itself as hostility. Is the genesis of the physical damage, damaging pain. So it can go in all directions. And so there's no, you know, right answer. Just accept you have to do an investigation yourself. Last one, then we'll stop. I just want to say, I get really surprised quite often when I realize that the basis of my suffering is clinging because it's so subtle often. You know, I know you're such a experienced meditator that it probably comes clear more quickly. But I'm always surprised at how subtle it is. Well, yeah, because sometimes I don't even know I'm suffering. Yeah, it is subtle. So the bad news, of course, is that Buddhism helps you understand your suffering. I didn't know I was suffering this much. My God. But it's a lot better to be awake and aware than to continue being numb. And then hopefully you discover the joy of the engagement. Looking at this and then the wonderful joy of freedom that comes as our clinging starts to get released. The ultimate ideal in Buddhism is release, release of all clinging. They don't be attached to that. So thank you all very much.
