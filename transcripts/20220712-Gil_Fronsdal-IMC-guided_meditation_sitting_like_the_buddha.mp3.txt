The Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California Good morning, good day everyone. And I'll begin with a story. And the story goes that when the Buddha set out for his quest for freedom from suffering, that he first did the meditation practices of some of the great meditation teachers of ancient India, people who taught him to go into deep states of absorption, of trance. And when he there, teachers were very pleased with how he attained these and wanted to make him a teacher. He said, no, this is not the answer. And so he went on and he tried the ascetic practices of his time. There was a strong tradition of ascetic practitioners. And he spent six, seven years doing this, a long time. And it said that the descriptions of him being so emaciated from having eaten so little, that he couldn't walk, he fell on the ground and people thought he was dead. But he managed to revive and he thought, you know, I've taken asceticism as far as it goes short of death. This is not the way either. And he was given a bowl of rich, creamy rice porridge mixed with cream, I guess. And then it revived him and gave him energy and he went about looking for, you know, how to continue. And then he remembered a time when he was young. We're not sure how young he was, but it might have been quite young. And there it was a ceremonial plowing of the fields in his home country. And his father, who apparently was the king, was leading the ceremony. And the young boy was forgotten on the edge of the field under the shade of a rose apple tree. And sitting there cross-legged upright, just kind of maybe watching the scene from a distance, he got absorbed, he got settled, he got peaceful, he entered into a state of well-being that can come when we leave ourselves radically alone and allow ourselves to settle just to be here. And radically alone means that we don't tell ourselves stories. We don't tell ourselves about the future and the past and who we are and who we should be and how we're wrong. And he was simply able to just sit there peacefully and just be with the situation and at hand. And because maybe no one was paying attention to him, he could just get absorbed in the peacefulness of the scene. And he remembered that scene, he remembered that event, and he remembered the joy of that event. And he said, that joy, that sense of well-being is not to be afraid of. In ancient India there was a lot of hesitation among the ascetics to experience any joy, any well-being. That was, goes in the opposite direction of just building up the suffering to somehow purify oneself. He said, this is the way forward. And so this is the way to awakening. He had an intuition that's this certain kind of leaving oneself radically, fully alone, settled, with a mind not dispersed, distracted, jumping around, and that simple well-being. It was not necessarily dramatic. That is the path. That's the way forward. And so then he went to sit under the Bodhi tree and that was the path that he took until he became awakened. So this is a story of not being caught up in our stories, not being trapped by the stories that we live by. And to be able to put them aside, what a radical idea. We're not abandoning them. If they're useful, they can come back at the end of the meditation. But for the meditation to put aside the stories that we live by, except for this story, that it's okay to put them aside and settle in to our experience here and now, whatever it might be, when the stories settle and there's no interpretation or beliefs about what's happening, and we're just here in the middle of it, is there a well-being? Is there something that feels right and good, even in the middle of pain or all kinds of things? What is it that is below the story making mind, below the stories, below the beliefs, the predictions? So taking a posture for meditation that's right for you, and gently closing your eyes. And then taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. And these deep breaths at the beginning is a ritual of putting aside the concerns of the day, concerns of your life the best you can. And as you exhale to let go of them and settle in to here now, as if this time and place and this person that you are here is invaluable, invaluable place to settle and to be, letting go of any thoughts, ideas that diminish or criticize ourselves or settle in to this body below the stories where we are invaluable, here and now, and then to let your breathing return to normal. And the real meditation hall is here in your body and deeper than your body. It's whatever intuition, hints you have of being at home here and now. Putting aside any story that says otherwise. Gently becoming aware of the body breathing. The rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. The alternation of in breaths and out breaths. Some stories have never have a good outcome. And instead of trying to fix the story, there's a time and place for just letting go of it fully here. Here with the body breathing. Following the little hints towards a feeling of simplicity of being just here, just now breathing. Breathing. And if there are any hints of well-being, here and now, maybe that's a way forward to allow for it, to feel it, to breathe with it. Putting aside any story or belief that interferes with that. Just being here. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Putting aside any discursive thought, any story making of the mind in favor of feeling and settling into what has no story. What you can know about breathing, body, present moment experience. Without the need for thought. What is your experience when you don't use thoughts to explain it? Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. And then coming to the end of the meditation. There's a story of the Buddha coming to the end of his meditation on the night of his awakening. And he gazed out upon the world with care, with his tenderness, his caring, caringness for others. And he saw that there were people whom he could help support the guy. And he got up from his meditation and set forth for the next 40 years, supporting others in the practice. So coming out of this meditation to reenact that story. Is there some way that's appropriate for you to now consider the world, the people in your lives, neighbors, strangers, people in the news, to glance upon them with care, as if your care is appropriate, that caring for others, even if you don't approve of what they do, even if you don't have love or even kindness, can you care for their welfare? Can you care in such a way that you contribute to repairing the tear, the torn fabric of our social universe? Caring is their repair. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
