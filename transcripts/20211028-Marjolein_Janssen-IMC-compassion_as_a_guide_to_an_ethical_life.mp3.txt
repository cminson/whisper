 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Tonight I'd like to talk a little bit about compassion, a little bit inspired by a question from last week where someone asked about compassion and in wisdom being two wings of the same bird leading towards awakening. Two wings of awakening. And then, often in the Insight tradition, a lot of emphasis is on the wisdom part on cultivating awareness and wisdom. And I thought it might be nice to also emphasize the compassion part a little bit tonight. So I'll talk a little bit about compassion. It's karuna in Pali, the old language, the Buddha scriptures. And then I'd like to also relate compassion to moral conduct or ethical behavior. So as you all probably are familiar with compassion, it is a quality of the heart. It's one of the brahma viharas, the heavenly abodes. And the other ones are metta, loving kindness, mudita, sympathetic joy and upecca or equanimity. And compassion is different from metta because compassion comes up when we encounter suffering while metta is more for general settings. And when we experience compassion, we actually ourselves are free from suffering. So we see another being or ourselves, we can also experience compassion to ourselves. We see suffering. And then this wish wells up in us that this being is free from suffering. It's a genuine wish for their or our own well-being. And it can also come with a component of action, like it can spur us into action to alleviate that suffering. So example, for my own life is sometimes when a little spider gets caught up in the sink, I want to try to save it and put it outside instead of like maybe some people might flush it through the drain. But I feel like now I want to save this little spider or in a bigger way, you might feel compelled to help with an organization that strives for justice and equality. Or we might feel compelled to be a politician to help the world become a better place. But depending on the situation and on the timing, it is not always possible or appropriate to come into action to alleviate suffering. Like when we see something on the news and tragedy or something in a country far away, it's not so easy to help alleviate the suffering of the people or animals over there because we're over here and we don't have that much power. So another example would be if we see a bird eating a worm, we might feel a lot of compassion for that worm, but it might not be so appropriate to save the worm because then the bird will lack from, will suffer from a lack of food. So we can still feel compassion for those people in that other country or for the animal that's getting eaten. So even though we can't always come into action, we can still feel compassion. And it's very important to stress that compassion is a wholesome and positive state of mind. So when we feel compassion, we don't suffer ourselves. It is an opening of the heart and it is a very positive attitude, a very positive wish for the other or for ourselves to be free from suffering. In the fisudimaka, which is a commentary from the fifth century, there are two enemies of compassion or karuna named. One is a near enemy and one is a far enemy. And a near enemy that is being named is that we often confuse compassion with pity. And according to the dictionary, it's feeling sorrow for the misfortune of others. So we suffer then if we feel pity together with the other person or with ourselves. And it's not that wholesome positive state that I was talking about in our hearts and minds. It's more like we're experiencing suffering. We don't feel wholesome ourselves or we don't feel positive. And recently I read an article about a famous person in the Netherlands. I'm from the Netherlands. And it is probably one of the first examples of someone who got cancelled. It was like almost 20 years ago now, probably. And in my eyes, she hadn't really done anything wrong, but it was just the circumstances coming together back then that caused her to be kind of banned from society. And in this article, someone had visited her again and was reporting that she actually needs a very lonely existence nowadays. And she had moved to Canada and was very lonely. So I felt really sad for this person. And I was already preparing for this talk and I recognized, oh, this is not compassion. This is sadness that I'm feeling. So, yeah, the sadness in itself, it's very understandable, of course, that you feel sad for someone, but it's not a very wholesome state of mind. So I was observing the sadness. And after a while, the sadness subsided a little bit and I started to feel compassion. And the compassion was really like a warm heartedness, an opening of the heart, a genuine wish for her to not suffer, a wish for her to not be lonely. And when I compared that to the sadness, when I was feeling sad, it was hurting me a little bit as well in my heart, like a little bit of feeling of sorrow for her. I could really feel that in my heart. So when we encounter suffering in ourselves, in others, in the world, we can kind of feel into the states of our hearts and minds, like, what is actually happening? Is there a pity or sorrow or some hurt ourselves? Or is there a genuine wish for freedom from suffering? So that's the near enemy that we can watch out for when we are trying to develop compassion. And then there is also the far enemy, which is the opposite of compassion. And that's cruelty. And when cruelty arises, we actually want others to suffer. So maybe we've all had these moments that someone has treated us unfairly and we really wished upon them that they would get the same fate as we did or that they would suffer. And that's kind of an expression of cruelty, maybe a mild one. It's not like we're torturing someone, but it's kind of a mild version of cruelty in the mind. And then another example is that the other day I saw a fragment of a TV show where there was someone was killed and the loved ones of that person wished for the killer to rot in hell, which is, of course, very understandable in that situation. But from a Buddhist perspective, this is still a form of cruelty, wishing them to suffer, basically. The Buddha gives a relatively extreme example as well. He says that even when bandits sew off your limbs, you should still practice loving kindness towards those bandits. This is a bit extreme for most of us, but it kind of shows us in what direction the Buddha wants us to go. I mean, I don't expect any of us to start feeling loving kindness towards bandits who sew off our arms and hands and legs, but it helps us see which direction we're moving towards with our hearts, even though we can't really do that right now yet. So we can be aware of those near and far enemies when we encounter suffering, like is there a feeling of sorrow or pity coming up when another person or being or ourselves or we ourselves are in difficulty, or is there like a genuine wish for their welfare? Or do we even feel some cruelty? Do we even feel a little bit of like a wish that other person would be suffering? So that was a little bit of an introduction to compassion. And now I'd like to talk a little bit deeper, on a deeper level, about compassion, the relationship of compassion with ethics and moral conduct. Because compassion can be actually a direct expression of an ethical life. When we don't harm other beings, we are in essence compassionate towards those beings. And Biku Analio, a renowned scholar, says, compassion is intending to avoid what is harmful for others and ourselves. So when we intend to avoid harm, we are expressing compassion. When we refrain from killing that mosquito that has kept us up all night with his buzzing and instead captured in an empty glass and set it free outside, we are engaging in a compassionate action. So compassion can be extremely simple and very day to day life thing and can occur many times during our day without us even really realizing it. It could be like refraining from her from speaking harshly to our loved ones, or maybe we take the effort to call friend who we know is going to a hard time. Or maybe as simply as eating healthy out of compassion for our own bodies. When we look at the five precepts, the five Buddhist precepts for lay followers, then the relationship between compassion and ethics becomes even more clear. For those who are a bit rusty on what they are, I'll repeat them here, I'll name them. First one is refraining from killing living beings, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from sexual misconduct, refraining from lying and refraining from taking intoxicants cloud to mind. And then you think about it, when we refrain from all those activities, we become a safe haven for other beings. And we refrain from all those things. Other beings don't really have to fear us anymore. They won't, because they know or don't know, but we won't harm them. So they can be safe with us. We won't harm them by killing them, stealing from them, or harm them with our sexuality. We don't lie to them. Or we don't do something unwholesome under the influence of intoxicants like alcohol or drugs. Like if everyone in the world would adhere to those principles, precepts, like how much safer would the world be for our living beings? And that probably won't happen anytime soon. And everyone will do that. But we as individuals have a choice. We can offer this kind of safety to all beings if we choose to. And Buddha expresses it as follows in the suttas. This is from the Anguttranikaya. By abstaining from the destruction of life, the noble disciple gives to an immeasurable number of beings freedom from fear, enmity and affliction. He himself in turn enjoys immeasurable freedom from fear, enmity and affliction. And this same phrase he gives for all four precepts. So that's quite beautiful, that we can give this freedom from fear, enmity and affliction to an immeasurable number of beings and to ourselves. The Buddha also mentions in the suttas, also in the Anguttranikaya, that the purpose of ethical behavior is non-regret. So when we don't harm and we live from this compassionate heart, we don't have to regret anything. And we don't have to regret lying to our loved ones or killing the mosquito or speaking harshly to our neighbor. Instead, we can dwell in what is also called the bliss of blamelessness. And this is an incredible, useful and wholesome state of being and a state of non-regret or the bliss of blamelessness. And it's hard to recognize how amazing this state is, how wholesome it is when we don't have anything to regret. But once we do have something to regret, we can feel how that weighs on us. I once treated someone very unkindly and without much compassion. And it was years and years ago, and I had heard how much it had hurt this person. And I realized how much harm I had caused. So this instance kept coming back to me in meditation and in daily life, this regret of my actions. And it has a real weight on my shoulders. And we might all have examples like that, how something keeps coming up in our meditation that we feel guilty about or ashamed or regret. So when we've had this experience of regretting something, then we know how wonderful it is if we don't regret something and how wholesome that is. And keeping those five precepts is a way of minimizing the amount of unwholesome deeds that we do, and therefore minimizing the amount of regret that we experience. Like in my own life, if I use the five precepts as a way to monitor my ethical conduct, it's very useful. Because then before I do something, I get kind of an internal alarm bell if it's something that is not in line with those precepts. Like, oh, I don't want to go there. And we are usually not in a position to change the past, but we are able to live a wholesome life from now on, a life of non-regret, a life in which we at least don't accumulate new regrets. And the Buddha actually has advice for us how to deal with these regrets, the things that we've done unskillfully. And in one of the suttas, he gives advice to his son, Raghula. It's the Majjhmani Kaya 61. And the Buddha explains in this suttat to Raghula that when Raghula has acted in a way that has hurt himself or others, or both himself and others, that Raghula should confess and clarify his deed to the teacher or to a sensible spiritual companion. And after having revealed his unskillful deed, he should restrain himself in the future. So the good news is that we don't have to suffer regretting our harmful deeds for the rest of our lives. But the Buddha actually says, like, okay, maybe we can confess it to a sensible spiritual friend or a teacher. And I would say it should be probably someone who you really trust, that you trust will support you and will be compassionate, especially when you feel really ashamed about it or it's something unethical that you did. And then when we've confessed it, we can practice restraint in the future. We promise ourselves that we won't do this again. And on a side note, this is maybe a bit simplified for our modern times. And maybe we need a little bit more than just a confession. Maybe we need some therapy to deal with what we've done. Maybe if we feel really caught up in it or it's very difficult for us. Maybe we need something else also. And I just wanted to mention it because it's not always so easy to just forgive ourselves and decide we don't do it again and just move on. Sometimes we just need a whole process and it might take years for us to process something like this. So through our ethical behavior, we can be a safe haven for other beings and for ourselves. And then that way we don't have to regret anything. And that's a direct expression of our compassionate heart. And whether we start now to be a safe haven or we might have been a safe haven for years already, it is just a very wholesome way of living, independent of what we've done in the past. In each moment, each new moment, we have a choice again and again to act in an ethical or wholesome way. And it's a living from the standpoint of not wanting to cause harm, but to care for ourselves and other beings in the world. This is a living from a compassionate heart. I will close with a quote by the Buddha. A wise person of great wisdom has no intention to hurt themselves or hurt others or hurt both. When they think they only think of the benefit for themselves, for others, for both, and for the whole world. This is how a person is wise with great wisdom. Thank you. Sometimes, sometimes we're sharing questions discussion. And I also want to mention the question form that is on the IMC calendar. If you have a question for Andrea will be back next week, then feel free to fill the question form out so she can look at that. Are there any questions or assurance right now. Anthony. I enjoyed your talk. Oh, and I was gonna ask about what you were discussing. So, about the, you know, the. What I was gonna ask is, so, is it, is it like the karma in a way from our actions in the past gets conditioned into our, into our being, and then that that that's what karma is is the conditioning that we that we cause from, from our actions. Karma is a big subject. And, like, very short way to describe karma is karma literally means just action, but usually what is meant with karma is the fruit of our action. So, karma is what when we act, we are better is in body speech or mind can even be taught. There's a consequence. So, um, you could say that that that our action right now conditions the next moments and conditions, the other moments in the future that we can't really grasp yet. So that's kind of my, my super short take on karma. Is that helpful answer your question. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Yeah, they Thanks. I'm on the top of compassion and the, the anecdote you get from them gave from the Buddha's teachings about the bandits and that compassion could even reach as far as bandits who might cut your limbs off. Did I understand that I hadn't heard that story before. I had a sense of understanding of it. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. I. It's a very timely topic for me and without going into detail I have an interesting situation that generated a lot of conversation today that aligns with that well and I'd like to get your opinion. Imagine this is loosely based on a real life situation that happened this week. Imagine a situation where a bandit comes into your house and causes great damage to both people and property and. But in the process of doing so leave something behind. And that's something is very valuable to the bandit and not know a monetary way but in there. It's an important item that would mean a lot to that person and always has meant a lot to that person. And the discussion today was how it should be returned to the bandit who I'll never see who none of us will ever see again, whether it should be returned or or just discarded and thrown away sort of in retribution or in indifference to a person that caused such harm. My contention was that, of course, it needs to be returned but it's all a question of the attitude of the heart in its return because it would be very easy to return it in sort of a self. It's a way of congratulating ourselves for being so compassionate and so forgiving, rather than in really wanting this person to have the best life they can and this is part of that. Do you have any particular comment on the attitude of heart when when showing that compassion in a complicated situation. Yeah, that's very interesting. I would say that it's, I agree with you about the attitude in heart that that's most important. And since we're all not like fully enlightened probably. We will have a mixed bag of intentions. So, there will be probably partly compassion, partly like this. Oh look at me I'm so great kind of feeling and I'm the better person or, you know, whatever it is. It's just important to be aware of the mixed bag, and we can't force ourselves into having a lonely compassion in that moment. So, being aware of the things that are still in the way of compassion or that are on the side or next to compassion is the most powerful way that I know of strengthening your compassion in the long run. I just know okay there's also this other part that's maybe not, not so whole not as wholesome as the compassion but they also feel compassion, there's also some commission in my heart so. Yeah, isn't that helpful. It is and I appreciate you pointing out that it doesn't have to be. It's almost impossible for it to be all or nothing to have a really pure heart in the situation. So I appreciate your acknowledging that are reminding me to acknowledge that it doesn't have to be perfect compassion for it to be more helpful than less. So, thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question. Very interesting situation. It is. Thank you. Thank you for your teaching. That was great. I was wondering if you've come across any of the suitors or anywhere else, pointing to self compassion I know that mostly, you know, maybe something new that, you know, they're bringing it out now or a modern thing or is it also mentioned in the suitors directly to that. First part I know it's not mentioned in the suitors self compassion is more of a modern development. I'm not sure why. Because there's like a lot of research nowadays, like Christian net for example who does a lot of research in the area that self compassion is super valuable, and that we can be very healing. It might be a modern problem that we have that we don't feel compassion naturally for ourselves. Well, maybe in the old days they did have that or back in that culture they did have self compassion just naturally. But who knows we can't really go back in time.
