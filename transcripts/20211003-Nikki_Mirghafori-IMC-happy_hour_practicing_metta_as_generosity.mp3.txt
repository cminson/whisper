 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello and welcome everyone. Hello and welcome to happy hour. So for today's practice theme, I wanted to invite us to consider the practice of metta, practice of cultivating kindness, loving kindness, warmth, goodwill, so many different ways to relate to and translate this lovely word from Pauli, metta, and etta, to relate to it as generosity, to relate to it as generosity. This week, I'm sobbing for Gil at the 7 a.m. sits of his hiking and on vacation. So and the theme I've chosen to explore in the morning to invite everybody's minds to swim in is the theme of generosity, which is a deep, deep practice. It's not just about giving material items, but it's a deep practice of letting go and cultivating an attitude of generosity, an attitude of letting go, relinquishing, relinquishing with goodwill. It's not letting go like, oh, I have to let go. You know, when you think of a metta, for example, metta, may you be well, may you be happy. You're letting go of your good wishes of this well-being. You don't want to keep it all for yourself, right? It's an act of generosity, this practice of metta. May you be safe. May you be well. You're blessing. You're generously wishing. You're generously offering. You're generously offering this goodwill for others and also generously offering it for yourself not to exclude ourselves. Generosity doesn't mean that you just give it to others and not to give it to yourself, but to also generously, oh, may I be happy. May this being go as me. May be happy. May I appreciate the blessings of my life. May I rejoice in the blessings of my life. May I have well-being. So there's this sense of generosity that is part of metta. So that's what I'd like to invite us to explore tonight as we practice metta, this aspect of generously, generously opening our heart and offering metta first to ourselves and then to others. Actually, maybe we'll start with the deer being and then somewhere in the middle there we bring ourselves in. Sometimes that's easier to do that. So let's begin. Let's get started with our formal practice. So, so landing, landing in our chair, landing in our cushion. This chair, this cushion offered, can we accept it? Can we land in it with accepting generosity, with graciousness? Maybe even saying thank you chair. As if we were giving a little bow to the chair, thank you for supporting me. May my weight, deer cushion, deer chair. Relaxing, inviting the body to relax, to soften. Starting from our hands, softening, keeping their weight off to the earth. Providing our arms, our hands, hands, wrists, lower arms, upper arms. To relax, soften. Our neck, shoulders, our face, our jaw. Now let's get started. It is weeping. When there ain't everything. providing the chest, the upper back to soften, relax and receive the breath. The lower abdomen, lower back too, giving their weight to the earth, making space for the breath. The lower abdomen, lower back to soften, relax and receive the breath. Relaxing into the chair, cushion, their sit bones, the bottom of the body. The bottom of the cushion. Releasing the weight of the lower legs and feet onto the earth. Relaxing into the chair, cushion, their sit bones, their sit bones, their sit bones, their sit bones. Relaxing into the chair, cushion, their sit bones, their sit bones, their sit bones, their sit bones, their sit bones. Relaxing into the chair, cushion, their sit bones, their sit bones, their sit bones, their You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You As we receive each breath receiving the gift of each breath in this body, in this moment Can we invite ourselves to appreciate the breath, the life-giving breath soaking it in, relishing it as a gift of generosity offer to us, not taking it for granted not rushing for the next breath we try to hold on many longer comes and goes, gifts come and go relishing each, comings and goings of this gift bestowed to us every minute Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as if we were giving ourselves a gift Just as the breath is offered as a gift. Because generosity is a gift that we give others and we give ourselves. To bring to mind someone who's dear to us, someone who's easy. Bring them to our mind's eye. And as if we had a bag of gifts generously giving them gift after gift, gift of metta, gifts of goodwill. Blessing them with these wishes of goodwill. May you be safe. Knowing that life is unsafe for the world. It's human. Being human is not inherently safe. There are changes all the time. Anything can happen at any moment. And yet, I offer you a wish of safety. I wish, I generously, from my heart, wish may you be safe. Expressing my intention for your well-being as this wish. Not hanging on to it. Just sprinkling it, giving it freely. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May your life unfold with ease. Thank you. Feeling the goodness of the generosity in our heart. With each wish of metta for this dear being. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, if you'd like, can we allow ourselves to be seen through the eyes of this dear being with their eyes of generosity and let ourselves be the recipient of generosity? Can we accept their gifts of good will, graciously, not to deflect, say, oh, I'm unworthy, I don't deserve? The kindest way to show up when someone offers generosity is to receive it graciously. Can we receive generous metta goodwill, good wishes offered? From our dear person, dear being, open our hearts and receive them graciously with gratitude, appreciative. Imagine in your mind's eye that they say to us, may you be safe. We let it land, may I be safe. Imagine they say, may you be happy. We open our hearts and let it land, yes, may I be happy. Imagine them saying, may you be healthy. Ah, graciously receiving this gift, yes, may this body, may I be healthy and strong. Imagine them wishing us, please, may you have ease in your life, receiving it. Yes, may I have ease, may my life unfold with ease. I wish that for myself too. So receiving with generosity, graciously offering it to yourself, this metta. Thank you. Thank you. Graciously receiving. Smilingly receiving. And offering, generously offering. This bottomless well of metta. The more you give yourself to your dear being, the more there is, the more goodwill gets generated, doesn't run out. Feeling the abundance of your own heart. Showering yourself, showering your dear being with goodwill, friendliness, generously. May both of us be safe, etc., etc. Thank you. Thank you. Now if you wish, can shower, not just your dear being and yourself but others, generously with your goodwill, feel so good to be generous in this way. Maybe offering it to the sangha. All these travelers who support you with their practice, what they're showing up. Bringing each being to mind, their face, their name. Wishing them well. And if imagery works for you, you're welcome to use images. Maybe you have a bag of seeds, seeds of metta. You're throwing, sowing all these seeds from this bottomless bath. Maybe it's flowers, they're tossing. The past reviews the image of playfully, especially when it was hot, I guess, in the summer, showering them with cooling waters of metta. With a hose, playfully, whatever image works for you. Showering, maybe showering them, showering others with metta dust like fairy dust that touches their heart. Your wishes of goodwill. Friends, family, colleagues, people whom you don't know very well. Neutral beings, maybe neighbors, people you see at the grocery store. And definitely let's include the person who mistakenly deleted happy hour from the calendar, IMC calendar tonight. Showering them with metta. May this volunteer be well, be happy. They've done their best. All human beings just like us, just want to be happy, just want to do their best in this life. We all make mistakes. May they be well. May all beings, all of us humans, all beings be well. Thank you. Thank you. I said that generosity. Met the glad in the heart. See if your heart is a little gladdened, more gladdened compared to when you arrived. A little lighter is just a little freer. Appreciating your own heart's abundance. And offering the merit, the goodness of your practice with generosity to all beings everywhere. All beings be free. Thank you for your practice everyone. I think that practicing metta as an act of generosity brings two beautiful practices together. And it's happy making. I feel happier and more at ease. My body, heart and mind. Compared to when we arrived. Being very, very tired tonight. I feel refreshed by the practice of metta's generosity. I would love to invite you for your reflections, for your questions. Comments, Fred please. Hi. I had great difficulty at the very beginning, reposing into the gratitude for being here. I'm a little self conscious about going back into this again but this is what I'm experiencing. Just, you know, seven weeks now into my ears ringing all the time. I'm just very, very uncomfortable. It's really hard to feel the gratitude of sort of physical existence. And I did feel something shift slightly as I started to think of my beloved person. That it wasn't, it wasn't difficult to, to wish metta for them. And then it was entirely possible when I pictured that person then looking at me and knowing that, that she would wish with, with great urgency that I be safe and happy and well and at ease. So that was, that was a really significant turn. I won't say it, you know, it eradicated what I was feeling before, but it was different and, and I appreciate that. And I guess I also want to ask you then, if you have a more advice of how to, when I'm physically over rot and exhausted with this constant ringing. Is there, do you have an advice about how I might try to step into the physical pleasure of existence, which I could tap kind of easily, you know, be able to for seven weeks ago. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Fred. First, really feeling for you and I'm so sorry, this is, it's, it's challenging tinnitus is challenging. Ah. And as I hold with compassion, what you're going through, I also celebrate with mudita or what you just shared with this transition, noticing this shift, which is profound, which is profound. This shift and just a little more lightness not being in that state. So, so holding both of those holding both of those. Yes, it's challenging. And wow, notice this shift, it was possible to wish well not to keep being in the state of over rot or you didn't say any of these, but like really, really challenged state, you know, there was possible to step out of that. Hooray. Hallelujah. To offer meta for dear being and then see them offering it to you. Beautiful. Yeah, this capacity. I celebrate what you're sharing this profound I really want to highlight it. And so that is beautiful. Yay. Yay. Really leaning into that leaning into the possibility because that really opens up even more possibility of what is possible for you right now in this moment in this heart and in this mind and in this body and with everything that's going on that. But yes, it is possible. A little more freedom is possible right here right now. Right. Yes, exactly. It was possible. Yeah, it was experienced. Yay. And yes, beautiful surprise. Right. Yeah, I appreciate you smiling. Yeah. And these are mini Nipanas. These are mini moments of freedom. Freedom is like this more freedom. There was more contraction and pain and being over on another is the heart is opened I've stepped out of myself wishing this person well, the ringing is still present but there's less suffering in that moment. And yeah, thank you. One other thing I would say so that really I want to point that out just for you to see that yes, there were you, you are capable it just it's here already the freedom is here for you. Okay, so in one more thing all to say, also to add the moments when there is exhaustion and overwrought well yeah you already know this practice of mental for the dear being helps you step out of yourself out of this, the prison like feeling of this so that you know that that's possible and surprisingly wow and then wish you all for me and then there's just some light and I see that the buzzing can still be there but you can be above it. There's some level of transcendence. Right. Yeah. And also sometimes it could be so so this is enough. Maybe I shouldn't even mention this next thing but, but I'll say it. Sometimes it could also be skillful to turn your awareness if you wanted to explore this other invitation also. Turn your awareness to something that is pleasant in your body, because I'm willing to bet there is something that's feeling good. Maybe it's the. I don't know the weight or the warmth of the hands or something just feels pleasant and warm or cool or turn your attention to that. Not allow tinnitus to be the only game in town I mean as human beings there's so many sensory information that we receive as you well know every second and perception can be selective select something else, turn the channel. Thank you very much. Thank you, friend. Wayne I see your hand. I just want to thank everybody and thank you, Nikki and the teachers at IMC I am so grateful for the practices that you've given me, and all of us. They did this has been the most difficult day I've had a long time and it was so helpful to just try and stay in touch with my body and and think of thinking, giving feeling compassion for these parents that were giving me hell. Anyway, thank you. Thank you, Wayne. Thank you for showing up for being here supporting yourself and also knowing that you are a teacher right now in these very very challenging times, good heavens. These very very challenging times thank you for what you do for so many students so many parents who in your words gave you hell today and in this practice, sitting with opening your heart and holding them with compassion. That is. Wow, I feel chills if every teacher practice in this way as you do transform, it would transform, not only the lives of the teachers but the students and parents, so thank you for doing this for everyone. I also feel a lot of yesterday I did a hour and a half long men's retreat with James bearers and some other fellows that I've done once before and and that's very, very wonderful. That's great. Thanks for sharing that wonderful. Thanks, Wayne. And on YouTube, Richard says thank you Fred a tender sharing. I'm living with tinnitus since two months ago, and sending you met for your difficulty. So, thank you for for sharing friend, and Richard and I trust many other people appreciate the shared shared common humanity of tinnitus and similar conditions that are ongoing. So dear ones, the time has come for us to share with generosity, our presence with each other in small groups. So, I'm going to create the small groups now. And as always we start with 15 seconds of meta silently for each other and then you can share as little or as much as you wish about your practice, kind, take care of yourselves take care of each other. And the rooms are created.
