The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Hello everyone and welcome to the Sunday morning talk.
I'd like to begin with a little something autobiographical.
That when I was in my 20s, I was living at a Zen monastery.
That's the heart of monastery here in California for about three years.
And I had recently graduated from college and had been accepted to graduate school,
which I then deferred and was living at the monastery, living a monastic life.
And it's been a lot of time reflecting, thinking about, what was I going to do with my life?
Go to graduate school, do something else? What should I do?
And I was happily engaged in the monastic life in four days of the week.
I had a five-day week cycle, so following the monastic routines for four days,
and then the fifth day was kind of half-day off or something.
And so I would go and hiking in the mountains there.
And those days offered the hardest days for me, because I was left with myself in a different way
and I had to reflect on my concern about, what am I going to do with my life?
I had to make a decision. So I did a lot of reflecting on those walks.
And after about a year of these kinds of walks and reflections and thinking what to do,
I think it was beginning to be kind of, maybe I had done enough reflection thinking about it with no answers.
And at some point I realized that I was operating into generalizations and imaginations,
imagining a future, imagining things that were beyond the monastery about what I could do and should do and possibilities.
And I became acutely aware of how much I was in my world of my imagination thinking about all this.
And so I made a decision. It wasn't exactly a conscious decision,
but it was like, I don't know exactly, but it was a decisive moment where I decided,
somehow I decided that I had enough of all these reflections and thinking.
It hadn't helped me. I decided that I would start my life over.
I'll just start all over again with the next step as I walked.
And looking back at it now 40 years, I don't know if that was naive.
Sure. But anyway, I did it. That's what I did.
And I just happened to be living in a Zen monastery.
That was kind of a cool place to start all over again because then the bell rang and I had to go meditate.
The bell rang and you got up and it went to work or did things.
So it was a healthy, very wholesome place to be.
And I just then followed what opened up in front of me.
And at some degree, that represents the rest of my life.
That somehow, that just taking the next step and then seeing what happens and then responding to that and things open up and doing it.
Eventually, you know, let me hear, you know, into what's happening in Redwood City now and the rest of my life.
And I'm still doing that, just kind of.
And so that was nice for me. That was a nice decision to make.
And it turns out that each of us, every day, every moment comes to that juncture without realizing it.
Every day, you kind of start over.
Every moment, you kind of start over, believe it or not.
You could start over.
And the way you start over is that all the things that you did in the past are now in the past.
Things you did in the past contribute to this moment.
But whatever decisions you made in the past have been made.
You don't have to make those again.
We find ourselves here and now.
And now is when we can decide how to take the next step.
Now is the time we decide, given all the conditions that are present here and now,
now we're making a choice to do something.
And the choices you made in the past, they are what they are.
The place that's really dynamic, the place that's really significant for us in our lives,
is a place where today and this next step, we take the choice we make today.
And the choice we make today of how we walk, how we talk, what we say, what we do is consequential.
And sometimes there are unconscious choices.
We're influenced by things around us.
But the choices you make have consequences that shape your future.
Imagine that there are two identical twins who grew up together.
And people couldn't tell them apart.
They looked the same, they had the same mannerisms and way of speaking, the same personalities.
They were just all like so similar.
But then they decided to go to different colleges when the time came to go to college.
And each of them had a different roommate.
One of them had a roommate who had a strong tendency to complain.
The other had a roommate who had a strong tendency to be grateful for everything.
And then they didn't know that it was like, each one of them thought, oh, this is just what roommates are.
They didn't have any reference point to think anything different.
But you know, okay, I'm in college, you get a roommate, this is what roommates are like.
And so slowly they came under the influence of the complaining.
One learned to complain.
And one learned to be grateful.
It wasn't exactly a choice that we would say got a conscious choice, but there was a choice.
There was a kind of subconscious choice, like, okay, under the influence of a roommate,
it became, you know, like God reinforced, if you go in the complainer, if you complained,
it was like, you know, you had camaraderie-ship.
You could, with the one who was grateful, you had the camaraderie-ship by being grateful.
So slowly, you know, and the person who had the twin didn't recognize what was happening,
how they were being shaped by the situation.
And after a year, you could tell the difference between the two twins easily.
And their lives started to change dramatically.
The one that started to complain more and more, people kind of held their distance from that person.
People, the one who was grateful, people like to be with them.
Different opportunities opened up.
The one who complained because things, you know, things are a little bit uncomfortable.
It's an uncomfortable mental state to complain.
A stressful mental state that reinforced certain other inner reactivities, annoyance at the state of mind,
and certain self-criticalness, and made it easier not only to be complaining, but to be angry at things.
The person who was grateful supported other mental states, more relaxed states,
more feeling more of a generosity, and that's what came out.
So they both came to the same moment, going to college, where they, in a certain way, started their life over.
And then things went a different way for each of them.
So today is a new day for you. Today is a new beginning.
Every moment is a new beginning, and you come to a fork in the road.
And the question is, which fork do you take?
There's no one who's asking you or telling you, I think, really, about what fork you should take moment by moment.
But what if you really took it seriously that you are starting your life over today, fresh, new?
Because in a way you are, and the way that you are, maybe I'm repeating myself,
is that this is really the only place today and now where you can make the choices,
engage in the activities that are going to shape your future.
If you're going to be kind of the one who shapes your future to whatever degree we can shape it,
it's only you that can do that.
Even if you get a roommate who complains, how you respond to that roommate, how you take it in and receive it,
is really up to you, even if it's subconscious.
When we are mindful and have this kind of pause and ability to stay present,
we have a much higher sensitivity to notice the choices we make,
higher sensitivity to be wise about which fork we take, the one that's healthy and the one that's unhealthy,
the one that creates a better life, creates a kind of worse life for ourselves.
And so when we have this mindfulness practice, we can really appreciate we start over.
In that sense, in a certain kind of way, it's very forgiving.
Yes, you've been influenced by the mistakes you made in the past.
That's part of the conditions that brought you here.
But we don't have to be weighed down by the past.
The Buddhist approach is to think enough about the past, reflect on it, learn from it,
just enough so we can aim to do better in the future.
Buddhism, in a way, is forward-looking.
Some people think that Buddhism is all about being in the present moment.
It's about being in the present moment.
Part of the reason to be in the present moment is so we can, in looking forward-looking,
we can make the choices today that make a difference for tomorrow in a good way for ourselves.
And even something as simple as complaining, as innocent as it is maybe sometimes,
is choosing a fork which maybe one little complaint is not going to have much impact.
But once we start making complaints more and more, it affects our mind states.
It affects our habits. It affects how people treat us and relate to us.
And it begins creating a new world.
So how careful do you want to be in the world that you create for yourself?
How you create yourself?
There's an expression in English.
I don't know if it's an expression, not a set phrase, but it goes something like this.
If you do X, you own it.
You own it.
I couldn't think of a good example, but if you decide to balance all the tea cups in your house on top of each other,
and you insist on doing it when someone says, that's not safe, they're going to fall, they're so fragile, they're going to break.
And so the person then says, I'm going to do it, it's safe.
And you say, okay, well, the person walks away and says, okay, well, then whatever happens, you own it.
Meaning, I think it means that you're responsible for it.
It's up to you to take care of it.
It's your karma, some people would say.
You own it.
And directly, the Buddha said that too, 2500 years ago.
He said, you are the owners of your actions.
You are the owners of your actions.
And then he goes on to say something else.
He said there's a wonderful, almost like a liturgy, a very famous Buddhist line about action that I think encapsulated what I'm trying to say today.
Beings are owners of their action, he heirs to their action.
They inherit them.
And they originate from their actions.
They are bound to their actions.
And they have actions as their refuge.
So we're owners of our actions is kind of what I'm saying here.
Once we do something, the consequences of that somehow continues for us.
So to be careful with what we do so we, you know, the consequences, the results, the momentum we set in place is one that we want to live with, live by.
We inherit our actions.
So the heirs of our actions.
And so some of the, you know, we receive, again, some kind of the same idea, but they're passed down to us from date, from one day to the next, through habits, through conditioning, through whatever way that these, all these different ways,
infinite ways in which actions kind of carry with them consequences in the future.
The idea in Buddhism is that there's no free lunch when you come to action, or there's no free consequences.
All actions carry consequences.
And so we inherit them.
We inherit the consequences.
And then we originate.
That's the powerful one.
All beings originate from their actions.
So in this way I'm talking about it today, that who you are today is partly the consequence of all the actions you've done in this lifetime before today.
And it's all these things are so subtle and small and how they come into play and build up over time.
I think I was told once that Abraham Lincoln said something like, by the time a person is 40, they're responsible for their face.
And I think what he meant was, you know, all the little gestures and all the different ways, expressions we have on the face, you know, build over time a certain kind of face.
And I've been impressed, I've seen this sometimes with, I see people who grew up in different cultures, different countries.
And like someone who their parentage was from one country, but they grew up in a different country.
And you can see sometimes like the difference facial features or muscles or expression, how they are on their face.
Maybe it built up differently because of partly it might just be different muscles are used when we speak different languages.
And as you do that over, you know, decades it affects the face, but also expressions and all this stuff.
So we originate from our actions.
And I don't know if that was the best example, but from the Buddhist point of view, it's not about our face, but it's about our hearts, our minds.
And so much was shaped by all the choices we make.
And then we are bound to our actions.
You can't get away from your actions. You can't get away from the fact that actions are consequential.
Even if your action is to do no action, just be a couch potato, do nothing, that's an action too.
So, you know, we're bound to actions. We're human beings. That's what we are. We're human.
And we say we're human beings.
I don't think there's very, very little time we spend just being.
You know, you sooner or later you have to pee.
So we're more like human actors, human activities.
There are these constant activities that we're doing.
So to embrace that, to appreciate it, to find a new way to be an activator.
I don't know. I'm trying to do some equivalent to being.
And because we're bound to action, we can't get away from acting.
So let's look at action and activity in a serious way.
And then we come to the last part.
Beings have action as their refuge.
The Buddha said that you can make yourself a refuge.
So we're not trapped in action.
We're not trapped in creating problems for ourselves by what we do and what we say and how we act.
We can act in ways, we can engage in the world and behave in ways that we become our own refuge, our own support.
And the refuge in Buddhism is a very powerful word.
It's almost like one of the, I don't know, it's kind of like a word like, I don't know if it carries the same, it doesn't carry the same meanings,
but maybe the same associations or the same heart-feeling or emotion as in other religions,
they might talk about having a conversion experience or having a really deep, I'm a devotee of some wonderful religion or something.
It has this very deep religious sense, the refuge.
But rather than the refuge being outside of oneself, the refuge is not exactly in ourselves.
It's not like you find some essence inside yourself, oh, I can, you know, now I've discovered my true self in there.
And for the teachings of the Buddha, the refuge is our actions, how we live, what we do.
And it makes a huge difference how we live and what we do.
And we can do the things that are supportive and nourish us and benefit us.
So it means simple, it's not so simple maybe, but simple to say.
We can live ethically, we can live by the precepts.
It makes a big difference, believe it or not, whether you kill people or don't, for your heart.
It makes a big difference whether you steal or if you don't.
It makes a big difference if you engage in sexual activity that harms others or you don't.
It makes a big difference whether you lie or if you don't.
It makes a big difference if you engage in intoxication or if you don't.
It makes a big difference whether you're greedy or if you're not.
Big difference if you have hatred or if you're not.
It makes a big difference if you're generous or if you're not.
It makes a big difference if you are grateful or if you're complaining.
It makes a big difference whether you take the time to see people with respect and even reverence or maybe the opposite.
These are all actions, these are all behaviors.
And choosing the side of the equation that is healthy, we create our own refuge.
We create an inner life that we're happy to be in, that we're proud of, that brings us a sense of joy and delight.
More importantly, for meditators, it brings us a possibility of relaxation, of ease.
We look within and we don't find conflict.
We don't find, oh no, I regret what I said or challenged by what I've done.
But we look inside and say, oh, it's good in there.
Imagine, oh, it's nice to be in there.
Who's your best friend? Your own heart, what you find inside.
But to discover that, to find that, it's through our actions that we do.
Some people feel like they have a lot of doubts and lack of confidence.
How do you find confidence? How do you find faith?
Some people think it's by reading a lot of books until they find the perfect teaching.
Sometimes it's thinking they have to find some meditative state of mind that's going to come out, correct everything.
But the way to build confidence is step by step in the actions you do.
And it might be that it's just like after a while you've been practiced honesty
in small little increments, slowly getting more honest.
But after a while you feel that, oh, I think I have confidence.
I've learned the skill to communicate honestly in a way that's effective and helpful and safe.
But we learn and develop that.
We learn to be generous, maybe in small steps, until we feel, oh, I know how to be generous.
I know when to be generous and how to be generous.
I know about the world of generosity a bit.
And so it's through actions that we develop ourselves, cultivate ourselves.
It's by actions that we develop confidence.
And faith, dharma faith in Buddhism is not like faith in Buddhism so much.
There might be some of that.
But you want to have enough faith in Buddhism that you begin acting in different ways, behaving differently.
And then the refuge, the faith becomes less and less about Buddhism and more about yourself.
Knowing how to behave and act beautifully.
And so the word beauty, when the Buddha talked about action, he talked about the word here as karma.
In English translations you'll read his teachings.
They'll talk about good and bad karma.
The word for good, literally in Pali, ancient language, is beautiful.
There's bad karma and then there's beautiful karma.
What a difference.
There's bad behavior and then there's beautiful behavior.
That creates a very different feeling.
It doesn't have the moralistic flavor of good karma, I think.
And so what are we creating here?
What are we living our life as?
What if we say we're doing what's beautiful?
Living our beauty, living beauty.
And that is more an ethical life.
But it doesn't have the heaviness of being, of calling it an ethical life.
It has some sense of, maybe for me, some place of freedom and delight and joy.
That we're living the joy, we're living the delight of what we want, of what we do.
And so to...
So the teaching that's so central to the Buddhism that it has to do with action,
how do we live our life, behave in our life,
is not always conveyed for people learning meditation.
And there's a particular syndrome among a few individuals here in the modern west
of being...
Any emphasis on doing and doing something ties them in knots
because they feel like they can't do it right, they're wrong,
they have to strain, they have to push, they have to try too hard and get tense,
like this is serious, I have to prove myself.
All these kind of ideas that weigh down.
So much so that if you hear a talk about action, you feel exhausted.
Just hearing about it, oh no, I have to do more.
That's all I do is do.
I just need meditation as a break.
So yes, meditation can be a break.
And to get that break, some people love meditation teachings,
Buddhist teachings, that talk about not, don't do, just be.
It can be very profound to hear the instructions just be and don't do
as an antidote to all the being and doing and proving that goes on in this culture.
But as good as that teaching is,
it doesn't really represent the fullness of what the Buddha had to teach.
The Buddha talked about action and how to do it wisely.
And one of the ways to do it wisely, as we pay attention,
we start learning from the feedback loop
when and how our behavior adds stress.
How and when our behavior is refreshing and brings ease.
We start recognizing the extra attitudes
and that we pile on top that make it kind of heavy and difficult.
And we start learning other attitudes
that our behavior acting in the world can be light and easy and fresh.
We don't carry so much at stake.
It's just, oh, I'll do this.
And I think this is one of the important things to learn,
is that as we recognize that actions can be our own refuge,
how do we act so that it's not a burden?
How do we act?
How do we live and behave in the world so that there's a ease and it's beautiful?
Isn't it what we enjoy to do?
So when we finish doing something, we're not exhausted by it,
but we feel revived by it.
It's possible to do that much more than most people realize.
So that means, again, mindfulness, to keep the mindfulness turned on oneself
and track carefully the extra attention, the extra stress,
the extra straining that goes into what we do
and to learn how to act.
The solution is not to avoid acting.
The solution is to act without all that extra stuff.
When I was at that Zen monastery, there were stories about the founder of it.
A Japanese monk named Shinri Suzuki, he was pretty short.
I think maybe he was five foot tall or something.
He was in his late sixties and these young Americans, strong, tall,
he really loved having tall American male students look up at them.
One of the things he liked about them was they would come to help him with his rock garden.
They had his big boulders.
The stories from those people who worked with him in the garden
was that when Suzuki Roshi was going to move a big boulder,
he seemed to use no extra effort, more effort than it was needed.
His body seemed to stay relaxed and he knew how to engage and move the boulder
without any extra strain.
So I wasn't there, so I don't know what they actually saw,
but that principle stuck with me.
Yes, you can even move boulders without adding extra on top of it.
So beings are owners of their actions,
heirs of their actions,
bound to their actions,
originate in their actions,
and have actions as their refuge.
Can be your refuge.
And it's your choice.
Which of those two, whether you make it a refuge
or make it something that keeps you bound up and caught
in a certain kind of prison.
So those are my thoughts this morning.
So we have a few minutes.
If any of you want to ask some questions or comments
or testimonials about actions or...
Complaints?
Or anything else?
It seems to me very hopeful,
because I get a new chance all the time.
Yes, it's hopeful you get a new chance all the time.
Yes, you do carry with you the effects of the past,
but you always can see, okay, now I get to start over.
So you don't have to be way down by it then, yes.
Well, I do try to do the best I can, most all the time.
But since I can't guarantee that I will not offend you,
because I'm not there in your being,
I ask the people around me that if I offend them in any way,
please tell me, because then I can look at maybe
and correct my mistake, but if I don't know about it, I can't.
I think that's really wise.
We have a lot of unconscious behavior
and a lot of foolish behavior and all kinds of things we do.
And so how do we take that into account?
You don't want to be in a straight jacket.
And so what you just explained was a really important way
of having a community to support us in finding our way.
And so to make agreements or arrangements with people you know
or to choose friends who can offer you feedback
in places where you're safe to make mistakes
and be told about it and find your way forward.
This is really, really useful.
Yes, it's difficult for people,
because people don't want to offend you.
Yes.
Thank you.
If you would say your name, it would be nice.
My name is Jeannie and I'm Suzanne.
I just had the thought that what you were talking about,
living with a teenager, you start anew every day.
Because now that I'm in there,
the teenager's mood changes from day to day,
sometimes moment to moment, and you're seeing a new person
each day or each moment.
And having to learn to flex and change with that
and decide you're going to do things differently
is probably very good Buddhist practice.
Fantastic, because maybe you'll then learn to do it for yourself.
Because you probably change more than you realize.
Great, thank you.
Thank you, Gil, for explaining actions as a refuge.
It was confusing to me when I first saw that statement,
but now it's very clear that good actions can become
certainly a refuge for going forward.
Great, great.
And beautiful actions too.
I'm inspired by this idea of calling it beautiful actions,
rather than good actions.
And I don't quite know what to do with it.
It's honest to be honest, but it inspires me quite a bit.
My name is Abhishek, and can you please explain
what's the difference between a good action and a beautiful action?
Can I distinguish between a good action and a beautiful action?
The word good, probably both words, need defining.
We use it so lightly, the word used to word good so easily
as if everyone understands what we mean.
But I think you can ask him, what do you mean by good?
I would like to use the word good, that it means that it's useful
and beneficial for some purpose.
Rather than focusing on the morality of it,
it's good action is ethical action,
which it is for some people, that it's useful,
it's healthy and beneficial for certain things.
Whereas a beautiful for me is that it's certainly pleasant.
It's almost like looking at art, it's so nice to see.
Someone says something beautiful to another person.
It's not just useful, but there's a kind of grace,
there's kind of a pleasure, delight, kind of inspiration.
That was well done, that was a nice thing.
You'll forgive me for being so poor at examples,
but if I just said something like,
well, thanks for that question, that was great.
That was a good question, thanks.
That's one thing, right?
But if I say, wow, that was a really great question,
that was important.
It makes me reflect on it now,
and it kind of gives me something to think about even more,
that difference.
I hope my answer was good, but thank you.
So maybe the first was not so beautiful.
Maybe the second approached beauty.
Am I in the ballpark for you?
Yes, so what I did is how we do things
relates more to beauty, and what we do relates more to beauty.
Oh, good.
The beauty has to do with how.
Yeah, I like that.
Very nice.
Okay, so I guess...
Okay, and thank you all very much for coming,
and we used to, when we met before the pandemic,
we would often periodically ask people to turn next to each other
and say hello and all that,
and I feel hesitant to do it now with the pandemic and all that,
and how we are with masks and being close together.
But if you go outside in the gravel or under the tree or something,
and just maybe some of you would like to say hello to each other,
and maybe people you have never met before,
if you're standing in the gravel or you're available to say hello to,
and maybe chat a little bit.
Yes?
And if anyone's new, I'd be happy to show you around
or introduce you to our building and place.
Perfect.
Jeannie used to do that before the pandemic,
so she's offering anybody who's new or relatively new
to just say hello to an old timer
and hear a little bit about what goes on here.
Yeah, go see Jeannie.
You'll be outside too, right?
Yep.
Great, okay.
Well, he is in the hall.
In the hall, just outside.
Yeah.
Great.
Thank you all.
