 The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org. So greetings everybody, I hope you're all well. Good to see you back again. So you might notice that my voice is a bit kind of gravelly and I've had a bit of cold the last few days. So if you find that it's too rough for you, then just close your eyes and imagine that the Dhamma talk has been given by Tom Waits. Then everything will be better. Okay, so we're here for the second of our installments on the Parayana Wagga of the Suttani Pata. I am speaking to you as usual from our place in Harris Park which is on the unceded land of the Barramudagal people of the Dharid nation. And so I pay respects and honor to the elders past, present and emerging. So I hope that you've all had a great week this past week and that life and everything like that is treating you as well as could be expected. All right, so let's start with a brief recap from last week. So we began with the introduction to the Parayana Wagga which is the fifth chapter of the Suttani Pata which is one of the books in the Kudhikankaya of the Sutapitika. So the basket of discourses, the minor collection and the anthology of discourses, Suttani Pata, Parayana Wagga which means the way to the beyond. And so last week we looked at the first chapter which is that narrative introduction. And I talked about the fact that this narrative introduction is, it's a bit lowbrow if you like compared to the bulk of the text. And while it is clear that this is a substantially later addition to the text, I also argued that it has a narrative purpose, particularly that it situates the collection as a whole, as a conversion narrative. So it's telling us something about how the early Buddhist community spoke to people who were around them in ancient India at that time, especially as they were spreading to new areas. Now even though that first section is linguistically, narratively, doctrinally quite distinct from what we find in the central portion of the Parayana Wagga, there's still many connections between the two and I'll point some of those out as we go today. So for today we will begin with the 16 questions, or rather 16 sets of questions which were asked by various of the Brahmin students of Bhavari when they came to see the Buddha. So after their long journey, finally they came and they had the chance to ask the questions. Now a number of these passages that we're looking at are actually quoted elsewhere in the suttas. So this gives us a chance to do a bit of intratextuality, checking how the same text might be used in different places. And in fact it's worth bearing in mind that these particular verses, even if we just consider within the Pali Canon, are used and quoted in a variety of contexts, the suttani-pata which is the primary context, then there are these occasional cases where they're quoted in the four Nikayas, also quoted in the nidasa which is the commentary, the canonical commentary on this chapter. And also we find a number of them are quoted in the neti-pakarana as well which is a kind of a guidebook to interpretation of the suttas also found in the Pudukanika. So these were dealt with and explained and interpreted from a variety of perspectives from the earliest time. All right. And as always, since we have a relatively short, oh hang on, oh interesting, so I'm sorry I just noticed a message there by Susan. So Susan Pembroke's given an announcement of a beginner's Pali class on Zoom that's being offered there. So that's really interesting, thanks for that. So please do join up anyone who's interested to learn some Pali. I might pass that on to a few of my friends actually. Okay. Let's have a look at the first set of questions from Ajita. And he was the first of the Brahmins who spoke to the Buddha and the Buddha invited him to ask whatever he wanted. And Ajita's questions in some ways probably the most famous of the sets of questions and which give a rather succinct overview of the scope of the questions that are being asked by these Brahmins. Let's have a look at Ajita's questions. By what is the world shrouded? Asked Venerable Ajita. Why does it not shine? Tell me what is its tarpet? What is its greatest fear? The world is shrouded in ignorance, replied the Buddha. Avarice and negligence make it not shine. Prayer is its tarpet. Suffering is its greatest fear. The streams flow everywhere, said Venerable Ajita. What is there to block them? And tell me the restraint of streams by what are they locked out? The streams in the world, by the Buddha, are blocked by mindfulness. I tell you the restraint of streams, they are blocked out by wisdom. That wisdom and mindfulness, said Venerable Ajita, and that which is name and form, good sir. When questioned, please tell me of this. Where does all this cease? This question which you have asked, I answer you Ajita, where name and form cease with nothing left over, with the cessation of consciousness, that's where they cease. There are those who have assessed the teaching and many kinds of trainees here, tell me about their behavior, good sir, when asked, for you are alert. Not greedy for sensual pleasures, their mind would be unclouded, skilled in all things, and mendicant should wander mind-ful. Okay, very good. So here in these questions of Ajita we have an extremely succinct and very powerful set of questions. First set of questions, he's asking, well, what is the problem? What is the, why, why, why things like they are? Second question is asking, well, what can we do about it? So the first one's about dukkha, second one is how do you practice, what do you do? And then the third question is asking about the goal of practice. And so how, what actually happens? Do we just keep, do we just keep practicing forever? Does the road go on forever or is there an end to these things? And then finally he asked the question about those who have assessed the teaching and many kinds of trainees, in other words, those who are, are a hunch is the first category, those who have assessed the teaching and those who are still on the path and asked about their practice. So how do, how do those people live who have fully or partially attained the goal? So even within these just few verses there's a very, very broad and very succinct and very powerful expression of the whole scope of the Buddha's teaching. There are a number of interesting little linguistic details. At our mark I won't dwell on them for too long, but worth noticing. First one is what is, by the word, by what is the word shrouded, nivutot. Now this is actually the past participle of the same word that we're familiar with, with nivarana as in the hindrances. So this is by literally by what is the word, where the hindered, we might translate that. But the basic meaning of avarana and nivarana is to shroud or enclose or to darken. And in the, in the Rigveda, the Vrittra, the, the, the cosmic serpent or the dragon that enshrouds the world. This is the word for the dragon that enshrouds the world. And so there's almost this word, this idea that the, it's, it's what covers things up, it obscures them, it brings darkness. Now the idea of the tarpid, if you're thinking of brarabhat falling into the tarpid, then good. You're supposed to be thinking of brarabhat falling into the tarpid. There is a story in the, I think it's in the Satipatana Sanjuta that talks about a monkey that gets its hands and feet and even its face stuck in the tar. And the word for tar in that case is lepana, the same word we find here, abhilepana or lepana. So it could have the, there's a variety of senses, but generally it means some kind of sticky substance. So something that you get stuck in, and sometimes a tarpid. Now one of the most interesting lines here that the Buddha is saying is when he says prayer is its tarpid. Now notice again, as often, so often the Buddha has sort of psychological strategy. Now when he begins with the word, world is shrouded in ignorance. Remember that this actually calls back to the original narrative, because if you recall the conflict there was that the teacher, Bhavari, was afraid that his head was going to split into seven pieces. And Buddha's answer was, well, that the head is ignorance and its knowledge, which is that which splits the head into pieces. So by calling back and using the idea of avijja is making that connection there. Avarice and negligence make it not shine. Now prayer is, so far by talking about avarice and negligence, you already taught, you know, the Buddha's in a way establishing that common ground. You know, the Brahman who's come to see him is somebody who's interested in knowledge, interested in overcoming ignorance and so on. And so the Buddha starts by, you know, finding some common ground. And then he says, but prayer is the tarpid. Now the word I've translated as prayer here is japa. And japa basically means like, in canting the Vedic mantras. And so this might be done as a religious service, as a sacrifice. It might be done as a curse, as we saw in the opening narrative. It might be done as a simply way of recollecting the Vedas and so on. But this is a very kind of common idea, japa. But japa has a slight ambiguity in its form because it also means to wish for, to desire for something. And so in that sense, it neatly encompasses the English word prayer. To pray is to repeat sacred words, but to pray is also to ask for something, to beg for something, to wish for something. And so this is really precisely what the Buddha is talking about here when he's replying to Ajita. You think that when you're reciting your sacred scriptures, that you will get what you want, that this will help you to focus your mind and your aspiration, and that you will realize that what you want. But actually, this is what you're stuck on. This is what is holding you back. So really, a kind of dense line there, and with quite powerful implications. You can imagine that the 16 Brahmins listening to this would have been challenged by this. So, streams are flowing everywhere, blocked by mindfulness. Sati te sang nivarana. I tell you, the restraints of streams, they are locked out by wisdom. So the idea here, it's a little bit difficult to pass this verse out in the Pali, but the basic idea is that mindfulness keeps the streams of desire in the world checked, but they are not fully locked out or fully blocked until wisdom comes into play as well. That wisdom and mindfulness, and that which is name and form, and question, tell me of this, where does this all sit? So one of the, an interesting question, because he's asking about even these things which we regard as being good, wisdom, mindfulness. I mean, how could you not want more of these things, and yet even these things, do they come to an end? And what about name and form? Nama-rupa, again, a Upanishadic term referring to Nama being the literally name or the conceptual side of life, the concepts, the mentality. Nama-rupa being the physical dimension, things which are perceived as having physical properties. This question which you've asked, I've answered you with the cessation of consciousness, vinyanasa nirodhana. And again, in this directly contradicting the teachings of Yajnavalkya in the Upanishad, the Brihadaranyika Upanishad, who saw the vinyana as the higher self, which was the ultimate purpose of practice. So the Buddha is making a direct contradiction with Upanishadic doctrine. So in Upanishadic doctrine, the basic idea is that this world of manifestations that we live in is like all of the rivers, which each have their individual names and their individual forms. But when all of those rivers flow down, they merge and meld into the great ocean. And that great ocean is the infinite mass of vinyana, of consciousness. And that is your true self. So this is the Upanishadic doctrine. Now interestingly enough, if you know a little bit about science and ecology and so on, then you know, well, that's actually not really how the world works. There isn't a kind of infinite ocean that just somehow receives the water. But actually, it's a cycle and the ocean evaporates, becomes rain, rains on the land, and then the water flows down back into the ocean. And it's a cycle where all of these things are mutually dependent on each other. And that, in fact, is the Buddha's teachings. So the Buddha's teachings is a naturalistic teaching. It talks about cycles and patterns, talks about dependency, talks about how things relate to each other. So it doesn't talk about this idea that there's some kind of absolute consciousness that exists outside of reality, outside of conventional reality, I should say. Now the last one, those who have assessed the teaching. So Aditya is just sort of throwing this term here, sankhata dhamma. That is an important term. We find this a number of times. It has, you can see from the look up there, that agreed on, reckoned, so-called named. Okay. This doesn't mean a kind of being at the end. So our little Pali compound breaker upper, it's not quite working correctly here. It should be sankhata dhamma, say. But anyway, doesn't get it always right. It's about maybe 80, 85% correct. Anyway, the first word is sankhata, agreed on, reckoned, so-called or named. So one of the basic ideas of sankhata or sankha is that sankha is like the reckoning or the calculation of things. So think about, say, business, right? So keeping your books in business. So you know exactly what is there, how many it's such and such an item, how much it costs and all of those things. And if you look at Indian philosophies, they're actually very business-like a lot of the time. They are very interested in categorizing things, making sure everything's placed on the shelf in the right spot. And so this idea that somehow you can survey the world and reckon everything and categorize everything and know where everything is and how it fits in its place. And so this is what that sense of sankha is. So sankha is having assessed it or having reckoned the teaching. So then how do they behave? Not greedy for sensual pleasures, their mind would be unclouded, skilled in all things. A mendicant would wander mind forms. Satobhikubharibhajeti. Now this particular verse, this last verse is also found in another sutta, which I will just briefly share with you. And that is the bhuta sutta. So the Buddha said to Sariputta, this was said in the way to the beyond in the questions of Ajita. So notice how when it's referring, this is not, so there's plenty of places in the suttas where it will just like quote a line or a verse or a passage or something like that. But in these cases, one of the reasons why it's so interesting with the parayana vagga and also the ataka vagga is that they're actually quoted and referred to by name. So this was said in the way to the beyond in the questions of Ajita. There are those who have assessed the teaching and many kinds of trainees here. Tell me about their behavior, good sir, when asked for you are alert. How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement when he said this, the saiputta kept silent? Okay, very dramatic. All right, very dramatic moment here. You know, you can imagine the Buddha's there. So he put to the greatest disciple that most accomplished in wisdom. The Buddha's asking him for the meaning of the particular verse and he just sits there and says nothing. Very dramatic little moment here. Second time the third time and then the Buddha says saiputta, do you see that this has come to be Bhutamidam sahri putta pasi. So the that this has come to be when he hears this Bhutamidam, the idea of Bhutta has the contains the idea of something which has been produced or generated or condition. So when saiputta heard this, then it seems that he recognized the the framework in which the Buddha was asking the question. So this first so it's interesting that the saiputta could have answered by simply quoting from the original passage or paraphrasing the original passage. Whereas in fact, the answer he gives here is not very similar to the answer that the Buddha gives in the Ajita Panha itself. But the Buddha was asking for a particular framing of it here and it wasn't until he knew what framing the Buddha wanted that he was able to answer. So one who sees with right wisdom that this has come to be seeing this one is practicing for deluge disillusionment and so on. One who's truly sees this as practicing for disillusionment. So what the basic point here is one is practicing what you've seen what has come to be. In other words, you've seen how things are conditioned, how things are produced or in other words, you've seen dependent origination. In this way, you are trainee, that is to say you're a stream enter a once returner or a non returner. And what is one who has assessed the teaching one truly sees. So seeing that one is freed but not grasping. Okay, so one is freed but one practicing to be freed by not grasping is a trainee. One who has been freed is one who's assessed the teaching in other words and arahan. And so this is the explanation that S I put to get here. So one of the things about that which is I think interesting is that it shows us that in the earliest time in the Sangha that we weren't just getting like one interpretation of everything. There was there were it's an open question. It could have been answered in many ways. Of course, it doesn't mean that it could be answered in any way. But it does mean that there was a creativity and a contextual awareness in how people were approaching these things. All right. So this is the Adjita manavapanha. Let's move ahead to the next one and I will share my screen again. Again you're most welcome to because we because it's a relatively short session. We won't really have time for a question session. But please do feel free to pop any questions into the chat. I am keeping an eye on that. Hopefully I won't. Okay. So Venerable Tisameteya appears here. The Maiteya here is not has no relation to Maiteya or otherwise known as Maitreya the Buddha in the future. Although in the Buddhist tradition there were a variety of stories that sort of connected the two and so on but in the Sator itself there's no such connection. Tisameteya begins with a very powerful question. Who is content here in the world? God has sent us it all. Okay. I was reading that this morning. It really struck me. Who is content? Like we always want something don't we? Always want something. And even when we come to spiritual life it seems that we're still driven by desire, by ego. And yet to find someone who is truly content, such a powerful thing. Who has no disturbances, ingita, perturbations perhaps. Who having known both ends is not stuck in the middle. Who do they say is a great man? Who here has escaped the seamstress? Very terse questions and the Buddha gives equally terse answers here leading the spiritual life among sensual pleasures rid of craving ever mindful. A mendicant who after assessing is quenched that's who has no disturbances. So it seems that the first part of that verse probably refers to contentment. It's not entirely clear exactly how that's, how they are related but in any case one who's quenched is one who has no ingita. So that idea of ingita or eja is one that we will come back to in subsequent questions. That sage having known both ends is not stuck in the middle. He is a great man I declare he has escaped the seamstress here. Ko idha siddh bani mat chaga. So the Buddha doesn't give too much detail in the answer there which leaves that up to a bit of interpretation. And in fact this is another sutta where we find that interpretation was discussed in the suttas. Let's have a look at how that happened. So the Buddhas are in Benares and after the meal several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them. Reverence this was said by the Buddha in the way to the beyond in the questions of Mettia, the sage has known both ends and is not stuck in the middle. He is a great man I declare he has escaped the seamstress here. But what is one end? What is the second end? What is the middle and who is the seamstress? All good questions. So one of them said contact is one end, the origin of contact is the second end, the cessation of contact is the middle and craving is the seamstress. For craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another. Darnha yinang sibbati tasa taseva bhava sa nibbatiya. Interesting right? I find that it's a really powerful simile that idea of the seamstress reminds me as a fan of mythology it reminds me of Penelope sitting weaving in the castle of Odysseus as he was wandering around the world. So many that kind of idea of that kind of binding and tying together of the world, very kind of potent set of imagery. And then a variety of other questions. The past is one end, the future is the second end, the present is the middle and craving is the seamstress. Okay, it doesn't seem like a bad explanation as well right? Past so as sort of letting go of the past, the future, letting go even, maje manta nalimbati right? So remember not even getting stuck in the middle. Seems reasonable. Another one said pleasant feeling is one end, painful feeling is the second end, neutral feeling is the middle and craving is the seamstress. Also okay seems reasonable right? Sometimes it's like that you hear a bunch of different explanations they all seem to make sense. Another one says name is one, inform is the second end, consciousness is the middle and craving is the seamstress. Another one said the six interior sense fields are one end, the six exterior sense fields are the second end, consciousness is the middle, craving is the seamstress. Identity is one end, the origin of identity is the second end, the cessation of identity is the middle, craving is the seamstress. Not sure about that one. Okay, I mean I'll allow it but the Buddha is saying don't be attached to the middle and says if the cessation of identity is the middle, I don't know. Sounds a bit sus but anyway we'll leave it at that. So one of the Mandakins said to the senior Mandakins, each of us has spoken from the heart. Come, Reverends, let's go to the Buddha and inform him about this. As he answers so we'll remember it. Yes Reverends. So notice that they all have these different interpretations but and I know this might come as a shock to you but they don't get angry and upset with each other because they have a different opinion. I know, amazing right? It's almost as if they were kind of mature adults who understood that other people can have different opinions and that was kind of okay. So they went to the Buddha and asked him who has spoken well? Kastan lukobhande subhaasitan. Mandakins, you've all spoken well in a way. Oh, okay. So they've all given answers which are in line with Dhamma and they've all given answers which make sense in terms of the context. However, this is what I was referring to in the way to beyond in the questions of Maitaya when I said the sage has known both ends and is not stuck in the middle. He's a great man. I declare his escape the seamstress here. Listen and play a close attention. I will speak. The Buddha said this contact is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle and craving is the seamstress. But craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another. That's how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life. So the first answer was right. They're all pretty good. But one answer was right. You got to imagine that the monk who was like the first answer was like was feeling pretty pleased with themselves at that moment. But you know and again it's to me this is really interesting because you see something of the life of these teachings within the community. Something people would discuss. They would have interpretations. They would be back and forth. And so there was this these teachings are never something. They're not they're not just a dead letter but they are something which was alive and engaged with in the community itself. And that to me is one of the really kind of powerful things about the the suttas. So they're not they're not just sort of dead textbooks but they're they're regarded with this sense of urgency. I mean we've already seen how urgently the 16 Brahmins really wanted to know and the effort they put into coming to the Buddha. All right let us continue. The seamstress. Yeah so Debbie just mentioned that she was interested in the idea of a stream here. So this was the streams that are flowing everywhere. So this is not the stream as in stream entry but there the stream is used as a synonym for the senses and the stream of activity that we're getting through these senses. And mentioned says so which stitches a life. I don't know if each stitch is a life but it's more like like there's this idea in the suttas you have this idea of a Bhava neti which is like a Bhava is a life and a neti is like a like a cord or something that binds you know. So you have this almost like a way that things are being woven and bound together like a create a tapestry that tells a story. It's really it's really kind of um it's a really evocative set of imagery. Anyway let us move on. Next one. So the punty question punika these questions are also quoted elsewhere in the Nikayas. We'll briefly check those as well. To the imperturbable the seer of the roots said Venerable Punika I have come in need with a question ati panhena agama. What grounds have hermits and men aristocrats and Brahmins here in the world performed so many sacrifices to the gods? I ask you blessed one please tell me this. Whatever hermits and men replied the Buddha aristocrats and Brahmins here in the world have performed so many different sacrifices to the gods all performed sacrifices bound to old age hoping for some state of existence. So the sacrifice such an important part of not just Brahmanical religion but religion all around the world. It's so strange the sacrifice is one of the strangest things in all of human culture. We get so used to the idea that it's normal that you forget that it's deeply weird. Remember that in the opening narrative that Bhavari had just performed a sacrifice. So and again this is a kind of a challenging answer that the Buddha is giving here. So he's even Bhavari even their own teacher was attached or concerned with old age and that's why he did this. As to those hermits and men said Venerable Punika and aristocrats and Brahmins here in the world who performed so many different sacrifices to the gods being diligent in the methods of sacrifice have they crossed over rebirth and old age good sir. I ask you blessed one please tell me this. Okay so one of the if you look in the the Brahmanical scriptures they have a lot of detail about exactly the right way to do sacrifices. This is what they say meaning when he's talking about being diligent in the methods of sacrifice. The Buddha again giving a fairly uncompromising answer hoping invoking praying and worshiping by the Buddha. They pray for pleasure derived from profit devoted to sacrifice besotted by rebirth. They've not crossed over rebirth and old age I declare. Okay so that that say this is this that's a hard one to hear it's a hard one to hear hoping I see something right. I gave a whole talk last Friday about hoping and about how we should all lose hope and some some people really didn't like it I can't imagine why anyway. And so these are all this idea that that prayer and these religious activities are bound up with wanting to get something. And here you find perhaps the earliest or one of the earliest ideas of expressions of the idea that you can only make money if you've got money. And so they're saying you're playing for pleasure praying for praying for pleasure derived from profit but each a lab. So the point here is that only those who are wealthy can perform sacrifices only if you've got staff can you just throw it away. And that's a really interesting perspective and a very kind of true perspective that at one of the sociological roles of sacrifice has always been to burn off excess wealth and to distribute wealth with with others. And so only if you have things can you get things so this whole round of sacrifice even though it seems that sacrifice is about giving things up actually the whole thing is bound up with this cycle of acquisition and profiting. If those sacrifice if those devoted to sacrifice said Venerable Purnika have not by sacrificing crossed over rebirth and old age then who exactly in the world of gods and humans has crossed over rebirth and old age good sir. I ask you blessed one please tell me this having assessed the world high and low and again this word Sankaya which we're finding it finding commonly used in these passages there is nothing in the world that disturbs them. Yes, in the town not to go in to go care peaceful and clouded untroubled with no need for hope they've crossed over rebirth and old age I declare a tarry so jati jati broomy. So again this idea of the word I'm translating heroes hope is asa which is probably the closest Pali word there's no there's no word that's really exactly the same as the English word for hope but asa is probably the closest. So and again the idea here is that the spiritual practice that we do is based on who we are now and what we can realize and what can we can become now and so in Buddhist idea we're not doing something because we have hope of a better world in the future but because we have knowledge that if we do the right thing now that we create a better world right now. So when I'm saying that we should be losing hope I'm not saying that we should embrace despair although despair isn't such a bogeyman you know just a little bit of despair is okay this is like a just like a it's like a touch you know not too much and keeps things keep things spicy anyway so this sutta again is referred to in the sutta this is in Angodran Nikaya 3.32 but I won't in this case I won't read 3.32 even though it's actually really interesting so I'll actually I'll just paste it in the chat for you but otherwise we won't get through enough sutta's is really interesting sutta but I'd like to move ahead let's look at the next one okay I'm going to skip over the the next one and I'm going to go straight to 5.6 the questions of Dhotaka again I'm a bit concerned of running out of time I ask you blessed one please tell me this I long for your voice great hermit after hearing your message I shall train myself for quenching well then be keen alert replied the Buddha and mindful right here after hearing this message go on and train yourself for quenching I see in the world of gods and humans a brahman travelling with nothing therefore I bow to you all seer release me Sakyun from my doubts notice that this description of a brahman travelling with nothing is very similar to the description of bhavari in the opening narrative where he was also said to be a brahman with nothing who's embarking on a journey very powerful verse response by the Buddha here I'm not able to release anyone in the world who has doubts about it but when you understand the best of teachings you shall cross this flood so this idea that the Buddha said he cannot liberate anybody cannot get them enlightened but he can only show them the path and here obviously a very famous kind of idea we find a lot in modern Buddhism and often quoted idea and this is one of the main sources for that idea again it's a radical notion and it's a radical gesture of humility to say it's not up to him it's not up to the Buddha to do this it's up to you to practice then you shall cross this flood teach me brahman out of compassion the principle of seclusion so that I may understand I wish to practice right here peaceful independent as unimpeded space I shall extol that peace for you replied the Buddha that is apparent in the present not relying on tradition get paid down there and the aneti how having understood that one who lives mindfully may cross over clinging in the world now rejoice great hermit in that supreme peace having understood which one who lives mindfully may cross over clinging in the world once you've understood that everything replied the Buddha you are aware of in the world above below or round between is a snare don't crave for life after life even a tongue we did fast and go to look at him so I will leave Dodeca's questions for now I'll come to the perceive a question this is a more famous set of questions and I'll dwell on this a little bit longer alone and independent or Succion I'm not able to cross the great flood so you can see how this one's almost like drawing on the narrative from the previous one the Buddha said well I can't actually not able to bring you across myself you have to do it you have to do the work and here we perceive the same but I can't do it alone you expect me to cross this great flood tell me a support Osear depending on which I may cross this flood tell me a support there must be something I can use it's going to help our Ramanang bruhi mindfully contemplating nothingness reply the Buddha depending on the perception there is nothing across the flood giving up sensual pleasures refraining from chatter what day and night for the ending of craving hakin chanyang pekkmano sati ma nati dini sai tarrasu ogaan so here the Buddha is directly teaching the dimension of nothingness and so many of you are probably familiar in the Buddhism we have the eightfold path the aspect of the eightfold path right Samadhi the right Samadhi is usually defined as the four jhanas and in addition to the four I hesitate to say ordinary but the four standard jhanas we have the four formless attainments which are sort of consequent to that the infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness and neither perception nor non-perception now when the Buddha practiced with his former teachers Alara Kalama and Uduka Rama Putta he famously developed the third of those the base of nothingness with Alara Kalama and the base of neither the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception with Uduka Rama Putta and so there seems to be with these Brahmins this idea of nothingness is a kind of recurring theme and here it's you know it's quite explicit that this is what the Buddha is talking about and so it seems that these are sort of a circle of Brahmins or a school of Brahmins who were perhaps affiliated with Alara Kalama or at the very least were practicing in a similar way and who were used to practicing this particular state remember again in the introduction it said that all of these Brahmins were experienced meditators so depending on the perception there is nothing across the flood giving up so again the Buddha doesn't want to like he doesn't want to get them to throw out the things that are valuable from their tradition they've already been doing this very powerful meditation so he wants them to continue that giving up sensual pleasures refraining from kachata watch day and night for the ending of craving and it's freed so it will see if it goes on to ask some very interesting questions so one is free of sensual desire depending on nothingness all else left behind hit money freed in the ultimate liberation of perception would they remain there without traveling on so his use of language here is very precise so the the dimension of nothingness is the ultimate liberation of perception why because the next stage is neither perception nor non-perception so nothingness is the highest liberation of perception it's a very subtle point but he's using language in a very precise way here would they remain there without traveling on now the exact interpretation of this is not entirely obvious and you could read it a number of ways but i think what it's referring to here is the non-returner it says you're saber sukame su yo vita rago so he's got rid of any attachment or desire to sensual pleasures so this describe well describes the non-returner who is practicing that dimension of nothingness then they get reborn in that realm would they remain there without traveling on in other words you know would they go to that realm would they then get reborn somewhere else after that what happens what happens to them one now the buddha again the buddha's answer is quite interesting the buddha said one free of sensual desire depending on nothingness all left behind freed in the ultimate liberation of perception they would remain there without traveling on hmm tiktaeya su datta if they were to remain there without traveling on even for many years oh siya right so traditionally it says that rebirth in such realm would last for 60,000 eons so when it says for many years it's not kidding even for many years and growing cool right there for freed with the consciousness of such a one pass away so here again we're talking about these kind of very very exalted states and and ideas and yet we perceive it keeps on keeps on pushing keeps on asking so if you are a non-returner you get reborn in that realm of nothingness and then grow cool in other words become an arahant in that realm with the consciousness of such a one pass away as a flame tossed by a gust of wind replied the buddha comes to an end and no longer counts so too a sage freed from mental phenomena comes to an end and no longer counts and the again very evocative imagery very powerful memorable imagery here notice again the use of the word sankha as in to reckon or to count or to measure or to add up something right so they come to an end atang paleti the freed from mental phenomena again the use of language is very precise here nama kaya is a term for the cluster or complex of mental qualities now remember that this is talking about a person who has been reborn in that realm of formlessness where physical properties have already been left behind so they only have that nama kaya to be freed from still or perceiver is not satisfied i've got to admit i like or perceiver like i like i i i i someone who can start where he started and then just keep on pushing for questions this is how you get the really good stuff one who has come to an end do they not exist atangatou so udawah so natie dahwe sasity arugo or are they eternally well because that would be the normal idea in the bromannical circles that they are not the only way to be able to be in our circles that they get reborn in that realm and they stay there for eternity please sage answer me clearly for you truly understand this matter one who's come and the buddha gives a very enigmatic answer one who's come to an end it cannot be measured replied the buddha they have nothing by which one might describe them when all things have been eradicated eradicated too are all ways of speech one who's come to an end cannot be measured atangatasana bromannamati literally if you translate this literally overly literally it'll be something like for one who's come to an end there is no measure that by which one might describe them does not exist for them so they have escaped concepts and the words to describe that are not found so the idea here is that our we we describe things by the features or the particulars of those those properties which they have but somebody who's in that state there is nothing by which one might describe them ending with a slightly bit moment there so here are some of the questions in the parayana waga and i'll just check a couple of the things you've said in the comments here before we wrap up years ago buddhist news said that abandon all you hope or hope you who entered the year could be thought of a buddhist idea i told that someone who was a teacher who didn't like it i mean it's interesting i find it do find it interesting because hope is an idea that is it's a christian idea faith hope and charity and now look the fact that it's the christian idea doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it but it's interesting that it really isn't in buddhism you know and it's again it's not it's not just like there is this thing that that isn't there but it's that the buddha talked about things in quite a different way you know it's not like there's something lacking from buddhism but the way that buddha approached things and we've seen this you know even in in in these questions you know what is there that is dit ped hame what is there that is apparent in this very life yeah something that i don't have to rely on tradition i don't have to long for something i don't have to produce something in the future and so this idea to me this is much more powerful and i i do believe you know i hear because i hear this a lot here especially with when it comes to climate change you know people say we have to have hope we have to have hope and it always seems a bit desperate to me it seems a bit fearful to me and i'm so i'm always like well i don't know i gave up hope years ago i'm doing all right it's okay oh great you know have good days and bad days but it's okay and you don't get so afraid of it hope's just a feeling it's just an emotion it's just an idea it's okay get up in the morning what are you going to do what are you still going to live a good life it's the important thing what are we going to how are we going to live our life today i don't know what's going to happen maybe something good will happen i don't know anyway let me just um last question here from julienne is the counter here active one who counts or passive one who is counted or plays on both uh senses it's interesting it seems to sort of play on both those senses because it it has that certainly it's somebody who has counted has reckoned right so somebody who has understood fully and assessed what's happening but also it's the idea that once you've done that that you step out of that realm of reckoning so that you can yourself no longer be counted it's interesting i mean obviously we could go in a lot more detail into the specific nuances of that i'm just wanting to sort of draw attention to the prominent role that that concept of sangha plays within these texts so i think we've reached pretty much the end again today uh look it's been great uh sharing some time with you to talk about the parayana waga hopefully um you know we can uh convey something of the sense of the the passages something of the role that it has within buddhism but also to me you know it's something i really love and so i'm trying to hopefully convey something of my uh you know my love and my devotion for these these sort of because i think i think these are really uh precious uh precious moments that have been passed down to us and you know i still find that i come back to these after so many years and find so much that's valuable and worthwhile in them so hopefully this has been something that's been interesting and uplifting for you all i wish you the best and i look forward to speaking with you again next week
