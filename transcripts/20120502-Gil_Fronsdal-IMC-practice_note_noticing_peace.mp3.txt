Practice Note: Noticing Peace

For the rest of this morning i t may be interes ting for you 
to consider noticing something that may be unfamiliar . 
Many years ago , I was told about some young people 
from New York City who were taken to the tropical 
jungles of Central America to go on  nature walks . Their 
guide had grown up in the jungle , and would point to 
birds and animals that were standing out in highlight for 
him. The young people couldn’t see anything . They 
couldn’t see the parrots or other  birds becaus e they 
were unfamiliar  with the jungle , and didn’t know how to 
see or to pick out different things  because it was such a 
foreign world for them . I’m sure that if you took 
teenagers who grew up in the jungle and brought them 
to New York City , they too would miss a lot  of things 
that New York teen agers would pick up . 
 
There is a lot going on , and we’re not necessarily 
picking up everything that’s happening to us or t hat’s  
going on . Our attention is  a selective process based on 
what we’ve been conditioned to pay attention to  – or 
what we think is important to pay attention to . Because 
of that selective process,  we might be missing things.  
 It’s possible, perhaps, to train yourself to notice t hings 
that you’ve been missing or  not paying much attention 
to. These things are  there, wa iting for you to notice  
them . What I’d like to suggest for today is that you 
notice peace .  
 
There’s always peace here and now. There’s always 
peacefulness, tranquility,  or calmne ss here, even if 
you’re not familiar with noticing it . If what you’re familiar 
with noticing is your concerns, thoug hts, emotions, 
stories , and dramas of your life, then you might not 
notice that in the cracks of those  thoughts , in the 
background of your emotional life , there’s peace.  
 
In this next period, you might  see if you can peacefully 
notice the peace that’s here . See how you would notice 
the peace, or what you’d notice as peaceful. Perhaps, 
you mi ght feel it externally . Maybe you feel  that this 
room is peaceful , even though there are  leaf blowers 
outside.  
 
There are  many areas  where you can look for peace . 
But the place that make s the most difference to find 
peace, stillness, calm, tranquility  is in your mind , your 
heart , or your awareness .  
 
Is there something in t he nature of being aware, in the 
nature of the heart or the mind itself, that no matter how 
agitated you might actually be ( not to deny the a gitation , or to override  it, or push it away), there in the midst of it , 
around it, above it , containing it,  is some kind of peace 
you can taste or get a sense of ? Maybe not 
dramatically, but a little  bit. 
 
I hope you enjoy your morning. Thank you.
