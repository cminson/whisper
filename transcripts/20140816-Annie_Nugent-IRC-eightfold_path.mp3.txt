a wandering ascetic who was looking for the Buddha and he was told in which
direction to walk. The Buddha had gone down that road and along that way and so
this wandering ascetic who really wanted to meet the Buddha and to practice with
him duly went on his way in search of the Buddha and it got to nightfall. He
hadn't found the body yet and so he came to a lodging place and spent the night
there and then the next morning went off on his way again in search of the
Buddha. But as it happened the Buddha was staying at that same lodging place
that he was staying at and because he didn't know what the Buddha looked
like he missed the opportunity to actually see him, meet him, receive
teachings from him and probably missed the opportunity to come to full
realization which is what many people did when they met the Buddha and
practiced with him. Many of them became fully liberated. So I've always found
this story deeply compassion evoking. It's kind of a touching story. Someone is
right there in the presence of the Buddha but because he doesn't know what he
looks like he just bypasses him and gets up the next morning and goes off on
his way. And so we can equate this story with the noble eightfold path in as
much as it too is right here under our noses available to us at any moment. But
if we don't know how to see it, we don't know how to find it, we don't know how to
look for it, we then don't engage it, therefore we don't actually do the
practice and therefore we don't come to know true happiness. So we can see that
there are parallels here with this story about the wandering ascetic. So if the
question is how do I live in the world without suffering or how do I live in
the world with deepening true happiness, the answer is by means of the eightfold
path. This is the path to freedom and it's also a way of life. So we want to
check for ourselves. Are we living the wrong path of attachment or are we
living the path with these eight steps, the eightfold path, that will ultimately
take us towards freedom from suffering. So let's just remind ourselves what
these eight facets, these eight steps of the eightfold path are too, and it's not
that we have to go and remember all of them. Just before I even say what they
are, as long as we can remember to connect with now, here and now with
mindfulness, all of the other steps will begin to show themselves. So the first
part of the eightfold path is the wisdom aspect of the practice, its right
view, it's sometimes called right understanding, then the second step is
right intention. Then the next section of the eightfold path is called conduct,
our conduct in the world, wise conduct, and this is right or wise speech, right
or wise action, right or wise livelihood. And then the last part of this
eightfold path is called the concentration aspect of the path, and
it's right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Now you've heard me
use the word right or wise, some people don't like the word right. Others prefer
the word wise, so it's your choice, you can use wise or right whatever speaks to
you in a more meaningful way. So we're taught by the Buddha to walk this, it's
called the middle path, it's the path of neither extreme, sometimes it's called the
right way to live, it's also called the path of non-grasping, and remember this
was his very first teaching to us, this was his revelatory understanding that he
had on the night of his enlightenment. It's about living the path of neither
extreme, not overindulging on the sense pleasures on the one hand, nor
living from a life of depriving ourselves in a harsh and extreme way on the
other, hence it's called the middle path. That is not so easy for us to do. Have
you ever stood in line in the meal line here, they do this sometimes at IMS, and
then you get up to the food counter and there's a little sign that says
moderation please, that's when there's the most delicious of dishes and we want
to take a lot, and there's this little sign moderation please, moderation is
hard for us, I certainly know it's hard for me, I tend to be one of those all or
nothing kind of people, so the middle path was you know something quite new, who
would have thought you know the middle way. It wasn't easy for the Buddha either,
it was very very hard for him to come to this realization, he learned through
trial and error, remember he went from a life of extreme indulgence, then he
flipped to the other side of extreme deprivation, and he worked in this way
for quite a long time nearly starving himself to death, just could not figure
out how to come to this place of true and lasting happiness, freedom from
suffering, but he didn't give up, he didn't give up, he kept looking, he kept
looking until he came to this realization, oh it's about the middle path, the
middle way, so that's not overexertion on the one hand and not laxness on the
other, not overindulgence and pleasure on the one hand and pain on the other, not
greed on the one hand or aversion on the other, so we're talking about
equanimity here too, the non-reactive mind, so after he came to his deep
realization related to this middle path, he taught as we know I spoke about the
Four Noble Truths the other night and just briefly mentioned the last one, the
Eightfold Path, and his instruction to us related to this Eightfold Path, the
Fourth Noble Truth was that it needs to be developed, so developed is the
operative word, we are not perfectly aware, perfectly mindful yet, we're still
working with it, so we need to bring that into the equation that it is a path, it
is a practice path, it's a way, it's a way of life towards true happiness and so
we begin just at a pace that really works for us to walk this path, there's no
rush, just a moment at a time, so it's a very organic unfolding, meeting
experience for each of us at a pace that works for us, he also said that this
path, he described it as the safe and good path to be traveled joyfully, that
was his phrase, the safe and good path to be traveled joyfully, so it's a safe
path in as much as we are not going to harm ourselves or anybody else if we
walk on this path and therefore it's good and we travel it joyfully because it
brings us a growing freedom from suffering and happiness with each step
of the path as we come to understand it and live it, so this evening this
afternoon we're going to discuss this Eightfold Path primarily from the
perspective of how we can live it and develop it in our daily lives, seeing it
manifest in our daily lives, the retreat comes to an end tomorrow and how can we
continue the practice as we go forth into the future days and into our lives, so
we're going to look at some of the very ordinary occasions that could arise for
any of us in our daily lives and seeing how the Eightfold Path can manifest
bringing it to the forefront of consciousness for us in these ordinary
mundane kind of experiences, of course there's not only mundane ordinary
experiences that we come across, sometimes too there are shocking kind of
cataclysmic events that happen in the world and we want to see too how we can
meet these, respond to these, incorporating the Eightfold Path, seeing how
our practice shows itself in some of the extreme events in life too, so the
challenge for us once we go back out into the world is how to actually do this
for ourselves, it's kind of the billion dollar question on our lips as we walk
out of the door here, how do we do this? We've been talking about mindfulness of
there is a body and we've been talking about the mind, what's happening in the
mind, seeing how the mind relates, this is what we've got, the mind and the body
and this is what we take with us when we go back out into the world, so this is
what we practice with, whatever comes up for us related to this body and this
mind, so let's take a look and see how these eight facets of this Eightfold
Path, how we can see how they actually unfold, how do they flow, initially very
initially they work in somewhat of a linear way and then after a very short
period they begin to show themselves together, interwoven, intertwined you
can say, Bhikkhu Bodhi the well-known translator, he's a monastic and American
monastic who's translated many of the the suttas, he gives a very useful example
related to the Eightfold Path in as much as he says there are like eight
thinner strands of a thicker piece of rope, they're intertwined and they make
up a much thicker rope which is therefore strong and sturdy and that's how we
work with this Eightfold Path, they arise together to allow for a deepening
wisdom to arise within us and then in addition to that they also work in a
kind of a cyclical and spiraling kind of a way, so we as we refine wisdom we live
with it out in the world, that deepens our connection to the practice, purifies
our conduct, so there it allows for us to have a deeper connection with the
practice, therefore a deeper wisdom arises for us and so it goes on like the
spiraling around and around at the same time all eight facets are arising at
once in each moment as the spiral moves around and around in our life, so from the
outset from the very start as we begin the practice we start with the first
step of right view, now the two phases to right view and at first the very first
thing that we come to see in right view is that we're here practicing the dharma
because we've understood that the worldly life that we've lived it up until
now hasn't actually delivered, something is just not working for us, so we turn
our minds, we turn towards the dharma to realign ourselves with a different way
of living, to live in a wiser more wholesome way of life and so we return
and connect towards the dharma, we're aligning ourselves with the bodhis
teachings of living wholesome living wisely in the world, so this is the
very first moments you could say of wisdom that okay let me see if I can
live life from a different perspective, a wiser perspective, so you could say we
have the wisdom to want to wake up, that's the amount of wisdom that we have,
we may not be even be waking up yet but we have that wisdom to know that this is
the direction that we want to go in and we want to begin the practice, so we come
to a retreat such as this and then we hear about the eightfold path and the
importance of living wisely and we're then told about the precepts, so that's
the very first thing that we did on this retreat, we began to work with the
with the precepts and so this is living from a place of wisely not harming
others, why? because we're told initially, well that if we take a look we'll see
that actions dependent on their intention, dependent on the motivation
behind them, they bring results, so if we act from a place of wholesomeness the
result will be a wholesome one, if we act from a place of unwholesomeness
well the result is going to be one of suffering, so the more we begin to
understand this relationship of cause and effect, that's what we're
understanding here, when you harm another being it harms ourselves and it harms
them, so there is a karmic result, okay this is about the law of karma or the
law of cause and effect, that's what we're learning about right away when we
talk about non-harming, so this is the first part of right view, we want to
wake up and the first part of waking up is learning that our actions are very
important because they have a result, they lead to either happiness or
suffering, so then with this understanding in mind, this first little
part of wisdom, what very naturally comes forth from that, very naturally our
aspiration is towards intending to live in that way, not so, we intend to live in
a wholesome way, so that intention is the next facet of the eightfold path, with
the right view we now intend to live in a wholesome way, so very naturally that
right intention begins to show itself, and so we intend towards non-harming
which now brings us to the next facet of the conduct, conduct in our life and
conduct includes right speech, right action and right livelihood, so wisdom
we wisely understand that to not harm another living being will bring wholesome
results for us, right, we see that wholesome results for us and out of
seeing that we thus intend to put that into practice and that's the next facet
of this eightfold path, bringing into our actions in the world kindness in how we
speak, kindness in how we act, kindness in how we conduct ourselves in our
livelihood, not coming from a place of greed, not coming from a place of
grasping, not coming from a place of holding on, but coming from a place of
generosity of heart, letting go and renunciation, that quality of giving
over rather than grasping, and we're also coming from a place of wisely, wisely
being present as opposed to being lost in a world of dreams and not being
present, now we're intending to connect with the present moment, we're intending
to be here to connect wisely with each moment, so what really have we been
talking about in these moments, we're talking about the defilements of non
greed, non hatred and non delusion, this is where our intention leads us,
intending towards not coming from a place of greed, not coming from a place of
aversion, and not coming from a place of delusion in how we live out in the
world, so it's from kindness and compassion, generosity and giving and
renunciation and wisdom, and in order for us to do this, what does it take, how do
we actually put these wholesome qualities into action, it takes effort, it takes
right effort bringing us to the next facet of the the eightfold path, the
concentration part, it includes right effort, it includes right mindfulness, and
it includes right concentration, now let's talk just a little bit about this
right concentration, what do we mean, we can simply use the phrase non
distractedness of mind, the undistracted mind, living in a world, living in the
world from a place of being present and not fragmented and distracted in our
actions in the world, so this is the fullness of the eightfold path here,
wisdom, with wisdom we intend to live rightly in terms of our conduct in the
world, and in order to do that it takes right effort to be mindful and to be not
distracted so that we can act in a way a wholesome way, not fragmented, so we can
say that our life can be propelled from a place of kindness, generosity and
presence of mind, this is how we would live the eightfold path, propelled from
a place of kindness and compassion, generosity of heart and presence of
mind, that's non delusion, whilst on retreat though we can see it's somewhat
doable isn't it, we're here under very specialized conditions, we're not talking
so that helps the mind to be more settled, it's a much more simplified way of
living, so we're not really distracted by the outside things that go on, where
we're secluded here, so we've got a fair amount of support that's just in that
that aspect, then you've got the teachings, the instructions, you've got the
like-minded group that you're working with, the Sangha here, all of this is a
tremendous support for us, so working with the eightfold path which is what
we've been working with, this is it's been fairly doable, we're encouraged to
notice when the mind grasps at something, just notice the arising of the
wanting mind, don't need to grasp it, you'll see that it's an impermanent
arising, notice when aversion arises, you don't need to act on it and push it
away, that you act on the aversion, just notice it's another arising, so we're
encouraged to put the instructions into practice and slowly we begin to get an
inkling that if we just are sitting with awareness, we'll notice these things
arising and we see that they actually change, they are impermanent, so we get
little tastes of spaciousness of mind, ease of mind and as we practice a little
more in this kind of a setting, we can possibly come to the deeper aspects of
wisdom, that's the second part of wisdom or the deeper aspect of right view and
that is where we see at a much deeper level the unsatisfactory, transitory,
impersonal nature of experience, but out in the world it's not so easy, it's not
so easy because we're caught up in the busyness of our daily lives, we don't
have the support that we have here and it's very seductive, the world out there
is really very very seductive, so we need to be our own guide, we really need to be
our own guide and at first it can be very difficult, so we may fall off the
eightfold path for a chunk of time and that's how it is for quite a
while, we forget what we're doing, we may lose it for a period of time and then
oh yes, maybe we come and do another retreat or we go to a group or we speak
to someone and we're reminded, yeah mindfulness, this is how you work with
the practice and so more and more as we work with the practice, we don't fall
off the path quite so much more and more we can work more steadily with the path
until we are on the path full-time you could say, but at first as I say it
isn't that easy, a little while ago I went to a garden center to buy myself a
rose, a creeper for my garden and so I was talking to the attendant, the
nursery assistant there, garden center assistant and I said well what do you do,
how do you plant the rose and what should I do and I said I've heard that
you know the roses are very tricky in terms of the rose beetles, they eat the
plant and I'm not sure you know, she said oh that's not a problem, all you do is
when you see these little creeps, little bugs, you catch them and then you put
them between your two thumbs like nails like this and then
you just squash them and so I'm listening to this, I'm saying oh I don't
think I'll do that, but thank you, this is what I'm meaning by the lack
of support that we get out in the world, not everybody works with the precepts
and the precepts are front and foremost for us in our practice because
they incorporate all of the facets of the Eightfold Path, they're there, so this
is what I'm showing you, reminding you that it isn't quite so easy out
there, it's for us to be our own guide and also our guide is mindfulness, that
becomes more and more our place of refuge, mindfulness is our guardian, it
guards us against acting in ways like that, especially if we carry those
precepts, conducting ourselves from a place of care and kindness towards
ourselves and others, that will come into our mind immediately when somebody
says, oh that's how you take care of those bugs on your plant, we know,
actually know, I don't do that, so ultimately as we continue with the
practice we really know that mindfulness, right mindfulness, mindfulness is our
refuge, that is our place of support, our guide in the practice, so we more and
more we also learn that there's no separation in the practice, it's not
like well now I'm on retreat and then I go home and I'm off and then that's
something else, it's really a different form of practice but it is all the
practice, what we have to remind ourselves about though is that there is no quick
fix, it is not a matter of right, I've got it and that's how it is, it's helpful
to remember and we can glean from the Buddha that he didn't give up, he kept
on working with it, he didn't have a path, he didn't have a teacher or a guide
or an instruction, he had no clue but he kept on working, looking, working, falling
down, picking himself up and beginning again, going in this direction and he
saw that didn't work, picked himself up and then went in that direction, so this
is what we can take from him, incorporating this willingness not to
give up, just to keep working with it, a step at a time, a step at a time, the
Buddha gave what I found a very helpful little example related to this, just
staying with it, just staying with it, he gave the example of a hen sitting on
her eggs, so he says that if a hen sits on her eggs and wishes for them to not
hatch, she sits on her eggs and wishes for them to not hatch, no matter how much
she might wish for these eggs to not hatch, they are going to hatch, why?
Because the conditions for eggs to hatch are going to be there, she is sitting on
her eggs, so then he turns it around and says similarly, if that hen does not sit
on those eggs and she wishes for those chicks to hatch, those eggs to hatch, no
matter how much she wishes for those eggs to hatch, they are not going to hatch,
why? Because the conditions for those eggs to hatch are not there, she's not
sitting on those eggs, then he says similarly for us as we work with the
eightfold path, if we do not work with the eightfold path or you could say work
with the Dharma, you could simply say the Dharma, the Dharma is the eightfold
path, if you do not work with the Dharma, no matter how much you wish for
happiness, for growing happiness, no matter how much you wish to not suffer, we
are going to suffer, why? Because the conditions for not suffering are not
there, we are not practicing the Dharma, so we're going to be perpetuating our
unskillful actions, thus we're not going to come to know freedom from suffering
or a deepening happiness and then he says, if we do work with the Dharma, if we do
practice the Dharma, if we do practice the eightfold path, even if we don't wish
for freedom from suffering, even if we don't wish for happiness, even if we
don't want it, I'm not interested in happiness, I'm just interested in practicing
the Dharma, even if you don't want it, I'm sorry to say you are going to come to
know freedom from suffering, it's going to happen, why? Because the conditions for
freedom from suffering are going to be there, we're going to be sitting on our
eggs you could say, we're going to be working with the eightfold path, now when
those chicks hatch, we don't know, the hen isn't sitting there for waiting for
the 21 days, she's just sitting, she's just sitting, they're going to hatch
sometime, that's the same with us for our practice, so there is no quick fix, as
long as we're willing to sit on those eight eggs, as long as we're willing to
work with this eightfold path or the Dharma, it is going to bring results, so
that is very good news, we don't have to worry about the results happening,
they're going to happen, they're going to happen, that is very very good news for
us, it's just that it's not a quick fix, so we can't keep looking at our watch,
it's just a matter of staying with it, staying with it, staying with it, not
understanding this, not understanding that it is not a quick fix, is a great
hindrance for many people in the practice, many many people, why? Because we go
out into the world and we hear how to work with the practice and we think yes,
I'm motivated, right, I'm going to work with it, so we go home and we work with a
particular situation, nothing happens, there isn't a particular shift that we
think should be happening, so we're looking for some kind of result over
here that we think is going to be the result, our agenda, our idea of what the
result is, the result is happening but it's over here, but we're looking in the
wrong place, and so what's happening? We're feeling despondent and so this
doesn't work and we'll want to give up, so we want to take great care of what our
our idea of the results of practice is, because it's not about floating around in
a state of bliss, it's not that at all, really what begins to happen more and
more is that we learn to meet all of the same situations, they will still arise,
all of the same situations arise, we learn to meet them from a place of
non-reactivity and wisdom and compassion, rather than the usual, I don't want this
to happen, I want it to be this way, that's where the shift happens in the
mind, not with the actual events that are coming about, so when we have a love of
the Dharma, then we want to practice it, especially when we do hear that it does
bring freedom and when we actually see it in our own practice, just incrementally
in little moments, in small, small events, as a child of, oh about 11 or maybe
12 years old or so, I remember traveling in my grandfather's car, my
mother and I, it was just me and my mother, she didn't have a car, we didn't, she was
we were very poor and so my grandfather would come and pick us up and take us
wherever we needed to go, and so I was often sitting in the back of the car and
you know what a child does, peers out of the big back window and just watches the
events going by and I remember driving down one road and there I would see some
men like moving some shrub and bushes and some rocks and stones and clearing
some kind of a space and several months later we're going down the same road and
there I'd see them still there out in this space but now there was some kind
of a road and some kind of a structure, you know, concrete blocks up in the air
and then months or maybe even longer, maybe even years later, drive down that
same area and my gosh here was a huge highway and then I would reflect, gosh
that's incredible, there was nothing there at first, it was just bush and shrub
and rocks and then they cleared that and how did they know that actually one
day there would be this highway? This too is what happens for us in the
Eightfold Path, we can liken it to the Eightfold Path in as much as we can see
that these builders of this road had this view, this vision, this direction that
they were going in, they were clearing this path with a view to building this
highway which was going to support a growing infrastructure for the city
and so similarly we can see that this is what it is for us with the Eightfold
Path, when we have a right view to head in this direction, this is where I'm
headed, then we develop a momentum in that direction and before we know it
there is the Eightfold Highway and we've got this momentum, we're on it and it is
pulling us along towards a deepening happiness in our lives, that's to say we
are developing it, we're putting the Buddha's instructions into practice, we
are developing it, this is the practice happening for us. A key factor of course
with this Eightfold Path is that one, they're all very important, all
of these facets are very important but the one that comes forth, kind of in
the forefront you could say is, and I spoke about it last night, right effort.
Now there are many other words that I've selected to put under the umbrella you
can say of right effort because right effort can be a little bit of a harsh
phrase for us sometimes. We could also use the word zeal, we could use the word
enthusiasm, we could use the word courage, we could use the word order and we
could also use the word tending, when you're tending to the moment it's got a
loving quality to it as well, there's effort in it and it's got a loving
quality when you tend to the moment. So these are all words that I've
put in a kind of an umbrella under a right effort. I also use the word
passion, when we're passionate about the Dharma then we engage it. So when we
bring right effort into play it's really just meaning that we're not giving up on
the practice, we're not giving up on connecting with our life and seeing how
we can use whatever comes to us to wake up, not some special experiences but the
ones that are there, whatever those events are, can we use those. So in the
same way that when a young child doesn't do something, they forget to do
something or they get something wrong, we don't reprimand a young child, do we?
We encourage them, we say come on let's try again, let's see if we can do it, we
kind of encourage them in a loving way, this is how we work with ourselves, we
put our arm around ourselves you could say, encouraging ourselves to reconnect,
give it a go, see if you can work with this situation and this is how we do it
for ourselves. It's not about judging ourselves, if we're, you know, we haven't
engaged the moment or we've completely forgotten about being mindful in a
particular situation, it's not about judging ourselves because in the moment
that we've woken up, now we can rejoice, now we're present, now we can see, wait a
minute, wait, wait, wait, what's happened, okay, how can I change the tone of my voice
in this moment and see if I can connect with this person, you know, bringing
right effort into play in any given moment. So we use the full range of
experiences, the full, the full selection. For example, relationships with people,
sometimes for some of us it can be very hard for us to say no, people ask us to
do things and yes, I'll do it, yes, yes, I'll do it, I'll do that. This was a
situation in my own life where this is many years ago where I knew that I would
always say yes, I'll do it, yes, I'll do it and then I decided I'm gonna really see
if I can next time say, you know, I'm sorry but I'm not gonna be able to do
this. Lo and behold, I'm asked to do something a little while later and what
yes, I'll do that for you. Oh and then I got home and wait a minute, I was really
working with this. This is something I'm genuinely working with. What did I do?
It took a lot of courage, I called the person up, that was very hard for me to
do, to meet that situation, to rise to the occasion and say, you know, I'm sorry, I
said I would be able to do this but actually I'm not going to be able to do
it. I'm really working with this aspect of practice in my life and I'm going to
have to turn you down here. It was very hard for me but just having to do this
particularly difficult action, talk to this person, for future events I learned
to say, hang on, I'll take a look, I don't know yet. So it gave me some breathing
space. So this is how this is bringing right mindfulness, right effort, right
intention, intending to respond to the moment rightfully. Sometimes we get it
wrong, well then we try again. This is how we work with the practice in our
lives. I'm sure there's similar situations, maybe not the same, but
similar things that you can see in your own life that will help us to see that
we can rise to the occasion, to break these very deep tendencies that we
habitually act out on. Because it might be the opposite, perhaps we're the kind
of person that always says no and then we see that and then wait a minute, can I
have the courage to say yes, okay I'll do that for you. So it works both ways. A
different sort of situation, again many years ago, I was bitten by a dog about
15 years ago now. It took me completely by surprise, a German shepherd bit me on
the butt. It wasn't a really bad bite but enough for me to get a real fright
and consequently I was frightened of dogs. And so for many years I avoided any, even
a little dog, I avoided dogs to the best of my ability or I'd push somebody else
in front of me and I'd hide behind them and you know they would just you know
take the little poodle, they would face the poodle. That was, it was that you
know frightening for me. So this went on for quite a few years and I improved a
little bit, I improved a little bit. Several years after that, eight, nine
years or so, I noticed that I would do a little bit of running, you know about 15
minutes, sometimes 20 minutes and I'd notice that I'd run a certain distance
and then turn around and double back and oh well that was my run. But then I
noticed that very conveniently where I was doubling back was where two dogs
lived and the real reason I was telling myself I had run enough now was
actually there were those two dogs there and I didn't want to face them. And so I
thought well they're not mean dogs, I know them, they're not ferocious dogs and
I've been you know avoiding for quite a long time now, wisely at first because we
have to support ourselves, we're conditioned by a dog bite, but now after
10 years or something, now I have to take a look. Could this be apathy? You know
the lack of wise effort or not? Yeah I think it is, I think so. So now I was
gonna bring in wise courage, courage, another word for effort. Now it takes
courage, all right I'm gonna see if I can do this. And so I ran and I did and I
could feel the fear, there was fear there, but I let that fear be there. That was
porous, it had space, it wasn't solid, just breathed through it and ran and then
saw them and oh and just did my run and doubled back and I survived to tell the
tale. It was okay and it was confidence building and you know oh it's okay. This
is what I'm suggesting that we stretch our limitations a little bit, wisely. We
don't want to be foolish about it, we want to wisely stretch it and see can I
meet this difficult situation. So this is bringing the Eightfold Path into play
right here. It's not some sort of holy situation that the Eightfold Path comes
into play. It's right here in the midst of a dog bite. That's where the practice
is. How are we, what's the attitude of mind? Are we bringing wise intention to
not continue to feed the apathy and the fooling myself? A kind of
dishonesty in a way. I don't need to go there. So this is what we're talking
about, really taking a look at what's going on in the mind related to all of
these situations. At any moment in our life, at any moment we can stop and take
a look what's happening in the mind now. We've been practicing that here. We can
see what, what is it? How am I relating to this situation? Whether we're in a
traffic jam, whether we're in the department store, whether we're talking
to the neighbor. Is there aversion in the mind? Is there impatience in the mind? Is
there a wanting in the mind? Take a look. Notice what's going on. If we notice the
aversion or wanting in the mind, let it be there and continue with the
conversation or the action without acting on the aversion or the wanting. I
mentioned this a similar situation I think last night, but a different one
related to seeing the wanting in the mind and watching how transformation very
naturally comes about when we see it. Quite a long time ago I was eating a big
sandwich, maybe a chicken and you know lots of stuff on it and I know it had
mayonnaise on it. It's a big sandwich and I was really hungry and I was at home on
my own. So there was nobody watching me and so I took a big bite out of this. I
was really hungry. A big bite out of the sandwich and I'm eating, eating, eating.
And then I saw the wanting, like the greed in the mind that the juices were
salivating, like running down the chin. I could literally feel this and you know
like the leaning in. In that moment, in the noticing it, I didn't change anything
stayed with it and then just watched what happened because then you feel the
contractedness. I may have given an example similar to this. I could feel the
contractedness and the pain of the greed of the leaning in and with that
wisdom very naturally comes in when we're bringing right effort, right
mindfulness and non-distractedness of mind to the situation. Wisdom arises.
Wisdom says, oh, take your time. You've got all day to eat the sandwich. Relax.
There's no need, you know, the greed subsides. The greed subsides and in its
place is balance of mind to actually truly taste that sandwich. Let it come to
me rather than trying to, you know, climb into it from that place of greed. Now
watch this. These are, I'm sure, I'll bet you that some of you do this when you
eat a hamburger or sandwich or something. Watch that quality arise and wisdom can
arise right in that moment. The eightfold path is in the midst of that bite of
that sandwich or hamburger. So you can watch the energy in the body too. Watch
it. You'll feel how it all builds up and contracts and rushing, rushing out in the
world. Notice the rushing and see it, see that it's tiring and it takes a lot of
energy and just in seeing it wisdom will come in and we'll relax and settle back
and we don't need to slow down but rushing that quality of rushing need
not be included in it. And so we're intending to come from a place of
balance in the mind and settle the backness in the mind and this is bringing
the eightfold path into view. If we think that none of these things are the
practice, if we think that oh this isn't the practice, the practice is sitting
here on the cushion, then we're not going to bother to engage these kind of
ordinary worldly events. But that sadly will mean that we're not engaging the
eightfold path, that we're not using our life to bring the Dharma to the floor. So
any situation, any situation whatsoever. We could also be just have a very
spacious life with very little to do in it. So there may be no rushing in our
life but we're sitting with plenty of time on our hands. Is it possible to just
sit and be and just look at the four walls? Just look and be. I do that
sometimes in my living room. It's not that I think okay now I've got time now
I'm gonna sit down and meditate. No, we can do that too. That can be an event
that we importantly do incorporate into our life but it could just be sitting
like being in this room and just looking, seeing, being. Just being with nothing
special, no event, just being. That too is bringing the eightfold path into to
play. As we practice in this way we begin to have some success. We really do see
that it's possible for us, we see we're less reactive, we're see we're less
leaning into the moment, we see there fewer moments of aversion there and we
become more confident that it is possible for us. Out of this there's a growing
sense of self-respect for us, for ourselves in our lives. There's less
remorse. Why? Because we haven't been so reactive. We're not acting from a place
of aversion towards others because we're responding more kindly in our speech and
our actions towards others. There's more generosity of heart and so on that I
mentioned earlier. Those dark old habitual tendencies of mind are not there as
much as they used to be. Maybe they're still there but less than they used to
be and so sometimes we can hardly recognize this new person. We don't live
from those dark painful states of mind quite so much and wow the practice
actually does work. So we begin to have a bit of a spring in our step. There is a
little bit more joyfulness in our life because we can see that we're not dragged
around by the nose of the defilements you can say. We're not thrown off center in
life quite so much so there is more balance of mind. There is more equanimity.
That's to say there's more right effort, right mindfulness, right non-distractedness
of mind brings about the sense of ease, balance and centeredness in our lives and
so we begin to take ourselves a little bit more lightly. We're not trying to get
rid of our foibles and get rid of our idiosyncrasies. They're there and we see
them but we take them more lightly. We can laugh at ourselves a little bit, be a
little bit more playful with ourselves. When people say things about us we don't
get so hurt perhaps, we can laugh with them or we just say oh is that what you
think oh that's interesting. I don't feel that way but we're not taking what
other people think about us on board and so there's much more spaciousness of
heart. Quite a number of years ago I was at home going on for a walk with a
colleague of mine and I was telling her that oh I had been exhausted the previous
evening and you know I got into bed at around 11 o'clock at night and had a
large bag of chips with me and so I munched away at some of these chips and
then I just put them down at the side of the bed and I went to sleep and she
turned to me and she said oh that's disgusting and I turned to her and I
chuckled and I said yes it is kind of disgusting isn't it but I wasn't taking
it personally. It wasn't like oh gosh what a bad person I've been for doing
this it was just yeah yeah it is a bit disgusting but that's all that's not
something I do on a regular basis by the way. What was what I experienced in
this moment was the deeper part of right of you that is not taking it personally
that is it wasn't about me, mine, myself, I am bad or I am anywhere it was just oh
is that what you think well that's the way it is there's the spaciousness of
heart when we don't take things personally. There's much more space in the
mind we're not we haven't got this you know the sense of smallness of me and
who I am there's just this interchange this flow of conversation and events
without it being a separation of you saying this about me and now I'm heard
that you have said this to me that isn't in the equation because there's this
real connecting with not taking it personally which is the deeper aspect
of right view showing itself. So there's a huge relief that we begin to feel we're
not struggling with ourselves so much we're not struggling with others and
the part really does become vital and playful and joyous for us. Then too in
those dramatic cataclysmic events that can happen in the world from time to
time we feel those two from a place of deep resonance and also equanimity when
the Eightfold Path has been strengthened within us.
For example at the event of 9-11 you know that that was a cataclysmic event
for for us here the destruction of the Twin Towers. I remember that and I'm
sure we all do I remember that event as though it happened yesterday. On that day
I'd had a plan to go for a swim at the local lake and so I thought well alright
I'll keep that that date I had with this friend of mine she had asked if we
could go and I remember we were driving in a car towards this lake and I saw an
electrician he was up at the top of his ladder working on the the electricity
pole and the thought arose for me as I saw this gosh the moments in life never
stop no matter what these cataclysmic things the tidal waves the earthquakes
the war whatever happens in life these things happen and life still goes on we
can't say life stop this is too much it there's another moment it continues it
just continues to unfold this understanding comes from a place of
deep equanimity related to the events in life we see that we're not in control
of what happens in life in the round of samsara as I mentioned a few days ago
the round of birth and death anything can have unfold things arise and cease in
ways that we are not in control of what we can do through a deepening wisdom
through working with the eightfold path is meet them with equanimity meet them
from a place of looking on at life with a growing understanding that this is how
life is within that equanimity is a deeply resonant heart of compassion it
understands how life is that all of us on the planet all of us in the world
really want to be happy yet we act in ways that are so hurtful and painful to
each other and so sometimes we cannot fathom why things like this happen in
the world and why they're done yet we can hold it from this place of equanimity
so we learn through working with the eightfold path to hold all of life the
pains and the sorrows that come to us in life and the beauty and the joy that
comes to us in life we learn to hold it all with a very wide heart an infinitely
wide heart that comes from this deep understanding of the truth of the way
life is so we can see that it's a path with a tremendous amount of heart it is
not a kind of a clinical practice at all it's very alive and heartfelt so the
more we practice with the Dharma the eightfold path in our lives our wisdom
strengthens and deepens and more and more we see on a very infinitesimal
level you could say the transituriness of life that life is hurtling by at such
a pace it's moving by so quickly and we get to feel this and a very sensitized
level that you can say and we begin to see more clearly that a life immersed in
the kind of the sense pleasures you could say the worldly activities we see
more and more that actually we were at a deeper level we know that they are not
satisfying to us we're here as human beings practicing them and living them
and participating in all of the the fun things in life but ultimately we know
that that is not where true happiness lies and so at times in our life we
get this intuitive sense that we need to bring ourselves to a place like this
once more we know we need to steep ourselves in seclusion and so once
again we bring ourselves to a place like this that is silent it is renunciate
somewhat in lifestyle we're here together with like-minded people and
having practiced out in the world we now have a much more steady mind because
we're living with less remorse because we've been living from wholesomeness out
in the world so we come again to a place of seclusion like this and the mind
becomes still and quiet much more quickly than it did in the past and out of
that we get to see a deeper layer of wisdom a much deeper layer of the true
nature of the way things are they impermanent unsatisfactory impersonal
nature and once again we go back out into the world and we live from this place
of deeper understanding once more refining the precepts and our connection
with life in a much deeper way and so it goes on this is the cyclical kind of
path that I was talking about that we take it goes around and around ever
refining our practice both here on retreat and then out in the world so we
include both the formal practice here and our practice out in the world
connecting with family and people out in the world and so just to remind us of
the way the Buddha described this eightfold path so we can travel that
knowing that it's a safe path and it's a good path and can we all travel it
joyfully knowing that it takes us to true and lasting happiness so let's sit
quietly together for a moment or two
