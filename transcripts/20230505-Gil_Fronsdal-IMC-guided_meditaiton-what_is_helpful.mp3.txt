 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Warm greetings. A cloudy, kind of a little bit wet California here. We've had an unseasonable amount of light rain through the week and clouds and cool weather. And I like it quite a bit, maybe from my leftover from my native town in Norway where I was born, Bergen, where it rains quite a bit, cloudy quite a bit. So, my friends, there are many motivations for meditating, but the ones that Buddhism somehow holds up as central to the Buddhist enterprise could all be subsumed under the expression benefit. We are meditating, practicing Buddhism to benefit. And who are we benefiting? Everyone. The Buddha said that a wise person is concerned with benefiting oneself, benefiting others, benefiting self and others, and benefiting the whole world. And it's kind of comprehensive. There's not choosing one or the other to just benefit yourself, just benefit others, but there's an integrated whole that is the domain of wise reflection and wise motivation. And if your motivation is to serve others, to benefit others, when we sit down to meditate, one of the important ways to prepare ourselves to bring benefits to the world is in fact to benefit ourselves. It's important to do this. It's important to shed layers of reactivity and stress that we carry. It's important to shed layers of clinging and attachments and anxieties that we carry. Because the more these are shed, the more that not only are we available to benefit the world, but our very way of being in the world is beneficial. When people experience someone who is calm, who seems to have no fear, someone who has no obstacles to their kindness and their love, and we benefit ourselves and bring forth what's beautiful within us, those qualities then are available for the world as well. So when we sit down to meditate, one of the options you have, and which we'll do today, is to orient the meditation from the very beginning with the question, what is beneficial for me here and now? Let's not just go ahead and just meditate in rote, just meditate because I'm supposed to, and I have a technique to do, I have a way of practicing, and I'll just do it because that's what I do. But rather, it takes some time at the beginning to reflect, how am I right now? What's happening for me? And given what's happening, how I am, what would be beneficial? What would be a beneficial way to meditate? And that there's layers of answering that question. One is to ask the questions in the point of view of your body. What's a beneficial way to establish a posture for meditation? Maybe there's a deep need for rest and relaxation. Maybe there's a deep need for strength. Maybe there's a deep need for to kind of really feel embodied and feel connected here in this body, so that with the body we can feel connected to the world around us. And different postures support these different things. So to be a little bit conscious about what posture is useful for you, in small ways it might change from day to day. And then you might ask, what is beneficial for your heart? Maybe it's taking time to acknowledge what's happening emotionally and with you, not to overlook it or try to barrel through it. Maybe there's some tender loving care of some kind that your inner life could benefit from, metta, kindness, compassion. Maybe your heart needs some honesty. Sometimes truth telling is the greatest need that sometimes we have to really acknowledge how we are, what's happening in a clear and unapologetic way. Just, oh, it's like this. Something in the heart can settle sometimes when our situation, ourselves are hardly acknowledged. Even to acknowledge that I'm afraid or acknowledge I'm depressed or acknowledge that I'm angry, that's a truth telling that's needed. If we want to kind of start bringing benefit to ourselves and to the world, because when it's honest then we can kind of find our way with it. What's beneficial for this mind? Maybe how we meditate is important for the mind and the heart to not strive or not measure or not compare ourselves to, maybe it's helpful to be fearless when we meditate or uninterruptible, undiscouragable, even if there's discouragement or to not let it get in the way, even though there's anxiety, not let it get in the way. So sitting here and just asking yourself, what way of meditating right now would be beneficial? Given everything. And then meditating that way or starting that way, sometimes starting for just a few minutes and then settling into the basic meditation practice, sometimes just doing it longer. But what happens to you when you begin your meditation with a question, what would be beneficial right now in how to meditate and then proceed from there? Now be quiet now as we meditate for the next minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we come to the end of the sitting, to take in the idea that if we want to benefit others spiritually or dharmically, we can do more if we have benefited ourselves spiritually or dharmically. And if we don't want to benefit others, but only ourselves, if we're ourselves in the Dharma spiritually, we will somehow or other benefit others anyway. Our own spiritual benefit, our own dharmic benefit is integrally linked to the welfare of others. For one thing, the more we dharmically benefit ourselves, spiritually benefit ourselves, the more we know what dharmic benefit can be. The more we can be attuned to that possibility for other people as well. Maybe people more than material help or emotional help, what goes deepest into the heart is dharmic help, spiritual help, something that touches a home inside of us that's deeper than our emotional life or cognitive life. And may it be that as we navigate and walk this path of the Dharma, may it be that we do so to benefit ourselves, to benefit others, to benefit self and others, and to benefit the whole world. May our deepening connection to the dharmic life, to the spiritual life be a support for the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings know freedom, freedom from suffering and find it in their hearts. Thank you.
