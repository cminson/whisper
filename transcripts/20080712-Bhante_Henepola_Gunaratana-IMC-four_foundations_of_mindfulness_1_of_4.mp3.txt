Good morning everybody. 
We are nuns, friends. 
I'm very pleased to be here this morning. 
Yesterday morning somebody asked, where is this Sati Center? And somebody said, there's no place. 
People meet in various places. 
Then I said, the Sati Center is here. 
And we go wherever we go. 
We go with the Sati Center. 
Wherever we go, Sati Center is there. 
So we all came with our Sati Centers to learn more about Sati. 
I was told to talk about Sati, Satifarthana Sutra, four foundations of mindfulness. 
Is there anybody in this crowd who doesn't know this Sutra? You see, they're, oh no, really? And you? No. 
You know it. 
I thought there may not be even one who does not know the Sutra. 
And I found couple of them. 
Anyway, this is the manual of Buddhist meditation. 
This Sutra is so big. 
One is called Mahasatifarthana Sutra that we find in Dighanikaya. 
And there is another Satifarthana Sutra in Madhyamini Kaya. 
That's called just Satifarthana. 
And there is another Sutra in also Madhyamini Kaya called Kaya Gata Sati Sutra. 
And there is a part of Mahasatifarthana in Madhyamini Kaya. 
That is called Ana Paana Sati Sutra. 
And there is another Sutra in Angutrini Kaya called Girimananda Sutra. 
And in all these sutras we find very direct meditation systems. 
Sometimes people might wonder why Buddha has given so many discourses on the same subject. 
Why didn't he stick with the Mahasatifarthana Sutra which encompasses everything? Why did he break them into groups or separate classes, sections? Well, the answer is very simple. 
Buddha lived for 45 years to teach Dhamma and he met thousands of people with different background, different mentality, different state of spiritual growth and different attitude. 
Just as he saw, soon after he attained enlightenment, he saw the whole universe like a pond full of lotus. 
Some are right at the bottom but some have come few inches above the mud and some have come halfway in the lake and some have come to the top and waiting to get one first ray of sun to open. 
These four, remember, these four is very important. 
These four stages are categorized as in Pali, Ugrthitanya, Vipantitanya, Nayya, Padaparama. 
Ugrthitanya means ones who are at the very first touch with the Dhamma, very first touch with the Dhamma, attains full enlightenment. 
They are like those lotus buds that are out of water, waiting for the sun to open. 
And the second is called Vipantitanya. 
They are halfway. 
They need more time to grow, mature, to open. 
Similarly, some people need more explanation, description, guidance, instructions, time to attain liberation. 
And the third lotus are few inches above water and they are like the people of that type are called Nayya. 
Nayya is the kind of people who need more explanation, detailed explanation, guiding them, holding by hand, dragging them, giving a lot of encouragement, a lot of discussions, a lot of reading and so forth. 
And the last is called Padaparama. 
Padaparama is a very interesting word. 
Pada means words, parama means the best. 
And their best is words. 
Most people, 99. 
99% are Padaparamas. 
They like to read and read and read. 
They say, I have read 20, 50, 100 Buddhist books. 
Have they learned anything? They read Buddhist books like novels, newspapers, trash, and read once and throw away. 
And afterward they get tired of reading. 
They even don't want to read Buddhist books. 
But they like words. 
Then read another book. 
Go to this meditation center, sati center, spirit center, so forth, so forth. 
Go to various places and do what is called meditation, you know, window shopping. 
And never learn anything, never stop, never practice. 
And they can linger in samsara forever. 
They are called Padaparamas. 
Now, how can I relate this to this different, different Sati Bhattanas, different discourses on meditation? When people met, when Buddha met people, he found this kind of people. 
Some are ready to attain enlightenment right away, like Mahayadāruchīriya. 
He needed only very few words right away he attained enlightenment. 
Others like Śāyārputta's disciples. 
Buddha took sometimes to explain things. 
Even Śāyārputta could not explain. 
And others like Chanda, who needed even reprimanding and punishment for him to attain, like Venerable ānanda, until Buddha touched away, he did not attain enlightenment. 
And others are rest of us. 
We also might have seen the Buddha, heard him giving dhamma sermons and never listened to it, never learned. 
And we are still in samsara. 
So, Buddha met all these different people and gave different discourses for them to practice. 
Mahāsati Bhattāna is the one who delivered to people of all kind of mentalities, giving very broad basis of meditation instructions. 
And others, he gave to people who are not yet mature, who are more mature, and he gave short discourses and so forth. 
So, he changed this meditation techniques, subjects according to the people's needs. 
That's why there are so many meditation, discourses on meditation. 
Now, with this introduction to Mahāsati Bhattāna, let me go to the sutra. 
Mahāsati Bhattāna sutra we learn by heart before we learn the language, before we learn to speak. 
How? Our parents, every morning when they wake up, when we wake up, we hear our parents reciting something in Pāli. 
On full moon days, new moon days, quarter moon days, they observe the precepts going to the temple, and they take us with them. 
We don't know anything, but they put us on their lap, who made us sit next to them, and they recite Mahāsati Bhattāna. 
So, we learn it. 
We never knew one word of it, but we memorized it. 
I learned to put it into practice because of one very unforgettable traumatic experience in my life. 
I have mentioned it in my book. 
I had a photographic memory that in fifteen minutes I could read two hundred, three hundred pages book, and memorized everything, every punctuation mark, every word, page number, everything stuck in my mind. 
When I was twenty, I lost everything because I felt sick. 
My parents, teachers, friends did everything, including vudus, to treat me. 
Nothing worked. 
Then, since I had memorized Mahāsati Bhattāna sutra, I thought perhaps if I meditated, I might regain at least some of my lost memory. 
Meditation at that time in my age, in Sri Lanka, was a taboo. 
Young monks of my age would never meditate. 
If they see me meditating, they would teach me to death. 
Until they went to bed, four of us were in our room, and until the other three went to bed, I stayed. 
Then everybody went to bed, turned on the lamp, and I sat there and meditated. 
Believe me, after about six months' meditation, I began to feel something happening in my nerves, like little insects crawling under my skin. 
Then I thought, this may be something good happening to me. 
I went on meditating, after about a year. 
When I lost my memory, you believe me, you may not believe me. 
When I lost my memory, before I losing memory, I had learned Singhalis, Pāli, Sanskrit, Tamil, English, and Hindi alphabet, six languages. 
I was fluent in these languages. 
But when I lost my memory, I could not recognize alphabet of any of these languages. 
If I saw somebody, and five minutes later, if he goes away and comes back five minutes later, I would not recognize him. 
Under these conditions, I started medicating, using Mahāsādhīpa Tānasuta method. 
Then after about one year, I began to recognize alphabet. 
And people, and slowly my memory came back. 
This encouraged me to continue my meditation, and since then I have been meditating. 
The more I meditated, the deeper my understanding became, and deeper was my understanding of Mahāsādhīpa Tānasuta. 
And therefore I like all these words I mentioned to encourage you to go back to Mahāsādhīpa Tānasuta. 
If you don't have a teacher, meditation teacher, don't worry. 
Read Mahāsādhīpa Tānasuta word by word, line by line, not like reading a novel. 
Read, pause, think, and meditate. 
Now let me begin Sūtra again. 
I keep coming back to Sūtra and again going out of it. 
All this I do for you to remember how vigilant you should be, how diligent you should be in learning and practicing this particular discourse. 
And it begins with ākāyaṇu, āyāṁ vikre, maṅgo, sattānaṁ viṣuddhya. 
It begins with giving the purpose of meditation, purpose of meditation, purpose in this discourse, instruction given in the discourse. 
There are five whole purposes, five purposes. 
What are the five purposes? Sattānaṁ viṣuddhya for the purification of beings. 
Because our minds are full of garbage, full of dirt, it needs lot of detergent. 
And this very strong detergent is recommended in this discourse to cleanse the mind. 
Why do we want to start with that? Because that is the source, that is the beginning of all our problems and all our liberation from problems. 
So we have to begin with cleaning the mind. 
That is exactly what you read in the Dhammapada, the first stanza in the Dhammapada. 
This is what you read. 
And this is what we learn in entire Buddhist teaching. 
First is sattit-paryodapana, purification of mind. 
That is the first purpose. 
You can understand why we want to purify our mind, because all our problems, stems, begins from the mind. 
The mind is the root of all our problems. 
We can never find root of problems anywhere outside our mind. 
Although we may try to point finger at someone somewhere, but the problems really are in our mind. 
Second, soka-paridavanam samatikamaya, to overcome sorrow and lamentation. 
We practice mindfulness, meditation. 
Third purpose is dukkha-domanasanam atthangamaya, to overcome suffering and disappointment, dispassion. 
Fourth purpose is to tread nyayasa-dhigamaya, to tread, to follow the right path. 
What is the right path? The noble, late, old path, nyayasa-dhigamaya. 
The last purpose and the supreme purpose of all is nibbana-sattikiriaya, to attain nibbana. 
Just remember, the goal of this meditation is very lofty goal. 
The best goal, the highest goal. 
You may think, well, it is not possible within this life, let it happen somewhere in future. 
Even if you think that you cannot attain in this life, the practice will not become meaningless. 
You at least become good for the parama, who will attain enlightenment in future, in samsara. 
But the practice will never become meaningless. 
When you aim at the best, if you don't gain the best, you can at least gain the second best. 
If not third best, you gain something if you aim at the best. 
So, remember, these are the five-four purposes, five purposes of this practice. 
And for that, Buddha said, ekayano-yam-vekri-makgo. 
For this, attaining these five purposes, there is one direct method. 
There are many ways of attaining many things. 
They will lead you to many places. 
If you want to go to heaven, you don't have to practice meditation, if you want to go to heaven. 
All you have to do is three things. 
Satchangbhane, Nekutgeya, Dajjapasmimpya-yajito etehiti tane, Gacchedevan, Santikeya. 
If you want to go to heaven, you don't have to be a Buddhist. 
You don't have to be a meditator. 
You can be a Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, anybody, even without religion. 
You can go to heaven. 
All you have to do is to do only three things. 
What are the three? Satchangbhane, speak the truth. 
Nekutgeya, don't get angry. 
Dajjapasmimpya-yajito, give whatever you can when asked. 
These are the three things. 
Who cannot speak the truth? If you don't like to speak the truth, anybody can speak the truth. 
Who cannot stay without getting angry? Anybody can practice that. 
And who cannot give? You don't have to be a Buddhist to give. 
Anybody can give. 
If you practice these three things, you can go to heaven. 
Practicing this meditation is. 
. 
. 
One of the five purposes of practicing meditation is not going to heaven. 
It is not included in these five purposes. 
So don't meditate to go to heaven. 
There is a way to go to heaven and there is a way to go to Nibbana. 
To go to Nibbana, there is only one direct method. 
To overcome sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, there is only one method. 
To follow the right path, there is only one method. 
To purify the mind, there is only one method. 
The second liberation, total liberation, without any residues left behind, is meditation. 
That's what Buddha did, and that's what he achieved. 
So without any hesitation, reservation, Buddha mentioned at the very outset, this is the only direct method, other methods are indirect, you can, perhaps, through samsaric lot of practice, you may, but this is the direct method. 
And in this direct method, Buddha mentioned many things. 
One is to practice, become mindful of the four foundations. 
They are called four foundations. 
And in the Buddha's discourse, I lie also to mention the reason why it is called sutra. 
These are called sutras. 
Why they are called sutras? Sutra is like a sutra that you stick, you use sutra to stick. 
It is called sutra because it has the thread going from the beginning to the end, one message. 
Just like sutra has the beginning, middle and end. 
Buddha's discourses have these three segments, three points, beginning, middle and end. 
At the beginning, Buddha was so, so profound and enlightened that he gives the summary at the beginning. 
When you write good articles, paper, book, dissertation and so forth, at the very beginning you give the summary, introduction. 
You can get the rough idea of what is going to discuss. 
So he gave the, at the very beginning he gave the summary. 
In the summary he mentioned what is going to happen in the discourse. 
And he said there is only one direct method to achieve these five purposes. 
And then he outlined this five, this method in four steps. 
He said, let me translate that into English. 
Be mindful of the mind in the mind. 
Be mindful of the body in the body. 
With diligence to overcome, with intention of reducing greed and hatred. 
And satima vinayya, satima with mindfulness, vinayya having discipline, having restrain. 
Abhidhya domanastam loki, the covetousness and grief in the world. 
That is, be mindful of the body with the intention of overcoming covetousness and anger or disappointment in the world. 
Now this is really very important sentence. 
It is what I call loaded with meaning and given in compressed form. 
So we have to decompress it to understand the meaning of this sentence. 
First he said, khaya anupasivirati, be mindful of the body in the body. 
Now here we hear the word body twice. 
Be mindful of the body in the body. 
What does it mean? And to make it more meaningful, this particular section is divided into six categories. 
To make it meaningful. 
So each part is a body in the body. 
For example, he began with the breathing. 
We will explain all these things in detail later on at this introductory talk. 
I want to give this as an example. 
It started with the breathing. 
Breathing is a body. 
It is called breath body according to anapa and sati sutta, mindfulness of breathing discourse. 
And according to chula vedala sutta, chula vedala is a discourse delivered by a bhikkhuni dhammadhina to her ex-husband, hisakha. 
And in these places the breath is explained as a body. 
It is called breath body. 
So breath body is in the body. 
So be mindful of this breath body which is in the body. 
That is why the word be mindful of the body in the body is mentioned. 
Similarly, be mindful of the feelings in feelings. 
Be mindful of the feelings in the feelings one is plural, one is singular. 
Why is that? Because we pick one feeling at a time among many feelings. 
We don't deliberately pick. 
When feeling arises, if one feeling is more strong, stronger, more powerful, that naturally drags our mind into that feeling. 
And then become mindful of that feeling. 
We cannot be mindful of all the feelings. 
One feeling at a time becomes more conspicuous than other feelings. 
When it is more conspicuous, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, mind naturally is attracted to it, dragged into it, goes there, and be mindful of that. 
Then chitta, chitta-anupase vairati, be mindful of the mind in the mind. 
Similarly, we cannot become mindful of the mind, but we can be mindful of the mind when we notice contents of the mind. 
And there are various things happening in the mind. 
When one particular contents, one particular thing arises in the mind, then we become mindful of that in that mind. 
That also we will explain if we have time today. 
And the fourth is to be mindful of the dhammas, mindful of dhamma, in the dhammas. 
Dhamma also are many. 
When one particular dhamma arises, be mindful of that dhamma at that time. 
For this reason, Buddha used this particular sentence in each foundation of mindfulness. 
That sounds very difficult one, but also people say, when we say this thing, people say it is easier said than done. 
But from my experience, I say, is this easier done than said? If you do it, if you don't do it, you simply say, you simply brush it aside, shine it aside and say, well, who cares? We can do it. 
It is just like you try to teach me how to swim, and see how long you take to tell me how to teach. 
I can never swim. 
I have never learned. 
But for you, it is easy to swim and show me how to swim. 
So it is easier for you to swim than telling me how to swim. 
Why? Because you have been swimming. 
Similarly, if you do it every single day, every waking moment, all your life, it becomes just like breathing. 
You don't learn how to breathe. 
We naturally breathe. 
So the practice also becomes so natural to our life if we do it. 
And then all this becomes crystal clear in our mind when we practice. 
So at the very beginning, he mentioned these four statements. 
Then he said, ātāpi, why we want to do this? Why we want to become mindful of the mind? ātāpi, meaning with the intention of overcoming, with the intention we make effort to overcome our various mental impurities to fulfill those five purposes, at least to begin with one. 
Then the next word he used, sampa-jāna. 
This is the only place the word is given. 
In this way, in the detailed explanation, the word sampa-jāna is not used. 
But this is the place where sampa-jāna is used. 
Sampa-jāna means clear comprehension. 
In the commentaries, clear comprehension is explained in four ways, four fold, four different types of clear comprehension. 
This is another confused area, area where not too many of us get very clear comprehension. 
Although we talk about clear comprehension, we don't get clear comprehension in most of the time. 
Therefore, let us spend a few minutes on that. 
I will explain it later. 
But it is very important to mention it here. 
Clear comprehension is also four types, clear comprehension of the purpose, clear comprehension of the domain, clear comprehension of the suitability, and clear comprehension of non-delusion. 
Now, let us take each of them in turn and try to understand them. 
What is the clear comprehension of the purpose? These are the five-fold purpose that we already had mentioned. 
We already mentioned the five-fold purpose. 
We have to have a clear understanding of these five purposes while we meditate. 
That is to cleanse our mind, to overcome sorrow and lamentation, to overcome suffering and disappointment, and to follow the five-path, the noble eight-fold path, and to attain liberation. 
Attaining liberation is the tastiest things in all tasteful things. 
And Buddha said it in the Angutnika Ayah, the highest taste of all the practice, all the dhammas, is the taste of liberation. 
So that is what we want to attain. 
We want to taste liberation, freedom, not with the tongue, but with the mind. 
So, these are the five purposes we have to keep in mind, that the understanding, clear comprehension of the purpose. 
Then, when we practice this, we must ask the question, I practice this part of meditation, I practice mindfulness of the body, does this practice of mindfulness of the body help me to purify my mind? Ask the question, the purpose, the first of the clear comprehension. 
The first is to have good understanding, clear understanding of the purpose. 
And for this reason, we mentioned the purpose at the very beginning. 
We said the purpose is to purify the mind. 
When we practice mindfulness of the breath, mindfulness of the rest of the body, we must ask, does this practice purify my mind? Keep ask this question. 
Second, when we practice mindfulness of the feelings, does it help me to purify my mind? Ask this question each time you practice any part of the four foundations of mindfulness. 
As the second question, does this help me to overcome sorrow and lamentation? That is the second purpose. 
So we have to have a clear understanding of the purpose, why we do what we do. 
And the third question, does this help me to overcome pain and suffering? You may inflict pain and suffering when you meditate. 
Most meditators experience that. 
Then they ask the question, I am supposed to practice meditation to overcome pain and suffering, but I am suffering now. 
I am having pain. 
The purpose of meditation is not to inflict pain. 
At the very beginning, Buddha said, purpose of meditation is to get rid of pain. 
Instead of getting rid of pain, we experience pain. 
We inflict pain. 
That is one experience that everybody complains against. 
Some people even given up meditation, give up meditation. 
They say they go to for weekend meditation. 
Weekend meditation is actually one-day meditation just like this one. 
All they get during that week is pain. 
Then they leave the meditation center, meditation place, saying that, all I got this meditation is pain. 
I don't want to meditate to get pain. 
But the purpose of meditation is mentioned at the very outset, is to get rid of pain. 
So we have to understand the real purpose of meditation. 
You cannot have pain, or you cannot have pleasure without pain. 
A pleasure always comes with pain. 
The purpose of practice meditation is not to increase pain, but to overcome pain. 
And then we gain pleasure. 
We work very hard to gain pleasure, mundane, ordinary pleasure. 
But this pleasure we work very hard to gain, and we gain this pleasure. 
It is not mundane pleasure, not ordinary, carnal pleasure. 
Pleasure with greed, hatred and delusion. 
This is the pleasure, spiritual pleasure, pleasure of freedom. 
So we go through little difficulties. 
Then we ask the fourth question, does this practice fulfill the fourth purpose? What is the fourth purpose? Following the right path. 
Right path. 
Does this practice put me on the right path? What is the right path? Path to liberation. 
Path to freedom. 
And the fifth question we must ask, does this practice help me to liberate my suffering, liberate my defilement, liberate myself from all kinds of defilements? So we have to have a full, clear comprehension, understanding of the purpose. 
That is the number one of the four purposes. 
The four clear comprehensions. 
Second clear comprehension is even more important. 
What is that? The domain, the field, the scope of meditation. 
What is the domain? The domain of meditation is nothing but our own five aggregates. 
Form, feeling, perceptions, volitional formations and consciousness. 
Or sometimes we can put them into the four foundations of mindfulness. 
Four foundations of mindfulness is nothing but the mindfulness of the form, feeling, perceptions, volitional formations and consciousness. 
Whether we say it four foundations of mindfulness or five aggregates, we say the same thing. 
Words are different, meaning is the same. 
That is our field. 
We use, this is our laboratory. 
Everything we need to attain the goal is in this laboratory. 
In this world, and that is why Abhijja, Domananda, Sangh, Vinayaya, Loke, the Buddha used the word Loke, this is my world. 
Each and every one of us is living in our own world. 
Five aggregates are our world. 
In Sangyuta Nikaya Buddha defined the world. 
World is with this one-fathomed body with this consciousness. 
One-fathomed body with this consciousness. 
What is the one-fathomed? Fathomed means six feet. 
In that definition, I am not one-fathomed. 
I am only five-three. 
So the fathomed is elastic, flexible fathomed. 
That means when you stretch our hands from middle fingertip to the other middle fingertip, that distance is one-fathomed. 
So each one of us is one-fathomed in our own measurement. 
So within that, Buddha said, is the world. 
Why Buddha said, Buddha was so intelligent, not intelligent wise. 
There is a big difference between intelligence and wisdom anyway. 
The Buddha was so wise, he gave the world in a nutshell and the whole world is here. 
What you find in outside world is here. 
So covetousness and grief in the world means we are not going to remove the covetousness of other people. 
Reduce greed in the world. 
You can never do that. 
Many a time people say, I want to get involved in what you call. 
. 
. 
What you call active Buddhism, engage Buddhism. 
I want to engage in Buddhism. 
What do you want to do? Go out and tell people to reduce their greed, hatred, delusion and keep going out, doing that. 
And they say, reducing greed, hatred and delusion in the world. 
So that I can live peacefully. 
If there is no greed, hatred and delusion in the world, I can live peacefully. 
Therefore let me go out and reduce greed, hatred and delusion in the world. 
And it is like somebody who wants to walk on the earth. 
Where to say, let me cover the entire world with leather, so that I can walk without getting my feet hurt. 
On rocks, thorns, rough areas, getting without getting burned and so forth. 
Let me walk. 
So let me cover the whole world with leather. 
And somebody would say, mister, it's not going to work. 
On the one hand you cannot collect enough leather to do that. 
On the other hand, before you collect enough leather, you will die. 
Because you don't live that long. 
Thirdly, you have to kill so many animals. 
There may not be that many animals that has that thick leather. 
And therefore what you should do is to cut piece of leather and make a pair of shoes and then walk. 
That will work. 
That is the Buddha's method. 
That means reduce greed and hatred in the world, in our world. 
When I reduce my greed and hatred and delusion, I can move among people who have greed, hatred and delusion without being affected by their greed, hatred and delusion. 
And that's what the Buddha did. 
So the second clear comprehension should be the domain. 
The domain is not in the world, outside. 
Domain is here in us. 
And this is, as I said, our own laboratory where we have to work. 
Normally people don't like to use their own laboratories. 
They want to borrow others' laboratories and work there and let their own laboratory get rusty, collect dust and collect garbage, dirt and use others when they turn back and they see their laboratories are filled with dirt. 
And in this meditation, the Buddha said, therefore, have a clear comprehension of the domain. 
What is your domain? There's a very beautiful story in Samyutini Gaya. 
I think most of you might have heard, since some of you are Dharma teachers, some of you have listened to many Dharma talks by giving very beautiful Dharma teachers. 
This story you might have heard thousands of times. 
But I like to present it myself again so that you may remember it. 
If you have memorized it, you will hear different version of it. 
Anyway, this is the little story that Buddha gave to illustrate the meaning of domain. 
He said there was a little quail and one day a big hawk came and grabbed this quail because the quail was, you know, walking around and, you know, basking in the sun and relaxing and going away and so forth. 
So the hawk came and grabbed him and took him away. 
Then he was being taken away. 
The quail said to himself, today is my bad unlucky day and this fellow is going to kill me. 
Had I been in my own domain, this quail would not be a match in fight. 
I could have defeated him very easily had I been in my own domain. 
Then the hawk, without getting upset, you know, listening to this little quail's challenge, hawk did not get upset. 
He asked the quail, what is a domain by the way? He said that newly cloud field where there are big clouds of mud, that is my field, domain. 
Or is it so? I can take you there and leave there. 
So he took him and left there and by leaving him there, he said, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow I come and get you. 
Is it okay? So he dropped him and flew away. 
Next day he came and quail was sitting on a big cloud of mud and he saw the hawk sweeping, you know, stooping down, coming down as he was approaching the quail very quickly, rushed under huge cloud of mud. 
And the hawk came and looked around, he could not see him. 
From the distance he saw the quail. 
Now when he came close, he could not see him. 
And he got very angry and bit, bit, bit his breast and flew away. 
And Buddha said, similarly, if you stay in your own domain, Mahara will not come and get you. 
You will be trapped by the Mahara if you leave your domain and try to borrow others' domains. 
So this is the domain. 
We have to always remember our domain is our own five aggregates, body, feeling, perception, thoughts, and volition, and volitional formations and consciousness. 
So we have to clearly understand these five aggregates, this body. 
This is another subject I talk, like all this we find in the discourse. 
And the third clear comprehension is also very important. 
What is the third? That is the suitability. 
And people say, sometimes suitability is, this place is suitable for meditation, near supermarket, near casino, or in the casino, or the public well, or swimming pool, and so forth. 
No, no, no, they are not suitable. 
So they look for suitable, clear comprehension of suitability, something like this. 
That is not the meaning. 
Suitability is always referring to this practice, asking ourselves, is this practice suitable for attaining that goal, five-four goals? Is this practice of mindfulness or breathing suitable for purifying the mind? That is the suitability. 
The subject, the practice must match the goal. 
And ask, is this suitable for, if it is not suitable for gaining that purpose, I should not practice it. 
If it is suitable for this time, for this mentality, for this state, and this is what I should practice. 
I give another example. 
Suppose you practice mindfulness of the body, focus in mind on the parts of the body. 
This is another big subject of meditation, parts of the body. 
When you practice the meditation on the parts of the body, all of a sudden, instead of reducing to a lust, lust can increase. 
At that time, you should be able to ask yourself, is this practice suitable for me at this time? Then you will realize, no, the more you meditate on this, the more lust increases in me, therefore I must abandon this and choose another subject from the same, the sutta, and you practice that. 
Why you want to, your purpose is to overcome greed, covetousness and hatred. 
When you practice the part of meditation on the various parts of the body, if hatred arises, you abandon it and choose another part because your purpose is to overcome your hatred. 
So, suitability also must match the purpose and the subject. 
That is suitable, not the place. 
It is, some people say, when you go to the kitchen, you have a purpose of going to the kitchen. 
When you go to the bedroom, you have a purpose in going to the bedroom and so forth. 
These are not the purposes. 
The real purpose is, the suitability means that you have to have a clear understanding. 
Is this suitable for gaining this goal? And the fourth clear comprehension is non-delusion. 
That is even more difficult and very deep subject. 
We have to have a clear comprehension, clear understanding of the clarity, non-delusion. 
That means, when you practice meditation, this one of the four foundations of mindfulness, whichever it is, if we begin to relapse into the belief that there must be something permanent, something solid, you are deluded, and you should be able to penetrate that solidity, that permanency, to see the impermanence and non-solid state. 
That means the practice is to penetrate the ways and the blocks going through into the reality. 
So, these are the four clear comprehensions. 
Then, satima. 
Satima is being mindful. 
The word sati is used for several meanings. 
One meaning, I have given some explanation in my mindfulness in plain English. 
In Chapter 13, I have spent a lot of time in explaining it. 
I advise people to read that. 
Sati, mindfulness. 
Among many meanings, one meaning is non-conceptual or pre-conceptual awareness. 
To see things exactly as they are without distortion. 
What do we mean by seeing things as they really are? That also is a heavily loaded phrase. 
See things. 
See means, how can we see? We always see when we open our eyes, we see. 
Do we see things exactly as they are when we open our eyes? Superficially, yes. 
Materially, yes. 
Spiritually, no. 
When we open our eyes, look at things. 
We see they are color, shape, size, height, shades and so forth. 
These are not the reality. 
These are the superficial appearance of the object. 
The word vipassana also has a very special meaning. 
V is special. 
Passana means seeing. 
That means seeing things as they really are. 
Seeing here is not with eyes open, but with eyes closed. 
This must be a very special seeing. 
Seeing things with eyes closed. 
We see when we close our eyes and open our wisdom eye, like platypus. 
You know platypus living in Tasmania. 
This animal looks like a beaver. 
It lives in water. 
It's a mammal, breastfeeding babies. 
And this animal, when he approaches a prey, at the accessible distance, he closes his eyes. 
When he closes his eyes, there is a device right in the middle of his forehead, above his nose, and that device opens and sends electric current to stun the animal. 
Then he opens his eyes and catches the prey. 
But he has to close the eyes when he approaches the prey to open this device to stun the animal. 
Similarly, when we close our eyes, close our ears, close our nose, close our mouth, close our body, and focus on what really is happening in the mind. 
We cannot close, we cannot plug our ears, we can hear sound. 
And they convert inside and something is happening inside. 
You can watch it. 
When we pay this undivided, nonverbal, preconceptual attention to the sound we hear, we hear the change. 
We experience impermanence. 
When we open our eyes, our eyes go here and there and bring a lot of information from outside and distort our awareness of impermanence. 
When we close our eyes and just pay attention, nonverbal, nonlabelling, nonconceptual attention, we can exactly experience the changes. 
Just like when you listen to music, if you want to enjoy music, don't criticize. 
Don't have a commentary. 
Don't use words. 
Just listen. 
You can really enjoy music. 
If you start commenting, verbalizing, conceptualizing, criticizing, commenting, you never enjoy. 
This is much deeper than that. 
To understand the true nature of something, something here means not outside, something in this body and mind, just pay attention. 
This is called sati, one meaning of sati. 
In vipassana, there is another word to understand, to make mindfulness or vipassana more meaningful. 
That is anupasana. 
That is why the Buddha used the word kaya-kaya-anupasna-virati. 
So we combine these two words, kaya-anupasana-virati, vedana-anupasana-virati, kitta-anupasana-virati, dhamma-anupasana-virati. 
And even to make it even brief, we said kaya-anupasana, vedana-anupasana, sitta-anupasana, dhamma-anupasana. 
In all these, we have the word anupasana. 
What is anupasana? We have to understand the meaning of anupasana to understand the meaning of vipasana. 
Vipasana means seeing in a very special way. 
Anupasana is seeing it as it is happening, no before, no after. 
Simultaneously with the happening, the mind must be able to register what is happening, not before, no after. 
And sometimes this is explained in being aware of the present, present moment. 
Present moment is not the past, no in the future, but in the present. 
And this is what anupasana means, seeing certain things happening in the body and mind as they are happening. 
And when these two combine together, we can gain vipasana. 
That is vipasana with anupasana, seeing them happening as they are happening. 
By paying total, pure, clean, undivided attention without words, concepts, ideas, labors, only then we can see what is happening. 
With, as I said, with eyes open, we cannot see our body, even if we look in the mirror to see our body, how much we can see? Only the front, we cannot see the back, we cannot see the top of our head, we can see the right eye on the left. 
You know, we move the right hand and we see in the mirror, we are moving left hand. 
You write M, A, Y and hold against the mirror, you can see YAM. 
If you see, write T, K, E, Y and hold against the mirror, you can see YAK. 
So even if you look in the mirror, with eyes open, you cannot see the object exactly as it is. 
So you cannot trust our eyes. 
What people call seeing is believing. 
It is not true, not true. 
You cannot believe what you see. 
So this is a very, very special way of seeing. 
And the pure seeing, wonderful seeing, no prejudice, no biases. 
It's a clear, pure seeing. 
So, kaya kaya nupasana kaya nupaswita atata api sampa jhanu satima vinaya loke abhijya domanastang. 
This phrase also is important to remember. 
Vinaya means restraining, disciplining. 
It's also heavily loaded because there are five kinds of disciplining. 
Restrain. 
We are called sangvara. 
Seela sangvara. 
Sati sangvara. 
Kanti sangvara. 
Jnana sangvara. 
Virya sangvara. 
Sangvara means restraining. 
We have to restrain our senses with effort, with patience, with mindfulness, with wisdom, and with effort. 
Restrain. 
All these things must involve in our mindfulness practice. 
We have to have a lot of patience. 
People always ask, Bhante, is there any shortcut? This seems to be very, very long. 
We don't have that much time. 
When I was in Washington, a woman came working in the World Bank at lunchtime. 
She came and said, Bhante, I have one hour. 
I have to go back to work. 
Teach me meditation so that I attain enlightenment and go back to work. 
I said, I'm sorry, I don't have what you call this quick pill, you know, to boost your attainment of enlightenment. 
People are so impatient. 
Very quickly they want to attain. 
The quicker you want to attain, the longer you will take. 
So you have to have a lot of patience. 
Take it easy. 
Just be fully aware of what is happening bit by bit. 
And if you're trying to grab everything, you are just like trying to grab the whole heap of orange. 
You cannot do that. 
That is called discipline. 
We have to do it with patience, with effort, with mindfulness, with wisdom. 
And then with discipline. 
They are called Seela Sanghara, Virya Sanghara, Kanti Sanghara, Sati Sanghara, and Jnana Sanghara. 
Five touch of discipline. 
Abhija Domanastham, Vinaya Vinaya means discipline. 
And having overcome greed, covetousness, and anger. 
Covetousness is translated as excessive greed. 
That implies that there is certain amount of greed, and over and above that is excessive. 
So you can have certain amount of greed, and over and above is excessive. 
Actually, it simply means gross greed. 
He cannot eliminate greed all of a sudden, but at least try to overcome this oozing, very gross type of greed. 
Other greed will slowly vanish eventually when you overcome the very gross part. 
So, I think I am supposed to stop the talk now, this morning. 
This is the introduction to the Mahasattipatthana Sutta. 
And then we go, you know, we are supposed to do some meditation also. 
Morning is the best time to meditate. 
Artificial meditation will be difficult. 
Therefore, I have a plan for afternoon meditation to make it easy. 
We do little walking meditation. 
I give you some instructions on walking meditation. 
You might have heard people giving instructions, you might have learned how to do walking meditation and so forth. 
I also like to introduce my version of walking meditation for you to either clarify or get more confused. 
So, let us see afterwards.
