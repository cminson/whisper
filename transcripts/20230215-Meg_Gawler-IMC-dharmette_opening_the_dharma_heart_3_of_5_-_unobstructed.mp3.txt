 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. I do appreciate your presence. I appreciate your practice, and I'm happy to be here with you. Today's the third talk on opening the Dharma Heart, and we're looking at five qualities of mind that the Buddha used himself to see if someone was ready to become awakened. In Pali, the word for mind is chitang, and the qualities we're looking at this week are palachitang, mudu chitang, vinivara chitang, udaga chitang, and pasana chitang. Someone yesterday asked where this came from in the Pali Canon, and although they're not one of the many Dharma lists that you often see in the early texts, I looked it up, and they do occur as a group together nine times in the early teachings. And the text that I'm referring to is near the end of the Brahm훮ya s큰ta, which is Majim훮 Nik훮ya 91. On Monday, we talked about being receptive, available, and ready to change. Yesterday, we evoked the quality of having a soft and malleable mind. And Gil talked about this process of softening the mind with the idea that we're each a work of art, and in working to progressively become more and more beneficial to ourselves and others, having a mind that's stuck or rigid or hard makes it difficult to change ourselves in a beneficial way. We need a mind that's receptive and also soft, so that we can shape the mind to become more and more beautiful. And today we come to the third quality, which is vinivarana. And Pali-vi is a prefix meaning away from or not, and nivarana are the five hindrances. Those powerful forces that we as humans all experience. The root word in Pali for these hindrances is var, which is to block. So the hindrances are obstacles, obstructions, and barriers to awakening. And it's important that we look at freeing ourselves from the hindrances as a progressive task. These five hindrances exist in each of us on a spectrum from being completely caught to being completely free. As you may know, the first hindrance is sensual desire, wanting, greed. The second is not wanting, aversion, hatred, ill will. The third, usually called sloth and torpor, refers to resistance, stiffness, shutting down. The fourth includes restlessness, agitation, worry, regrets. And the fifth is doubt. Doubt about the value of the Buddha's teachings, or doubt about our own ability to walk this path of freedom. So one of our first jobs as a practitioner is to get to know these forces in ourselves, to study what causes them to arise, and to see the unskillfulness when we're caught and reactive. And then finding ways to see them start to arise and having the wisdom to know, this is not how I want to be. So in the process of getting to know our own unskillful qualities, it's important, as always, to remember to be kind to ourselves. Because we're human, after all. You might think of training the mind the way you would train a sweet little puppy. But if you yell at the puppy and kick it every time it makes a mistake, you're going to end up with an angry, aggressive dog. And if you want your puppy to grow up to be a happy, relaxed, loving dog, then you train it with caresses and with treats. Giving the puppy positive feedback every time it does something right. So in the same way, without setting expectations too high, we can give ourselves positive feedback by noticing the moments when the hindrances are in abeyance. And appreciating what it's like to be free of them, these obstructions, even if it's just for a second. Ah, it's like we've opened the windows and doors of the mind. And we can enjoy the healthy pleasure of the sunlight and the fresh air. What a relief not to be spinning around in preoccupations. And the more often we notice the goodness of these moments of freedom, however short lived they are, the more we build the neural pathways so that letting these obstructive forces in the mind subside can happen more easily and more often. So take these moments of freedom in and savor them. Without, of course, clinging or getting attached. It's enough just to say, ah, right now the mind is unobstructed. And a mind that instead of being caught up in me myself and mine is open to the sunlight, fresh air and spaciousness of the Dharma. That's beautiful. So let yourself consciously receive and enjoy these moments when the mind is unobstructed open. Beautiful. You can enjoy the taste of well being and gladness that come with letting in the light and the fresh air of open awareness. My first Buddhist teacher was the Zen master, Suzuki Roshi. And I began studying with him at what was for me the tender age of 21. Only two years after I had gotten out of the mental hospital and I still had a lot of work to do in myself. And what struck me so deeply right away was that the end of every period of meditation, he would bow to each of us as we came out of the meditation hall. And when he bowed to me, he communicated that there was something worth bowing to. In the same way, he would bow to a Buddha. No matter how screwed up we were, he saw the beautiful potential that each of us had. And he treated everyone like a Buddha. And I had the good fortune to become his disciple and to be on the receiving end of his unconditional love. And it wasn't because I was someone special. But it was it was amazing to just be with someone where I was convinced that there was nothing unworthy about me. I didn't have to worry about being worthy or unworthy. It was enough just to want to practice sincerely. And this is something we can do for ourselves. We may have been taught that we were inadequate, unworthy or unlovable. But being inadequate or worse is a harmful mirage that we can let go of. And the beauty of this path is that even those of us who struggle with scars from having been deeply traumatized are perfectly welcome. This seed of the Buddha, the beautiful Buddha, is alive and well in each one of us. I hope you believe me. It's alive and well in you. So this path is about little by little, learning not to cling to the unskillful coverings that we thought were necessary to survive. And to enjoy the aliveness and taste the freedom we can experience in moments when the doors and windows are unobstructed. So if you're for a little homework for the next 24 hours, see if you can slow down enough so that whenever possible, the mind can take a break from its reactivity from spinning off in thoughts. Notice how beautiful it is to simply abide even temporarily in the moments when you're obstructed in the absence of the hindrances. This moment of touching the door knob. Wow. The aliveness of being right there with the door knob. Or mindfully cleaning the sink. And it's lovely to just be cleaning the sink with all out all the commentary of the mind. Listening attentively to a loved one without jumping ahead on how we want to reply. Just being receptive, soft, and without barriers for them. So the homework is to really touch into the joy and gladness of those moments when you are fully present with your experience. So thank you for being here. And know that I appreciate and am very much encouraged by your practice. Thank you.
