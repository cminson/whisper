 Good morning. And just can you hear me okay? Thumbs up. Thank you. Probably good afternoon for some of you already. So this morning I'll be giving some instruction on a mindfulness of the body. If we think of ourselves as being made up of concentric circles, we start at the center and we put the breath at the center to be here and now in the present moment instead of being caught up or lost in the mind. When we're lost in the mind, we've moved out of the present into future thinking, past thinking, fantasies. So we begin with the breath in the inner circle, in the present. Then we open up our attention to the next concentric circle, which is our body, our physical sensations. And as our attention becomes more stable, we can then open up to the next circles, to thoughts, to emotions, to moods, and eventually to everything else. The idea is that we fill the center with our awareness. We stabilize our attention so we're not easily pulled off balance. This sitting we will continue to focus our attention on the breath as our anchor, as our home base. For now we will open our field of attention to include any strong physical sensations that may arise. It can be helpful to think of the mind as having a foreground and a background. We keep the breath in the foreground and allow everything else to stay in the background. But if a compelling physical sensation arises, we don't need to push it away. We can bring it into the field of our awareness. We make it the meditation object. And once the compelling physical sensation has faded, then we can return to the breath. When physical sensations become compelling, we can pay close attention to the different sensations that make up the experience, to fill them intimately from the inside. So I'd like to just take a couple of minutes for an exercise that points to this. So close your eyes if they're not closed and clasp your hands in your lap and bring your attention to where your hands meet each other. Feel the sensations there. What do you feel? Not the idea of what you feel, but the actual sensations. If it's helpful to connect with your experience, you can softly note what you feel. Retingling, pressure, warmth, vibration. When you use noting or labeling, let the labeling be about 10% of your attention, like a whisper in the mind, but allow most of the attention to be on the actual physical sensation. Feeling the pressure from within, the tingling, the warmth. You might notice the sensations change. They don't stay the same. Some areas have stronger sensations than others. Now let go of your hands and allow them to rest, palm up on your lap. And then notice how the sensations have changed. What do you feel now? Go ahead and open your eyes. You keep them closed, that's fine too. In this way, in a similar way, you can pay attention to any compelling sensations when they arise. Just notice the changing details of any compelling sensations. When they're no longer compelling, you can rest in the breath. And if it's helpful, use labeling or noting as a way to stay connected with them. But if it's not helpful, just let that be. One other suggestion I'd like to make is to minimize how much you move when you meditate. It really helps get settled and concentrated when we don't move as much. But move if you need to. But try not to move or scratch right away. If you have a pain or a discomfort or an itch, try not to move automatically. Pay attention to it first, even for a little bit. And if you choose to move, it's not wrong. But do it mindfully. Make the awareness continuous between the change in position. It's more important to stay aware than if you move or not. Try to have a curious, open attitude towards everything that arises, even if it's unpleasant. What is the sensation like? Notice the details of your experience. I'll guide you into a meditation of mindfulness of the body. Close your eyes. Take a relaxed but alert posture. Keeping the spine erect. Allow yourself to be centered on your body. Push a connection with the body and make small adjustments as needed. Finding your seat. You can take a few long, slow, deep breaths, allowing yourself to connect more fully with your body. Breathing more deeply with every exhale. Allow the breath to return to normal. And gradually scan your body from top to bottom, relaxing where you can relax. If you can't quite relax something, that's okay too. Try to soften around it. Relax the face, the jaw, the shoulders, the chest, the belly. Relax your entire back. Settle the body into your pelvis. Notice how your body feels, however it is. Settle the sensations from the inside out. And begin to notice the physical sensations of breathing. Maybe the chest rising and falling. The belly rising and falling. The rib cage expanding and contracting. The movement of air in and out of the nostrils. Whatever is prominent to you. And however it is, the easiest for you to feel your breath. Allow yourself to rest there. Allow yourself to connect with the full length of the inhale. And the little gap at the end before you exhale. Connect with the full length of the exhale. And stay connected during the little gap before the inhale. And take a minute to just allow your attention to rest in the breath. On your anchor. On your home base. On your home base. As long as other experiences or sounds are in the background, allow them to remain there. But if any strong physical sensation becomes compelling, shift your attention to it. Just like we did with the hands. And explore the sensations and make it up. Maybe hardness or softness. Warm through coolness. Tingling, throbbing, lightness, heaviness. If it's helpful, you can make a quiet mental label for your experience. This noting labeling is a gentle, ongoing whisper in the mind that keeps the attention steady on the experience. Most of the attention directly in the sensations of your experience. It might sound like this. Tingling, tingling. Water. Warmth. Drop any commentary or judgment in favor of experiencing the sensations directly. Try to be alert for the difference between the sensations and mental commentary about them. If you get the idea that a strong sensation shouldn't be there, that's commentary. And once a physical sensation has disappeared or is no longer compelling, gently return to the breath until some other sensation calls your attention. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The attention has drifted gently, non-judgmentally. Bring it back to the breath. It's not a problem. Just what the mind does. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being with today. If you'd like to leave, then we can be coordinated with you. Make sure you are of And just like we end the sitting, we begin a sitting with taking a couple of deep breaths. It can be helpful to end a sitting with a couple of deep breaths and commitment to stay present in whatever comes next. So I'd like to say a few words about physical sensations in relation to pain. Sometimes our physical sensations might be uncomfortable, painful, but pain is not a single thing. It's made up of many different sensations. The perception of pain is affected by how we relate to it. I've known people who think nothing of weightlifting, incredibly heavy weights. Their face is grimacing in effort and they do this regularly. Yet they cringe at the momentary prick of the needle. So it's not that one hurts more than the other. It's how we perceive it. So if there has any pain or discomfort in the body when you meditate, see if you can drop any resistance to it. Resisting pain doesn't make it better. In particular with pain, noting or labeling can be very helpful because when you look at it carefully, you see that the pain is not just one thing. It's many, many different sensations. Chins and young used to say divide and conquer. So if you pay attention to all the different sensations one at a time, like a knee pain, you might notice a pressure or tingling and you notice the differences. There might be a center to the pain, edges to the pain, but it changes. You try, you focus on what you think is a center and then it moves. So you can stay very interested and curious with painful sensation. So we want to respect the body, especially on this first day of a retreat. It's not helpful to force yourself through pain where you're not able to stay mindful and you're just grimacing and waiting till the bell rings. It doesn't develop anything except grimacing and resistance. So really respect the body, listen to the body and change postures as needed. It's a lot of sitting at first when we're not used to doing it. When we pay attention to pain, it's important to stay interested. If the mind begins to stay grim, it's more helpful to shift the attention to something that doesn't hurt. It might be just going back to the breath and really focusing carefully on this tiny sensations of breathing. So just again reminding us mindfulness is an embodied practice. I encourage you to keep your mind and body in the same place in everything you do today.
