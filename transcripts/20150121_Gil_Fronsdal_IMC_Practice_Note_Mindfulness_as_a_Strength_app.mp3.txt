Strength

One of the core practices of our tradition is mindfulness, 
which is to pay careful attention to w hat is happening in 
the present – not necessarily active recognition, but  
register ing events  in such a way that you are clearly 
aware of what is happening. This is it. Because if you 
don’t recognize something clearly, there are all kinds of 
tentacles, all kinds of confusion in  the mind about our 
relationship to what is happe ning. We can be reactive to 
it. We can judge it. We can have all kinds of 
commentary and ideas about it. There is something 
about the cle ar recognition of breathin g in knowing , “Oh, 
this is an in -breath. ” As opposed to  thinking , “The breath 
is kind of nice, but it’s not a s deep as maybe it should 
be. Maybe you should be thinking abou t what to get for 
dinner today. ” In this case, t he mind is not clear about 
exactly what it  is doing.  
 
Mindfulness is a clear recognition, “Y es, this is what is 
happening.”  In that regard, the mental capacity to be 
mindful is sometimes called a ‘faculty. ’ It is a faculty we 
have, but which sometimes  is not being used. W e want to start using  this faculty . This faculty, this mindfu lness, 
is sometimes  called a ‘strength ,’ a bala. When we utilize 
it, it is possib le for it to become a strength.  Sometimes 
when people use it, there  is a kind of a drifting ; there’ s 
no strength in it. It’s kind of weak. When it becomes 
strong, it becomes a  strength. It becomes  one of  your 
strength s. Not a strength th at is a strain or is stressful.  
Not a strength that is inhibi ting. Rather,  when something 
is strong  within us, it becomes ballast – a stabilizing 
force.  We are not so easily influenced by the winds of 
our life, the things that come along.  
 
As you practice, one o f the things you might explore is 
if, in a relaxed easy way , your mindfulness can be clear 
– with clear recognition of what’ s going on. You may 
find strength in  knowing , “Oh, this is what’s going on 
now.” Relaxed strength. Not pushing. Not rushing. So, 
when you take a simple step during walking medit ation, 
you can be kind of there  – or you can be really there, as 
if the most importa nt thing happeni ng in the world  at this 
moment, is that step. You are going to be there with that 
step. You a re not going to miss that step. That particular 
step will neve r happen again. You want to really  be 
there for it. In this way, you develop this strength that 
you h ave. You bring a strong part of yourself : “Here I 
am. With this.”   
 
May a sense of strength support the deepen ing of your 
mindfulness, relaxation , and ease with your practice today.
