So this is the third talk on the five characteristics of the Dharma that's an expression or kind of meant to express the kind of confidence that some people have in the Dharma. 
And so the saying goes, the Dharma is well spoken by the Buddha. 
It is visible here and now, immediate. 
Inviting us to see. 
Onward leading and to be personally known, experienced by the wise. 
So today, the topic is Ehipassiko, which is sometimes translated as inviting inspection, inviting us to come and see. 
And it's a compound word or two words. 
The ehi, e-h-i, is the kind of the instruction, come, come here. 
And Pasiko has the word to see in it, come and see. 
And it's the same kind of root as Vipassana, which has passana in it. 
Passa is that to see as well. 
And so come and see. 
And the Buddha, early in his teaching career, when someone wanted to become ordained as a monastic, he would say to them, come bhikkhu, come monastic. 
And that just simply that come, come here, come into this, that was the ordination ceremony, nothing more, nothing more fancy. 
And so I kind of like this because this idea of ehi, come and see, has this kind of association in my mind to this movement to really step into the spiritual life, dharmic life really fully as this ehi, come, come bhikkhu, come into this. 
And so the dharma beckons us to see, invites us to see, says, come look, come look. 
And it's not telling us, come learn, come read these books. 
Come memorize these teachings. 
Come believe what I'm saying. 
Rather it's saying, come and look, come and see. 
And it's beckoning us. 
And the question is, what is doing the calling? What's inviting us to come and see? And some people have suggested it's the world, that everything that's there, there's a request that we connect with it, that we know it, that we really are present for this world, because everything is important. 
And I've known some wonderful spiritual practitioners, you get a sense when you're with them, that everything is important, every little detail, everything we do. 
And the inspiring little event story that I witnessed was in many, many years ago, in the late 1970s, I was witness to unusual gathering, maybe the first time, of about seven, maybe the only seven, full Zen teachers in the United States. 
And most of them were Japanese who moved here to teach Zen. 
And they had a meeting, and one evening of their kind of gathering they had, they had a panel for us Zen students. 
And someone, they were there sitting upon a table and answering questions and things. 
And some Zen student came along with glasses of water for them. 
And the Zen student just reached behind them and put it on the table for them, kind of innocuously, kind of. 
But as he went down the table, he came to the last person, a teacher, Meizumi Roshi, and when the student left the water for the teacher, the teacher turned around as if that person bringing the water was the most important person at that moment, and bowed, kind of an appreciation and thanks. 
And the fact that none of the other teachers had done that, it really started, wow, this is important for this teacher. 
This is important as anything else. 
And the other teachers seemed to me, they were so involved in the Q&A that they didn't notice, maybe. 
But they said, everything's important. 
Later I was sitting in a retreat next to a Japanese Zen monk, and I saw him bow to his teacup. 
I said, why would you bow to a teacup? So everything is important. 
So what's inviting us to see is the world. 
Be present for it, everything, everything is important. 
Another way of understanding what we're being invited to see is the seeing itself. 
That's the seeing that's important. 
Come and see, come and be involved in the seeing that the freedom is found in how we see, how we're aware, how we know. 
And as we start tuning into how we see, how we know, a fantastic thing begins to happen, is we start recognizing how our awareness, our seeing, our knowing gets hijacked, gets caught in, gets utilized by our attachments, our greeds, our agendas, our conceits. 
Because we feel it gets tight, it gets frozen, it gets pressure, it gets assertive. 
The knowing is not spacious, relaxed, open, peaceful. 
And so come and see is, I take to be partly an invitation, was not so much what you look at, or in addition to what you're looking at, it's the act of seeing. 
Come really see. 
Learn about your seeing. 
Learn about how you're aware. 
Learn about the richness and the value of this present momentability to be present and to see. 
And so what's been calling us to see is the seeing itself. 
Because the seeing itself wants to be free, wants to be open, is available. 
And I think the analogy I have for this sometimes is if you sit and meditate in a nice way, come out of meditation very calm and centered and very present, then the seeing of the world around us just happens naturally, easily, and things begin to sparkle and stand out and highlight in a way they weren't. 
They were busy and stressed in everyday life, maybe before meditation. 
I remember the first time I had this experience. 
I kind of felt everything is sparkling. 
And I said, wow, someone gone around and cleaned while I wasn't paying attention. 
And wow. 
Or sometimes taking a nap during the day. 
And I've woken up in a place where there's sunlight coming in through the window. 
And I can see all the dust particles playing in the sunlight. 
And I'm just kind of. 
. 
. 
That's completely interesting to see. 
Not because the dust particles are so interesting, perhaps, but what's so compelling is the very relaxed, open way of seeing that just seems to happen on its own. 
A kind of way of seeing that's free of attachments and genders and all this stuff. 
So come and see. 
The Dharma is come and see. 
See each thing, maybe as important. 
Come and see. 
Be in the seeing and the freedom that's there. 
And see deeply. 
And as we do that, there's a lot to see. 
And one of the things to see is what we'll talk about tomorrow. 
Another amazing quality of the Dharma is that it's onward leading. 
And what is that onward leading? Well, I'm getting ahead of myself now, but so that's for tomorrow. 
Kind of excited. 
But for now, it's our capacity to perceive. 
Our capacity to know. 
A capacity to see. 
Literally in representing all the acts of perception. 
There's something that is welcoming us, inviting us to let that come to the foreground. 
And yet that there's some feeling of invitation, some calling to it. 
Come is part of the Dharma that's within us. 
This call to be present, this call to know, to see, lives within us, that gets obscured, gets covered over by preoccupation, by strong desires, strong aversions, being in a hurry. 
But as we are no longer in a hurry, we live in this extended present moment where time gets stretched out or is more open or seems timeless. 
I think maybe you'll feel the call to being aware. 
To being aware in a way where being aware has been set free of our thoughts, preoccupations, stories, past, future. 
We're just being alive is enough. 
So, ehe pasiko. 
Come and see. 
Come look. 
May this be the day where you explore this and consider this. 
It requires what I'm suggesting of giving yourself that kind of extended time of now. 
Because if you're in a hurry, you can't feel the call, the request, the invitation. 
But take from time, from time to time through the day to give yourself that extended time and see what you can discover that might be similar to this call to attention. 
That is free, peaceful. 
So thank you and I hope you enjoy your day and you're exploring of this wonderful invitation to be present. 
And maybe that responding to that call can be entering into a deeper life, fuller life. 
Thank you.
