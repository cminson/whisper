 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay, and the... okay, great. So hello and welcome, everyone. It looks lovely to see you, to be with you. So for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to explore the practice of compassion for others in a particular way. So the practice of compassion, compassion is where metta, love, goodwill meets challenge, meets suffering, either ours or others, and holds it with kindness. And one way to practice this beautiful practice of compassion, cultivating our hearts towards compassion is called tonglen, tonglen. I've mentioned it before, we practiced it before. Some of you might be familiar, some of you may not be, it's all good. So the idea of tonglen, and something that some people find actually perhaps challenging with tonglen, which is really the crux of what I like to focus on, is this connecting our breath, breathing in, breathing out, breathing in, breathing out, that's one part of tonglen. Breathing in, suffering, breathing out, goodwill, love, kindness, compassion, soothing. But what really makes this possible, what really makes this tonglen possible, and actually makes it a beautiful practice, not a heavy practice of, oh my God, I'm breathing in the suffering of others, which is where sometimes people go off, like, I don't like tonglen because it's heavy, I'm breathing in suffering of others. Because the idea that actually, when breathing in happens, the idea of this transformative capacity in our heart, that suffering gets transformed, suffering that's breathing gets transformed without us doing anything, it's not ours. So we take the self out of it, because if you make it about me, I'm breathing in the suffering of the world, it gets too heavy, it gets too much. How does the little me do that? Well, it's not about the little me, it's about this me that's unfathomable, that's much more dimensionally divine, and the capacities of this heart, this mind are much more expansive than the little me has access to, or the little me can even envision. So this practice connects with the bodhisattva vow, that I vow to free up all human beings to support the freedom of all human beings, which if you take it as face value, it's like, are you kidding me, the little me is going to do all that? Well, it's not the little me, it's the sense of tapping into something that's bigger than me, I am part of something that is so bigger than me, than I can even imagine, but I trust this heart, this kindness, goodness of my heart, as suffering is breathed in, is transformed as if there is this fire, this holy fire, this fire that transforms the suffering into goodwill, into light, into light of well being, that then shines out. So I'm just being a, I'm supporting this process that's happening on its own, I'm not doing it, I'm witnessing it. So you participate as a witness, as something that you witness and you take, you're even maybe even amazed by and it inspires you. Wow, wow, this is beautiful, this is amazing. I also want to connect it to something else that was brought up in the Google groups that is practice that yes, my suffering, there's a particular way to see that my suffering is a part of this transformation, it's a part of this transformation, it's part of this transformation of suffering into goodness, suffering into care, into love. And that's one way that we can see our own suffering as a way to support the well being, the compassion, that it's an act of compassion, it's an act of taking on, it's an act of taking on. Of course, not in the way of making it heavy and like, oh, I have to take on the suffering of the world. It's not about that, it's a sense of aspiration. So without saying so much more about it, just engage with this practice, see what arises, not get too heady about it. Because the more I talk, I'm afraid we'll get more heady about it, trying to analyze, but see what comes up, see what you might explore or realize, discover that may not have been evident, like discover something new. Wow, this is beautiful, this is amazing with each breath. This being is providing, is shining more love, is shining more compassion onto the world. Wow, what a capacity. I didn't know my heart was capable of that. So let yourself be surprised. And if at any point it gets too much, then step back, take a step back, turn the compassion to yourself, to your own heart, to your own body, to your own mind. There are no shoulds in this cultivation. See what is nourishing, see what is supportive. So without further ado, let's engage, let's practice together. As always, we start by landing, landing in our bodies, landing with the breath. In this moment in time, letting go of the words, of the thoughts, of the thinking, and just connecting with the breath, with the body. Feeling, receiving the breath in the abdomen, and relaxing, softening into the body. With each breath arriving, taking refuge, nowhere to go, nothing to do. Thank you. And if thoughts are arising, and if awareness is now resting on thoughts, plans, it's okay, it's all right. It's okay, have compassion, kindness, humor, to your own mind, it's okay. Come back to your mind, come back. Sweet little puppy of the mind running away, here and there, it's okay, come back, come back. Rest, rest, rest on my lap. With the breath in the lower abdomen. Thank you. Thank you. Each breath helping us land right more deeply here now. Each out breath, relaxing, softening. Can be so delicious just to sit and receive the breath. Rest, rest, rest now. I'd like to invite you to my as if the breath was entering through the center of your chest. The breath entering through your heart center as it would enter, would enliven, it would set a light, bring a light. It awakens of kindness, goodwill, shining. It awakens this light, this brightness in your heart. Goodwell, care shines out. As it shines out, it touches you first, touches your body first. And this heart, this center of your chest, this heart center, proverbial heart center, it's both yours, it's personal. It's also not yours. It's connected with goodness, with grace, with beauty, with love. You are a part of, but you don't own. It's too big for anyone to own. But you are definitely a part of, as if it's an ocean. It's an ocean, and yours is a drop of the same taste, same quality. This goodwill, this care, this unconditional love. And you are a part of it, whether or not you see it in this moment or it's accessible, it doesn't matter. No problem. And each breath entering through the heart center, it awakens, it awakens, it enlivens, it brightens, the spark, this light. This fire, the light shining. It's very healing, and after most of this life, oh let's imagine, just imagine, I would But your own suffering, your own challenges in this life, whether it's physical pain, difficulty in the body, in the mind, in the heart, in your life. Let's imagine that it's like a fog or some kind of a cloud maybe. It gets breathed in, this suffering, this challenge into the heart center and it gets transformed. It gets transformed, this suffering and this bright light and this holy fire. Whatever vision, metaphor works for you. One thing that works for me is to imagine this bright burning, alchemical fire where suffering gets transformed. It becomes light, it becomes soothing, calming, lovely, loving light that just shines out. And it brings comfort and ease. The transformation happens on its own. The breathing, even the breathing happens on its own. There's nothing for you to do. The body knows how to breathe. You are just holding witness. Nothing to do, to well. Pain suffering your own is breathed in as if a fog smoke. Into the heart center, transformed to bright, soothing light brings comfort and ease and healing. This heart center, transformative, transforming, powerful, energetically powerful beyond our character, our imagination,arias, and physical being from the heart. Let yourself feel drenched in the light of your own healing, of your own heart that gets shown outwards. Now, if you'd like to invite someone you care about, or you're close to, imagine their challenges, their suffering. Something that's difficult for them. As this cloud that gets breathed in the heart center naturally and transformed into healing light, compassion, love, care, and breathed out through the heart center and bring them ease, care, love, your soothing wishes for their ease from their challenge. Can witnessing the process happening on its own? Can this being breathe in, breathe out? Can this being breathe in, breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Can this being breathe out? Thank you, Claire. Thank you so much for your hands being shot up on its own to share this as a gift of as a part of your practice, which is something I hope everybody has the chance to do. And it's also, it's a gift that I so appreciate, as you said at the beginning and gives me chills is from your own background, your own suffering, losing your parents at a young age and it's our own suffering. It was what was in me to get exactly it's turning towards it not shying away but turning towards it and builds up the courage of our hearts and you going to ground zero to offer that support as a gift as just strengthening your heart as a gift. Yeah, it just made me so grateful that I could help others that way. Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing I'm getting chills as you share this thank you, Claire, and Richard also says touching sharing in tears. Thank you, Claire. Really appreciate. Other reflections please questions comments. What worked what was challenging. It's all welcome. You know it's all welcome. Especially if you haven't spoken for a while. Were there particular images that worked for you as you were finding your own way with this practice, especially with the heart being this transformative alchemical, powerful, repetitive oven or orb of light or whatever works for you. Any, anything you like to share for the benefit of others. Can use your hand if you like or type chat. One more pause. Jean is raising her hand which they're I don't see everybody's physical hand Jeannie so but so thanks for pointing out to those who did okay Jean please. Thank you so much. The thing that the idea that previously the most light is light. The idea of focusing on the light, you know, the lights it's all around us is just uplifting so much for me. And I really appreciate it. It makes my heart just kind of go out. Thank you for sharing that Jeannie lovely and this light as you're saying, not just my light but part of the light light good this yes yes. Wow and realizing that hello is this not just not just this little light of mine, it is this little light of mine but it's also part of this bigger light, let it shine. It's great. And Richard says, it was well, it was a welcome reminder for me that the suffering is not my suffering but our suffering can be transformed when faced together. Yeah, thank you. He says, think globally, act locally. Yeah. Yeah. And also, David asking Claire for thanking Claire for the reflection and this idea of this archetype of a wounded healer that young brings up the more we suffer the more we're able to identify and support other suffering. Yeah. And we're going to talk about each other in small groups such a rich practice for us to sit just for six minutes seven minutes with each other. You can share your meta your compassion in silence, or you can speak if you wish, share your practice or just breathe, breathe in breathe out. However, use this time in whichever way. It's helpful for you in your little group you decide. So, I'm creating the groups now. And opening the rooms, take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. Precious song of time. Okay, everybody's back. So, welcome back everyone. And let's mute the phones. Zoom has a problem not muting the phones after we come out of group so welcome back everyone we have a couple minutes for reflections, what came up for you what did you notice observe. We've been practicing with each other in groups, makes me so happy. Practice Fred, please. I wonder if you would say a little more about the in in the practice, how it happens without without our willing it without without effort that it's how it's like breathing. Yeah, yeah. So, the way to bring that in that sense in and it takes a while, you know, there's with Tonglen. There's so many pieces, it's, it's like a you know, multi multi ring circus there's the breath, there's this there's. So it takes a while to get it all together and then. So, so, it may not be immediate what I'm saying that becomes apparent but at some point, it just seems like the breath comes in. The suffering is breathed in gets transformed and it's it's it's shown outward, the sense of kindness love healing, it just all happens instead of, okay, now I'm going to make it better there's not a sense of willing it is just a sense of witnessing and it's connected. What's beautiful about this practice of compassion this way of doing compassion practice. I mean, there are lots of beautiful ways. One way as we've done before is you know, maybe free from suffering, you know, bringing up the suffering of the person in mind meeting and kind of saying the phrases so it's more active there's a sense of phrases, whereas here this there's this sense of the breath comes in breath comes out and it's just, so there's a sense of witnessing what's happening, of course, we are part of this, but it's, it doesn't feel so willful. So it's just witnessing this. It's not sort so much willing it happens does that, does that help. So clarify a little bit. Yeah, thumbs up. Great. Thanks. The last minute questions or comments. It's a beautiful practice, it can take a little while at first, be clunky I'll tell you that I learned this practice years ago. When I was going through the teacher training at Stanford, see care center for compassion and what a secret center for compassion and altruism research and education, that's what it stands for a mouthful. When I went through the teacher training, it was nine months and this is when I really got to practice this and and at first was like okay all these pieces and then at some point, it really became alive for me and I loved it I just loved it became my primary practice for a while I just love the sense that, wow with each breath, with each breath. It's, I'm holding witness there's a sense of goodness I'm not turning away from suffering and it just became easy was just compassion practice just this feel like it's going to happen on its own. So when it when it gets going can be really really lovely. So, so it's seven o'clock, and we have come to the end of the session then I see your hand if it's really quick. Yes, no. You tell me. I wanted to add really quickly, because what you're saying, my original Buddhist practice preceded all of these events, and was, I worked on the sutra of compassion for two years. Yeah, so there you go. There you go. Exactly. Yeah. Wonderful. Thank you for that. So, yes, make compassion, be our way of being, made support us to meet the challenges in our lives not to turn away, and also the suffering in other people's lives. It's a heart that is, is resting in compassion as curl this curl that has courage can be with compassion and not cower. And you can see the words, so may you all be well, say free from suffering and thank you for your practice. May you be well, and all beings may all beings be well safe and happy. Good to see you. Good to be with you.
