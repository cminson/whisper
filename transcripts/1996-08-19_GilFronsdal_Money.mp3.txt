 I want to start this evening reading a poem. It's kind of an odd poem. Either it doesn't read well or more likely I can't read as well. But it kind of hinges on the last word, which kind of struck me the first time I read it. So if you'll bear along. It's called Lightning Bugs and it's by August Kleinstahler. Lightning Bugs. The cruel world at eventide. The night sips up like a spider's retreat. Go back to your needlework. We shall not be chasing lightning bugs in the tall grass tonight. Put the whiskey on the shelf and let us speak calmly of money. And why did you laugh? If it said calmly of love or nature and people would have said, oh yes. But somehow money in our consciousness, the way we think, kind of seems kind of odd in that kind of context, the way it's kind of flowing along nicely. For many of us at least. There's certainly for me the first time I read it. And so I came home last night from teaching retreat. A wonderful nine day retreat up in Vajrapani, Boulder Creek, and some of you were there. And it felt like a very nice retreat. It felt fairly profound for people. And it was very hot. But the teachers were saying, I think the heat actually, the meditative students kind of didn't maybe realize it so much. But it seemed like the heat actually helped. Because it seemed like you couldn't go anywhere. It's kind of like people were more grounded or in their body, solid with all this heat kind of all over everywhere. But I don't know if it's true, but it felt like a relatively solid retreat. Very nice. So I came back from kind of inspired and very happy to be there. It's a wonderful spiritual activity. And on my message machine, the phone was a call from an editor from Tricycle saying that he'd heard that I'd written an article about money for the inquiring mind. And that he was doing, they're doing an issue on money and if they could use it or if I could write something about money. And I hadn't written an article about money. And so he called me again, he said there was a message, and so he called me again today and he asked me and I said, no, I hadn't written anything on money. And I had written a small little two paragraph thing on generosity that was meant for a fundraising report for the San Francisco Zen Center a couple of years ago, but never ended up being used. And I thought maybe the first paragraph, maybe the first paragraph you could use is a little poke boat or something. And he asked me to send it to him. So I've been thinking about money today. And so that's what I thought I talked a little bit about, about money. I don't think I didn't feel like I don't have anything profound to say. So I'm feel a little bit odd to sit down and take that as a subject. But I think it's a very useful subject for us to look at for many reasons. Now, first, I'm aware that some of us who kind of are maybe part of the aging, hippie culture or whatever, in the 60s and 70s, there was a kind of, among many people, a kind of strong anti-money feeling that money was somehow evil in and of itself or wrong and shouldn't have money, shouldn't have a lot of money, she should be poor, she should be hitchhiking around and barefoot and having a great time. Which many of us did. I spent, it was 1974, I spent six months traveling around the country hitchhiking, wonderful time, on $100. And quite comfortable with that, no problems. So there's this kind of anti-money feeling that kind of circulates in our culture. And I don't know exactly where the beginning of it is. Some of it was, you know, the 60s perhaps, but they got it from somewhere, I'm sure. And some of it's a reaction, I think, against some of the ways money is used and attitudes people have towards money in our culture, which sometimes is full of greed and ambition and status and showing off. And so there's a reaction against kind of misuse of money or funny ways or in wholesome ways the money is used. But you know, some of it, that's one route perhaps, and some of it comes back maybe to our Judeo-Christian roots also. And you find Jesus, some passages in Jesus where he's very critical of money and wealth. And he has this famous passage where he says it's harder for a wealthy man to enter into heaven than it is. It's as hard as a wealthy person to enter into heaven as it is for a camel to go through, pass through the eye of a needle. And other kind of quotes like that around wealth and money. And then there's this ideal of poverty that you find in Christianity and in our culture. And poverty has a certain ideal. Living in the life of poverty has a lot of value religiously in the Western consciousness. So then some of these, you know, hippies, aging hippies, they weren't aging then, but they were, but they didn't know it. You know, I went to practice Buddhism in Asia or here in this country. And we went to practice in Asia especially. We tended to go practice in the monasteries there. And the monks, nuns, and the monasteries tended to live a life of simplicity that looked like, and you know, we call them monks, it's a monastic life, which was not a Buddhist word. I mean, that's a Christian word, right? So you have to be a little bit careful when you take a Christian word and apply it to another culture and say, I found it there. And so perhaps we should be a little sensitive to the word monk and monastic, maybe it doesn't apply for Buddhism, and maybe we need to kind of look at it from a little bit different angle. But anyway, the ideal in the West of being a monk is an ideal of poverty, the vows of poverty. And so you go out and study, but the monks and nuns in Asia are not supposed to handle money. And they're not supposed to have a lot of possessions. And they're not supposed to have food, for example, after 12 o'clock. They have to forfeit all food. And the next day they have to, whatever food comes their way before noon, they can eat and then they forfeit it. So not handling money, not having a lot of possessions, not just attitude towards money, towards food, looks like they're living lives of poverty. Looks like it lends itself for us with our Western ideas about money to, oh, to kind of support this idea of money is bad, perhaps, and we shouldn't have money, and we should live the life of poverty. But I think that we're kind of, many Buddhists, they kind of impose onto Buddhism Western ideas of money and wealth. And so we still find very strongly, I believe, in Europe, Euro-American based Buddhism in the West, Western ideas about poverty and wealth, and certain kind of uncomfortability with money and wealth in a way that is not the way that money was understood by the Buddha in the early Buddhist tradition. And so it comes a little bit a strange thing to hear this for many Westerners who are studying Buddhism, that the Buddha in many times actually found value in money. Money had value of importance. There was no inherently, nothing inherently wrong with having money and wealth. And there was no particular ideal of poverty. Poverty in and of itself was considered to be an unfortunate status to have. That creates a lot of suffering for people. And the hope was that people wouldn't be poor, and that you'd alleviate the conditions for poverty. And the ideal of a monastic, the simplicity of a monk, wasn't necessarily a vow of poverty. The ideal in Buddhism is not poverty. The ideal in Buddhism is contentment and fewness of desires, having few desires and being content. That's more the ideal than poverty. And how few contentment and fewness of desires expresses itself in your life might vary, but it doesn't necessarily have to mean that you're poor. And the monk, the monastic life, is not an ideal for everybody. It's not like an ideal life in a sense. It's not like an ideal life. Like this is the way everybody should be living in order to follow the religious ideal. The monastic life is a pragmatic strategy, that strategically it's very useful to live this way, not to handle money, not to have food at the 12 o'clock. It's an ideal of simplicity. It's a strategy of simplicity, and it's a strategy of looking, of being confronted with issues around we have with money and food and possessions, issues like ambition and greed and fear and insecurity. So all these things are kind of, you know, you're kind of confronted with the face and deal with. Not because you're supposed to be poor, but because the goal is to live a life where the heart is free and not clinging in any kind of way. And one of the places people cling a lot is around money and their possessions. And so the strategy of monastic life is to look at that by not participating in fully in the simple life. But it's not an ideal of poverty. And the monks, you know, hopefully have lived well and fed well and had lots of medicine and had lots of clothes, you know, have enough robes. They have what they need to live. So the Buddhist tradition then distinguishes between the suffering that arises from not getting what you need versus the suffering that comes from not getting what you want. And those two are two different things. And the monastics are supposed to hopefully, depending on if the laity support them, hopefully the monks have, you know, a comfortable life, though some of us wouldn't believe that. Maybe some of us looks kind of aesthetic, but the Buddha was offering, suggesting a middle path, middle way he called it, between asceticism and indulgence. And for monastics he defined it a certain way. But for laity they find that in a different lifestyle, but still it's the middle way between those two. So the monastics are supposed to have, you know, the basic needs satisfied quite well. So they can devote themselves to their practice and being of service and teaching and whatever they do. What the Buddha criticized was, or was concerned about, was not wealth and money in and of itself, which is kind of a neutral phenomena, but the ways in which it's acquired and the ways in which it's used. And money which is lawfully and morally acquired, the Buddha said it's fine. It's actually considered for a lay person the Buddha said it's fine. It's actually considered for a lay person the Buddha said it was an appropriate goal to acquire money and even become wealthy. Now that resonates kind of a little bit funny among some of us aging hippies. I don't know, you know, all of you. And it's complicated because we have a very, some, there is a very sophisticated analysis of how the economy runs in our culture and our world and how money is acquired and how it circulates. And so money has a lot of deleterious effects the way it's used. And so a lot of people say, well, let's not be involved in it. But in and of itself, money in the Buddhist tradition is understood as being somewhat neutral in and of itself. It has no value in and of itself. It has no value in and of itself. It has no inherent value in and of itself. It has value from how what is associated with how it's acquired and what it can be and how it is used. So that's what the Buddha was concerned about those issues. So certainly money had to be acquired lawfully and morally. And the first three precepts in particular are very important for understanding how appropriate ways of acquiring money or wealth. It should not involve killing, it should not involve stealing. And perhaps the most difficult of all for many of us is it should not involve lying. Because I think a lot of there's a lot of lying that goes on in various professions. It might be very subtle. It's just kind of, is advertisement truth? It's not like lying, is it always? But is it right speech? So the whole area of right speech. So understanding, so looking at one's livelihood and how one acquires money. And is anybody hurt in the process? If no one's hurt in the process of the way you acquire money, the Buddha said it's fine to become wealthy, quite wealthy. And he was quite happy to be supportive of very wealthy people. But then how you use the money. The Buddha was very critical of people who just kept all their money hidden away and never used it. He said that was really stupid. Because if you never use your money, never do anything with it, it's like the analogy he used was, it's like there's this beautiful lake of clear water in the middle of some isolated desert where no one ever lives or no one ever goes. It doesn't have any meat and value for anybody. That lake is a lot better if it was kind of next to a village where there was farms and people could use the water for their farming or whatever. It's kind of empty, it has no value. The value comes from the use of money. And money is just a piece of paper, a piece of plastic nowadays for us in credit cards. And how it's acquired, it has symbolic value for many of us. It represents a lot for us. So for example, money represents, well what it represents comes partly from what we can get from it. So it represents for example for some people status, for some people it represents security, for some people it represents pleasure and joy because you can do happy things with money, you can make yourself happy a little bit. The Buddha said there's two worldly ways that are considered wholesome to be happy. One is to spend your money in ways that make you happy, I mean for pleasure, I mean not for, you know, but I mean spend your money and go to a movie or do nice things with money that kind of brings happiness and pleasure. That's considered to be a nice thing to do by the Buddha. The other way, worldly way of being happy is to do virtuous leads, to live a moral and upright life and to do virtuous things, to be generous and kind and helpful to the world. And that brings happiness. So money represents stuff. And it's interesting for me that I think there's sometimes you hear this attitude that, you know, I paid for it after all. That if it's my money, then it's mine or I have certain rights to it. And the whole notion of me and mine is a study that Buddhists make to understand very well the suffering that arises out of our acquisitiveness, our possessiveness. When we hold really tightly to something, it is mine, it tends to lead to suffering. And if that sense of mind, possessive, comes from our money, then money becomes symbolic in the sense of ourselves. And the tremendous pain that some people feel when they lose all their money. I mean not all their money, but you know what happens when the stock market crashes? How many of you check the stock market to see if the Dow Jones goes up and down? And when it goes down, I don't know, 20 points? Is that enough to kind of go? Is that what it takes or is it 70 points? You know, you're living quite a nice life. You have a job, you have a house, you know, and things are going along quite nicely. And, you know, 70 points. You know, it's depressing. If it went down, you know, 500 points, people are jumping out of windows. What does it represent? Why? I mean, I don't have any answers to these things, but money is very representative of something in our culture. And to understand and begin to thinking about what it represents for us. I was very struck when I was growing up a little bit in Norway. My grandfather went traveling to Germany, I guess it was the Nazi Germany, the late 20s or early 30s. And the inflation was phenomenal. And so they had to, rather than reissuing money all the time, they took their bills and they just stamped higher denomination on top of it. And so he had this bill, you know, it was basically, he told me it's basically worth toilet paper back then. And it had something like 10 million stamped across it. I think originally it was like, I don't know what it was, 100 marks. And then it was stamped, you know, 10 million marks across the top because inflation was so rapid. And I was in Brazil some years ago and when inflation there was very high and people didn't want to use money. They didn't want to touch money. Everybody wanted to use checks because their money in the bank, the bank automatically adjusted for inflation. And as soon as you took the cash out, you weren't adjusted anymore. So you didn't want to touch the money because, you know, in two days, you know, inflation was 30 percent. Because everybody paid by checks as much as they could. And then when I was in Burma, I think I've told the story, you know, I went and changed my American good, American green back money, which American money is worth a lot. It's, you know, the very stable, secure money and you can trust it always. And much of the world trusts American green money. And so I took my green money and I changed it for this thing called Kyat, which is what their denomination is. I changed it a certain amount. So I'd have when I was on retreat, when I needs I had. And when you retreat, you know, in silence for all these months, you can't go to the bank, you can't leave the monastery. You have to rely. So this money you have. Well, the government decided from one evening to the next morning that all the denominations above a dollar were worthless. How could that happen? I mean, money is, you know, you can trust it, right? I mean, that's something you could trust, like anything else. I was just flabbergasted. So the money I had, you know, I woke up in the morning, it was paper, it was toilet paper. What does it represent for us? Money. So it's interesting. People ask me sometimes, well, on the retreat we were teaching, there was, it's kind of tight quarters there a little bit. So there's a dining room and kind of speaking tables outside. And in the middle of this complex of dining room, the picnic tables where the yogis and meditators are eating is the staff room, this little office, title office, where the three teachers and the three staff hang out and eat their meals. And we're not, you know, exactly on retreats in the same way. So we're talking kind of you know, you know, we think it's kind of quiet and mindful and stuff and whatever. And we got a note in the middle of the retreat saying, I think that you in there, I think you guys need a mindfulness bell because the sound coming out of there, I guess was a little bit, occasionally perhaps. But people in mindfulness bells, you know, little bells, something reminds us to be mindful. And I've used going through doorways as being a mindfulness reminder. Every time I go through a doorway, I kind of going into a new space. So I'll take that to check in what's going on, remind myself to wake up as opposed to being lost in my fantasies and ideas and thoughts and worries and whatever. So I propose a mindfulness signal. And then I stand up every time you spend money. Every time you spend money, that's a time to wake up and pay attention. And to find out what, how do you feel? What's going on with you? And that can roll into a whole bunch of interesting study. What, you know, what is your attitude to what you're doing right now? Do you need what you're doing? Money is an interesting place to measure where our priorities are. Because we can say our priorities are X, but if you study where your money goes, it might be Y. And so to study, you know, where does the flow of money go? What is it connecting to? What is it supporting? What is your attitude about your money that you're giving? Are you giving it reluctantly or angrily or resentfully or with resistance? Or are you giving it with some generosity, with some joy? Sometimes I don't like to be overcharged for things. But, you know, but sometimes I don't mind because there are times when the people who are charging me, I know that they don't have a very good life. They're not making much money. And I know that I could go somewhere else and make a little bit, you know, and get a better deal or, you know, whatever. Or, you know, I know that they're kind of like in Asia sometimes or someplace they see an American and they jack the price up. They double the price, you know. And I remember the first time with this triple the price or 10 times the price or whatever. You know, I was in Morocco when I was young, I was 18 and 19. And I asked this guy, we had befriended this guy who sold rugs on the side of the road. This young guy was about our age. And he explained to me his policy, how he decided how much to charge. And he said, depending on what country they came from. And so like Italians, it was twice the price. And Germans, it was four times. But Americans was 10 times. So, but, you know, these people are just struggling. They hardly make, you know, so when people sometimes people overcharge, I said, actually, it's, you know, so it's fine with me. It's kind of nice to support them and help them out a little bit. And I feel even more now because my livelihood now comes almost entirely from people donating money to me, this Donna basket and all that. So I'm kind of in the system where it's kind of like if, you know, I'm receiving people's generosity, I feel even really more inspired now to kind of pass it on being generous to other people for services they do and give people, you know, it's called a tip in our culture, but, you know, be generous and help people out. The movement of generosity, understand where money goes. So the feeling of generosity we give, we pay for something, you know, it's actually can be an act of generosity. Someone's being supported. Many people are being supported by this little act, rather than, you know, all me and mine is being lost. I have this image, you know, that money represents a flow of something in our culture, a flow of energy, a flow of intention, a flow of priorities, a flow of support. And it kind of flows around maybe like a whirlpool or maybe, I don't know how it flows, but when it passes through me, I put a certain spin on that flow and that spins out a little bit. Maybe it goes, I don't know, you know, maybe it's like, you know, an eddy in the water and it kind of goes for a while and then it kind of dissolves in the wider stream, but at least I put a little spin on it for a while. So for example, you know, I buy cigarettes, that puts a certain spin on that money, I believe, and that supports people who do other kinds of things. And, you know, it maybe supports the cigarette companies to do more advertisements, and, you know, and advertising, put more advertisements for kids to get them to smoke, or advertisements for all these women in China who don't smoke, but it's the next big, greatest market in the world is Chinese women. So let's bombard them with all these images of America and how wonderful it is for women to smoke. And so when I buy my cigarettes, you know, I put out a spin on that money. If I, you know, if I go to the local supermarket, like Safeway, a certain spin in the money, that's different little spin if I go to a local kind of corner store. And sometimes the corner store might be a little more expensive, but it's a different spin. And if you think about the spin, then maybe, you know, it affects your priorities. You know, is your priority simply to make as, keep as much money in your own tight little world as possible and not kind of let it go? Or is the purpose of your life to create nice spins? So how, so I think, you know, how is this money being spin? You know, what are you doing with it? I'm kind of fond that when I studied for a while with Eiken Roshi, a Zen teacher in Hawaii, and when you start, when you go to study with him, it's a little bit of a Zen formal kind of system. You have to ask him to become your teacher. And you do it with this little slight ritual that you have to go into the interview room and do your bows and you have to give him a gift, an expression of kind of, of, you know, of your respect, you're honoring him and, and you're sensory and all that. And I thought it was a little bit odd because the gift had to be money. It was slightly funny to me, you know, money, but it was only three dollars. You know, the ritual was very specific, three dollars. But what was more interesting to me was it had to be brand new, crisp dollar bills. Because that somehow, the newness, the cleanliness or whatever, the money, that actually was in some ways an expression also of the respect that was happening in that. It was a transaction, something was happening there. And having these new crisp dollars, as opposed to these crumpled up, you know, half-tour and stained, you know, smells like they've been in someone's butt for, you know, the last two months. You know, there's a little money, you know, money has a different feel to it. So, so it was an expression of something to have, you had to go to the bank and ask for these crisp dollar bills and put it in a nice little envelope. And so what do we express in our money is the question. The Buddha, well, I'll say one more thing here. So the how to acquire money. So the Buddha said various things about that. But there's a beautiful poem where he talks, gives kind of an model or analogy for how to acquire money. So the poem goes like this. The wise who are trained and disciplined shine out like beacon lights. They earn money just as a bee gathers honey without harming the flowers. And they let it grow as an ant tail slowly gains in height. With wealth wisely gained, they use it for the benefit of all. And I love that image of, you know, a bee gathering honey, it doesn't disturb the flower at all. So to gather wealth, to gather your money in a way that doesn't harm anything around you, it just, you know, and just gathering it, you know, like a hunt, like a bee. And let it grow like an ant tail. I suppose that means let it grow slowly, I suppose, but also ant tail, I guess, is stable. So let go of some stability. So the Buddha said, the Buddha suggested various things. But one thing he said was about spending your money. One way, there's four areas, four, four, you divide up your money in four parts, he said. One was one fourth you should spend on yourself for your requisites and needs. Two fourths of it, half of it, you should reinvest into your business, if you have a business that's appropriate, I guess. I don't know how we... And the last fourth, you... Oh, now I forget, but I think the last quarter must be for the giveaway to support other people. And this idea of generosity, of giving, is really central to the Buddhist tradition, to be generous. It's the first spiritual practice actually we're supposed to practice. Buddha offered a gradual training in spiritual life. And for him, the spiritual life begins with developing generosity. Not so much because generosity is a good thing for society and other people, which it is, but it's good for your own spiritual inner life to be generous. You do it almost for yourself. What it takes to be generous in a genuine way requires a kind of open-heartedness, a kind of letting go of acquisitiveness, of greed, of ambition, of holding things tight, of me and mine. It requires an openness, of connectedness to other people, a sensitivity to other people. And all those are necessary qualities for the development of a spiritual life. And the Buddha started with generosity because without the development of those strong qualities, it's actually very hard to go on and continue with the other points in the spiritual life. And I've been thinking a little bit recently about how the idea of understanding no-self, selflessness in Buddhism goes together with a training that develops qualities of being, which in the Western parlance is considered to belong to a very strong self. Though there's no self in Buddhism, but we have these qualities become very strong. Qualities of honesty, of energy, quality of effort, quality of paying attention, qualities of love, qualities of generosity. So generosity is one. There's a beautiful Zen Koan, a story, where someone comes to a Zen master, Weihai, and says, what is the gate of Zen? What's the gate? And Weihai says, complete giving. And that is a beautiful answer. You know, he didn't say enlightenment or he didn't say, what's the gate of Zen? What I love about this is that the word gate, you can both, it's a place where you enter and you exit. So what's the entrance and the exit from Zen? It's generosity. What's the beginning and end of Buddhism, a Buddhist practice? It's generosity. And whether you think it's the beginning practice or the culmination of your spirituality, it's the same. It's generosity. So having money allows a person to be generous. One of the values of acquiring money is it gives you the opportunity to be generous. It gives you opportunity to participate in the spin. And you participate for how you acquire. Living simply is also one way of creating spins and not having a lot of money. Remember, contentment and fewness of wishes is a primary virtue. Generosity is a primary virtue. Yes. I just wanted to say something about the rich man and the eye of the needle. Yes. I'm not a biblical scholar, but I've heard that what that's talking, actually the way it's translated is, it's harder, it's hard for a rich man with his wealth to enter the kingdom of heaven as it is for his camel to go through the eye of the needle. The eye of the needle was a real place. In order to pass through that pass, the baggage had to be taken off the camel. So it's harder for rich people to go through attached to their life. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. As it is for people to go to heaven attached. That's beautiful. So that's really what it is. Maybe. There's a lot of things which you understand the context. They have a different meaning than the way they've often been interpreted. It's often been interpreted in the history of Christianity as being very critical of wealth, but not always, but beautiful. I think it's a really appropriate way of understanding it. So the whole thing about clinging is really also clean. What are you holding onto? So how do you hold your wealth? You hold your wealth generously with, or you hold it really tight to yourself like a miser. Being a miser is considered to be one of the terrible sufferings in Buddhism. And then the last thing I'll say is, I read a poem here some months ago. And the beautiful image of the poem was something like, you know, if you're holding a little bird in your hand and you hold it really tight, it's not a bird. But you hold it loosely and let it fly, it becomes a bird. Some things are not really things, not really what they're meant to be if you hold them too tightly. So what else do you have to say about money? Thank you. What else, anybody? You know, we're uncomfortable with it, we're afraid of it, we want more of it, we're insecure about it. Yes? I've been thinking during this evening that why it has a feeling in America, especially, although maybe it's the same in the rest of the world, I don't know, but money in this country is power. And power to me usually seems to operate when there's fear and inner instability. And money has become a catch to all of that. Both of my grandfathers committed suicide during the Depression, both of them. And they lost parts of their fortunes. Parts. Not the entire thing, but a great deal of them. And my parents would say, oh, that was just the Depression. Let me just give a team deal, let me know, thanks very much. But I think it is somehow connected to power. And I think that's one reason that the young people of the 60s and 70s do not want to be connected to that kind of strangling power. Yeah, I think very much so. The way it was being used in our culture is very dangerous. Right. I don't, I, probably it's used that way everywhere. I don't know, but certainly in our culture it's felt very oppressively so. So it takes a lot to study. So the moment of mindfulness when you use money is not just, you know, what's going on in that moment itself, but it's what we're connected to, what we're connected to when we use the money. Carl Marx said something beautiful, my thoughts about money. He said money can either unite us or separate us. And so what's our choice? When we use it, are we using it to separate ourselves or connect us with others? And power separates us. And I thought of the same thing today because on the radio today or yesterday, they talked about all the, how money's being used at the party conventions. And that's exactly what they said, that the money's being used as access to power. Yes. So we need something to dissolve the clot. I'm not going to write it up, but if someone transcribes this, then I might work on it. I'm not going to write it up. The average American household has a credit card debt of $5,000. American family. That's where the papers have lasted. I haven't paper, I don't know. Paper. They're spending it. Yes. I wonder if anyone knows where money got started. Money. It existed in time of the Buddha. It existed at the time of the Buddha, so I'm predated. I don't know how old it goes back. It's an interesting question. I'm sure there's books on anthropology. There's a very nice book to be read. I recommend, called The Gift. Actually, several books go to the same title, but the one that's published, Not by Mouse, Moose. It's a book that was published first in the 1920s, but it was published, this was published in the late 70s. It's called The Gift. And it's a beautiful, the first half of it is a beautiful discussion about gifts and generosity and money. It talks about different anthropological studies in different parts of the world and what money and gift giving means in our culture and how it flows. I really recommend it if you're interested in the subject. The subtitles come in something called The Erotic Life, The Gift, The Erotic Life of Money. No. The Erotic Life of... Anyway, it's a beautiful book. I haven't read it. I think it's well worth. I've thought for some time to give a talk about money, but I thought, well, I better spend a lot of time studying and learning something about it and reading those books. Because I feel like it's really a juicy subject. There's a lot going on in money because money is just a piece of paper. Definitely more is going on than a piece of paper. But anyway, because of this phone call yesterday, I just blabbed away. Yes. There's the ... Okay, great. I was also thinking about feeling on the other end of a spin. Yes. And so I did accept it and it's been really interesting to be on that end and I really do feel some larger thing happening. Beautiful. Beautiful. I think it's beautiful. Learning to receive is as important as learning to give. And if we value giving and we can't receive, we're not, you know, it's not very nice. And being on the receiving end of a spin, no matter what, but there's different spins we receive. But that's what I mean, I feel it all the time. I'm on the receiving end of the spin of all the people who give me Dhanana. And that affects me deeply. I'm in that kind of spin. I'm kind of spinning in that, I'm spinning away, you know? You know, it's a powerful spin to have my livelihood come from that kind of strange, un-American kind of way of living a life. And it really deeply affects me and deeply appreciative and I hope that I really want to keep spinning things in that direction, keep spinning with those kind of values. I'm going to live my life that way. And I consider how I use the money that I get because of the way I've gotten it. Last one. Yes. I was in a group last night and a speaker made this quote and it's so good, it's a shame not to share it with you and it relates to what you've been talking about. It went this way, this is about three sentences. If you want to be happy for an hour, take a nap. If you want to be happy for a day, go fishing. If you want to be happy for a month, get married. If you want to be happy for a year, inherit some money. If you want to be happy for life, do something for others. It's an anonymous source. Beautiful. Beautiful. And it said, one of the practices of Buddhism is to reflect and enjoy and celebrate our good deeds. And so doing something for others is a good deed and you carry that with you for your life to make you happy. So thank you very much. Thank you.
