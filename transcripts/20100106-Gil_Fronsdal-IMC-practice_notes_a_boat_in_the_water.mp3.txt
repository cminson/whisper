Practice Note : A Boat in the Water  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

When doing meditation, both seated meditation and 
walking meditation, the two primary partners for that 
practice are mindfulness and concentration . One image 
I have for how they  work together is that of a boat 
moving through water. The bow of the boat just  ploughs 
through the water, and the water parts for the b oat and 
creates a wake . The water just falls t o the side  and is 
left behind. So to some degree, when you set your 
course, the bow of your boat, on your breathing, the 
idea is to have some continuity with the breath, to be 
able to hang in there, to be mindful of the breathing . 
That’s where the bow of the boat is . All kinds of stuff 
may come up – all kinds of thoughts and feelings. 
Different things come up, and for the most part , you just 
let it be like the water that washes off the side and  
becomes the wake, and falls back. J ust keep the 
course.  
 
A big part of mi ndfulness is having that steadiness, that 
concentration, the continuity of one thing , because the 
mind does not necessarily have it s best interests at 
heart . What the mind thinks about is not really in your 
best interest, and so to simply follow the course  of the mind, whatever way it takes you, is usually not that 
useful . And it  keeps you from being settled, because the 
mind can jump around a lot. You are much better off 
getting some basic settledness.  
 
You have to find some way not to give in to all the 
thoughts that come up, and to not be so interested in 
them , and to have a different interest. So the idea is to 
be really interested in where the bow of the boat is set:  
on the breath, or in walking meditation it ’s set on the 
feet. There ’s the rhythm of bre athing in and breathing 
out, or the rhythm of stepping, one step after the other. 
And the idea is to somehow collect oneself, gather 
oneself around , so that ’s the tip of the boat . That’s 
where you ’re gathered. The boat is there, and that ’s 
what you ’re doin g. A lot of things will come up, and you 
allow them  to just wash off. Often you have to 
remember to go back , but for other things, you can let 
them  wash off.  
 
Unless, of course, it becomes quite compelling, what 
else is going on, and then you change the course of 
your boat. If some  really strong sensations in the body 
come up, then you aim the bow of the boat on those 
strong sensations to really take them in . And you really 
get to know them, and then to  allow surface thoughts to 
just wash off and fall off. And just keep the course , 
focusing on that. Or if strong emotions come up, the 
same thing, you just turn the boat , and keep it focused on that in a clear , cons istent way, gathering yourself 
around that experience. And again , with things that are 
nothing to do with that, you can for the most part just let 
them wash off.  
 
A lot of things can wash off . You’ll be amazed, how 
many things are really not that necessar y. Just let them 
wash off, hold your course , and take some effort to do 
that.  
 
I hope you hold your course today.
