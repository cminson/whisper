Okay, well why don't we go ahead and get started this morning.
So welcome to IMC's Sunday morning sit, whether it's morning where you are or not.
It's really nice to be sitting together.
So we'll begin just with our simple meditation.
So perhaps taking a posture that's upright and also relaxed.
And if you're comfortable doing so, you can close your eyes.
Just begin to bring the attention through the body.
Allowing any thoughts or energy that you had to get here to get in front of the computer.
Letting that settle out.
Sometimes looking at a screen the mind enters a certain mode and so we can relax that out also and really just feel the body sitting.
The contact of your seat against the chair or the cushion or the bench.
The bed wherever you're sitting.
Feeling your legs or your feet against the floor.
The sense of stability, groundedness where you're sitting.
Perhaps softening those contact points so that you feel gently connected to what is supporting you.
And allowing it to support you.
Maybe taking a couple of long, slow, deep breaths.
Letting go of any tension in the body that is willing to let go at this moment.
Perhaps softening the eyes in the eye sockets.
The muscles of the face.
Softening down through the shoulders.
The shoulder blades slide down the back so that the shoulders drop naturally without rounding forward.
Down into the belly area.
Letting that feel round, soft.
Maybe dropping a little lower down into the abdomen area.
Feeling how when the belly relaxes, there's a little bit more flexibility in the lower spine so that it can find just that balance point.
There's the feeling of stability down where we're sitting and then also feeling of openness or uplift through the middle part of the spine.
And softening the arms and the legs.
There's no sense of bracing.
And feeling also along with the softening, a sense of energy, perhaps contained in the straightness of the spine, whether you're upright or lying down, there can be a feeling of straightness.
A sense of energy.
And what unifies the softening, the calm, and the energy is the breath.
Close throughout the whole body.
Close throughout the whole body.
And then inviting that same ease into the mind.
The ease of having a soft, receptive mind, and the ease of having an energetic, alert mind.
To the body and the mind are also in harmony.
And all of this isn't so much an engineering project as an invitation
in this balanced way of being to whatever degree it's available.
To be at ease in general with how things are now for you.
It's interesting with the breath.
And after we've settled in for a few more minutes, going to read a verse.
Either just let it pass through the mind and continue with your usual practice, or you may wish to let it resonate for you and see how it affects the rest of the city.
Okay.

Okay.
So cool.
If there is something in these teachings calling out to you.
It's because something in you is calling out to these teachings.
And it will take you whenever you're ready, just as you are.

as we continue to sit noticing or even just sensing that the path is this. The path is the flow of experience moment by moment. It's not found anywhere else.
And so there's this sense that the path can take us right now, letting yourself flow along with that in some way, however that resonates for you.
