 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at adiodarma.org. Hello and welcome back to our series of Ansati Patana and the four foundations for awareness, for developing our mindfulness. And this particular part, exercise the first one of the discourse, can be understood very simply that there's a path of development, there's a growth, there's an unfolding. And to summarize the text very briefly in terms of the verbs, the activities that we're doing, there is a goal which is to observe. And how do we observe? By first knowing, then feeling, experiencing, and then relaxing. And this is how we come to a meditative ability to observe our experience. And so in this ancient teachings of the Buddha, observing, just watching experience, is considered to be a very high kind of attainment. It's something that's not meant to, the word observing is always used for deep meditation or very strong, well-developed meditation. And the way to develop that is to cultivate, develop our attentional faculties. So first just simply to know. And then once we know something, also to feel it, to experience it in a deeper way. And then in doing so then, it gives us the opportunity, once we feel something, to also relax it or to bring a tranquility to what's there. So in terms of breathing then, the text, it's the goal is to observe the body in terms of the body, just very simply to observe. And the day to observe here means without interference, and without the interference of our judgments and our expectations and our agendas, it's kind of like, almost like sitting back and letting things be just as they are, but have this powerful ability, penetrating ability just to watch. And so the way we do it is first we know our breathing, and we develop as capacity, as knowing faculty. And then once we know it well, then we begin to drop into it to feel it more deeply. And then we can allow ourselves to relax the whole body as we breathe. So there's this unfolding that goes on, and as we do this, or get strong, then at some point we can just settle back to observe the experience of what's happening. So that's this, you know, one way of talking about this journey that we take in this kind of meditation. So to assume a meditative posture, and to lower your gaze to the floor, and gently close your eyes. And then to know the first step of this breathing exercise, to know it well, and to kind of establish the knowing, take a few long, slow, deep breaths, and know that you're breathing. If you really want to know that you're breathing, maybe because the mind is distracted, hold your breath a little bit, the top of the in-breath, and hold it at the end of the exhale. Not for a long time, but enough time to get your attention. So that when you start breathing in and out, you really know you're breathing in and out. Here you're establishing yourself to know the breathing. And you could also relax on the exhale, softening the body. And then letting the breathing return to normal without a high standard of what normal is, just as it happens to be. And in settling in to the breathing, it helps to relax the body. The more tension there is in the body, the more likely we get distracted. There's an art to relaxing into the body breathing. Relaxing the muscles of the face. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the belly. And then settling in and taking some time to get to know your breathing, the experience of breathing. Get to know how the body experiences breathing. Know the breathing as being short or long breaths. Shallow or deep. Where is the greatest movement in your body as you breathe? Know the movement in the chest or the belly or the movement of air in and out through your nostrils. Like they say that no two snowflakes are the same. No two breaths are the same. Breathing each day will be different. So to know and recognize very simply your breathing. And as you know it, allow yourself to experience it. Allow yourself to feel how the body feels, how the body experiences breathing. And this feeling is different than knowing. And the two support each other. Sometimes we know, sometimes we feel. And perhaps you can rest in the body's experience of breathing. If your mind winters off in thought. Relax the thinking muscle. Soften the mind. Quiet the mind. And surrendering yourself to the experience of breathing. Breathing. Breathing. And if it feels appropriate, you can relax your body more. Breathing in, maybe softening, relaxing. Bringing a tranquility to your body. As you exhale, relaxing, tranquilizing the body. Maybe with a feeling that the breathing. Breathe through whatever physical tranquility there is. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. If the mind wanders off. Come back to knowing your breathing. And then feeling the body breathing. And then relaxing if that's possible. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. And then see if you can settle back and just watch your breathing. Observe it coming and going. Observe how you're engaged in the breathing. Little bit like having a bird's eye view, just watching your self practice. Watching that needs nothing to happen. Not trying to accomplish anything except to watch. Watching the comings and goings of the inhale. Comings and goings of the exhale. Like watching the waves coming and going up on the sandy shore. Nice relaxed vacation day, just observing the waves of breathing in the body. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Watching is to perceive without any agenda. Without any time, past and future. To perceive and allow what's perceived to be what it is, not interfering with anything. Settling back, opening up, observing the flow of life that appears in breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. When we see with our eyes, it's possible to see like the way the Buddha sees. With the eyes tranquil, with calm eyes. With eyes that are not staring or fixating on anything, not searching. Not pulling back. Quiet, cool, calm eyes. Whether it's the inner eye that perceives or the real eyes. What supports a tranquility, a body and mind, are eyes that are tranquil. The eyes that are the link between the outer world and the inner world. And may it be that as you go about your days, that your care, your goodwill, can travel through calm eyes, eyes that are tranquil. Eyes that can look without straining, working. Eyes that are not afraid or angry. Eyes that allow us to really be present for someone while we stay relaxed and open. May it be that our practice of mindfulness, of knowing, feeling, relaxing and observing, may it be for the welfare and happiness of the world. May we do it to benefit ourselves and to benefit others. May all beings, ourselves included, be happy. May all beings, self included, be safe. May all beings, self included, be peaceful. And may all beings, self included, be free. And in doing so, may our eyes be liberated from attachments and fear, anger, resentment. No hostility in the eyes. No greed in the eyes. Just a calm observing of this profound world we live in. Thank you.
