Practice Note : Sing Your Mental Noting

I think it’s probably fair to say that for most of us , it’s not 
that easy to meditate. We sit down with the idea of 
staying in the present moment,  staying focused on the 
breath or on our steps as we walk. Then,  whatever our 
intention is to stay present  and b e aware of what’s going 
on, it can be hard because the mind gets involved in 
thoughts a nd imaginations , or gets caught by feelings, 
emotions, desires, or aversions. Sometimes  we can be 
aware of it , let go or step back from it , and come back to 
the breath – but we easily get pulled back ag ain. 
Sometimes we can multitask. We can kind of  be with 
the breath or with our feet as we walk, but in the 
background , there is this churning of a thoug ht, 
concern , or emotion. We’re still caught and involved.  
 
One of the really wonderful practice techniques in our 
tradition is mental noting or labeli ng. Some people don’t 
like it. They  may have strong feelings about not wanting 
to do mental noting. It’s sometimes taught as a 
continuous practice. Today  I want to mention one  of the 
many values of mental noting , and that is when you find 
yourself e ntangle d and caught up with thoughts and 
concerns . Maybe you can let go momentarily and come back , or you can’t even let go  and the thoughts are just 
churning along . That might be a really good time to use 
intentional mental labeling of what’s happening. It could  
be as simple as saying , “Thinking .” Or it could be , 
“Thinking about the dinner menu .” Sometimes  noting  
can be more than just a simple word . You clearly 
identif y what it is , and then – without thinking too much 
about the exact right word – you label it . Just this simple 
acknowledgement  of what you’re  doing helps you step 
back  – and you’re not so entangled.  
 
But sometimes simple  noting is not enough. Part of the 
opportunity with mental noting is that you can note in 
different ways , so that it changes your p erspective of 
what’s happening and helps pull you back more. For 
example, you can silently note in your mind much more 
loudly than you would normally. You can say it loud and 
clear , like you’re going to let the world know. You don’t 
say it out loud, of course, but “Thinking, thinking, I’m 
really thinking . This is thinking. Wow , am I thinking!  This 
is really  thinking .” If you acknowledge what you’re 
caught in  loudly or vigorously , pretty soon the energy of 
your mind goes  into the noting , rather than  flowing into 
that entanglement.  
 
When the  acknowledgement becomes really big , 
sometimes  you get a different pe rspective. It’s like, “This 
is ridiculous.” You know you’re thinking about the  same 
thing over and over again. You say it really loudly as if all your friends could hear , and then you realize that this 
is really silly. “Why  am I ca ught up in dinner menu 
planning?  Why am I reviewing what happened at the 
high school prom? ”  
 
A variation of mental noting is if you keep telling yo urself 
the same thing – as in a common thread  or belief 
system  – maybe  that you’re completely inadequate as a 
human being . Then you repeatedly say that really loud ly 
in your mind : “I’m really inadequate! ” You don’t do it  in a 
subtle place where you continue to believe the thoughts 
and they’re influencing everything. But you broadcast it 
throughout your mind , and even sing it : [sings] “I’m 
really inadequate. Boy , am I ever inadequate!  I’m the 
most inadequate person in the whole universe , and I 
really know  it.” Try to get into it.  After  a while, you say,  
“This is silly ,” and it helps lo osen up the grab or the pull 
these thoughts  have on you . It changes the perspective 
of it all.  
 
If you continue with business as usual and keep noting  
in the same way , then you kind of stay in it . But, if you’re 
stuck and need a little break to loosen you  up, then try 
something a little mo re dramatic. Then you can go back 
to a more quiet , subtle way of noting – or not noting – 
and being present.  
 Make some sense ? Have fun with it. Sing your mental 
noting. You’ll find your mood changes quickly.  So now 
enjoy your morning.
