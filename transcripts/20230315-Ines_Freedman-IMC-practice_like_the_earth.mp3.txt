 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. The theme of the day will be one of equanimity, which points to a mind that's balanced, composed, and calm. And it stays balanced regardless of what happens, whether the power is out or not. It's a mind that has nothing to defend. So I'm going to read a quote that the Buddha taught, teaching that the Buddha gave his son, Rahula. Rahula, develop meditation that is like the earth. For then, agreeable and disagreeable feelings and sensations will not take charge of your mind. Just as when people throw what is clean and unclean on the earth, feces, urine, saliva, pus, or blood, the earth is not horrified, humiliated, or disgusted by it. In the same way, agreeable and disagreeable feelings and sensations will not take charge of your mind when you develop meditation like the earth. So let's sit.
