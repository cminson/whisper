Peter, okay. Great.
Hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to Happy Hour. It's such a delight to be with you, to be sharing the space together.
And I'm delighted today is in many countries celebrated as Christmas Day. And of course, in Australia, as Marie-Christine is joining us and others would be joining us.
It's already the 26th. So, and also for many countries, it's, it's honored, but it's not celebrated. I was born in Tehran, Iran.
And where, again, it's acknowledged, Christmas is acknowledged, but not celebrated, of course, as big as here. So, so the theme I wanted to invite us to explore for, for the, for Happy Hour today is the theme of
reaching out, reaching out to others is an act of meta.
And I'm not meaning just reaching out to support them, to give them, but just reaching out to touch someone, reaching out even for support, reaching out and sharing of yourself, reaching out and telling people it's, it's an act of meta.
It's an act of sharing, connecting with others. It's letting other people in and it could be a matter of reaching out and saying, Hey, I need support. I need help. I want to reach out to you and, and talk to you.
I feel alone today. That too is an act of meta, not just meta to yourself, but also meta to the other person, because you allow them to be there for you.
You are reaching out, allowing your, you're opening this channel, you're revealing of yourself, you're being vulnerable or say, just as I shared with you earlier that I wasn't going to say, but hey, yeah, it's true.
It's my birthday. Oh, there's a sense of vulnerability, perhaps in that. And then all the, all the good wishes and greetings come. So it's a sense of, oh, yes, just as there is this sense of delight, there's a sense of gratitude of reaching out.
No appreciating that there is this, allowing this, this reciprocity of meta and care to come back to you, to come back towards you. So without making it too complicated, as I will lead us in an exploration tonight, is really acknowledging
that opening our hearts, opening our hearts, opening the channel, opening the channel, and it might be reaching out to someone, asking for support, reaching out, sharing something about ourselves, a matter of water, or something.
Well, me asking for help, vulnerability, et cetera, is actually opening up the channel of meta, opening this reciprocity. Otherwise, it's blocked. There is no coming and going that can happen. And our lives get enriched.
And the other people's lives get enriched because, oh, they've been able to be there for us, that they've been able to support, to give, to connect, and connection with care is an expression of meta.
So I hope that this simple concept makes sense, as I'm explaining it. It's basically opening up. It's not just you giving meta, but opening yourself up to receiving, to receiving care.
That actually is something that we usually don't consider when we practice. This practice, when we cultivate loving kindness, it's not just for us to share and give, but for us to realize our common humanity, realize our vulnerability,
realizing whatever it is about, you know, that, yes, we have so much to give, and we can also receive.
So, we pause for a moment and think if there's anything else conceptually I want to say before we just dive into exploring this together.
Yeah, let's just explore it together. How about that? Let's just do it. So, I'd like to invite you all to get into your meditation posture.
Whether you're needing to shift, move, lie down, or sit straighter.
And landing. Landing in your body. Landing with the breath.
And letting go.
Letting go of the thoughts and we'll use the metaphor we used last night, yesterday, as thoughts come up.
Seeing them, holding them as if they're ornaments. As if they're ornaments.
Christmas tree ornaments, looking at them, examining them, appreciating them and not holding them, hanging them on the tree.
So, they have a nice place to be in the corner of the room, not taking over the whole space of the mind.
So, they are honored, appreciated, and don't have to be held. Your arms are coming full.
You can hang them there and just being, sitting, silently enjoying. Breathing.
Breathing.
Putting down, putting down, putting aside all these ornaments of the mind, all these thoughts, hanging them on the Christmas tree.
Just letting yourself sit. Landing in the body, breathing, resting.
Taking delight in the simplicity of just this breath in this moment.
The whole world that is just sitting and receiving the breath.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Again, if more ornaments of the mind, shiny objects, these thoughts come up, thinking them, observing them and hanging them on the tree.
Coming back to the body, to the breath, receiving this preciousness of the moment, this moment's presence, the shiniest of all, and its simplicity and beauty.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
The entire in-breath, the entire out-breath, received in the abdomen.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing, letting yourself feel your feet connected to the earth.
Your sit bones on the cushion, your hands on your lap or each other.
Receiving each breath in the body, sensations of it, as if it's a present, a new present in this moment, as if you're unwrapping a present.
You have no idea what's in it.
Oh, it's a new breath.
What would it be like to approach, to receive each breath as a present you're unwrapping?
How does that shift your attitude to the present moment?
You don't know exactly what this breath is going to be like.
It's going to shift with ripens.
Look, it's a shallow breath.
Look, it's a long breath.
Interest, curiosity, delight, as if you've never breathed before as the first one.
And now, another first one.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Hang in there with the breath, a sense of it being a present to your opening.
You can transform your practice.
You know how to do this.
Breathing.
Opening the present of each glorious breath.
Feeling sensing it in this moment.
With the gloriousness of your awareness in this moment.
Expansive, receptive, spacious.
This moment is a gift.
Unrapping it with awareness.
With curiosity, with awe, with surprise.
This moment, it's new, slightly different from the previous moment.
Has it never been experienced in this way ever?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
It never will be again?
Now I would like to invite you, if you wish.
As you stay embodied, feeling the breath in the body.
Feeling the breath in the abdomen, the chest and the heart center.
The whole body.
Imagining.
But you reach out, you reach out to a few people who are important to you.
From your present to your past.
You reach out to them and you invite them.
Invite them to a party for you.
You reach out, opening the channel.
Basically, the reaching out is, hey I care about you, you're important to me.
That's an expression of metta.
And bring a few people to mind that you're reaching out to.
And this imaginary gathering.
Staying with each being that you're inviting in your mind, in your heart.
Connecting with your heart that you care about this person.
They're important to you, they've been important to you.
The reaching out, the invitation is an act of care.
Metta, goodwill from you.
Opening the channel.
The flow.
The reaching out with a few people.
Staying with each first few seconds appreciating them.
As you're inviting them.
As if in your heart you're writing an invitation to them.
I would like your presence.
Will you please come?
I appreciate you, I care about you.
You're important to me.
Reaching out.
And seeing how they feel touched.
And appreciated that you reached out to them.
Inviting them, appreciating them.
You reached out to them.
To support you.
To show up for you.
And how that enlivened something in your heart, your connection with this being.
How you appreciate them and how they appreciate you.
Appreciate the connection you've had to take your time to assemble your invitation list.
Connecting with each person in your heart.
Feeling them appreciating, being invited, called on in this way.
And now, if you wish, imagining that they all show up for you.
They're all present.
You've invited them, they've come.
You reached out and they reached back to you.
They're gazing at you.
And you can either imagine them physically in a circle all around you.
Or given that this is 2020, you can imagine it's a virtual gathering.
They're all showed up on Zoom.
Present for you, gazing at you.
Their face on the screen, looking at you, all these beings you invited.
Experiment with either, see which one works better for you.
Just feeling yourself held, supported, cared for.
Receiving that talent.
Let yourself feel receiving the care front of you or all around you.
People who care about you, who've been part of your life, they showed up for you.
You showed up for them in different times, in different ways.
You're either feeling the metta collectively or highlighting each person, one person at a time.
Or one group at a time and feeling the exchange of metta between you.
They care for them, they care for you.
Breathing, keeping the images, the felt sense.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Appreciating that this giving and receiving of goodwill and metta in this version of it became possible because you reached out.
You reached out.
You connected, you opened your heart by acknowledging the other person and your dependence, your care for them.
And how important they are to you, expressing that which is an aspect of vulnerability you're important to me.
I care for you, please come. It matters to me.
See that how that reaching out and expressing your needs is an act of metta expressing your heart's wish to connect.
It's an act of metta to others to allow them to care and an act of metta to yourself.
Seeing this invisible thread, maybe in your image, is a golden thread of connection between all your hearts.
You're connected in this web of humanity.
Appreciating the beauty and the grace of this interconnection and how you can act on it.
To increase your goodwill, to brighten the light shining of your goodwill.
And those of others, you can take the first step.
May all of our steps together collectively to open our hearts, to reach out and care and metta for ourselves or others to make connection, increase goodwill care, love in our interconnected world, and serve all of humanity.
With more love, care, ease and awakening.
Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice.
So I'll change the settings if you like to share.
You can either raise your hand
or you can type in chat in your reflections.
But you like to share about this realization, this way of practicing.
Now reaching out is an expression of metta is opening our heart and allowing others to reach back out and be for us.
It's a very interesting realization in metta, in daily life, in real world.
So I would love to hear from you if you wish. Why did you realize what came up for you?
And again, first I'd like to invite folks who usually don't share, who hold back.
All right, now I'm going to open it to everyone, whoever would like to share reflections, please.
I would love to hear your wisdom, your opinion, your reflections, your thoughts are important.
Marie-Christine says, does reaching out give the other person the opportunity to increase their married points?
I think that's one way to think about it also.
It's an interesting way to think about that in that perspective.
And I think maybe perhaps it's a way of seeing it as a cultivation.
I appreciate that. So it's basically reaching out, inviting them.
It's creating an opportunity for them to cultivate.
Yeah, I like that. Thank you, Marie-Christine.
Erica says, I appreciated the visual of the gold thread connecting all. That's lovely.
Yeah, thank you. And I see Diana, please.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
I had such difficulty when it came to imagining, I was moving along and just really relaxed and everything.
But the image of imagining my party and the people, because there was an incident today.
I was about to attend the small Christmas party and it turned ugly in terms of, yeah.
Someone canceled at the last minute and there's been a habit of this and it caused such ill will all day.
People going back and forth and like this.
So that's why I was so happy to come tonight.
So finally, I just stayed with listening and stayed with the breathing because I was blocked.
I couldn't find anyone to invite at this moment of my dear people.
And so what happened was after a while, it seemed to me, well, invite some other people.
It didn't have to be them. And so I reached around.
So I found a person from past and since I was in this mode, so I was very grateful for this time.
You said take your time and it can be this person or that person.
So I got unstuck and managed to put together a really nice group of people and got through the metaphor and everything.
And it was much better. So I think we can do that with a lot of things.
But I had such a fix.
Yeah.
Great. Dan, thank you so much for sharing because what you shared is such a fantastic example of how our minds,
and it's not personal about how our minds get fixated on what's hard.
And then what I love and how you shared is then you thought, okay, how can I work with this?
Oh, I'll just invite other people.
Like there are plenty of people in my past.
And then from what I gather, it was a healing experience.
It was just so healing to be in your mind with your heart, with this group of people whom you invited and they showed up.
And it was healing and there was metta and especially what had happened earlier today.
And this might actually have been a nice healing experience.
So thank you for sharing how creativity working with that, not staying stuck anyway, but finding ways around it.
Yay.
Terrific.
Thank you, Diana.
That is just lovely.
Yeah.
And Claire, I see your hand is up.
Please.
Oops.
I lost Claire.
Sorry, I had a really quickly experienced today that I just wanted to share because it was such a great example of how giving metta can can come back in the sense of helping one feel wonderful.
It was very spontaneous. I live in an apartment building where there are only two apartments on a floor.
And as I was about to, I was doing something that involved opening my front door.
I happened to notice that my neighbors who are relatively new in the building and much younger than me were coming in on Christmas day with all their luggage and I thought, gee, that's all strange.
So I actually had a gift for them. So I said, oh, quickly here. I'm delighted you're here. This was for you. I meant to give it to them before they had been away.
So the husband was going in and he took the package. He said, yes, he said, you know, we just lost all our power of state.
And they had their whole Christmas was ruined because it was freezing cold and they had two young children.
And so I actually is just spontaneously said, well, do you have any food? It was as though I were living in the country.
You know, I was very would have been very happy. We hadn't had our dinner yet. I would have been glad to have them over.
And we had a big roast. I could have had them over for dinner.
But I really appreciated my reaching out like that.
Oh, I'm touched as you talk about it, just as simple at reaching out and then hearing the story and just, oh, my heart is buoyed hearing that.
It made me feel so wonderful. It made my day special.
Yeah, exactly. It's the most genuine and spontaneous.
Yeah, beautiful. I love that. It's a great example of of reaching out, reaching out, you know, in this in this metaphorical example,
it is reaching out and inviting and here you're reaching out, you're giving you a gift and it creates this connection and you feel better for showing up your humanity.
Oh, thanks for sharing that Claire. That's lovely. That that that makes me happy hearing it secondhand even that's lovely. Thank you.
And a couple of quick comments here.
Let's see. Forrest says, had difficulty connecting with this meditation, though I'm not sure why can you say more about what you feel in your heart when you visualize it. It's really a sense of calling for us.
I mean, just as Claire was saying, reaching out, reaching out to another human being is just feel into the reaching out.
So that would be kind of the opening, the getting into this practice in this way. That's the quick thing I can say. And Eric says, I felt very touched by this meditation.
In my party, we had we held hands and express gratitude for being present for each other.
Oh, that is so sweet. That's lovely. That makes me very happy. Thank you, Eric.
So dear ones, time is flying. So let's, let's get into our practice groups and small groups tonight and and sharing it by reaching out or maybe in small groups, you're reaching out, you're reaching out by by sharing your metta by inviting
by telling people in your group whom you might have just met or met before that you care about them. It's important to you. It's just feeling that thread of connection of humanity between you.
So I'm about to create the rooms. And here we go. I'm going to open them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, everyone, the rooms are closed. We're all back. And we have just about a minute.
Okay everyone, the rooms are closed, we're all packed, and we have just about a minute.
So I'd like to invite you, any reflections you'd like to share, you can either type them
in chat, and any reflections from the groups, what that was like, and please you can raise
your hand, type it in chat, I'll stay a couple of extra minutes after you formally close
for singing, as Mara Cristini is suggesting in chat.
So any reflections you want to share about the group, it would be lovely to hear one
thing before we go, especially if you haven't spoken yet.
Okay, I don't see any takers for reflections, okay.
So tell you what, Catherine says, it's hard to open yourself up when people you've loved
in the past broke your trust, yeah.
So it's, I appreciate you bringing that up, Catherine, and it's, I think it is that matter
of vulnerability and opening oneself up once again, trusting that yes, people may not accept
your invitation, and some people might break your trust, and I think there's more that
can be perhaps lost in not reaching out at all, so yes, hearts can be broken, absolutely,
maybe they're meant to be broken, so that we grow in compassion and care for ourselves
and others.
So yeah, thanks for bringing that up, because I think that can be challenging, what this
practice to and this is a healing practice, practicing metta for ourselves and others
to heal and continue to reach out and trust, even if we know that hearts can be broken.
Okay, so tell you what, I'm going to close the session formally, dedicate the merit,
and then we can sing if you like to stay and do that.
So thank you all, thank you for your practice, for showing up for yourself and for everyone
else for opening your heart and trusting.
