 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. Here we go. Okay. So welcome, welcome everyone. Welcome to Happy Hour. Lovely to see you all and lovely to be with you, feel your presence from around the country and the world. So, so for today's practice, I wanted to bring in the sense of, of patients as metta, patients as metta, patients with ourselves, patients with others, patients with this body, patients and kindness with causes and conditions, not being what we want them to be, patients with our to-do list, patients, patients, patients, patients can be such a beautiful practice. It's really an aspect and expression of love. And again, to have discernment, patients is not just, oh, postponing and procrastinating. It's not patients, but there is a wholeheartedness. There is a kindness. There is a gentleness to appreciating when is, when it's appropriate to have patients and when it's appropriate to lean in and, and not impatience, but, but of course, holding ourselves or others accountable. So, so, and that is the role of wisdom because compassion and kindness without wisdom become what Tibetans like to call idiot compassion or idiot kindness. So, so in that way, what is the appropriate expression of patients as kindness, as love, as metta for ourselves and for others without veering into enabling and unhealthy enabling. So, so I leave that as, as a little contemplation and then knowing the guided meditation, I lead us to explore that a little bit. So, so let's, let's begin. Let's land in our seats. Let's arrive here, here in this moment, in this moment in time, in this body. Starting with patience with this body, with this mind, the body might still be settling, reverberating from the busyness of the day. Patience with this mind might still be running around like a little puppy. Can we have patience with ourselves in this moment as we start to settle, connecting with the breath and the attitude of spacious patience with the breath. As it finds its way through our bodies. As it finds itself in our body. As it finds itself in our body. As it finds itself in our body. Having patience with the hard mind. As it connects with the sensations of the body, feet, the feet on the earth, hands on the lap, on our lap. Or sit bones on the cushion. As with the unfolding of settling and arriving. Patience with this body. Maybe it's achy or creaky or a little unsettled, anxious or sleepy. Or whatever else might be arising. As if we're opening our hearts, kindness with patience. Accepting the body just as it is in this moment. With each breath. Accepting the body just as it is. Not waiting to exhale when the conditions are right. But relaxing, exhaling right now. And can we have patience with the mind? And this mind, if it's drifting here and there, thinking about the past and future. It's okay. It's okay, dear. It's alright. Not judging. Not attacking. Noticing, noticing. It's like this right now. Postquels GAMEMACH to reconnect. Leaning in, landing, landing in, landing with. YenED Notice what happens if awareness connects with patience to the breath, to this breath right here. Like a scientist of your own mind, a relaxed scientist. Notice what happens if you're not reaching for the next breath or the next moment or the next thing. Connecting, awareness connecting with the breath, with the body, sensations of the breath and the body with a lot of patience. Nowhere to go, nothing to do but just to be, just to honor, just to love, be patient with this breath right here. This in-breath, this out-breath. That's our training today. That's our exploration. Relaxing the body, connecting with the breath in the body, connecting with the body with a lot of patience. Kanti in Pali, a lot of patience. Glorious, glorious patience. An expression of love, an expression of peace. Be curious. You can be non-patient in a few minutes right after this practice. But right now try it on for size. What happens? See what happens. Patient with your own heart, with this heart and mind and body. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your own heart. You can be patient with your judgmental mind. If it's arising, thanking it, thank you. Thanks for trying to help me the best way you can, you know. There's plenty of patience with whatever is arising. Plenty of love for it to transform into wisdom. Thank you. I love and be patient with myself. As much as it's available in this moment, not pushing. As much as it's available. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And can we open up this space of patience? Patience as love, love as patience, goodwill. Goodwill, can we open it up? To include others, can we offer our patience to someone we care about in our life as an expression of care, goodwill? Taking the long-term view. What they are doing or not doing. Part of it is of course their volition, responsibility, and a lot of it is part of the causes and conditions. And we offer our support, our patience. Not our judgment. Transformations happen more readily in a loving patient container than one that is filled with impatience and judgment. We know this. Loving patience. Patience. Radiating, loving patience. And patience not as a chore, but as a gift. It's a gift of generosity from our heart. Loving patience, loving patience with causes and conditions. If that feels too abstract, then stay with a being. Stay with someone in your life. Or with yourself. Stay with us. Stay with us. Stay with us. And as we're bringing this sitting to a close, can we consider the gift of patience? As a gift with no strings attached to ourselves, to a loved one. And release. I'm just saying that patience, kanti is one of the 10 perfections and parames, exploring the equivalence of love and patience and offering this goodness, the equivalence of this goodness, love and patience, loving patience as a gift. May I love and accept and be patient with myself, just as I am, to create the conditions for growth, not for impatience and judgment. And sharing our goodness, sharing our cultivation, the seed of goodness and cultivation with all beings everywhere, may all beings, including myself, be happy, be well and be free. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. So, so much to say and explore with patience and the way we try to approach and explore patience in this sitting wise as an expression of love, as expression of goodwill for ourselves and others. And in this container of loving patience, again, it's not idiot patience, but it's one that enables transformation, enables growth, enables wisdom. Whereas if we're just impatient with ourselves, seeking the next thing or with judgments, it just contracts the whole heart, both for ourselves and for others. Anyway, a lot. This is a very rich topic, but maybe just a bit of exploration today. So, I'd like to invite us to explore this topic, this practice together in small groups with patience for ourselves, patience for one another. And the question to explore in the breakout rooms with one another, it could be about this guided meditation if there was something that showed up for you, something that revealed itself, something that was surprising. Or maybe this is just the general question of how does patience and lack of patience, patience and its opposite, patience and impatience, how does it show up in your life? And is it supportive when you lean into patience for yourself and for others? And why and the opposite of it impatience? Is it? What do you notice? It's just exploring, exploring a little bit. The invitation is for you to say, just if you have 10 things to say, just say one nugget, just one thing, maybe it takes 30 seconds or a minute, and then the next person will say something if they want, or they can say pass, just bow and hold silent presence, and then the next person will say something, and then your turn again, go around and around a few times. And please use I-statements, just share whatever you want to share from your own experience, not asking questions from others, not directing the group, just showing up with your own kindness and experience and humility, and patience, patience, and let's go reverse alphabetical order today. So I'm going to open the rooms right now. Take care of yourselves. Be kind, be patient with one another. Here we go. And I'm going to open chat right now. If you have any reflections you would like to share with me privately, you can send them on the private chat. I'll read only the reflection, not your name, or if you send it to everyone, I'll read out the reflection and your name. And if you haven't shared in the group for a while, you're welcome to raise your hand with questions, with reflections, with practice reports, or group report, whatever you'd like to share for the benefit of yourself and everyone. Malaya, please. I wanted to say that during the meditation, I was thinking about how not having patience and busyness that they are a way to distract from thoughts, from a person's own thoughts, and also from being in the present moment, and a way to escape reality. And then, it also can cause suffering. And then I was thinking about how, where my mother's family's from the Philippines, how my memories from when I was a teenager there, and how there's no internet, there's no cell phone service, there's no running water, there's no electricity. And so when we're not working or doing things like that, we pass the time by telling each other stories. And then how people would tell the same stories over and over again, but you'd be patient and you don't tell someone, oh, you already told me that story. Because they enjoy telling the story so much, you just let them tell you the same story again, day after day. And then when we don't have anything to say, we would just look at each other. And then when we were really bored, and it was getting late, we would just go to sleep. We would just go to sleep. Sweet. Beautiful. Thank you so much for bringing that in, Malaya. That is lovely. This gift of kindness and patience and letting people tell the same story that they enjoy telling over and over again. There's such sweetness about that. And, and just patience with life, patience with one another, patience with ourselves, there's something about the pace of the modern world, especially with social media, that it's unimaginable to be quote unquote bored. A single minute, you just have to pick up this device and keep scrolling and news and information and this and this and that. So just be here, just be patient, just cultivate patience. So maybe the next time each of us find ourselves with moment of waiting, doctor's office or here or there, can we just take that moment to cultivate loving patience, loving patience for ourselves as a gift. So beautiful. Thank you so much, Malaya. That was lovely. Vicky, I see your hand. And then Quentin. Oh, you're still muted. Let's try that again. Still muted. Still muted. Okay. Not working, Vicky. So tell you what, we'll go to Quentin and you can figure out what's what's going on. Technically, we'll come back to you. Okay, Quentin, please. Hi, can you can you hear me? Yes, absolutely. Good. I experienced something with my partners that was very unique for me that I definitely think relates to a lot of experiences, including patience. I've been studying Buddhism a while and I'm trying to say this in a gentle way. Many of the practice groups that I've been to mostly have been Western Buddhists. There is a lot of philosophizing and the politeness feels very, very surface. And my partners were able to share their thoughts. And I was able to share my thoughts with kindness at the same time. It wasn't the affect the facial expressions of warmth, but still speaking intellectually. And so sometimes over the years, I have not been able to feel comfortable sometimes with speaking intellectually feeling that the body was left behind. But my partner showed up with this kind of boundary of like, I will get to know them over time. And I will still receive and give kindness, and I will get to know them over time, and I will still receive kindness. And it was just really nice to be felt that I was being received of kindness, and still allowing people to express themselves without having to be vulnerable in a particular way to feel connected. And that's very different. I haven't experienced that before in a long time. So I really appreciate that. It definitely helped me with the idea of being patient and being comfortable with being intimate as things grow. Beautiful. Thank you so much, Quentin. Thank you so much for articulating that. And feeling touched by that noticing that and articulating it so beautiful. And also, I want to reflect back at just the way you were actually speaking about it, was you were sharing this intellectual idea, this thing that you had noticed in the space that's interesting to put it into words. And yet you were so embodied sharing your own care, you being touched, your own vulnerability of, oh, it's been challenging in the past. And this was really different tonight. So thank you for you modeling what touched you in the community and the group tonight. And I do want to say, I think this is something that I love about the happy Arasanga, because there is this sense of kindness, embodiment, not an idea, but an embodied kindness through our practice that we show up for one another holding one another holding ourselves. And of course, we discuss our practice, what arose challenges, and yet there's an embodiment of kindness, which is our, our intention in these hard practices. So right on. Thank you, Quentin. Really appreciate you reflecting that. Thank you so beautiful. Okay, Vicki, I think you've succeeded in unmuting yourself. Yes, I did. Thank you. I loved the thought of finding wisdom as you are having patience. And I remembered a yoga teacher a long time ago saying that rushing equals violence. And I thought about that with patience that a lot of it is holding one's desire to fix something or make it different. And having that, that calm to do it in the middle of being really wanting to get things done or wanting to move things in a different way. Yeah, yeah, beautiful. Thank you, Vicki. Beautifully said. Yeah, this gift of patience in so many different ways in the midst of busyness in the midst of our impatience, can we feel into it as not as violence impatience as violence of our minds, but yeah, thank you. Beautifully said. And one of you sent me a direct reflection. Having patience with mind was a beautiful concept during sitting. Beautiful. Having patience with our own mind. Yay. Having patience with our bodies. If it's not exactly, you know, the cause and conditions are challenging right now. So thank you all. I appreciate your practice, your wholeheartedness, your goodness, cultivating loving patience together as a gift. May we all wake up. May our waking up, our cultivation, our practice support the waking up of all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Be well. And now I'm going to.
