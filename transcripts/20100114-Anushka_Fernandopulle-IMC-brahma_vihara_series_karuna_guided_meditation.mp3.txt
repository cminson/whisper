Today we're going to work with the practice of compassion or corona.
My name is Anushka. I was here last week, some of you remember.
So I'll give a little guidance during the meditation time of this practice of cultivating compassion,
which you're free to follow or also you could do your own type of practice if you want to.
So we'll just start by sitting in a posture that feels not too painful.
And you can just take a deep breath in and as you let it out try to relax the body.
And just come into presence of being here.
So you can connect with your breath, connect with your body, the sense of sitting here.
And you can bring your attention to your heart center area.
And in cultivating the quality of compassion, we start by cultivating that in a way that it feels easy for us.
So we want to bring to mind someone who we feel some connection with,
who we have a sense that they have some suffering or some difficulty in their life.
And it's easy for us to feel compassion for them.
So probably not someone who has a really, really hard thing happening, not too difficult,
or also not someone who we're so closely connected to that we're very attached
and it makes us grieve to think about their troubles.
So it could be maybe a friend who's going through a hard time or a relative whose circumstances are difficult right now.
It could be through sickness or injury.
It could be through difficulty in their job situation, their relationship, life.
Just someone who you know something has happened to them, which your heart naturally goes out to them.
There's a natural sense of wishing, oh, I feel for you.
May you be free from suffering. I care about your pain.
So you can try to bring to mind this person.
It could be even something you've seen on the news that you feel connected to.
So bring to mind an image or a sense of this person or people.
And then just connecting with that in your heart.
You can find a phrase that feels like it resonates for you.
Another additional phrase is may you be free from suffering.
So just offering that from your heart.
Another one people sometimes like to use is I care about your pain.
You can pick one of those phrases or use both if you like.
And just holding the image or the sense of that person, wishing as sincerely as we can.
May you be free from suffering.
Just connecting again with the heart.
May you be free from suffering.
Just feeling that intention each time we say the phrase as best we can.
May you be free from suffering.
The mind wanders.
It seems to be bouncing off of the object.
Just notice that gently bring it back again and reconnect.
May you be free from suffering.
May you be free from suffering.
May you be free from suffering.
May you be free from suffering.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now if you wish to, you can switch from using that other person as your object for compassion to focusing that attention on yourself.
So you can just connect with yourself, either the feeling of your own body sitting here, or an image of yourself.
And just connecting with whatever aspects of your life are difficult right now.
Doesn't have to be hugely difficult.
Just recognizing that you have your joys and your sorrows, whatever struggles you have going on now.
Connecting with that and holding your own life with compassion.
So connecting with caring to your own pain.
May I be free from suffering.
May I be free from suffering.
Or I care about my pain.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
If you're lost in thought, just notice that, gently let it go, come back again to cultivating compassion for yourself.
Just connecting again with your own body and image of yourself.
Connecting with your heart.
May I be free from suffering.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just letting the sounds drive you deeper into your heart of compassion.
Thank you.
And then we can open our hearts beyond ourselves to wish compassion.
Connect with the suffering of everyone here.
And with all the people in the world, with all the animals in the world.
Everyone going through their days with some good things happening to them, some bad things happening to them.
Everyone having their share of sorrow and pain in this life.
So we can open our heart.
Connect with the pain that all of us share.
May all beings be free from suffering.
May all beings be free from suffering.
May all beings be free from suffering.
May all beings be free from suffering.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
