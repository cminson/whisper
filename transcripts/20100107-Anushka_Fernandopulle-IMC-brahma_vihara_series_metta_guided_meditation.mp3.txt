So I thought that during the meditation portion, I would do a little guidance on doing today metta practice, the next time compassion practice, time after that appreciative joy, and the time after that equanimity. 
So of course, you're welcome to do your own practice and ignore me if you want. 
I won't notice, so feel free. 
But I'll just give you some guidance. 
How many people here have done metta practice before? Some? Okay, all right. 
So just a little introduction. 
So it's about cultivating the heart of well-wishing or of kindness. 
And so basically, we start where it's easiest. 
So start with imagining someone who it's easy for you to do this well-wishing for. 
There's many different versions, but the version I'll do, you kind of pick some phrases that call up this sense of well-wishing for someone, right? And then off you go. 
So I'll give you some guidance as we go along. 
So the first instruction for the metta practice is actually to sit in a relatively comfortable posture because it's difficult to wish well for someone when you're in excruciating pain. 
So you can just adjust yourself so you're in a relatively comfortable posture. 
But like in the vipassana practice, you also want to be able to stay alert, right? So if you're too cozy, you might go into dozing, so kind of find that balance there. 
And so you can just take a deep breath and settle into your body. 
So just connecting with being here from whatever you were doing during your busy day or quiet day. 
And you can just feel however the body feels right now. 
You can feel your feet on the ground, the floor. 
Feel your contact with the cushion or the chair. 
You can feel where your hands are touching. 
And then just feel yourself breathing, allowing the breath to come naturally. 
So the first part of the metta practice is actually to bring your heart to the right space for doing this practice. 
So one of the preliminary practices is actually to take some time to appreciate yourself for your own good qualities. 
So this may not be something that you're used to doing, but just reflecting for a moment about what some of your own positive, wholesome qualities are. 
So it could be kindness, it could be generosity, it could be courage, patience, wisdom. 
I can actually drop your attention to your heart area and just feel yourself appreciating. 
It doesn't have to be a huge thing, it doesn't mean that you're perfect in this way. 
So sometimes you can remember some act that you did of kindness, it could be even as small as smiling at someone or holding the door open. 
Or it could be the way that you are with your kids or grandkids or friends. 
So this is not cultivating arrogance, but actually cultivating appreciation for these wholesome qualities that all of us have. 
So voices of doubt may come up, the voices of criticism for the moment you try to let them go. 
Just soak in that appreciation for your own goodness. 
All of us have this beautiful purity of heart that becomes obscured. 
So the next preliminary practice we'll do is a little forgiveness practice. 
So with this you can just repeat these phrases to yourself. 
And don't worry about whether or not it feels like you've forgiven completely in saying this. 
It's just a way of helping the heart to let go a little bit. 
So we'll do three phrases. 
If I have done anything to harm anyone, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I ask for forgiveness. 
If I have done anything to harm anyone, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I ask for forgiveness. 
If anyone has done anything to harm me, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I offer forgiveness. 
If anyone has done anything to harm me, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I offer forgiveness. 
As best I'm able. 
The third one is for ourselves again. 
If I have done anything to harm myself, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I forgive myself. 
If I have done anything to harm myself, intentionally or unintentionally, through thought, word or action, I forgive myself. 
So you can let go of whatever came up during this forgiveness practice and just connect again with the heart center. 
So we'll start the metapractice by bringing to mind someone who it's really easy for us to wish well for. 
So someone for whom the sense of love, happiness comes very easily when we think of them or see them. 
This could be a child, it could be a really good friend, it could be a mentor or a coach, it could be a beloved pet. 
It could be someone who you don't even know personally, but who elicits this feeling from you. 
So a revered teacher. 
So you don't have to worry about finding the perfect one, but just work with who comes to mind. 
They don't have to be perfect either. 
But we'll start out by just connecting with our own sense of well-wishing for them. 
Our own wishes that they are happy, that they might be safe, that they might be healthy. 
So just as we want those things, this other person also wants these things. 
So you can either bring to mind an image of the person, or if images are hard for you, you can just imagine energetically like they're in front of you, and you're going to do this well-wishing towards them. 
So I'm going to suggest some phrases you can use. 
You can use the ones that resonate for you, and you're also welcome to make up your own ones that are kind of along the same lines. 
May you be peaceful and happy. 
May you be strong and healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you take care of yourself with ease. 
May you be peaceful and happy. 
May you be strong and healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you care for yourself with ease. 
So you can just continue this well-wishing for this person. 
If the image starts to fade, or if you get caught up in stories about them, you can just notice that and just come back again to the practice. 
Staying connected with your heart as best you're able, and not worrying about what the feeling is that comes just with as much sincerity as you have, wishing well for them. 
May you be peaceful and happy. 
May you be strong and healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you take care of yourself with ease. 
May you be safe. 
May you be safe. 
May you be safe. 
May you be safe. 
May you be safe. 
May you be safe. 
May you be safe. 
Now I invite you to actually shift the sense of well-wishing to yourself. 
So we'll bring this same well-wishing to our own body and life. 
So just connecting again with your heart, with your own goodness, and with your own deepest desire to be happy. 
You can connect with the physical sense of yourself sitting here. 
If you find it difficult to send metta to yourself in your current form, you can actually hold a picture of yourself at a different time in your life. 
Some people find it easier to wish well to image of themselves as a child, or during some period in which they had more sympathy for themselves. 
So connect again with the heart, and this time we'll send the wishes to our self. 
May I be peaceful and happy. 
May I be strong and healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I take care of myself with ease. 
May I be peaceful and happy. 
May I be strong and healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I care for myself with ease. 
So you can continue this well-wishing for yourself. 
If one phrase is resonating for you, you can focus on that one. 
If one is not working for you, you can also drop that one. 
Just connecting again and again as you say each phrase with sincerity of your deepest wishes for your own happiness. 
If critical voices come up, just try to let them go and come back again to the practice. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
May I be peaceful and happy. 
May I be strong and healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I take care of myself with ease. 
May I be safe. 
On the last part of the practice period, we'll expand our sense of well-wishing out to everyone here and then even further to all beings. 
So knowing just as we wish to be happy and safe and healthy, so does everyone here. 
No matter what their story of their life, no matter what their job, their age, their family, and the same is true for everyone in the world. 
And in fact also all of the animals, birds, fish, seek safety, happiness. 
So first we'll wish for everyone here. 
You can expand your sense of well-wishing to include everyone here in the room today. 
All of our Dharma friends have come together to practice meditation. 
May all of us be peaceful and happy. 
May all of us be strong and healthy. 
May all of us be safe. 
May all of us care for ourselves with ease. 
You can expand your sense of well-wishing even further. 
So out beyond the walls of the building, includes everyone around here. 
In their homes and businesses, everybody driving on traffic, on the highways, all the animals. 
On the ground, the birds in the air, the fish who live in the water. 
Expand further, include everyone and all the animals on the great planet. 
From very small to very large, all beings wish to be happy. 
May all beings be peaceful and happy. 
May all beings be strong and healthy. 
May all beings live in safety. 
May all beings be free from suffering. 
Thank you.
