Practice Note : Relaxing During 
Meditation

The mindfulness practice described in the Buddha’s 
most ancient text on mindfulness, the “Four 
Foundations of Mindfulness, ” begins with mindfulness of 
breathing. It’s a way of starting . The instructions say to 
focus on your breathing . At first , just get to know it;  get 
familiar with your experience, and be with it.  
 
Then , to paraphrase of course,  it says to relax : “Focu s 
on your breath and relax. ” It actually says to tranquilize, 
quiet , or relax your “bodily formations. ” Bodily 
formations are those parts  of your physical experience 
that arise  because of what your mind has done. For 
example , if you’ve been running around frantically for 
the holiday season and your stomach is in knots, that is 
called a “bodily formation ” – the activity of your mind 
feeling frantic  expresses itself as intention, energy , or 
emotions in your body. There is such a strong 
connection  between what we do in the mind  and the 
body , that there are a lot of remnants or traces of our 
mental act ivity and emotions in how we hold ourselves  
in our tension s and posture .   
So, part of the very simple exercise of being with the 
breath is to also  begin relaxing and softening that . You 
can’t do it adamantly because then you’ll get tense. You 
want to just gently let yourself relax, settle in, notice 
where there might be holding or  tension in the body , 
and relax a nd soften. Be with your breath . Come back  
to your breath.  
 
If there’s holding or tension, I  find it particularly useful to 
soften on the exhale . I like t he word ‘soften ’ instead of 
‘relax’  because sometimes you can’t really relax. You 
know the tension is held somehow , but maybe you can 
soften around the way you hold it, or relate to it  – 
softening the attitude a little bit , rather  than making  an 
actual, physical change.  
 
So, as you sit here today , and as you meditate through 
these holidays , you might want to remember that it’s 
very helpful at the beginning to include rel axation as 
part of the practice. Then at some point , you might be 
relaxed enough that any further emphasis on relaxation 
is counterproductive. You’ll probably just fall asleep , or 
be too complacent. But , at the be ginning , it’s a 
wonderful thing to do.  
 
May you have a relaxed, wonderful holiday season. 
Thank you.
