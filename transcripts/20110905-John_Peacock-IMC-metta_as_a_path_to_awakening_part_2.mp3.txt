We've only just got over an hour to complete this. 
First of all, I want to see what other questions have rose out of the first part and then I'll talk a little bit more. 
Can you please talk a little bit more about grounding in friendliness so that you don't get compassion depleted? Yes, I mean, let's. 
. 
. 
Maybe a practical exercise. 
Well, the practical exercise is making sure you do metta for yourself for a considerable period. 
That's the real thing. 
It doesn't get much more practical than that. 
It is, for example, to select for a period of time, and I'm not talking about sort of a couple of times a week, but for a long period of time, even three months of just doing metta towards yourself before you start to develop it towards others. 
In my own training, we had to do three months on each particular individual. 
So you did three months on yourself, three months on basically the person you cared for, three months on the person you found neutral, three months on the person you found difficult, and there were some others in between, but it was basically that thing. 
So you spent a whole year doing the practice, developing it without any other practice at all. 
Could you elaborate a little more what is exactly, what do you do when you say you'll practice metta? Well, I will come to that. 
That was an easy one to do. 
We will come to that. 
I guess I have the mic. 
I'm just thinking about the relationship between practice and metta. 
Maybe you'll say more about this. 
Actually, it can't be heard. 
It's green, so it must be brown. 
Do it like this. 
So the relationship between the practice of metta and what it takes to really understand the dependent origination that you were talking about yesterday. 
Just my personal experience was that I couldn't do the metta practice without a long time of really looking at craving, and I couldn't do an explicit metta practice without a long time of really just doing more of the bare attention and letting the craving be seen and so forth. 
Okay. 
Well, it's not an either-or. 
It's not an either-or. 
First of all, it's helpful if you feel that that's the case to really begin to understand what's going on in dependent origination, to really begin to understand those links in the chain between contact, feeling, craving, clinging, and to really see those, to really, really start to see those and perhaps start to release some of the tendencies. 
But you see, even in a practice like that, when you're looking at that, and often I encourage people when I do this myself, is actually to bookend that practice with doing some metta. 
So, for example, you start with it, do it for a period, however long you select it, it really doesn't matter. 
Then do more what you're calling bare attention. 
I mean, I could say quite a bit. 
And then finish off with some metta as well. 
You see, I think my own personal feeling about this is we shouldn't just concentrate on one type of practice, in the sense that I don't recommend going all over the place and trying bits and pieces all over the place. 
But I think metta should be a fundamental part of it, either implicitly or explicitly. 
Implicitly was easier than explicitly. 
I mean, just holding the whole thing in a kindness to myself to look into what's going on. 
Yeah, I mean, holding things in a kindness towards yourself or the way that you hold and treat the mind, I think is absolutely fundamental, whatever practice you're doing, if that's samatha practice or whether it's vipassana practice or obviously explicit metta practice. 
But particularly the first two is, it's all the things I was saying just before the break, how you come back, how you bring the mind back, what do you do when your mind drifts off, what do you do when that self-critic arises and things like that, all about that. 
That's where the metta can be implicit in that holding period. 
Right, that's very true. 
And I think we need to keep reminding ourselves of that. 
I think this is what's important, we need to keep reminding ourselves not to brutalize ourselves. 
Hang on, there's one going on over there. 
Tony, when you finish those. 
Yeah, is it on? As far as we know, it's recording, but the speakers aren't. 
And it's working for the hearing-assisted devices too. 
So the people with the earphones can hear, but the people with the anthem can't hear. 
So just two brief questions. 
The first is you mentioned practicing metta for three months for each person. 
Was that full-time in a monastic environment? That was in a monastic environment, yes, it was. 
Do you have recommendations for people who are in the caring professions for amount of time? That they spend, most of us can't spend eight hours a day on the cushion. 
No, no, no. 
What I would recommend is actually say, for example, selecting either yourself or one of the other categories and doing that say for two, three-week period in whatever time you select for your daily practice to do that for that period. 
And to do that and not keep swapping around. 
That's the important thing about it, not keep swapping around. 
My quick follow-up question is, I'm wondering if you're going to be covering metta combined with vipassana practice or insight-oriented practice from a practitioner's point of view today? I'm going to talk a little bit about the way that we use the phrases in a different way in what I am considering to be the insight way as opposed to the more concentration practice way. 
Thank you very much. 
That's where we're going to go fairly soon. 
Hello. 
I've been asked to speak up, which I'm giving metta to myself for having to speak up loudly. 
The idea of metta is to bring the heart more to life as I am hearing you again today. 
And one of the obstacles for me can be too much conceptualizing. 
I am thinking of the metta practices now and realizing that when I'm doing metta for myself and for those people with whom I am intimate, I can get in quite lively relationship. 
It's when my practice. 
. 
. 
Thank you. 
I mean to life now. 
When my practice is to turn to the north, to turn to the south and the east and the west, I just feel the drifting and disconnectedness because of the conceptual aspects of the practice itself. 
I wanted to know if you had helpful ways to allow the heart to stay in vital connection with an expanded reality, that is largely for me still conceptual. 
An expanded reality that's largely conceptual. 
That's interesting. 
By its very nature. 
. 
. 
All beings. 
By its very nature, I think. 
. 
. 
There's a couple of elements to this question. 
Let's try and tease them apart. 
Expanding reality in relation to conception. 
Well, conception is not reality. 
Let's get that clear. 
Conception is exactly that. 
It's conception. 
In later Buddhist philosophy, conception is considered to be what's called a fiction. 
We're dealing with fictions here. 
So it's actually connecting with the reality as much as you can. 
Grounding yourself in the pragmatic reality of it. 
So this is the reason why we use phrases, we use visualizations as a way of prompting the mind to contact those individuals who you're visualizing or even just thinking about or having a feeling about. 
But without getting into other conceptualizations about them. 
We don't have to get into other stuff about them. 
That's really what's pretty basic about it. 
So it's not kind of calling to mind, for example, somebody who you have a close relationship with and thinking about all their qualities and thinking of conceptualizing around them. 
But it's just, in a sense, taking that person and now trying to incline the mind in this aspect of metta towards that person. 
So it's really quite basic. 
May I ask this question in a slightly different way? Sure. 
When I have practiced metta, I found it very useful to take the person, be it myself or another person whose face I know and actually visualize that face at some distance from me and create a cycle that actually comes back to feed my heart and my heart goes back to feed that image of that person. 
When I'm dealing with what, for me, are concepts like everyone in the north, all beings in the north, all beings in the south, my practice starts to, does not have that vitality. 
And so I guess I'm struggling with, I understand that after self and mentor and neutral person and the person with whom I have difficulty, that there are 128, perhaps I've got that number, approximate, practices that take you further afield. 
And it's in that field which, for me, is conceptual where it's not very robust and I need hand-holding there as perhaps some other practicum that I might use to create vitality. 
You might not even need to go into those other practices at this stage. 
It would be my first thing. 
Really ground yourself in the practices of the fundamental categories before trying to expand it. 
Certainly not get into having to think of all the directions above, below, north, south, east, west. 
I mean, these are all, because they're a bit busy, doesn't they? Just think, in a sense, if you're going to do anything like that or, for example, if you're doing metapractice in a group of extending it towards all the people in the group, if you can. 
Those who you are sitting with. 
Or, for example, to extend it just outside of the room as even just a vague feeling of what it would feel like to hold others in a sense of friendliness who might be walking past your meditation hall chatting or whatever it is if you're doing it in a city context. 
So I think there's many ways of playing with this but fundamentally ground yourself in the basic categories before even trying to extend it further. 
And when you do try and extend it further, keep it simple. 
Really keep it simple. 
If we give ourselves too much busyness, then the mind goes astray yet again. 
It literally has too much to think. 
And then it becomes intoxicated with its own thoughts in that way. 
So keep it simple is my advice in that instance. 
I think Tony's coming with microphones. 
There is no such thing as Karuna practice. 
There's no such thing as equanimity practice. 
There's no such thing as Mudita. 
You start with Metta and from Metta they all come into being. 
Yes, they grow. 
They grow out of that soil. 
That's why I personally place, and some of the teachers I studied with placed so much emphasis on the development of Metta, not because the others are not important, but because if you don't get this ground right, this soil that we in a sense are growing these other things from, then they won't come into being. 
Or they'll come into being in a very malformed way. 
For example, compassion can take, for the individual who's trying to do it, if they, for example, haven't been grounded in Metta practice properly, can take very destructive forms for themselves. 
They can feel overwhelmed. 
One of the most common things I often get with people who are doing Karuna practice is to say, actually, when I start to do this practice, I just begin to feel overwhelmed by the pain of the world and what's going on. 
Now, actually, none of this is supposed to be done in a sense without the balance to that because the Karuna practice is balanced by the joy practice. 
Usually, the Mudita practice is translated as sympathetic joy or something of that sort. 
Well, one of the ways I personally would extend it, actually, is, and this is not traditional at all, but is, I think, really quite important, is beginning to extend that sense of gratitude for your own joys, your own good fortune as well. 
Starting to ground that towards yourself because it helps to balance the sense of the pain of the Karuna practice. 
So you need to be fairly robust, is what I'm saying, and the robustness comes from the development of the Metta, but the co-development of the Karuna with the Mudita. 
Because otherwise, we're just left with misery. 
Now, they're not downplaying that. 
I'm really even making a joke about that, but we are, because we're suddenly somehow confronted with all of the pain of the world. 
It's overwhelming, doesn't it ever strike you that the pain of the world is overwhelming? However, as one of the phrases, a single ease version of the phrases for Mudita goes, the life is but a play of joy and sorrow. 
It's not all joy and it's not all sorrow. 
For most of us anyway. 
It's a play, it's an interplay of those two things. 
So in a sense, to get the equanimity, which is all this is aiming at, you have to balance that sense of what's going on for yourself and for others. 
So it is play. 
It's the play of joy and sorrow. 
And that's fundamentally grounded. 
These are the two things that are fundamentally grounding. 
Grounded in the metapractice itself. 
So they become the supports, the upholders of the other stuff. 
Putting very, very simple terms, the metapractice is an enormous resource for you. 
If you really want to build up resources, something you can draw on in difficult times, and let's face it, meditation, if you're engaged in meditation over long periods of time, either on retreats or just in your daily practice doing it, it ain't all roses and light, is it? It's not all sweetness and light. 
You go through the peaks of troughs. 
And when you go through the troughs, you really need support. 
And if you haven't got external support, then you need that internal support. 
And the internal support is the friendliness, the kindness, the gentleness with which we can hold difficulty. 
Because it's how we hold that difficulty. 
Sorry, I have a long answer again. 
I know you're interested in Shanti Deva. 
Does Shanti Deva address that in the way that you. 
. 
. 
You see, I've always been confused. 
I thought, well, you do meditation, and then you work on the Karuna, and then you work on the Mudita. 
And then, you know, I don't know how equanimity comes into being, but what you said earlier, you know, and I tested with my own experience, I found that if I truly were able to just rest in some metta for five or ten minutes, something happens around me, and I'll. 
. 
. 
the natural compassion will just. 
. 
. 
I didn't do anything. 
I didn't even know I had that emotion. 
It came flying out. 
And then I went, okay, this now makes more. 
. 
. 
I can see the process occurring. 
Yes. 
It's a natural outgrowth of the development of metta. 
Now, obviously, to develop it in wholesome ways, we have to steer it in certain. 
. 
. 
and that's what the phrases do. 
They steer it in certain ways, as do the Mudita phrases as well. 
They help to hold it in a particular framework so that we develop it, you know. 
If you've got a plant and you're trying to grow it, it can either straggle all over the place, or you can grow it into a beautiful specimen of the plant. 
Well, we're trying to grow beautiful specimens here. 
I'm using the Buddha's agricultural metaphors or horticultural metaphors here. 
We're trying to grow it in a very beautiful way, and so it will need some frame in order to hold it, and that's what the actual phrases that we use, those are the frames to hold it. 
But it is a natural outgrowth. 
You know, it is a natural outgrowth of this. 
Is that it? Just these two more questions, and then we'll move on, otherwise I won't get finished with what I'd like to say. 
So I would just like to ask you to repeat the quote from Long Chin Rub. 
Jumper. 
Yeah, out of the soil of compassion. 
Yeah. 
The rest of it. 
Okay. 
It's being recorded, but I'll give it to you. 
I think, personally, I think this is very beautiful, which is why I quoted it right at the beginning of the session this afternoon, this morning. 
Okay. 
Out of the soil of meta, out of the soil of friendliness, grows the beautiful bloom of compassion, watered with tears of joy, under the cool shade of the tree of equanimity. 
Don't we do that again? Out of the soil of friendliness, meta, grows the beautiful bloom of compassion, watered by tears of joy, under the cool shade of the tree of equanimity. 
Now, I think the reason why I used that image in the sense, because of the question it was just asked, which is it gives you the inter-dynamics of it, that actually it's not this linear, it's not this linear march from meta to upeka. 
You know, it's all growing together, but like anything growing, and again, I'm not joking about the metaphor here, it's getting that soil right. 
Preparing that ground for these other things to grow, in the most beautiful way that they can grow in your life. 
And this is something that I really would emphasize, that you all can grow these aspects in your experience. 
This is not an impossibility, this is not a monastic trip, this is something we can all grow in our daily experience. 
It takes a little time, that's all. 
But it changes your relationship with the world. 
If you change your relationship with yourself, if you actually fundamental change your relationship with yourself, and you can hold yourself in much greater friendliness than chances are that you're going to hold others. 
If you can hold all of your imperfections in friendliness, then you can begin to hold the imperfections of others as well. 
It literally is we do unto others as we do unto ourselves. 
Although I came across a misquote of that recently, which a child had written, which was do unto others before they do unto unto you. 
That's a child. 
Could you say something about the mechanics of metapractice as an insight practice, how it generates insight? Yeah, that really takes me on to where I want to go now, and then I'll say a few more other theoretical remarks. 
The practice of this, it's not difficult at all, but I think it needs a slight reorientation from ways that possibly that you use phrases in perhaps the way you've been taught. 
Hitherto, which is generally speaking, when we're using metamor as a concentration practice, there tends to be kind of endless repetition of the phrases. 
They almost become mantric. 
You repeat the phrases and you repeat the phrases and you repeat the phrases, and they're very good at getting you focused, but they can be awfully repetitious as well. 
I mean, I don't know if you've had this, but I've had lots of students come to me and say, you know, I get so bored with doing this. 
I'm repeating the same things again and again and again. 
And that's partly because it is you being used primarily as a concentration practice, so you will get focused out of it. 
Now, in the way that we use this as much more of an insight practice, it's not about the repetitions. 
What I would describe this as, and you've got to bear in mind this is slightly a metaphor as well, is that it becomes, instead of something which is endlessly repeated, it becomes more of a listening practice. 
So in other words, you might actually only say the phrases over a 45-minute session five or six times, but you listen. 
Listen to your heart. 
Listen to what's in your heart when you say those phrases. 
You know, let's just use one example of the metaphraise. 
May I be safe and protected? May I be at peace? May I live in this world with kindness and with ease? Now, you could say that over again and again and again, and that would then be concentration. 
But saying it the way I've just said it, may I live in these particular ways, then what you're doing is listening in a sense for the resonances. 
How do you feel? Because actually, sometimes I might utter those phrases, may I be at peace? May I be safe and protected? May I live with kindness and with ease in this world? And actually, you don't feel it. 
You actually don't feel it. 
There's your insight, immediately. 
Yeah, that's what's happening. 
You've got to listen in some senses for the rebound, the echo. 
What's coming back to you? You might even perhaps not want to recite the whole of the metaphraise. 
You might want to only just use one line out of it. 
May I be safe and protected? Or may I be at peace? So you're coming into a relationship with the phrases. 
You're not merely repeating them. 
You're developing a relationship with them. 
And often, particularly on longer retreats, what I encourage people to do is to try and reformulate these phrases in words which preserves the spirit of them, but means something more to you. 
So that because you're going to have a working relationship with this. 
And again, you've got to bear in mind that a lot of what I'm saying is, in a sense, couched in metaphor, but one of the things that you're doing, in a sense, is dropping a pebble into a well. 
Into the well of your being. 
This is what we're doing. 
Drop the metaphraise into the well of your being and see what comes out, what circles come out in terms of the ripples that are there. 
And those are the insights. 
The insights might be of unworthiness. 
They might be of arrogance. 
They might be of all sorts of things that are coming up for you. 
And people I've worked with this in this particular way, often I've seen incredibly profound changes in their relationship with this. 
So it becomes a listening relationship, not a repeating relationship with it. 
So you literally listen for what is between the words, behind the words, within the words. 
There's so many different ways of listening to these. 
But it's all about slowness as well. 
It's about slowing down, learning to slow the whole process down, because we can get into this endless gable. 
And then it just becomes words. 
It just becomes concepts, actually. 
Conceptualizations. 
And this is not what it's about. 
It's about the feeling of it. 
How does it settle? How does it settle in your mind when you say a phrase like that? If we had time, we could do a practice, but we haven't got time, unfortunately, to see how it settles in your minds. 
In your heart mind, yeah. 
That's exactly right. 
This is the practicalities of it. 
Whatever the phrases are, whether they are the metaphraises, the ones I've just given you, or whether it's the Karuna phrase, or the Mudita phrase, or whatever. 
How do they settle into you? What comes up? As you know that in Vipassana meditation, when we're doing basic, just simple insight meditation, just mindfulness meditation, what we're doing is not about staying with the breath. 
That becomes concentration. 
Staying with the breath is really actually quite easy if you want to discipline the mind comparatively. 
It's being aware and awake to where that mind goes when it's not with the breath. 
That is where your insight is. 
The fact often that our minds can't stay with the breath actually shows us insight that our minds are undisciplined. 
Lack the ability to attend, or that's the most simple way, or then we start to see the patterns that arise in the mind of fear, anxiety, sometimes joy, sometimes egotism, whatever it might be, you begin to see the patternings of the mind that are arising. 
And I think actually when we treat the Brahma, the Hara practices as insight practice, we do exactly the same. 
We see what happens. 
However, here we are using constructs. 
We're using concepts, in a sense, to reframe, resettle, and see what happens with the mind. 
And that gives a fair description of the practice. 
But this is what the practice is. 
It's allowing us space, time, slowness to actually see what's there within the mind. 
Without that, without doing any of that, then it becomes simply a concentration practice. 
And as a concentration practice, it has its efficacy. 
I wouldn't dismiss that at all. 
But I think it actually misses out on the power of it. 
It really misses out on the power to actually touch that heart-mind. 
Because this is what it's about. 
It's touching that heart-mind. 
Literally, I would say that metta is the beating heart of the practice. 
Without metta, the practice has no heart. 
Now, I'm playing around, obviously, with words here, but I mean, that is in the sense what happens when we just do kind of a very cold, vipassana-looking type practice. 
It has no heart to it. 
Which is even why we have to incorporate the gentleness, the kindness into the practice itself. 
A good practice actually incorporates, whatever you're doing, incorporates all. 
A metta practice, in the way I'm describing it, obviously involves some concentration. 
The ability to attend to what is there. 
It certainly involves the insight. 
This is what I'm claiming. 
And the metta is there, obviously, because that's what we're generating. 
Equally so with the good vipassana practice, is obviously you've got to have concentration to a degree in order to be able to do this. 
But you also have to have the metta in order to be able to treat the mind respectfully. 
To treat it in a way which is respectful and not brutalizing in the way that we handle where the mind goes, what it attends to, where it's gone, and also, of course, it's vipassana, so there's insight there. 
Equally concentration practice doesn't exclude insight. 
And actually, it needs an awful lot of metta concentration practice. 
Otherwise, I'm afraid, I think, that a lot of concentration practice is very brutal. 
It's like sort of bashing the mind into submission. 
You know, just hammering it down into submission. 
So that really is the basic protocol for doing insight brakhana vaharas. 
You will look stunned now. 
There's a lady over there as well. 
So I guess eventually I'll ask you for a daily or monthly prescription for metta, but you know, so often the way that metta is taught, where it's kind of an add-on, we'll do some metta, or you'll do a few minutes before you do your real practice in a few minutes, after you do your real practice. 
So what you're proposing is fairly radical, but those of us who are, but my practice is working for me, I'm afraid to experiment with it. 
What would your prescription be for, should we just try metta for extended period of time, weeks at a time, and see what happens? Yeah, I would. 
I'd certainly try it for that period of time. 
As with any practice, whether your practice is with vipassana, with concentration, or whether it's brakhana vahara practice, metta practice, then you have to do it for protracted periods of time. 
I mean, I can give you an example from my own year, really. 
I will divide my year up into basically doing three practices. 
I will do some concentration, not so much. 
I will do protracted periods, long periods, say four, five months of vipassana type practice, and three months of good metta practice every year. 
Yeah. 
And varying them through the year. 
It's not said that you're skipping from one to the other in the same kind of time span, but that you actually do that for that period. 
I think you have to do this, actually, and just for a very, very practical reason, is that your practice can become stale, as well. 
You have to keep refreshing it in some way or another. 
And that doesn't mean you have to be a dilatante moving from one thing to the other all the time. 
You know, like, I'll do one day of this and I'll do a day of that or a week of this and a week of that. 
This is much more about sticking with a practice, so you start to see the fruits of that practice for a long period of time. 
But I think it's useful to do that because of this tendency for the practice to become slightly stale after a while. 
You know, you can do that yourself throughout the year. 
It keeps you interested. 
As well. 
Maybe if you had the doubt, especially if you try some of these things that are new, for me, when I first started my practice, it was very dry, until I started dropping enough of those pebbles that were pretty charged in there. 
Yeah. 
I think practice needs juice. 
And it really does need some juice in it. 
It needs to be kind of fresh. 
Otherwise, it becomes simply another habit. 
Yeah. 
It becomes, actually, it becomes Silabata Paramasa. 
It becomes another right and ritual. 
Yeah. 
This is what the Buddha is really saying and all too often, unfortunately, our meditation practice, it becomes exactly that. 
I do exactly the same time every day and I do exactly the same practice and I'm doing exactly the same things and I'm joking about this, but it becomes another ritual and you're just going through the motions. 
Yeah. 
This is not what it's about. 
It's not going through the motions. 
It's keeping it alive. 
You don't want a kind of dead meditation practice. 
You want a live one. 
Something that really is you're learning from all the time. 
And the way to do that, I think, is just my one recommendation that I'm going to do this for this period of time and see what happens. 
And no matter if I find it difficult, I stick with that practice. 
Yeah. 
It is a good way of helping with doubt as well because, you know, this word doubt which I think I wrote up on the board the other day. 
Where is it? Sada. 
Which is the opposite of it. 
That's what we need. 
Confidence. 
Trust in what we're doing. 
We need to develop confidence in it. 
Doubt itself is going to undermine everything you do. 
It really does just kills your practice. 
It's good sort of Mara stuff coming in. 
Mara comes in and he'll kill your practice at the moment you start to do that. 
But, you know, if you stick with it and you go through the hard times, you come out the other side of it often. 
That really strengthens your confidence in what you're doing. 
But you do have to stay with it with protracted periods of time because otherwise we become butterflies. 
You know, just butterfly from one thing to the other. 
Yeah. 
There was a lady I remember over there, yeah. 
I was given method practice by a teacher because I was in a long retreat and a lot of aversion, hatred and ill will came up. 
And I find myself not listening. 
You just give me the way to do it. 
I feel like sometimes I'm doing the phrase like beating beating it down. 
Yeah. 
To to replace the hatred and ill will. 
Yes. 
And can you just speak to using the practices as a way to I guess you already have. 
I think I probably have but I think I mean when we use at its worst aspect method practice when it's used more as concentration is like trying to beat your mind into submission. 
You know, it becomes a way of kind of clubbing it. 
Yeah, so it becomes a little bit I don't know, more method in the worst possible sense because you're just using the phrases again and again and again and again and again to kind of hone it down in a certain way. 
I personally doubt whether I wouldn't say ever but I doubt for most people whether it actually works in developing any real sense feeling of in that. 
Whereas what I'm suggesting in the way that we use it here when we use it more as a listening method we give ourselves the opportunity for feeling to arise. 
We're not trying to sort of smash ourselves into a feeling but actually allow it to genuinely arise by keep on inclining the mind towards something which is what we do actually in the concentration practice but we don't do it in such a forceful way to allow whatever naturally there is to arise also so that we begin to see the obstacles to the development of the genuine feeling arising and do we then learn to work with the obscene in other words the obstacle that arises becomes a source for matter because we hold that kindly. 
We're not pushing it away Yes you befriend whatever is arising so when my mind in the initial stage let's face it most of us find meta quite difficult particularly for ourselves in the initial stages and as I said you might use the phrases and actually when I use the phrases may I be safe and protected may I be at peace may I live with friendliness and ease in this world you might not feel that at all because of our backgrounds often our conditioning there are often great obstacles and blockages to that and say actually I'm not worthy of that in fact this is self-indulgence I've heard so many people say that to extend these phrases towards myself in that way is just mere self-indulgence that's Protestant culture actually most of it and I say that because I think that's what's going on in Britain it's Protestant culture we get this stuff that we should be concentrating on others not on ourselves or focusing on others so we might not get that so we get this feeling of unworthiness perhaps that arises in relationship unworthiness itself becomes then the source of being able to befriend that unworthiness so you're generating a meta within the insights that you're actually allowing to arise about how you actually feel at this moment now obviously because it's the mind this is a changing relationship it will change over periods of time if you allow yourself the opportunity and you allow yourself the opportunity to keep on befriending what comes up the chances of the genuine meta arising is actually open for you within this and so it becomes a softening process so what is hard is met with softness it's very it's almost like the Taoist image isn't it of that which thinks itself hard is worn down by the soft water erodes stone and it's the same with meta erodes you know or the befriending process will erode whatever hard you know hard judgments that we make on ourselves does that kind of answer your any one more than perhaps well just one more and then I'll go on towards the conclusion hold on you need a you mentioned that cultivate the soil of friendliness and could you elaborate more and it's a metaphor you know it's a feel, multivator feel but what do you mean exactly you know actually in practical terms I think I've just been explaining that in actual practical terms what you're cultivating is the field of your being how you are at this moment in time everything that arises in relationship to doing the practice becomes if you like the soil for cultivation you're reworking it over you're taking out the stones you're taking out the boulders I know I'm using more metaphors here but that's what we're doing every time something hard arises to the surface somebody plowing the field sometimes hard rises to the surface you remove it we don't remove it forcibly here we allow it to remove itself interestingly enough by having been seen by having been acknowledged so in practice let me really come down to the actual practice again just to remind everybody before I kind of draw everything to a conclusion is that what we're doing is listening to what is arising we're using the phrases as instances of or opportunities to listen rather than talk the mind is chattering all the time isn't it we're talking all the time so we're allowing ourselves by using these phrases as a way of listening to something listening to the resonances that arise from that practice now that is cultivation that is the cultivation of the soil whatever is arising itself whether that be hard or whether it be soft whether it be a kind of pleasant thought or an unpleasant thought a feeling of unworthiness or a feeling of joyfulness that itself becomes befriended with the mind which is receptive and open and gentle towards it when we continue to do that it's like really continuing to plow our field again and again and again and again and as was indicated earlier on by one of the other questions after a while then things like compassion on that are not things you do they're what arise naturally it's almost as if the field now has enough nutriment in it to enable the flower of compassion to arise naturally out of it so the practicality is to keep doing it again and again and again but not obsessively compulsively doing it again and again and again but to do it in this slowing down way in slowness I'm getting off into a rant here aren't I but I was going to say we live our lives incredible speed these days and it's getting faster a lot of it and actually what these practices metapractice and all the practices particularly metapractice is about beginning to slow to slow down to slow down is to treat respectfully to slow down is to pay attention to slow down is to actually see to hear to look to listen and this is what we're doing we're beginning to slow down and allowing ourselves the opportunity for those qualities which are covered over by business to naturally arise I see it's kind of when I do vipassana meditation or staying with breath and I can see we can practice implicitly the metta in the sense that any sort of rising we treat it accept it nicely gently yes exactly but without really actually verbalizing the metta phrases that's the implicit use of metta that's why I say that no practice which is being done in the sense properly excludes metta it has to include metta because it's the gentle way in which we treat the mind now this is not self indulgence it's not a cop out it's also just that ability to hold whatever arises gently but also to return the mind gently back to the object or focus which is generally the breath in these cases in the implicit sense I can understand metta gotta be part of any practice but you are saying that it's beneficial to set aside certain time of the day or year so to explicitly focus explicitly do it and then you'll find that the implicit is easier to do as well so you've got to bear in mind that none of these practices are mutually exclusive none of them are mutually exclusive they actually all benefit each other so if you're doing metta practice that's certainly going to benefit the personal practice that's going to help you in your ability to attend to what's going on in your metta practice and they're both going to help an aid concentration practice and concentration practice isn't going to aid both of those so please don't see these as being all kind of well I do one thing and I'm of a personal practice which I hear so much of perhaps I ought to move on to the finish again it's a who done it it was me honestly okay let me just kind of make some final remarks here about this I want to say something a little bit more about karuna here about compassion within it the way that the Buddha sees it the way it's portrayed in much of the text and particularly within the brahma vahara practice karuna is the impulse towards tenderness and concern I really emphasise those words tenderness and concern actually compassion cares that's another way of putting it compassion cares actually mindfulness cares too mindfulness cares about what it's doing that's why these practices are other dimensions of mindfulness they're not excluded from it they're not sort of something else that we're doing here that's not no it's not samasati these are all samasati these are all right mindfulness so it has concern it's basically it's concerned to alleviate the pain of others now shantideva describes this and I think he describes it beautifully in the bodhichara avatar which is a mahayana text it's not in the early text but I think he really picks up on something it's very very important it's concerned to alleviate pain just as instinctively as the hand reaches out to pluck out a thorn that is embedded in the foot in your own foot it reaches out in just the same way instinctively to do that to engage with the other as well so it's you see the other's pain and you reach out now that might be reaching out with the mind because obviously we can't be present with everybody's suffering in the way that there is this endless sea of dukkha out there but it's that tendency of the mind to wish to to wish to move out towards others and actually more often or not we can find ways of helping in many ways now in order for that to happen and I haven't used this phrase but I think it's been implicit that metta is the melting of the heart it's the melting of the heart that allows that to happen and so karuna rather than actually I've spoken about them almost as being two separate things so far I've spoken about metta obviously it's been the main concentration of what I've been speaking about over this morning and I've spoken a little bit about karuna and it almost sounds like they're two separate things doesn't it? actually they're not let's overcome this mythology that metta and karuna are two separate things metta is the melting of the heart karuna is metta in action that's all it is it's just metta in action so first the development of this boundless friendliness this expansive friendliness which melts the heart towards ourselves and towards others and then it becomes karuna as action hence the root here to act to turn to see others to move away now the disciple who's perfected in this is actually described in the Pali Canon it's very interesting this phrase which is called sabaloka anukampi a person who pulsates with compassion for the well-being of the world sabaloka anukampi a person who pulsates with compassion for the world and that's what we can become this is our possibility this is our possibility of being now I think this is for me one of the main things about the brahma vaharas seen in this way is they're not kind of adjunct practices but they're possibilities of our human flourishing in this world and if anything that I think that the early texts are about and getting away from any mystical aspect at all I personally would want to write it out and I know that offends a lot of people any mystical dimension to this at all the Buddha's concern is about human flourishing how you can best be in this world with others nibbana is not a mystical experience nibbana is the absence of greed, aversion and delusion and the greatest human flourishing comes about through the absence of greed, aversion and delusion and the movement into upeka which is the finality actually of the brahma vaharas the outcome of all the work with metta so it's the natural flourishing we start to do this work and we naturally begin to find ways of being that hitherto haven't been accessible to us are inaccessible for all sorts of reasons hindrances, fetters, blockages all of these things which are stopping us from flourishing in this world so the Buddha's path is a path of human flourishing it's not a path of something superhuman I think this is for me why the figure of the Buddha is so powerful it's the figure of the Buddha both within the text and that is a powerful figure because he represents the epitome of human flourishing what is to be in this world there's an image which is used in a very late text actually which is the avatamsaka the avatamsaka sutta which is a pure land sutta and I don't actually like it very much the avatamsaka sutta because it's kind of all it's a very baggy monster of a text and it's all over the place but it has a wonderful image it says the Buddha walks through the world with bliss bestowing hands I think it's a lovely image now without getting kind of sentimental about it in a way if you think if you think your way into what that actually means it means you go through the world not leaving a wake of destruction behind you a wake of detritus and misery but you move through the world actually fulfilling human potential which is actually here to develop dimensions of real understanding and real engagement with ourselves and others and the world itself and I think that's what's so important about this just a few words about the other two brothers of ours it's kind of almost a whole day on themselves but just a few words about them the first muddita let's get away from the idea of sympathetic or empathetic joy the actual word muddita actually has its roots in to be gentle it's gentle joy it's probably the most accurate translation of this although you don't get that it's a gentle joy I don't think it's any real equivalent to it in any English language it has connotations emotional resonances of within the Pali of soft-heartedness gentleness, tenderness being suffused with joy and gladness of the heart it doesn't sound like too bad a state to be in does it so these are what are all implied so muddita rooted in compassion is both concern and joy that's an interesting mixture isn't it to be concerned about others and about yourself and yet to be joyful as well now I think joy doesn't get much of a look in in most Buddhist practice it's often that bit that's written out I'd like to kind of put in a plea for joy I'd like to kind of put in a plea for joy in terms of the practice it can all become a bit too pious and one of the great benefits of my early training was I spent years and years and years with Tibetans and if there's anything I learnt from Tibetans it was actually this practice was great fun you know it wasn't just misery it was great fun and you know it was a wonderful joyful thing to be engaged in as well as difficult and as well as hard and all the other things they emphasize as well but it was this joyfulness it was the heart of the practice and I think we forget that at our own peril really that's when your doubts start to creep in that's when you lose a sense of confidence if there's nothing joyful happening you need to look at your practice again you need to refresh it now I'm saying this in the context of the Ramavaharas which is slightly different but we also need I think as I mentioned earlier on also to appreciate what joyful aspects there are in our lives to regularly celebrate them as well as celebrating the joys that the others have perhaps which are not in your life so it's celebratory this joy there is so much good that is going on out there as well as the bad and we again forget that at our peril there's an awful lot of good stuff going on there's an awful lot of goodness as Walt Whitman once said he said I didn't know I had so much goodness in me it's in his very very famous poem so we need to celebrate that from time to time to come back to the goodness which is there the goodness in the world and the goodness which is within ourselves not burying our heads in the sand and not realizing all of the the dukkhas out there all the pain, all the suffering as well so it's both concern and bliss concern and joyfulness and there's again phrases which are associated with these which help us to rejoice in the joy of others but I would add that little plea as well rejoice in your own dimensions of goodness too as well as the difficulties that you have now finally of course there is upeka and those who've been with me for the last couple of days also know that I feel that upeka is also the pinnacle of the practice upeka is also the goal of this practice to come into a feeling of equanimity the greatest happiness as the Buddha says a number of times in the Pali Canon is nothing other than contentment this is the greatest happiness so it's the lack of the drivenness it's the lack of the drivenness of craving of tanha when tanha is absent the craving to avoid and the craving to have then there is upeka when that craving is diminished on its process of being diminished or when it's finally gone that is what we discover we discover poise, balance and engagement and I gave everybody, I'll say this to the people who weren't here the other day there's a synonym in the Abhidharma for upeka which is tatramajatata in Pali this means in the middleness now I think this can be interpreted in a number of ways it's literally in the middle like not being thrown off balance of something not being swayed by either the good things that happen to you not being buffeted by the worldly winds which will constantly buffet us praise and blame and all this sort of stuff that are constantly buffeting us so we go out looking for one and we get the other we don't like what we get but we wanted the other one and so on and so forth we're not swayed in other directions so we literally are poised and balanced in that way but I also think it means a lot of life so equanimity is not something we do on a mountain top or in a hermit's cave or in a monastery equanimity is there to be seen and engaged in an ordinary average everyday existence our ordinary average everyday activities this is where we need to develop it if we don't have it and I think often what we see in our societies is our societies don't have this what we get is unbalanced and dislocated societies with unbalanced dislocated people within our societies this is what it's about now it's about focus as well and having equanimity also implies aspects of discipline something which is very unpalatable I think often in the western world these days is actually beginning to build a discipline as one teacher of mine said to me once he said if you want freedom the only freedom you're going to get is within discipline freedom isn't the freedom to do anything the freedom that you have is the freedom within a particular discipline and there you would develop equanimity but this is not rigid discipline this is not a brutalization again of yourself this is a discipline such as a rule of training that almost takes me almost right back to the beginning when I started the other day rules of training this is what precepts are they're rules of training ethicality being grounded in ethical inquiry through our rules of training this is the discipline here I think I've finished thank you well that's not to sort of stop any questions if there's any final questions I'd be very happy to answer for a few minutes or so but I just want to thank everybody for listening for such a long period of time to me thank you.
