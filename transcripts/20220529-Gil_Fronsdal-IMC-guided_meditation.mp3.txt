 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome to IMC. And we'll just start with meditation directly. So to prepare yourself by sitting here with respect for yourself, with a kindness and care for your own welfare, perhaps so that later you might be able to offer respect and kindness and care to others. And to think of meditation as an act of self-respect, self-care, self-kindness, in such a way that it feels welcoming for you to be present, to be here at this time, at this place, with your attention, that your attention is the vehicle for which care, kindness, respect can be present. Gently closing the eyes, and perhaps with some long, slow, deep breaths, as a way of both connecting to yourself and as you exhale, clearing away whatever it is that might interfere with present moment awareness. And letting your breathing return to normal. Relaxing in your body, softening. Just with the help of your breathing, softening whatever is hard in you. Meeting with care and kindness, whatever is difficult in you. At the end of the exhale as the inhale begins. Perhaps you can evoke the kind of awareness, attention, which has a quality of clarity. Clear awareness here, with the beginning of each inhale. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing.
