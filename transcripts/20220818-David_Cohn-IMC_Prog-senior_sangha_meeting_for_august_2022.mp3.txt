 Well, why don't we wait by, I mean begin by meditating for a little while. Welcome, by the way, welcome everyone. Welcome to all of you. We have some members from different time zones. Somebody's here, I don't know, from Scotland. So welcome. Welcome to newcomers. By the way, I'll mention we do have small groups, for those of you who are newcomers. We have also small groups that are smaller, much smaller, like six to eight people. And people get to be very close, very intimate, open, and find it meaningful and worthwhile. So if that's something that you'd like to do, you could just write to the IMC Senior Shanga and let us know. And we'll get in touch with you about getting into a group. So before we meditate, I just want to mention something that I may have mentioned before. The Buddha, he was purposely raised in the lap of luxury. There had been a prediction to his father that his firstborn son would become either a great king, powerful king, with many lands, and very successful, or he would be a spiritual seeker. So the king was afraid he'd become a spiritual seeker, so he wanted to make sure everything was very nice for Buddha, for Siddhartha. So there was nothing in the home that showed any sign of suffering, everything, beautiful smells, beautiful music, artwork, great foods, wonderful, loving family. All of the worldly pleasures and worldly kindnesses were bestowed upon him in the hope that he was a great king. And so he was a very happy boy. And then you know what happened. He went to the town and they saw someone sick, someone old, someone dying, and he was shocked. It never occurred to him that this body gets old and sick and dies. And he also saw a spiritual, he saw a monk. And he was inspired to leave his wealth, power, prestige, love, material pleasures, and abandon, all of that. And by the way, he was a terrific athlete. He was a terrific student. He was best at everything. He was completely successful at everything he tried. And then it was the same on the spiritual path. He outdid his teachers and concentrations, but that didn't satisfy him. He went into the most rarefied, blissful, magnificent Jhana states didn't satisfy. He outdid his teachers in yogic exercises. It was said that his renunciation was such that his stomach was a sunflower seed away from his spinal cord. He almost died. And a shepherdess, her name was, I believe it was a job key, a little girl who was taking care of her sheep, noticed him across the river. And as he was by the river, he almost died, collapsed, sick. And she came over sweetly with a bowl of milk, a sheep's milk, and she gave him some sheep's milk. And he revived, and he looked through her kindness, her love. And then he had an awakening experience. He remembered himself as he was as a little boy. The innocence, the openness, the pure heart of a little boy sitting in the shade by a tree watching his father. Father was doing some chariot exercises in a field. And just remembering how simple and peaceful this ordinary little boy's mind was. So maybe we can remember something like that. I know we all have stories about our childhood that aren't maybe so peaceful. It might have been some heartbreak, some difficulties, some traumas and so forth. But also, I think maybe we all can get in touch with that peaceful childlike mind. And that was it for him. That was boom, this ordinary mind that we all share. This simple, natural mind was his awakening. Something like lights and bells and whistles and stars and cosmos, just this ordinary simple mind. And he thought, this is so simple and so wonderful. Nobody would understand it. Nobody would understand the simplicity of this. I'm not going to teach it. I'm not going to tell anybody. I won't continue with the story. It's a wonderful, long story. But the point is this childlike mind. So let's meditate for a little while with a loosely upright posture. And drop into the body. Drop the thinking mind, maybe below your navel, noticing that area as you breathe. And on the in breath, noticing the sensations and on the out breath, the release. And if you like, you could hold the end of the out breath for a little while to get a glimpse of this bare awareness. This simple, natural open state. And just relax. Like the Buddha, maybe just relaxing into the simple openness where you don't have to prove, you might prove anything to anybody. And thoughts appear. You don't have to get rid of those. You don't have to do anything. They free themselves. This childlike kindness. Children love to share. Just be. Be with the body. The sensations in the thighs, in the calves, in the feet. And simply hear. With ease. Just hearing. You might open your eyes and just look around a little bit. Not thinking too much about it, just seeing. Easy being. You may notice too that everything you see or hear or feel, you can't grab it. It's gone before it begins almost. We can't control our living experience. It's ungraspable. Children don't think about these things. It's just a feeling. A permanent me. It's kind of unheard of that we don't have to do anything, that we're enough just alive, just aware, just awake. Our birthright. In this aliveness, in this awakeness, this awareness, we are completely safe. Everything can destroy this powerful radiant presence that we are. Just all of us naturally are. It's just naturally loving, naturally kind, naturally free. And of course thoughts come, and our attention isn't on figuring out the stories, maintaining the stories, getting rid of the stories. More on the blessing. The blessing of just being. In this eternal moment, sacred moment that is ungraspable. And now shifting gears a little bit, imagining someone in front of you who likes you very much or loves you. Could be a good friend. Could be a life partner. Could be a teacher. Could be the Buddha. Could be a pet. Could be a grandson, granddaughter, a child. Just someone who knows you and likes you. And imagine them looking into you with appreciation, with goodwill, maybe with love. And feel this kindness from them, this appreciation. And they know if you could say, why do you love me? Or why do you like me? They would just shrug and say, I just do. And you feel okay with them. You feel this just simple okayness held in their love, their goodwill. I'm not going to say joy or something more exalted, just well-being, safe. A fundamental state of okayness, like you had when you were a child, perhaps. So nice to be just okay. But they also see your good intentions. They see that you're good, but you mean well. You live your life well, you made some honorable efforts to care for your loved ones, care for your friends, lead a virtuous life. They see your good intentions. You don't want to cause any harm. You want to be helpful. You want to develop spiritually. You want to live in truth. You want to find the meaning. You want to live in the meaning. They see your skills, your particular talents that are unique to you in the way you've carried out your life, things you've done well, things you're doing well now. And they see how you, maybe for a long time, a really long time, have longed to grow, to learn, to develop in wisdom, to develop in compassion, to live in your true nature. They know all these things about you. You relax with them and feel good, feel okay. And imagine now that this being, this warm-hearted and wise being, turns into light, melts into light, this magnificent light in front of you, but is there essence? And that light dissolves into you, and you become the light suffused by the light bathed in the light, allowing the light to permeate all of your tendons and sinews and muscle and energy, opening your mind, opening your heart, opening all your sublime energies and relaxing to the light. And that's a wonderful discussion, and thank you, Leslie, I think you did a very good job. Kids take naps every day. Trish, did you want to say something? Yeah, so, in our group, while we all recall times where we felt good about ourselves in in nature and doing riding bikes and climbing trees and things, and large family gatherings, taking care of a younger brother, feeling responsible for him. What stood out in our talk was the negative traumatic memories. And we felt like how much they dominated and also made the connection with how they made us lose touch with our goodness. So in my case, I was, when my sister was born, younger sister out of jealousy, I teased her. And so my parents called me the mean one and she was the mean one. And I was like, oh, I'm going to have to do this. And I was like, oh, I'm going to have to do this. And I was like, oh, I'm going to have to do this. I'm going to have to do this. I'm going to have to do this. And I was the mean one and she was a sweet one. So that really made it worse for me. You know, that I was bad. I was also bad at the first born. I was a girl. I was supposed to be a boy and others had different traumas, you know, that, especially high expectations, trying to live up to them. Someone said she felt like her mother's puppet trying to be proper and do all the things she was supposed to. But someone had a mean grandma and she felt like it was her fault, but she didn't know why. So the feelings of, you know, I'm bad and doing something wrong, but I'm not sure what it is and trying to please, but not pleasing. There was a lot of that that we felt made us use touch with our own goodness as we grew up. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's what we have now. We have those afflictions. Part of our being. That's what we practice with. That's the suffering that we get back to that to get back home, to get back to that purity. Rada, you're well, Trish. Thank you. I want to thank Trish for opening the door in our group. I listened to all the beautiful ladies giving positive memories of their childhood. And I just sat there wondering, oh, am I going to drop a bomb? And then when it was my turn, I just looked at them and said, well, I was an unwanted child. I was an accident. And I knew it. So, yeah, we had some just some discussion about negative childhoods too. And I can speak to mine, which, of course, spread out to my not having friends because I didn't know how to be social or nice or, you know, reach out for a relationship. I just hadn't been taught in my own family. So, so by contrast to the other folks in the group who were talking about when they started their musical lessons, it was such a leap of love into music that they remember that moment so beautifully. I just, you know, kind of did the opposite. But I do have to say that I'm in my childhood now. And it's wonderful. Now is when I am feeling as free as can be. I'm old and I'm sick and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm here and I'm free. I really feel it. So it turned out backwards for me, but I'm nine years old. Yeah, our suffering can be our medicine. Joe, what is what is would you share something with us? Yeah, our group did not have a great time at age nine. We all had very difficult childhoods. There was no child. Childlike innocence that anybody shared. I'm not saying nobody could have dug some up. It wasn't. It was very difficult for me. It was a very difficult exercise. Actually, there's nothing really nice to hang on to. All of that. The nice phase of my life started about 20, 25 years ago when I started to play. 20, 25 years ago when I started secular mindfulness before that, it was just not good. So. So anyway, so there's different kinds of memories about childhood amongst us. That's just what I. You know, I take away, I guess. I just want to respond to that. If I may. In our group. You know, we were sharing positive things and I shared some really lovely things, which I was grateful to be able to do. That doesn't obvious. The mother stuff that I just chose not to talk about today. Okay. So. I just want to respond to that. If I may. In our group. I don't know what I'm saying. I don't know what I'm saying. I don't know how to talk about today. It's both. It was there too. But I was very grateful to have the opportunity and I'm not criticizing in any way. Sometimes that's just what comes up, you know, the negative stuff that's just there until. But. Yeah. I guess what I'm saying is I don't want you to. Maybe I'm imagining this, you know, this is a little bit of a positive. I mean, you came up with whatever you came up with. And I could have, if the coin had flipped another way, I could have come up with some real horror stories. Yeah. Thanks. I don't think any of us. Felt bad about. That that's what came out. I'm such a caretaker. I'm not saying none of us had anything good. We could have shared. But that's what, that's what came up for all of us. Yeah. I think that's what I'm saying. Yeah. I think that's what I'm saying. I think that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Don't feel guilty about remembering some nice things about your child. I feel really bad about not remembering nice things about. That's right. I think that's a joke. That's a joke. Yeah. Okay. Good. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. When all of our, our. Hindrances and. Poisons were born in our childhood. So. Yeah. So of course that's. That's what we've come up. I think that's a good point. There's some handrails answers. Please. Elizabeth I've spoken. I think you should definitely. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's one of my inner. Child parts. Because I study internal family systems. Just with sharing the both the suffering. And even just naming some things of the difficulties of the poisons or hindrances. And I. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to. I'm not sure I'm going to run away and hide. But what I, what I feel. I finally come to. Is I used to feel so envious and jealous of people that had beautiful like childhood experiences or. And it was a thing that kind of ruled. It was always a comparison. And I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. But people that have had. Some good things in their childhood is I'm actually in awe. And I go, wow. And I sort of want to. So it was a big deal for me to, to, to work through that jealousy of some people that had good. To come to. And I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. As a, as a potential that I could try it myself. Even like. Looking at this age right now. And yeah, I can. Sort of. Feel. Those that have had the real challenges. It's it's a comfort. It's like a blanket. Oh yeah. And I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I'm learning to embrace the people that have had the good. And yeah, they haven't had it perfect either. Like. Who just spoke. Yeah, we could all dredge up. But I'm the age nine is just still sticking with me. I remember. Like it was. I was given a lot of responsibility at age nine. You know, I started to think about the, the, the, the, the. The. You know, you're not getting all your two skinny. Go see the doctor. You have parasites. I don't know. So you know, you just went on the bus and you did it. And then I started expected to get a job picking blueberries or. Whatever. But the wisdom, my, my mother. Who's 94. And she's become childlike in a very good way. She had so much suffering and I'm, people in the nursing home. I see people walking in the little park and I see so much of their life and how I see so much of their soul and what they've accomplished, whatever age they've become and what a frigging challenge it is to live this life. And yeah, I just wanted to share that and thank you. And thanks for those bringing both the good and the suffering, the poisons and our challenge in life. So thank you. Okay, well, this has been wonderful to hear your reflections and your digging into what's your digging into what's, what it was for you and what it is now for you and what's emerging from you now. So let's take a 10 minute break and then we'll do some more exploring when we come back in at Fiona, our dear and wise Fiona we'll give a little offering and then we'll resume our discussions with the same groups. Okay. And please don't leave because then you'll lose your small group assignments. So just don't turn off your connection but we will take a 10 minute break. Yeah. So coming back into our virtual space together while other people are coming back you can just settle back in and very rich sharing this last hour and a half together and a lot has come up. So just to sort of let it thinking and rest. It's very tender and sharing of you all in this contemplation of childhood memories and the positive ones and challenging ones and holding this now in this time of our life. I have found this was a practice that I encountered from Sharon Salzberg years ago when I was studying her teachings on Metta practice. And I recall someone asked her, well, Metta's wonderful and what if it's hard when there's people or things and memories that are quite difficult and it just doesn't, Metta's not arising. It feels fabricated, it feels stiff. It's not coming. And I really appreciated and have incorporated this practice over the years for myself. It was a forgiveness practice. And I just wanted to share that as possibly something to incorporate, especially if memories or incidents in our narrative arise that are quite difficult, either in our own actions or the actions of others in our narrative. So what Sharon shared was three practices or three intentions or mental intentions. And one was, the first was, may I forgive those who have harmed me knowingly and unknowingly. And the second was, may I be forgiven by those I have harmed knowingly and unknowingly. And then may I forgive myself for any harm that I have caused. And it felt to me so kind, kind, this kind practice when things are difficult to bring up this wellspring of openness. Can I forgive what's happened, whether it was intended or not? And may I be forgiven. So I just wanted to share that. I have found over the years, I remember I'll just share with you, I had some very challenging memories from childhood and now I had a conversation with my son years ago after my father had died. And he asked me about my, the hard times. And I said, I feel so blessed. All I remember now is the love. The bad memories have faded. And I don't know how that happened, but somehow I believe it's part of this Dharma practice has allowed the sharpness, the pain, the poisons of suffering to just level out. So I share that, I offer that as a possibility for all of you. And I wanted to also share this, David was talking about this awareness or this sense of innate goodness that I first came across this idea in my early 20s when I was raised in a tradition where what was innate was sin. And so to come across a way of life and the teaching, this was not Buddhism at the time, it was Quakerism. And it was a radical teaching of this innate goodness, this light within, deep within. And I feel that in Gil's teaching, he talks about as we come up in our practice and things arise, memories, our own suffering, our own suffering, our own suffering, our own difficulties, that beneath that one we can relax around what is arising and accept it. Underneath is this wellspring of beauty and goodness. I love it, he keeps referring back to this. Maybe this is what some people refer to as Buddha nature, that the Quakers would call it the Christ within. The invite to people would maybe say self with a big S. But really trusting that, and I think when you look at babies before they're nine, small children, there's this open awareness, it's unfabricated and it's this source of great comfort, great intimacy and beauty. And maybe our metropractic is what nurtures that, re-recognizes that in us. So maybe we'll just have to go back into our groups and maybe re-address, maybe not look at the childhood, there's so many prompts here, but maybe look at our own goodness, really underneath the story, what is there that's good? And one of the prompts to name three strengths or virtues that we have, can we honestly just say, this is true about me. And how does this feel to recognize this deep inner innate goodness that is ready to just be there, our deepest friend. So anyway, Joe, if you could put us back into the small groups and just for 15 minutes now, but if we can read, oh, yes. And if you care to, I'm sorry, I meant to say this at first, connect with each other and want to share your emails and reconnect in the future, you can always email me at the senior saga and I can connect you. No, we've had this request in the past. Anyway, so please enjoy the extension of your small group and sharing. What are your own good, natural strengths and goodness that you can recognize and share with others? So Joe, if you can put us in the small groups again, that would be great and for 15 minutes. So sorry, it was a short time, but the sharing was very rich and we just went over, but it was very natural. So thank you all. And if you want to share more, connect in ongoing with your group of people, please, hopefully you have each other's names. If you can let me know and you want to share emails or contact, please let me know. Just do this senior saga and I can ask people's contacts if they're open for that. I'd like to say something Fiona, just briefly, because I have to go, we're going on the trip, so I have to say goodbye. But I think we'll continue with this, exploring our inner goodness next session. So from a different angle, I think it's a very juicy and wholesome and helpful topic for us as seniors that are maybe struggling sometimes to see that in ourselves, to see our strengths. So I'm going to listen to Fiona for a few minutes, but then I'm going to be leaving you all. So thank you. Well, I'm very touched, you know, this whole subject and your sharing and looking at innate goodness and awareness, deep roots of love and where our strengths are. And I found this poem, I just wanted to send you off with these thoughts from John Adonohue. You have traveled too fast over false ground. Now your soul has come to take you back. Take refuge in your senses, open up to all the small miracles you rushed through. Become inclined to watch the way of rain when it falls slow and free. Imitate the habit of twilight, taking time to open the well of color that fostered the brightness of day. Draw alongside the silence of stone until its calmness can claim you. Be excessively gentle with yourself. Be excessively gentle yourself. Let's just be quiet for a few minutes. Let's just be quiet for a few minutes. Let's just be quiet for a few minutes. Let's just be quiet for a few minutes. Maybe feel a deep, gentle intimacy with this inner light, this inner goodness, may be hidden but there, just our deepest self, our deepest friend. May this sustain us as we move through our day and as we move through our day, we will be able to see the light of day. May this sustain us as we move through our days and may we be able to appreciate this whole journey, the whole picture, all of it. And this Dharma Path, the blessing of this Dharma Path. Thank you all. Thank you for sharing and maybe you want to unmute and say each other. And feel me. We'll use this only to read. Pardon? You send us the poem. Yes, I will. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you.
