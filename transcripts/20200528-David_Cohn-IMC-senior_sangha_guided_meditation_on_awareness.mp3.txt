The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
On awareness. Awareness is the heart of
all spiritual practices. Even Christianity.
Christianity calls it God, but it's awareness.
A great eighth-century mystic
and scholar and poet Shanti Deva, maybe many of you have heard of him.
So he said that if we don't understand this peace,
it's the secret of mind, of awareness, that everything we do is meaningless.
So this is the heart of our practice.
And I want to acknowledge that before I begin this meditation.
So if you could please close your eyes or leave them a little open if you like
and assume a comfortable but alert posture
and relax.
Relax your shoulders, relax your heart.
Relax the thinking mind.
And just to help drop down into the heart and the body.
Consider who are you if you don't have any problems.
Who are you if there are no problems?
And allow that thought to untie the knots in the mind
and come into the heart.
And just for now, there's nothing to do, nothing to become, nothing to change.
And we can just leave ourselves alone for now.
And I invite you in this open space of awareness
to allow sounds to come in.
Open to sounds.
Sounds outside, sounds inside the mind.
There is no inner and outer, just sounds.
As they appear and disappear
in the open emptiness of the mind.
With no effort at all, not looking for sounds.
Just abiding in this natural, easy awakeness
and allowing sounds to come into this awakeness and disappear.
This awakeness, this awareness is happening all by itself.
We don't have to make any effort
and noticing how sounds effortlessly appear and disappear.
In this vast sky of awareness.
Now be aware of sensations.
Points of feeling could be anywhere in the body.
Aware of points of sensation
appearing and disappearing.
Points of sensation like stars in a night sky.
Not reaching for them.
Sensations felt points of sensation
appearing and disappearing.
Like stars in the night sky.
There's no shoulder.
There's no thigh.
There's no head.
Points of sensation.
No boundaries.
No separation.
Amazingly simple.
Amazingly accessible.
Just arising and disappearing.
With no effort.
Notice how effortlessly each sound is known.
In the moment it appears.
And notice how effortlessly each sensation is known.
Whenever it appears.
Everything is welcome.
In this big empty sky mind.
Everything is included.
Be aware of thoughts.
Thoughts are sometimes shy when we start to look at them.
But they won't be shy for long.
Be aware of thoughts and images.
Clouds that pass through the night sky.
Appearing and disappearing.
There's no conflict with thoughts.
There's no measuring or judging.
Just a thought.
Cloud passing through the big open sky.
Be aware of this awareness.
Rest all your weariness.
Rest at ease.
The weary mind.
There's nothing to do here.
Nothing to be.
Nothing to change.
No inside, no outside.
No separation.
Just thoughts.
Sounds, sensations.
Opening and dissolving.
In this open awareness.
All experiences appear and disappear on their own.
And experience directly your own mind.
Take a U-turn and look directly at your own big sky awareness.
Look for it.
There's nothing to find.
It has no shape.
It has no form.
It has no color.
It is.
It doesn't exist.
Directly experience your own mind.
Much has been said about this mind.
It's been called the unborn.
The deathless.
The unoriginated.
The unconditioned.
Buddha nature.
The immortal state of being.
Resting in this awareness.
Is the practice of all Buddhas.
Sensations.
Sounds.
Thoughts.
Come and go.
The awareness outlasts them all.
Right.
And now even resting.
The weirdness of looking at your awareness.
Just becoming.
Awareness.
No self.
No sign of anything.
Clear.
Invisible.
Vast.
Without boundaries.
Limitless.
It contains all things.
But it's not composed of them.
Let the mind be soft.
And perfectly still.
Without grasping at anything.
Think to yourself.
I am awareness.
Let your identities fall apart.
I am spirit.
Feel this shift.
I am awareness.
