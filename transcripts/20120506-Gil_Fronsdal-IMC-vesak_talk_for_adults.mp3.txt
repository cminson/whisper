Vesak Talk for Adults  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on May 6 , 2012  
 
 
We celebrate the Buddha’s birthday today and it’s a 
happy occasion. It’s called the Vesak and it’s also the 
celebration of the Buddha’s awakening when he was 
about thirty -six, as well as his passing away when he 
was about eighty. I find it symbolic that on e holiday 
celebrates these three events with his awakening being 
approximately half -way between his birth and death.  
 
His awakening led him to discover how to live in this 
world without being in conflict or struggle. I think it’s one 
of the remarkable pos sibilities of any lifetime to discover 
how to live without any inner conflict at all. There might 
be outer conflict with the world around us . The Buddha 
had some in his time. But there’s a distinction between 
what the heart does , and the concerns we have to think 
about , reflect on , and engage in. And with practice , we 
can find a heart wherein we are at peace , and there is 
no longer struggle , conflict , or aversion. There’s no 
longer  holding onto something , or feeling unsafe or 
threatened. Halfway through his life , the Buddha 
discovered  how to live a life without struggle.  
 
He talked about a life without dukkha , a life without suffering. But if we keep using that word suffering, we 
begin to kind of glaze over , and the mind goes numb . 
But I think that to talk about conflict  or the absence of 
conflict  is significant. There is a strong tendency in 
religious circles, Buddhist circles, and human circles to 
want to hold on to an ideal. If I have become a spiritual 
person , a realized person , or a good person, then I will 
be a certain way. I’ll always be loving ; I’ll always be 
compassionate ; I’ll always be peaceful. I’ll be some kind 
of way.  
 
As I said earlier, trying too hard to be something is like 
trying to grab onto the  sound of a bell  [rings], which you 
can’t  grab onto . But it’s quite significant to talk about 
the absence of conflict , where  you experience an inner 
life without struggle , or in conflict with yourself – without 
feeling bad , or unworthy , or that you have t o hide  part of 
who you are . There are many ways in which we struggle 
and are in conflict. To learn how to relax, to shed, to let 
go of, to overcome these stresses  we live under  is one 
of the great tasks of a human life.  
 
As we discover how to live without  conflict, then we get 
to be who we are. I like to believe that most of the 
unskillful  or harmful things we do to ourselves and 
others , come when we are in conflict.  And if we discover 
a deep abiding sense of the absence of conflict , 
struggle, greed, aversion, fear  in our heart, then what’s 
left is the flowers and the beauty of our heart. What’s left is that which is good. But what that is and how that 
manifests in any individual will be  different. I wouldn’t 
want to try to fit anybody into a Buddhist mold. If you’re 
going to be a Buddhist, you have to look like this , wear 
these kinds of clothes , and behave this kind of way.  
 
I am in awe of the many ways to be a human  being. 
Each of them is special. I hope that in doing this 
Buddhist practice, this mindfulness practice, it helps us 
discover how to be free of our own conflict, our own 
struggles, and how to have a peaceful heart. But I also 
hope that  it helps us to see a nd recognize the 
specialness , the value,  and worth of each human life – 
so that as we meet the diversity of different lives, we 
can celebrate, respect , and include them all. So that a ll 
beings are welcomed into our hearts  – so that all beings 
feel that the y belong  in our hearts . We are all in it 
together.  
 
I hope that this practice can lead to a recognition that 
we are all here in a mutually supportive way. Our open 
heart supports other open hearts. And when our heart is 
closed, we have our community to help us open. When 
the hearts of others are closed, we have our good will, 
generosity, kindness, and compassion,  which create a 
field that allows others to feel safe.  And as they feel 
safe, perhaps they can begin to blossom and open  up.  
 
Part of this day of celebration is to remind ourselves of what’s best i n our own hearts. And also what supports 
and expresses that – what creates a container of 
support . And so we usually chant the Refuges – taking 
refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. And we also 
use this occasion to renew the commitment to the 
beautiful gif t we can give to ourselves and the world. 
That is, to live by the Five Precepts  – not killing, not 
stealing, not lying, not engaging in sexual misconduct, 
and not intoxicating the mind.  
 
Some of you know this , and some of you don’t ; so 
because some of you might not know, I will chant each 
line first by myself, and then in call and response style, 
you can respond second. Th e chant  begins with 
homage or paying respect to the Buddha. Without the 
Buddha, his practice and his awakening, w e would not 
be here together as a community on Sunday morning.  
We would all be somewhere else. Because of him, we 
are here. Without him, this wouldn’t be happening.  
 
[Audience repeats after each line]:  
Namo  tassa  bhagavato  arahato  
sammāsambuddhasa  
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato 
sammāsambuddhasa  
Namo tass a bhagavato arahato 
sammāsambuddhasa  
 
 Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi 
Dhamma ṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
Saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
 
Dutiyampi buddha ṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
Dutiyampi dhamma ṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
Dutiyampi sa ṅgham saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
 
Tatiyampi buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
Tatiyampi dhamma ṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi  
Tatiyampi saṅgham sara ṇaṃ gacchāmi  
 
And then to recite the Five Precepts, I will do half a line 
in English, you will repeat; and then I’ll do the seco nd 
half. 
 
For the sake of our practice together, I commit 
myself to not killing.  
For the sake of our practice together, I commit 
myself to not lying.  
For the sake of our practice together, I commit 
myself to not take what is not given.  
For the sake of our practice together, I commit 
myself to avoid sexual misconduct.  
For the sake of our practice together, I commit 
myself to not intoxicating mind or body.  
 
When I teach the Precepts to children, I don’t call them 
the Precepts. I call them the Five Protections. I tell them that when they are babies , they can’t do anything for 
themselves. All of their needs are taken care of by the 
adults. Then, slowly as they grow up, they begin to take 
care of themselves. They start walking and talking. At 
some point they are toilet trained , and so they can take 
care of that by themselves. At some point they can take 
the public bus , or walk to a neighbor’s house down the 
stree t. There are all of these milestones. At some point 
when they are old enough, their parents aren’t really 
there anymore to protect them. They are out in the 
world on their own; but even then, they need 
protections. These five are very important protections  to 
carry your whole life. They might sometimes seem 
burdensome  until you live with having broken one of 
them. Then you have to live with the consequences, 
and you wish you had kept the protection.  
 
The Refuges of Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha are 
important as r eminders and inspirations. One way they 
are important is that they provide a context  or a 
reference point for our lives that is bigger than our own 
individual efforts. They point to our own efforts, that we 
can do this practice , and walk this path. In this  wider 
reference point is the Buddha and what that represents 
– the awakening. And the Dharma – the teachings and 
practices, the inner natural unfolding that isn’t quite our 
own doing, although we have to set the conditions for it. 
And the Sangha – the community that supports us as 
well. Sometimes it’s really crucial to know that there is a bigger container than just our own efforts, that we can 
feel we are carried and supported, reminded and 
guided.  
 
As we end,  those of you who would like  to, come up and 
wash the baby Buddha. Remember that the baby 
stands for you. As you wash the baby  Buddha , perhaps 
you are washing that which is most valuable and 
beautiful in your own heart ; and it is always there for 
you, available for you, even though som etimes it is 
obscured.
