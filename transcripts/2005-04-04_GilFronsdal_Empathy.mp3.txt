 This Saturday I was at Red Morton Park, which is a park in the middle of Edwards City. It's kind of the biggest park with my two and a half year old son. I was also there with my seven year old son because it was the opening day of Little League baseball season. So it was kind of the opening event. Now it kept my two and a half year old son's interest for about twenty minutes. At some point he was no longer interested in being there, and so he started walking away. I had a different idea of what he was supposed to do. It became a little bit my idea versus his idea. He was determined to walk out. There are a lot of strategies of how to work with a two and a half year old who has a will of his own. I don't really know those strategies very well. I thought, well this is interesting. I'll just try letting him go. If he gets thirty, forty, fifty feet away, at some point he'll realize that he's alone and he'll get frightened or something. He'll come back to me. It's kind of a game of chicken, right? To see who's going to blink first. He started walking twenty, thirty, fifty feet. He wasn't blinking. He kept going and going and going. The field where we were at was quite large, a very large field. I was kind of at one edge with all the people. He was way off the other edge. I could see him quite well. I could see what was going on. I was watching him there. He wasn't in any danger or anything. He was just walking down the path. I don't know where he was going, but he was heading out. There wasn't really no one there. At some point this woman ran by. She was jogging. She ran down the path and she saw this two and a half year old small guy going around. She looked down and she passed away. She looked around. Something's not right here. She kept running and looking where the parents were somewhere. She didn't know that I was tracking the situation. Then I saw her. She kept running, but she went maybe another hundred yards or so. There was a man sitting there. She stopped and started asking him questions. He was pointing back. I couldn't know what they said, but I could imagine what's going on here. Are you with that boy? At that point I blinked. Then I went off to find him and go get him and bring him back. I was so touched by this woman going by. This strong instinct. Strong feeling, strong impulse. She had seeing an unintended small child. Being concerned about that is it was her own business to take care of and do something about. To stop and inquire and see what's going on here and look into that. What is that instinct? What is that impulse to care for a young child? My seven year old also on Friday, he heard his finger. Not so seriously, but seriously enough that he had took him to the emergency to have it x-rayed and checked. He had one of those injuries that I think half of you are in the crowd here. If I tell you what it is, you'll probably cringe like chalkbrokers on a chalkboard. Tell me, what's your reaction when I tell you what happened to him with his finger? He got it jammed in the car door. What a response. He went to the doctor and it's not broke or anything, but the doctor thought he should wear it. The doctor calls it a froggy. Now it's called a froggy. In our house at least. It's this little metal splinter you wear on your finger so you don't bend it. At some point on Saturday or Sunday my son was playing around or something. He didn't hurt it again. It was almost like he hit it. Almost like it got hit by something. Before thinking, before cognitive recognition was going on, I could feel my body go, I could almost feel his pain, the potential pain in that finger almost getting hit again and hurting. Human beings have a capacity of empathy, of feeling each other, being concerned with each other, caring for each other. That is a pretty deep impulse in most everyone. I think that we often tune in, part of our being tunes in to the emotional environment around us, to the emotions of other people. We relate to that. We tune into that. Researchers have pointed out that even when people are not cognitively thinking that they're tuning into the emotions around them, they map very carefully the facial expressions of people. They see their facial expressions are changing slightly in relationship to the people who they're with. If the person is with gets sad, the faces change a little bit. This evening before coming here I was reading a Dr. Seuss book to the two and a half year old. There's a book called If I Had a Zoo. It's a different story. Horton and the Who. Horton is this elephant, partway through the book, it gets really sad. There's two pages with him, this really sad face. Then the third page he finds what he's looking for and he's really happy. We've gone over and over these three pages. I can't tell you how many times he's fascinated with these pages. This evening I watched his face and his expression. When he saw the sad Horton, you could see this poor kid. I said, what's happening here? My son would say, oh he's sad. His face would drop and his energy would drop. I didn't feel sad looking at the pictures of Dr. Seuss's picture, but when I looked at my son reacting to that picture, he was like, this is serious stuff here. Then I quickly turned to the other page. My son would just beam up, a tremendous light beam. I'd feel really happy just seeing my son being so happy. He was sensitive enough to the pictures, the cartoons, and I was sensitive to his reaction. It's been said by some researchers that, I don't know if I don't have any basis to understanding the evidence, but that some of our emotional reactions and responses to people and situations is precognitive. That some of us certainly is cognitive. We have to go through and think about things first and pass them through the filter of our thoughts and memories and ideas. But some of the things, certain kinds of emotions seem to have a certain precognitive aspect where before there's recognition, before there's thinking about it, before there's concepts around something, that somehow the nervous system or the bodily system will intuit or pick up or react or relate emotionally to what's happening. In particular, what researchers have pointed out is that the caring emotions are this way. Emotions of compassion, of caring, seem to have this kind of effect on people. It seems to be quite innate, quite deep. In Buddhism often, especially in Mahayana Buddhism, there's great teachings about emptiness. The realization and experience of emptiness is very important. It's said in the tradition that the experience of emptiness in its most pristine forms comes with compassion. When the mind is most empty, the mind is most clear, when the mind is not filled with or has concepts or ideas in it, thoughts in it, that that mind which is deeply at peace, empty in a sense, that has compassion in that there. It doesn't even have to have compassion for anything in particular. There's compassion in that place. So the abandonment or the letting go of all the concepts we hold on to, all the ideas of who I am and who other people are, what I need, what I want, in relaxing all those, which is a huge leap sometimes people have learned to do, that one of the benefits of that is coming to a place of caring, of compassion. I believe that's one of the meanings of the Tibetan mantra, or it's in Sanskrit, but used in Tibetan Buddhism a lot, om mani padmi om. Mani means jewel, and in the Lakati it means, it's um, or in other words, om mani padmi om, and padmi means lotus, and om, in the beginning, is just kind of like, you know, great. It doesn't mean anything, it's just a mantra, and om at the end is a mantra like hallelujah. But mani padmi means the jewel in a lotus, so it's like hail, the jewel in lotus, hallelujah. And jewel in lotus, lotus refers to the enlightened mind, or enlightened heart. And the jewel is a jewel which is found within the enlightened heart, within the freed or the awakened heart. And that jewel is compassion. So the heart of awakening is this wonderful jewel of compassion, of caring. In most, it's been pointed out, I haven't done the survey myself, but it's been pointed out that a lot of different religions have something or other that's similar to what's called the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In Buddhism, there's a few different places where it says that, something like that. But one I could find this evening was, everyone trembles at violence, everyone fears death. Seeing others as being like yourself, do not kill or cause others to kill. Seeing others as being like yourself. So here's an act of imagination, of seeing others as if they're yourself, being in your shoes in a sense, or imagining them in your shoes. So if you were in their shoes, how would you experience something? Or if they were you, and they were experiencing certain difficulties in life, what would it be like? So it's kind of the movement of empathy is in part a movement of imagination. And in part, it's something which is pre-imagination, pre-cognitive. It's both, they enhance each other. So the idea of imagining yourself as other, doing unto others as you want them to do unto you. In the Mahabharata, so in Hinduism, it says, do nothing to others which would cause you pain if done to you, or Confucius. What I don't wish people to do to me, I also do not wish to do to them. And Muhammad, no one is a believer until he or she desires for others that which he or she desires for herself. And Jesus, whatever you want others to do for you, do unto others. And then there's George Bernard Shaw. Don't do unto others as you would want them to do to you. They may have different tastes. It's been said in Buddhism that one of the primary foundations for Buddhist ethics is this kind of empathy, this kind of placing oneself in someone else's shoes, imagining self as other as self. And it's quite remarkable how much, what happens when we really sense and feel and understand someone else's situation. When we don't not only imagine what it was like, don't only imagine what it would be like for you to have that experience, which is, it keeps you a little bit removed from what it is like for that person to have that experience. Because that person has a different history, different dispositions, different capacities, different all kinds of things than you have. So for them to kind of break their finger, might have very different meaning than for you to break your finger, or whatever. So the act of imagination, to imagine what it's like if you were completely in that person's situation experiencing it. What's that like? Some of you perhaps maybe knew here today. Some of you have been here for a while and know a few people here in the group. But if we took 10 minutes, and we're not going to do it, so don't worry. But if we took 10 minutes and informed little groups of say three or four or five or something, and spent a little time, everyone saying a little bit about the struggles they or their family are having right now, their extended family or whatever, we would find that there's our hearts that start opening up very quickly to people who maybe were strangers to begin with. In 10 minutes we can kind of get a very quick, heartfelt connection. Just hearing about the challenges and struggles people are having with family members who are sick or in hospital or dying or relatives or neighbors or someone. Different things we're struggling with, drugs and alcohol and work and being fired and going to jail and all kinds of exciting things that I know, some of those things I know are happening here. And it would change the sense of how we are with everyone here. Some people when they're here, we're going to do this exercise now and find out who's here and what's going on. Some people get shy, some people don't want to. And it can be very quick, kind of defensiveness arises, a kind of resistance to getting to know someone else. And it's seen most clearly, what people often mention it, in going down the street and someone's homeless. Some people put up their resistance in a guard, you know, oh no. They read about the Pope and how wonderful he was and how passionate he was and are so inspired by what he's done to the world and how he helped the poor and all that. And they go, wow, that's how to be. And then you go out onto the street and you see this homeless person and not that one. You know, the guards go up. There's often fear. If I get to know someone or if I let them in, that then I'll be pulled into a whole world that I won't be part of or expectations or you know, will be on me and be difficult to extract myself from it. So one of the foundations of Buddhist ethics is empathy. And it's an interesting foundation because it's not rule-based. It's not some commandment that comes down from above, but rather it's based on a sensibility that we can have, a sense we can have of what's going on around us and sense of the impact things have on people not wanting to cause harm because we can feel what that harm causes for them. There are times in our life when that sensitivity can become stronger. And sometimes when it gets weaker, if we're harried and busy or self-absorbed, it's very hard to have the sensitivity to the people around us, the impact life is having on them, their emotional things, what's going on. And there are some times when, for various reasons, it might be hypersensitive and some people fall naturally in a range of sensitivity. There was a time in my life where I remember once someone pulled a leaf off a tree and I felt pain. I'm not going to try to explain why or what was going on, but I remember I felt tremendous pain. How could they do that? There was a time in my life where I had spent basically three months, more or less on retreat, and had a very, very deep sensitivity and very great openness to life. And just pulling off a leaf was something that caused me, oh, how could they do that? I couldn't imagine pulling a leaf off a tree. Now I pull leaves off trees. So I've gone downhill a little bit from there. But I had that tremendous sensitivity. Sensitivity, ethical sensitivity, your sensitivity, empathy, or being connected to others is partly connected to feeling unthreatened and feeling relaxed. If we feel threatened, it's hard to have empathy, hard to have feelings to be connected to someone else. And if we feel relaxed, if we're not feeling relaxed, it's also hard. But to be relaxed and unthreatened. Meditation practice, one of the things it's trying to do for us is help us be more relaxed. As we become more relaxed, we become more sensitive. Also, meditation practice is trying to help us find a place of being a healthy place, an appropriate place of feeling unthreatened, undefended. And mostly what people are threatened with in life is not to saber-tooth, tiger-shooting, chasing you down the street. But most people are threatened. People that live in a chronic feelings of fear or threat is often having to do with their ego, with their sense of self. Well, other people like me, well, they reject me, well, they get what I want. And to discover a place of being unthreatened is to discover a place in the psyche, a place in the mind or in the heart where we have very little at stake. Where someone could say something or someone can like us and not like us. And oh, it's okay. We don't feel like our sense of self-worth or unhappiness is dependent on that. We don't feel crushed by many things we might feel have to do with our ego. So part of what meditation is trying to find for us a place of well-being where we realize we're not threatened in a bowl, a place where we can't be threatened. Not because we're created walls around us, but because we no longer have these buttons of being egotistical or being afraid of things that maybe we don't need to be afraid of. One of the things that deep meditation practice is meant to also help with is to come to terms with the fear of death, of dying. And when a person doesn't have fear of death, then you're, again, you're kind of unthreatening. You can go into a lot of different situations without as much fear. So to discover a place of not being unthreatening, a place of being relaxed, at ease, open. And so you have to defend it. In that place, then it's possible to have greater levels of empathy or care, connectedness. Now, why do that? Why be interested in that? Why is developing greater empathy a useful thing? For one thing, it seems to be self-serving to do that. So that's good, right? This is wonderful what science discovers, more and more. And what they discovered is that when there is a healthy expression of empathy and compassion, that the body releases oxytocin. And oxytocin is a chemical that makes people feel good. It makes mothers feel good. Oxytocin is released when they nurse. Oxytocin, I think, is released sometimes in childbirth. Oxytocin is a wonderful chemical in the body. And it seems like acts of compassion, they've been able to measure, releases oxytocin. You feel better. And however, distressed anxiety over someone else's suffering doesn't release oxytocin. Anxiety, distress over someone else's suffering, increases the heart rate. Compassionate response decreases the heart rate. So you actually become calmer, more relaxed. And I remember once going on a guided tour in the desert someplace, we were going over these cliffs and this and that hiking. And there was this woman, an elderly woman, who had trouble pulling herself up over these ledges. We had to pull ourselves up over and around. It was a little bit difficult. And so I kind of stayed behind and helped her. I lifted her up and gave her a hand and different things. And what I noticed was how much I loved helping her. I just thought it was the best feeling inside of me. This is great. And it wasn't clear after a while whether I was doing it for myself or for her because I just felt so good. This is odd. This is really something. And recently I read about oxytocin. I wondered whether I was just getting a big storm of it. So one of the ways of feeling good is to help others. And that's one of the great cardinal rules of spiritual life everywhere, is if you want to feel good, if you want to develop your spiritual life, forget about yourself and focus more on helping other people. And now we know why. It's not some mysterious thing, but at least part of it has to do with chemicals. You'll feel better if you kind of, if you self preoccupation probably doesn't release a lot of oxytocin. But being concerned and helpful for others is the one that does it. There's often a lawyer, an attorney that goes along with self concern that says that self concern is really important. You have to be concerned for yourself and that's how you're going to get your happiness in your life. And so there's tremendous arguments in the head that keeps you involved in self concern. But to learn to relax it to some degree and to offer yourself to others in a way, I think there's a lot of people in our society that they feel a lot more psychological help by doing that. So partly it's self-serving. But I don't like that so much. You can do it just for yourself. I'm going to be really compassionate now so it's my own benefit. That's kind of odd argument. I think that it's just kind of like, I think of it as a side benefit from it. Before I read these kind of studies, I was quite content for myself, for talking about Buddhism to some degree, to say something like there seems to be just partly who we are, who I am. Is it partly someone who responds? If they're suffering, someone's in distress to offer to help. It's inseparable from who I am, or inseparable to the situation or to nature. It's just when I'm relaxed, what wants to come out of me, what flows is the concern for others. And it's not premeditated, it's not doing it because it's a good idea, it's not something that's forced or imagined. That's what comes out, that's what happens. And not to let it flow, not to let it happen, is a kind of violence or a kind of limitation. It's kind of like stopping something. The movement towards empathy and compassion, compassionate response, is not something that has to be premedicated at all. You don't have to be told that you should do this, but rather it's something that arises naturally when the heart is open, when we're open, relaxed, and undefended. In my own spiritual life, in my own Buddhist practice, I've noticed that as I practiced my practice went on and on, that my heart got more and more open. And I was really surprised by that because when I first became a Zen student, the word compassion wasn't in my active vocabulary. And I had no idea that it was something I should even want or desire. And I was really into the wisdom side of Buddhism. And then I was surprised, in retrospect, thinking back over my early years of Zen practice, that I wasn't getting any more enlightened during Zen practice, but I was getting compassionate. And through all the difficulties and struggles that I had, that slowly it was opening and relaxing my heart. And I was having developed this tremendous sense of sensitivity to the world, to others. And that sensitivity then felt like something very innate, very deep and very integral to who I am, if we can talk about myself. And it's something I can't imagine when it's there, not responding to, not living by. And I think there's many people who find that as they do, some kind of spiritual practice, that spiritual practice tends to open the heart. And not to allow it to open the heart, to stay defended and frozen, is really to shortchange what's possible, the potential of a human heart. Because one of the really most beautiful things is that jewel and lotus, that wonderful treasure that can be found in our hearts. And let that flow and move. The mystery of empathy, the mystery of compassion. So those are my thoughts about this wonderful topic. I hope that I conveyed in this little talk the wonderfulness of it. Do you have any thoughts about it? Any comments or questions? Yeah, it just seems that with the biologic state, I'm wondering why the chemistry part happens. Having that positive feedback, the oxytocin, that's a positive adaptation for society, for a community. If your body feeds you back, something positive when you have something that's helping something else is going to help the whole community. So that seems like biology has a good way of doing that. Yeah, so part of the evolution perhaps is rather than the survival of the fittest, is the survival of the ones who had the most oxytocin. Survival of the ones who could care for each other and offer compassion. One small advantage, or side advantage, maybe that when we have compassion, we get some relief from the preoccupation with our own problems. That can be, and sometimes it can be a danger. Sometimes it's helpful to where compassion can relieve our own preoccupation, our own problems. But there are some people who get addicted to helping other people as a way of avoiding their own problems. That's also possible. It can become escape. It can be escape. Could you give some of the hallmarks of when not getting involved is really the best activity? Not being involved? Yes, not reaching out, not doing something like that. Say with a drug addict who's done this for quite a while, something like that. If it's not going to help someone, if it's not going to be helpful, then don't help. Don't try to help. It's not going to be helpful. So with a drug addict, sometimes it becomes an enabling movement where you're helping someone along. Sometimes some people have to reach rock bottom. It's very sad. Sometimes I've known parents of alcoholic children, for example, have to make that kind of heart-wrenching decision to just let the child go. They become homeless, they're kind of drunk and whatever. They really try to do everything they can do, but nothing's going to help. It almost keeps them coasting along in their difficult state by trying to help. Occasionally they just say, okay, let this person bottom out. And then situations I've known, the child then came back. But there's risk involved then because sometimes they don't. Sometimes it doesn't help. Sometimes people are attached to being a victim. And so to treat them with compassion is kind of somehow reinforcing the victim mentality they have of poor me. So you kind of get a sense of the consequences of trying to help someone. And hopefully we have the wisdom to see that and know when it's not appropriate. So that's what occurs to me now. It's a very important question. And maybe some other people have comments to make about when it's not appropriate to help someone who's in distress. How do you really decide when not to help somebody? Let me, I'm a professor I teach. If I fail somebody in a particular course, there's a probability that the person will be thrown out of the school or thrown out of the college. And you realize that when you show too much compassion, the student is not going to improve. So how do you draw the line? Is it through experience or is it through humanity or is it through you know training? Like more lectures I attend here, the more I become lenient in the class. I become very lenient in terms of making sure that I don't throw the student out of the program. Let's put that way. You know I don't have easy answers to any of this, but one of the ways of finding an answer to these kinds of questions is trying to get to know the person better. So the more you know about the person, and so it's not just your imagination about who you think they might be, then you have more information to build a case for what's best to do. And I could imagine there was some student, there might be occasionally once every 10 years, for example, I don't know what, a student for whom the best thing you could do for the student is to fail the student. And the student kind of has to realize, wow, then when he wakes the person up, wow, I better get serious here. And that's really the best thing to come back to you many years later. It's like the best thing you did for me in school is you failed me. It happened so far. But you know, how do you make these decisions? And you know, sometimes it's really tough, you know, to make these big decisions for people and they're supposed to have big consequences, you know, they could have big consequences. And we wouldn't be responsible for these big consequences. It's a hard one. I had to fail. I was taught a class at the ITP once, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, and I failed someone. And I hated doing it, you know, just but the person hadn't done any of the work. Well, I think there's the experience of compassion. And then when when to act or be involved and when not, and I think of, I've watched a lot of people, including myself, get over committed and over involved in helping people and becoming sort of really a problem. And so I think there's a Thomas Merton quote about that, that I don't have memorized, but it ends with doing too much is submitting to violence. It's a really, I don't know, tricky to balance this. There's a also beautiful quote of someone says someone is someone wrote it after being in South Africa, like in the apartheid times. And anyway, there's a story about someone finding a cocoon, seeing a butterfly struck, trying to struggle out of a cocoon. And so the person goes along and helps the butterfly. And, and the butterfly falls to the ground and dies. And what the person doesn't realize is that only by struggling out of the cocoon does the wings get strong enough so that the butterfly can fly. So sometimes you need to leave people, you know, to struggle to or to make effort. And so sometimes with my seven year old son, sometimes I don't, I don't, sometimes he wants help. And he's in some kind of distress. And I tried to be really present for him and say, you know, I'm here, I care about what's going on. And I'll stay with you as you try to figure it out. Sometimes he doesn't feel alone or abandoned. But he also realizes he's not, he's not, he can't depend on me always. Yeah, I, I wanted to sort of follow up on what you were saying. I think it's interesting that we went from compassion to help. Because I think they are very different things. Compassion is a state of being. And help is an action. And so it, like every action requires skillful needs. And I think that's what we're talking about in the distinction. Just like someone can feel angry, they're in a state internally of anger. But they don't necessarily act. And compassion, I think is a way of being that may predict certain kinds of behaviors, but doesn't prejudge action. That's good. The word that comes to mind is wisdom. And the Serenity Prayer in particular, which does something like change what you can change, accept what you can't, and have the wisdom to know the difference. So it seems to me that the connection between compassion and action is wisdom. Yeah, I think so. And one of the, one of the, one of the guidelines that I use a lot, I think is very, very useful, is I try to pay very careful attention to my internal state, my emotional state, if I'm trying to help or have compassion. And if there's any fear or aversion in my trying to get rid of something or push something away, or out of aversion or from afraid in the situation, then I think, no, I have to pay much more careful attention. Because then it's, I'm more likely to be unwise about how I respond or act. And so rather than understanding the other person more, it's also very important to understand oneself more. And they track that. That, one's own emotional responses are tremendous and important information about our intentions and what's going on. I think you've probably answered my question here right now. What you were saying about compassion and getting, I can't remember the name of it, the chemical. Yeah. And then you mentioned something about, but if you're anxious, like anxious and anxiety, it's the opposite. Now, if you have compassion for someone and you're feeling their pain and it brings an anxiety, to you, then that's the opposite of this chemical. And you were talking about the leaf at one time after, when you even felt the pain, but now you can do it. So there's a balance that you've got to learn. Like I had an example yesterday, my daughter's dog was pretty much passing away. Although we didn't know just how long, but I was sitting and being with the dog and just touching it, gave me a nice feeling that I was there for him. But also it was struggling with the breathing and couldn't lie down and watching it. I could feel that and the anxiety inside me. Just part of me wanted to get away because I couldn't, I couldn't get away. So that was mine. This chemical, it makes you feel good, but what happens when you said about you learned when the leaf that you now can touch the leaf and you don't feel that? Is that just going through the learning and getting more wisdom? I think there's a lot of different things that can happen in responses to suffering in the world. I mean, one is a compassionate, empathy, compassionate concern. And there's also, which often, even though it might come with some feelings of wholeness or integrity or warmth or kind of the oxytocin effect or something, it also hurts. It can be pain. Empathy sometimes comes with a sense of pain, but that's also can be distinguished from distress or anxiety. And I think it's very, I've been in situations where someone's been in tremendous suffering and I felt kind of like I was happening to me and it felt really right in a sense. It felt right. It felt painful for me to be there in the room with a person, but I didn't want the situation, in a sense, I didn't want the person to suffer, but in a sense, it was right somehow, just felt right. And I would try to alleviate it or try to be helpful, but just felt right about it. Even though it hurt and there was empathy, it was there, the compassion was there. But then there's distinct from that is anxiety and distress and fear, often based on fear and worry and the stronger the level of distress we have around suffering externally in the world. More often, I think, my observation is that it has to do with unresolved emotions and feelings in ourselves. I knew someone who had a tremendous anxiety, not about people suffering, but about pet suffering, animal suffering. And when I worked with the person, I worked with the person about this, you know, kind of out of the charts kind of anxiety about pet suffering. It turned out the person, if I remember it right, many years ago now, was someone who had grown up in a war zone. And there was all this scars, internal scars about suffering and murder and death and all these things that had happened. And somehow, symbolically, I guess, the suffering of pets was what resonated with this deep unresolved suffering from her childhood. And so she needed to go back to this childhood trauma of what happened to her. And when she did that, then she was able to kind of not feel such horror around pets being injured or dying. So hopefully she still feels, you know, some concern about injured or pets and stuff. But her anxiety had not to do with, less to do with pets than had to do with her own unresolved issues. Thank you. I think the distinction between compassion and action was a really good one. And I would just comment on the teacher question. I've just been teaching for a couple years and I had that same thing of, oh my God, I'm going to fail this student and they're coming and saying, oh, or not, I've never failed, but lower than they wanted. And oh, you got to do this, or I won't make the honor rule and all this stuff. And really suffered with that. And then I started getting requests for recommendation for these folks to go to medical school. And I'm there, whoa, this person is not medical school material. And they're applying to all these medical schools. And I'm thinking of all the suffering that they're setting themselves up for because they've never gotten the feedback that maybe there's this great person that could do all these great things, but medical school ain't it. And so I think, you know, I mean, for me, looking at it from the bigger picture, I could be very compassionate and it would be the greater compassionate thing to help them understand where they could contribute in the world instead of giving them the great grade that sends them on the wrong path that they really couldn't do. I'll tell the last story of a friend of mine who's being trained to be a hospital chaplain. So she's doing the rounds in hospital in CPE. And she said, it's been the hardest year of my life. But my supervisors love me. They think I'm the best, but they keep coming to me and saying, what they keep telling me is you're not living up to your potential. We see that you have this great potential, you're holding back, you're shy. And they keep pushing you, you have to fulfill the potential. And that kind of stepping forward, being pushed forward is really hard for her, kind of painful for her, but she also is valuing and she's going to make a career out of this. So anyway, I hope this has been useful or interesting discussion. And you might over the next days or week, study a little bit your own responses and reactions to other people and other people's suffering and the movements inside of you have compassion, of empathy, of caring, of anxiety, and kind of study the whole complex of stuff and become more sensitive to the whole. And my belief is that the more we understand and see about how we work, the more wisdom is going to be there. Thank you.
