Dharmette : A Still, Quiet Place Within  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

One of the ideas  that is sometimes  associated with 
meditation is that of cultivating a  still, quiet place within . 
I think it’s useful to consider that a big part of what 
drives our mental activity is desire, intention, wanting 
something , or not wanting something. If you look at 
most of the things you’re th inking about on a regular 
basis, behind that thinking is probably some wish,  
desire or  intention – someth ing we want to accomplish 
or that’s important to us. If you’re thinking about the 
same topic  a lot,  then your mind is directed in that 
direction .  
 
Or if you come into a new place you’re unfamiliar with, 
and you feel some worry  about being in this new place, 
then your attention  is going to be directed towards 
surveying the environment, looking around , and seeing 
what’s going on. Your  mind is more outwardly directed. 
Or if you’re sitting in meditation , and you have an it ch 
you’ve never had before, then your mind might  start 
thinking that it certainly must be skin cancer. And then 
it’s going  to be hard for your mind not to be leaning 
toward s that itch or concern  – it’s directed in a certain 
way.   
Often the mind  or the attention  is directed towards 
something . We may not be  consc ious that we’re doing 
it. We think that we’re trying to be with our breathing. 
That’s the plan for meditation,  to be with the breath 
perhaps. But the mind is already directed  towar ds 
something else. And because it’s not so conscious that 
the mind is directed towards this thing that’s interesting 
or important, you easily get pulled into that world over 
and over again . Perhaps  you can let go of what you’re 
thinking about, but the mind  is still directed  toward  this 
particular thing , and so  the thoughts will just keep falling 
in that direction over and over again.  
 
That’s  a long way of saying that the mind is oft en 
directed in some way, focusing  on something 
consciously or subconsciously. When you meditate, 
sometimes  it can be helpful not just to decide you’re  
going to be with the breath , but in a deeper , broader 
way, to direct your attention  internally towards a still, 
quiet place within. That way, your mind is not directed 
outwardly into the future , or into things that  are more  
external , or disembodied like virtual thinking. Imagine 
that your eyes – rather than  gazing out ward  – are 
gazing down ward  and in ward  towards  the stillness 
inside  yourself. You’re  listening inwards to the quiet  
within . There might be chatter there, but you listen to 
the quiet part of it.  
 As you turn inwards, you might notice what parts of your 
body are being activated or energized . We often are 
involved in activit ies or carry a lot of tension in parts  of 
our body that are habitually used and activated in some 
way. You might find within yourself that there is much 
more energy in your upper chest because of some 
concern you have. Or you might see that the inner world  
is swelling upward into your head with energies when  
you have a lot of mental activity going on  there .  
 
As you turn towards the still, quiet place within, you 
might notice what parts of your system are not quiet and 
not still. Then , in the service of stillness and quiet, it 
might be possible to relax or soften those . You might 
not have a lot of success. Don’t  set your standards  too 
high, but try to relax the places that are activated  or 
tense. See if you can come back , relax , and soften into 
that still quiet place within. Then  once you get a little bit 
closer to that stiller , more peaceful  place  here and now, 
it become s an encouragement to be here, now, and to 
tune into and direct yourself to that part which is still and 
quiet. I would  suggest that there’s always such a part of 
you. Mostly we overlook  it, because we have all these 
other important things  to think about and be concerned 
about  – all these other things that  we tend  to give 
priority  to.  
 
For example , if you’re feeling tense, you can feel  
uncomfortable in your shoulders, forehead, jaw , or wherever . It’s very easy for the mind to become  
preocc upied with that  and prioritize it as an important 
topic for the focus of your attention. The mind is dire cted 
towards it.  
 
But what happens if you prioritize the still, quiet place 
within, to give that slightly more value or importance 
than the place of tension?  Who said that the places of 
discomfort should be our major preoccupation or 
concern in what’s going on ?  
 
Perhaps  there are times when this id ea of turning 
inward intentionally to a still, quiet place within will help 
you to arrive, settle and be present , more fully here. 
Perhaps  that quiet, still place within can be a nurturing, 
supportive plac e – one that is meaningfu l, sacred , 
wonderful , or nourishing . Once  you’re a little more in 
touch with that  place , then, with that as a foundation or 
background,  it might be easier to stay with your breath, 
and be more mindful of what’s happening in the present 
moment.  
 
So, if this idea seems to be something you can relate to , 
you might try as you begin your meditation, or after a 
little while of settling down , to intentionally turn yourself 
inward to the still, quiet place within. Then  relax 
whatever seems to be around the edges , and surrender 
yourself . Give yourself over to the still, quiet place within – as a shelter from the storm. May it be a place where  
you feel comforted, safe , and supported.  
 
Those are my thoughts this morning.  
 
 
Participant  1: How do you know you’re in a still, quiet 
place within?  
 
Gil: How do you know you’re in a still, quiet place 
within?  Either you know it or you don’t. I wouldn’t wo rry 
about it. If you can’t feel, sense , or tune in to an inner 
quiet place, then don’t worry about it . Don’t m ake that a 
reason  to be more anxious. Don’t  worry about it , and do 
your practice as you usually do it. But if it’s accessible,  it 
can be a support.  
 
Sometimes  though,  it can be an escape. Occasionally  
there are people who have an ability to go to an inner 
quiet place , and they use it to run away from their life. 
Every time there is a challenge , they go there and they 
never really look at what’s going on . So it can be 
overdone, but I think that generall y, most people don’t 
avail themselves enough of that quiet place. It may be 
more useful to encourage pe ople to go there than it is to 
point out when it’s overdone.  
 
Participant 2: I mainly want to say t hank you . I just find 
this so valuable. I want to test my understanding a little bit here. It’s not an either -or, where  we’re either 
disturbed or peaceful?  
 
Gil: No, it’s a matter of degree.  
 
Participant 2: It’s a matter of degree , and we have the 
ability to direct our attention to ward s the still  quiet just 
as much as towards disturbances that may be going on.  
 
Gil: And some people have the habit of only being 
interested in the disturbances.  
 
Participant 2: Right . I think I have a sense that if there is 
a disturbance going on , then I better pay attention to it. 
That’s the healing thing to do  – to be in touch with my 
feelings, an d try to find out what they are – but not 
always.   
 
Gil: Not always. Often  the instruction we give here is to 
pay attention to what’s predominant. But sometim es it’s 
not so helpful to go towards what’s disturbing , because 
it just keeps us more agitated. Sometimes  finding that 
place of inner stability, peace , steadiness, stillness, and 
quiet , and establishing some connection to that first, 
that gives us  a different  perspective from which to look 
at how we’re disturbed. Then we’re probably not going 
to be  as entangled  or caught by it. And m aybe we can 
have a more balanced perspec tive, from which to 
actually look at it in a nonreactive, noninvolved way.   
Participant 2: Thank you.
