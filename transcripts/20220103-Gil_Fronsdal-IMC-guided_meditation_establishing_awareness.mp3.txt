The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Hello everyone and I wish you all well for this new year and as we begin our
weekday meditation and teachings. So to begin I'll recite the beginning of the
Buddha's instructions for meditating in the Satipattana Sutta, the discourse on
the Four Foundations for Mindfulness. Go to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or an
empty building. Sit cross-legged with your body erect.
Establish awareness to the forefront. And mindfully, with awareness, breathe in
mindfulness, mindful, mindfully, with awareness, breathe out. So that's the
instructions. And I interpret this going to the forest, the foot of a tree, to an
empty building. Empty building meaning not some desolate, abandoned building in
town, but rather a small hut perhaps, meditation hut in the forest. But I
interpreted it to the best of our abilities to understand that when we
meditate, we're stepping away from our ordinary life. Not to abandon it, but to
be able to come back to it with greater awareness, greater calm, greater wisdom.
And so we do the equivalent, sitting down and everyone has a different posture
that works best for them. And the four classic postures are to walk, to stand, to
sit, and to lie down. Those are the four classic postures for meditation. So
whatever it works for you is fine. But to do it in a way that allows you to
have figuratively the idea of being upright, being erect. We have the word
upright sometimes meaning that someone is ethically sound, ethically, an ethical
person, they're upright, they're honest. And I think of mindfulness, meditation as
a practice of radical honesty. But it's an honesty that's very simple and very
much rooted here in the present moment. And so we establish awareness to the
forefront. So assuming your meditation posture, and maybe moving around a little
bit in your posture to see if there's some way that you can sit with greater
uprightness, figuratively, dignity, greater sense of personal worth, like you're
allowed to sit in this spot, you're allowed to exist. Because this here body and
mind is the playground, is the field of meditation. And lowering your gaze, maybe
45 degrees to the floor. And if it's comfortable, gently closing your eyes.
And then this idea of establishing awareness. For some people it might be
closely related to establishing a sense of being present. A certain kind of
wakefulness emanating from the body itself. The vibrating, pulsing body.
Establishing awareness is remembering, remembering that awareness is always part
of conscious life. We don't have to make it, or do it, so much as allow for it.
And then allowing yourself to be aware of the body breathing.
Every day, breathing will have differences. So coming to your breathing, every
meditation session, curious to discover how is it today? What parts of the body
are activated as you breathe?
To establish more of a connection to breathing, gently breathe in more deeply,
gently exhale more fully. Little bit as if you're rocking your body, expanding as
you breathe in, body gathering back together as you exhale. And not so much
that as you're focusing on the breathing, as it is you're more focusing on knowing
you're aware and doing it by means of breathing. If you know you're breathing,
you're aware. Maybe it's more like allowing breathing to remind you that you
are aware and to rest in that awareness.
There is a softness to awareness. There is an openness in awareness.
Let the rhythm of breathing remind you of being aware.
As if breathing is gently washing over your awareness.
To abide in awareness, to rest in awareness.
He is moving to a simplicity, simplicity of just being aware.
We're the center of gravity, the center of our beingness is in the awareness, not
in the projects we have, the stories we tell, the thoughts, the concerns. But at
the center of it all, a simplicity of being aware, which can be the seat for our
goodwill, the seat for our care for the world, rather than compassion and love,
being something that's work and strain and obligation, responsibility. It's
something that can flow out of the wellspring, the spring, the wells of
awareness. Where awareness can remain simple, open, soft, as we open our goodwill,
our well-wishing, that whatever ways in which we have benefited from this
meditation, may we share it with others, may it spread from us out across the
lands, so that all beings may be happy, all beings may be safe, so that all
beings may be peaceful, so that all beings may be free.
