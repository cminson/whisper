 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Connecting with yourself in this moment, however you are, can you simply hold that with a simple, kind awareness, a friendly awareness? Well, this is how things are right now. With an honesty about how things are, kind of that open curiosity, well, how are things really? No assumptions, no projections, just taking in the state of your body with its sensations, the state of your mind with its moods, emotions and thoughts, receiving, being with yourself. Perhaps that sense of friendliness can be what the attention rests with, more that sense of holding, of caring, the sense of being with, more than kind of focusing on the little bits of things coming and going, but just holding that heart of allowing whatever those comings and goings are. And can you maybe just rest with that allowing, as much as is available for you in this moment. This attitude of friendliness, of kind attention, curious, interested, in what's here without judgment or needing anything to change. That attitude is descriptive of our practice, of what our practice is. And this place of curious, receptive, friendly interest, in just how you are in this moment, as an amazingly potent power, a capacity to simply be with, to hold what's here, sounds so minimal, but the experience, when we touch into that capacity, the experience of that place of resting, can be quite profound, allowing us to open not only to what's happening, but also to beautiful heart-opening qualities, love and wisdom coming together, meeting experience, touching experience, opening to experience. And if you even have a taste or sense of the quality of that kind, curious attention, it begins to grow, the feeling of the kindness, of the curiosity, all of those qualities, wholesome, beautiful qualities, begin to grow. So not underestimating or undervaluing sometimes, perhaps the simplicity of just being here with what is. For some of you, that being here with what is might be more naturally settling with a breath or body sensation. For some of you, it may be opening to whatever is opulence, variety of sensations, thoughts, feelings, needs. It doesn't matter so much what we are paying attention to, but the quality of that curious, attentive interest, intimacy with yourself, intimacy with experience, that will deepen and open both wisdom and compassion, wisdom and love. And sometimes surprising ways, if we can, let go of looking for anything in particular to happen, needing to have some signposts that tell me where I am, but just with this, just this, patience and receiving. Thank you.
