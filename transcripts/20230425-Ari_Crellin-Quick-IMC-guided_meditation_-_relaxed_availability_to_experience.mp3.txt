The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

It's beginning by allowing yourself to settle into a posture that feels relaxed and comfortable.
And that supports a natural sense of wakefulness and alertness.
And feeling the body sitting, just recognizing however it is in this moment, just this simple experience of sitting.
And inviting a relaxing and softening in the body.
It can be helpful to begin with a sweep through the body, just inviting, relaxing and softening.
If you'd like, you can follow along or just practice in whatever way feels most supportive for you.
And feeling into the toes and feet. Being available to any sensations that are present here.
And allowing them to soften, to relax.
Letting the attention move up into the ankles and calves.
And softening the muscles of the lower legs.
And softening the knees into the upper legs and eyes.
Just receiving the sensations that are present.
And allowing them to relax and settle.
And up into the pelvic area, buttocks, sensing into the stability, the experience of weightedness on the chair or cushion.
Just receiving the sensations of the contact there.
Feeling the support and stability resting on the earth.
Allowing the attention to flow upward into the lower belly.
And abdomen.
Just receiving any sensation that is present here.
And inviting and softening.
Relaxing.
And up into the area of the diaphragm and chest and upper back.
Just receiving the sensations that are present here.
Allowing any tension to just release, to drain out.
Being very gentle.
Giving a lot of room for any tension that might remain.
It's okay.
No experience is a problem.
Allowing the attention to flow into the shoulders, upper arms, lower arms, and hands.
Feeling the arms and hands just resting.
Letting them be hanging naturally weighted down into your lap or wherever they're naturally resting.
Your hands are touching.
Just receiving the simple sensations of that contact there of your hands touching.
Perhaps your hands on your thighs.
And inviting and softening.
Relaxing the sensations of the muscles.
Feeling into the space of the neck.
Feeling into the jaw.
Sensing into any extra tension or holding.
Just allowing it to soften.
And in the mouth, tongue, and lips.
Feeling into the space of the nose.
Perhaps noticing the sensations of the air of the breath flowing in and out of the nose.
Just very gently, lightly receiving.
Feeling into the space of the eyes.
Very often holding some extra tension here.
Just very gently inviting, softening, settling of the muscles around the eyes.
Letting the gaze, the internal gaze, be soft.
Letting the gaze of the eyes be soft even with the eyes closed.
Feeling into the space of the head, into the forehead, the top of your head, the back and sides.
Just allowing a softening, a settling.
Imagine that the breath is coming in not just through the nose, but also through the eyes, through the temples,
through the forehead, through the top and back and sides of your head.
Feeling the energetic openness of the head as the breath flows in and out.
Just allowing any extra tension just to simply drain away.
Receiving the experience of the whole body sitting.
Perhaps even broadening the awareness, letting the sense of the body expand.
And letting the effort be relaxed, just a resting with, not a hard focusing.
And from this space of resting and the body invites you to invite the space of the mind to relax.
Letting the thinking, the focusing soften and settle.
Trusting that there can be an effortless awareness.
Not so much something that you need to create, but something that we can be available to.
Can we be here in a fully present and available way?
In a simple and relaxed way.
Just receiving this simple experience of body and mind.
Remembering that no experience is a problem. We can know and receive any experience.
No need to make anything happen, or make anything stop happening.
Thank you.
If there's any sense of natural pleasure or comfort in the body or in the mind.
Allowing this comfort, this pleasure, this ease to be a source of nourishment.
And we take it in without clinging, without trying to get anything from it.
But receiving and appreciating the wholesome pleasure of a mind that is not clinging.
Thank you.
And when the mind is clinging, can we know that in a gentle way?
Perhaps even with an inner smile, an inner kindness.
No problem.
This is just part of being human.
This is all part of what we are learning to be with in a skillful way.
In our meditation practice.
Abiding in simply receiving, recognizing, being with moment to moment experience.
Knowing the body as the body.
Knowing the mind as the mind.
Knowing the body as the mind.
Knowing the body as the mind.
Knowing the body as the mind.
Knowing the body as the mind.
Knowing the body as the mind.
Knowing the body.
