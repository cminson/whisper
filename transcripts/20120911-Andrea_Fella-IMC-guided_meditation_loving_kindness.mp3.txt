The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

This morning I'd like to do a guided meditation with loving kindness practice.
Since we've been talking about the loving kindness practice for the past few weeks.
And I know there are several of you here who haven't been here, so I'm hoping that the guided meditation will be...
I'll try to do it in a way that will be self-explanatory so that everybody can follow along.
And I'll just say a few words at the beginning.
The loving kindness practice is a meditative practice that supports and encourages the quality of open-heartedness in our minds.
And we do this by actively inclining the mind, reflecting on wishes of goodwill for ourselves and for other people.
And we do this at first by explicitly, we'll start this morning by wishing thoughts of goodwill for ourselves.
And then for someone for whom it's pretty easy to wish kindness.
Someone who perhaps has helped you a benefactor.
And then to a dear friend and then to a person that you don't know well.
And then to somebody for whom it's kind of difficult.
So that's what we've covered in the last few weeks is the practices around those things.
And so we'll wish thoughts of goodwill to those specific people.
And that'll probably take us through to the end of our meditation, which will be about half an hour this morning.
So beginning by allowing your body to relax and be as comfortable as possible.
Settling into your body.
And allowing the attention to rest in the area of your heart.
Perhaps having a sense of breathing through your heart.
And just noticing whatever experience you notice in the area of your heart.
There may be feelings of heaviness or lightness, tension or ease.
Just noticing and allowing whatever is there.
In the process of exploring the loving kindness practice.
We're not trying to artificially create anything.
We instead try to incline our minds in the direction of goodwill.
And then begin to see how that resonates for us to do so.
And so having a sense of what is happening in the area of the heart will be a part of the practice this morning.
And continually checking back in.
And how is the heart responding now?
And we'll begin the loving kindness practice.
I'll also probably use the word metta, the Pali word for loving kindness.
The metta practice this morning.
By directing thoughts of goodwill to ourselves.
And so let's begin by bringing ourselves to mind in some way.
That might be the simplicity of yourself sitting here.
Just the felt sense of yourself here in this moment.
It might be an image of yourself.
If you have a photograph that you remember in which you have an expression of happiness or ease on your face.
It could connect with that image.
And another way in connecting with yourself to begin to incline our minds towards kindness.
Is to recall, reflect on kind things that you have done.
Either for yourself or for other people.
And these might be really simple things.
Like opening the door for someone or letting somebody go before you at the grocery store.
Or taking a friend to the airport.
Just some simple things, the ways we help each other.
Reflecting on qualities you like about yourself.
You appreciate about yourself.
This can sometimes be challenging.
So I just want to name that.
Not alone if this is challenging for you to bring qualities to mind that you like about yourself.
And everyone here has the beautiful quality of interest of exploring their hearts and minds.
Appreciate that about yourself.
Come here with an intention to explore your heart and your mind.
And with this sense of yourself, we'll begin expressing thoughts of goodwill to ourselves.
And we'll do this in a simple way. I'll suggest some specific simple phrases.
Be happy. Directing that wish of goodwill to yourself.
And with that wish, check in and see just with each wish that we make during this meditation.
Just return the attention to the area of the heart.
And see what's there.
May I be healthy.
May I be safe.
May I live with ease.
And we'll continue in this way. I'll say these phrases a few more times so they get into the flow of your mind.
With each phrase, understand the meaning of the phrase and check in.
How does this impact me to make this wish?
What happens in the area of the heart?
And again, there is no right or wrong.
There's no supposed to feeling that's supposed to happen.
It is just however this phrase lands for you in this moment.
If it brings up feelings of fear or contraction or confusion, that's okay.
This is actually part of how the practice works.
It brings into our minds things that get in the way of wishing ourselves well.
And so seeing if you can allow those feelings to come up into the surface of the heart
and continue wishing yourself well.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be safe.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be safe.
May I live with ease.
And noticing that these phrases begin with the word may, it's not a demand, it's a wish.
And we're connecting with that wish.
So continuing for the next minute or so, well, I'll be silent for a minute or two
and allow you to continue this exploration of sending thoughts of goodwill to yourself.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now bringing into your mind someone who has helped you in some way perhaps,
someone from whom it's easy to have feelings of goodwill towards.
Pick a being that makes you smile.
That might be a pet, a child, a teacher, a grandparent, someone for whom it's easy to feel goodwill
and for whom there's not a particularly complicated relationship.
You might want yourself to connect with this being perhaps either with an image of this being
or might work for some of you to imagine you're sitting with this being
and the feeling that comes when you're sitting with this being.
You might use the name to help evoke a sense of this being.
And we also find it helpful to connect with ways perhaps this being has supported you,
kind things they've done
and qualities that you appreciate about this being.
Let's begin offering wishes of goodwill to this being.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you live with ease.
May you be happy.
And with each phrase connecting back to the area of the heart,
the felt sense in the area of the heart and again seeing how does it impact you to make this wish.
No right or wrong response, just noticing.
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you live with ease.
Continuing in silence for the next little while to wish this being well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bringing a dear friend to mind.
Imagining them in whatever way works for you to connect with a sense of them.
Recalling qualities that you appreciate about this person.
And if other things come up that you resist or think about,
they're that but they're that way too.
Let's see if you can allow them both to be there and land a little bit more in the side of what you appreciate.
Bringing to wish thoughts of goodwill to your to a dear friend.
May you be happy.
Connecting with the person.
Expressing the phrase in your mind.
And checking in. How does it impact you to make that wish?
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you live with ease.
Continuing for the next few minutes.
Bringing to wish thoughts of kindness and goodwill to a dear friend.
Knowing and recognizing that if qualities that things that seem completely opposite to goodwill are coming up in your heart.
This is actually part of how this practice works.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bringing to your mind someone that you don't know very well.
Someone for whom feelings are pretty neutral.
Perhaps a grocery store clerk.
A bank teller. Postal worker.
Someone that you can get a sense of.
That you don't have much feeling about one way or the other.
This person into your mind.
And beginning to express the wishes of kindness to this person.
You too. May you too be happy.
And check in. See how does it impact you to make this wish.
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you live with ease.
And continuing in silence to wish this person well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now bringing to mind.
Someone for whom there may be a little struggle.
I wouldn't pick the person for whom there is the most difficulty in your life.
Pick a person.
Maybe there's a little irritation or annoyance that's happening right now.
There's a little tension in the relationship.
And bringing this person to mind.
And you might try reflecting on this person in a way where it feels safe for you to wish this person well.
You could imagine them on the other side of the country.
In some place where they're at a distance.
And for a few minutes also wish kindness, thoughts of goodwill for this being.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you live with these.
Continuing for just a few moments to connect with thoughts of goodwill for this person.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For the last minute or so of this sitting allow yourself to bring to mind whoever it was easiest to make these wishes well.
Make these wishes for to express this thoughts of kindness and goodwill.
Whichever person it was most easy for you bring that person back to mind.
And spend the next minute or so, the last minute or so of this sitting wishing that person thoughts of goodwill.
Also might be yourself, might be any of this categories, whichever category is easiest.
Thank you.
