Dharmette : Fluidity in Mindfulness  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

The most common practice we do here at IMC is 
mindfulness . People have all kinds of associations with 
mindfulnesses . But sometimes I like to think that 
mindfulness is different in different situations . Part of the 
task of being mindful – of monitoring and  tracking  what’s 
going on  – is to know what kind of attention , what kind 
of presence, what kind of mindfulness is needed a given 
situation . It’s important to have the fluidity, the flexibility, 
to switch the kind of attention we have .  
 
Sometimes what’s needed is attention to detail . You 
could focus on something very particular and refined  – 
in your breath perhaps , or in the world around you . And 
sometimes what’s called for is a very broad, panoramic 
or wide-angle awareness of what’s going on . If you’re in 
a group situation, r ather than focusing on the p articular 
person you’re with and the conversation you’re having, 
perhaps you need to open up the attention and take in 
the whole crowd, the whole room , and the group 
dynamics . 
 
How do you know if what’s needed is  the small or the 
large  view? You kno w it by  checking it out . If I’m being very focused for a long time on a particular thing , 
sometimes I’ll step back and say , “What am I missing 
here? What else is going on here? ” Or if my attention is  
a very broad, spacious awareness , sometimes I’ll check 
it out, asking , “Would it be useful here to focus more 
precisely and look at something more carefully? ” 
 
Part of the flexibility is not just whether we use a close -
up or a wide -angle lens  – but also what  we pay attention 
to. To have some wisdom to know , “Oh, now I need to 
focus on my body. What’s going on here physically? 
Now I need to focus on my emotions. Now I need to 
focus on my beliefs,  my thoughts. Now I need to stop 
focusing on myself. Now I need to focus on someone 
else [laughs] , or on  the situation a round me .” When you 
are driving , maybe you should be focusing on driving 
[laughs] , as opposed to other things that you could be 
thinking about.  
 
The key thing is the flexibility to be able to explore and 
see if what I need to focus on here is di fferent th an what 
I think it is.  If we’re paying attention to one thing for a 
long time , it’s helpful to step back and ask, “What else is 
going on here that maybe needs attention? ” If I keep 
focusing on my past , and thinking over and over again 
about what happened in the past,  I need to notice , “Oh 
that’s what’s going on. That’s my focus right now . Is this 
what serves me best? Do I have the flexibility to not 
focus on the past , but rather on the present , if that what’s needed here? ” 
 
Someone who’s mature in  mindfulness practice is 
someone who not only has the ability to be mindful , but 
they also have the flexibility to able to switch back and 
forth in different states of attention, different focus es, 
different states of being . It’s not a matter of always 
being one way . It’s not always about being calm or in 
some deep state of concentration . You can be in a very 
deep state of concentration, perhaps, and something 
could happen around you that requires you to change 
gears right away. It could be anything .  
 
On Sunday here at IMC, near the end of our sitting, a 
police officer came to our door . A lot of people come to 
our door , and we just keep sitting . But if a  police officer 
comes , it requires a different attention . You don’t just 
answer the door  with wide eyes, ‘Wow [laughs], t his 
present moment is sparkling ; everything’s so special : 
your eyes and the glint on your gun  [laughs]. ” You need 
to have  the flexibility to know what the situation  
requires . Perhaps  that was appropriate in one situation , 
but now I need to say, “Yes, Officer [laughs] .”  
 
For people who have the ability to get into deep states 
of concentration, t hat flexibility to go in and out of 
concentration is very important to learn . It’s importan t to 
learn how not hold onto to it or be stuck in it – and to 
have the capacity be fluid  when  something else or some other way of being in the world is needed.  
 
If you’re scattered and running around and you come to 
IMC, where  people are settled and calm , do you have 
the flexibility to notice that , and adjust accordingly ? To 
not come in here like you’re a  lumberjack: pounding the 
floor,  slamming doors , and yelling out, “ When’s the next 
sitting?  [laughs] .” To just know that this is a place to 
settle down, a nd be in a different mode . To have 
flexibility , fluidity , is a very important part of practice.  
 
Another part of our mindfulness practice is that it’s not 
just a matter of bringing different kinds of attention , but 
it’s also a matter of bringing different kinds of 
involvement in different situations . Different situations 
call for different involvements . I sometimes think that 
one of the great synonyms for mindfulness or practice is 
the word ‘participation .’ Rather than , “How can I be 
more mindful here? ” we ask,  “How can I participate 
more fully in what’s going on here? ” 
 
One of the shortcomings in our mindfulness tradition is 
that it’s too easy to think that you’re always supposed to 
have this self -conscious attention, with a little bit of 
distance, and calm , and always focusing on: “What am I 
feeling here? What’s going on with my breath? What am 
I thinking? What’s the attachment here? What’s the 
delusion here? What’s my intention? ” It’s all self -
preoccupied [laug hs]! This sometimes gets overdone in our tradition . Sometimes it’s really important is to let go 
of self -preoccupation . Some situations require that we 
let go completely , and just really be there . The word 
‘participation ’ is wonderful : “How do I participate fully in 
this activity here? ” 
 
It could be as simple as washing the dishes . Sometimes 
you’re washing dishes , and it’s nice to do it being 
mindful of: thoughts, feelings, breath, body, your 
relationship to it, your in tention . You can learn a lot  from 
that. But s ometimes what’s more valuable is to learn 
how to let go of that whole focus on self , and just do the 
dishes [laughs] ! Enter into the world of dishes as if that’s 
all there is : you and the dish, you and the soap . And you 
almost  become one w ith the dish washing , and you 
forget all this . 
 
In mindfulness practice, if  you sweep mindfully, you’re 
aware of the feelings, what it feels like to hold the 
broom , the sound of the rake across the gravel , and 
your relationship to it all – it’s a big world to explore . But 
the way you rake in Zen , is that you become the raking . 
You disappear in the process of raking because you 
participate so fully in that activity.   
 
Sometimes what’s called for is not careful attention in 
the way that we often think about it in mindfulness . But 
what’s called for is a capacity  to be flexible, to let go of 
any real focus on oneself, of concern with oneself , and in that way,  to really fully enter into that, in a clean way,  
a full way, without resistance, without holding back, 
without judging, without having a sense of self . There 
has to be the wisdom to know when it’s appropriate . But 
it’s very powerful to enter into something so fully that we 
have an experiential feeling o f not being self -focused in 
any way at all . All t hat just falls away , and we kind of 
disappear in the activity of washing dishes . It’s really 
safe to do that washing dishes . But there might be 
situations where it’s not safe, or not appropriate to 
merge, to participate so fully.  And there are times when 
that’s what’s called for.  
 
I think that too often mindfulness students err on the 
side of this self -conscious mindfulness , and  it keeps 
them a little bit removed from what’s going on . And Zen 
students someti mes err on the side of being too merged  
with what’s going on , and not being aware of their 
feelings and what’s going on inside of them . So the Zen 
student can be seemingly completely  merged with 
raking , and not aware of all the anger that’s there , 
whereas  the Vipassanā student is aware of all the anger 
[laughs] , but they’ve forgotten about the raking [laughs] . 
 
Having  the flexibility and fluidity to go  back and forth  
with different kinds of attention , and different ways of 
being is part of that maturation  – part of our growth in 
the practice.  
 How fluid are you? How flexible are you? How willing 
are you? How able are y ou to change modes of 
attention  and modes of being  depending on what the 
situation ca lls for?  
 
Those are  my thoughts for today. What kind of attention, 
perhaps, was called for when you were  sitting here? 
Another way of being in the world is called for now, for  
those of you who are going to stay and help with the 
cleaning.
