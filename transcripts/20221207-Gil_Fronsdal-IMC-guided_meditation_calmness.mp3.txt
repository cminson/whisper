Hello and welcome to this third day on the series of the Gladness Pentad.
In the middle one here today is tranquility.
It's specifically tranquility of the body, but we can also consider it also a tranquility of the mind.
And meditation is often associated with calmness, and people will do meditation to become calm.
But I'd like to propose that the calmness that we develop through meditation is not only for its own purpose,
but for the benefits that come with calm.
And one of the benefits is that our body and mind becomes organized, itself organizes in the calmness.
When we're not calm, when we tend to be disorganized, we're scattered, fragmented, agitated.
Sometimes jumping around, sometimes the thoughts are buzzing or jumping back and forth between things.
Sometimes the body can't be still.
Sometimes the body just keeps moving because being still is too uncomfortable.
And the constant movements of the body, the constant movements of the mind, can very easily become a disorganization process.
It's scattered, divided, fragmented.
And as things become calm, there's a settling, and in that settling, things begin to shift and change and become organized.
The classic Buddhist way of talking about this is that things become unified,
but unified doesn't suggest the ways in which things cooperate or coordinate that may be organized does.
And as we become more calm and more organized, more settled, it allows the mind and body to heal, to settle, to come alive in different ways.
And most importantly, it allows for a cleaner, more direct operating of our intelligence, our creativity,
and our focus.
And to bring our intelligence and our creativity to becoming focused in meditation,
to being really here in a wholehearted way, a wholeness that is also a wholesomeness.
So to become, and perhaps by mentioning these benefits from becoming calm,
maybe you will give this a try as we sit here in maybe a little bit more intentional way than you might in meditation.
So assuming a posture that is an organized posture, organized for the purpose of meditation,
just like a, maybe like a painter on a canvas will bring the whole body into being really present.
The body's organized, it's gathered together for the purposes of just being really there precise with the brush of the stroke.
Or the way the cook might be slicing, making a beautiful slice of some vegetable to adorn a dish.
Be right there, precise, focused with the body gets involved and connected.
And it's organizing the body, taking care with your posture so that it's a posture that you begin feeling that as much as your posture can,
in a relaxed way, is cooperating, participating in the meditation.
Maximum participation of the body in being intentionally present here and now.
And sometimes sitting up straighter will allow for a much deeper relaxation of the body than leaning back and slouching in a couch.
Initially it seems like it's more work, but over time an aligned body can let go deeply.
I read once that the two postures that allow for the deepest relaxation of the body is the yoga posture called the corpse laying flat on your back.
And the other is sitting cross-legged with a spine erect, not slouching, gently closing your eyes.
So the eyes are not doing, looking at things, they're different than being here in the meditation.
One more time with the eyes closed, making small adjustments to the posture, almost as a ritual of getting the body organized and participatory in the meditation, in being alert.
And then taking a few deep inhales and using the expansion of the rib cage, the torso as you breathe in,
as a way of deeply connecting to your body, the stretching, the opening, feel it fully, and then the long exhale, soften and relax.
Long exhale, settle into this body.
Taking a really deep breath that expands the torso, gives the torso a chance to reorganize itself as you exhale.
Refine itself.
And then to let breathing return to normal. And with normal breathing, relaxing the different parts of the body, both to relax them,
and also to begin this process of reorganizing the body to be a cooperative whole on the exhale, relaxing the muscles of the face.
Softening around the eyes.
Exhaling and relaxing the shoulders, feeling the weight of the shoulders, releasing.
Softening the belly as you exhale.
Maybe there's a way of relaxing the belly as you inhale as well.
And then on the next few exhales and the inhales, feel your whole body in a global way.
In the exhale, relax your whole body. Release any breathing you have, breathing against life.
Releasing any momentum forward into time to do, to worry.
And then relaxing the mind.
Maybe also on the exhale, a gentle softening of the thinking mind.
A gentle quieting of the thinking.
Any pressure or tension, agitation in the thinking mind.
Let it relax and let the weight of it settle it, quiet it.
And the fragmenting forces of the mind begin to quiet down.
And gathers together in a settle place within.
Gathers together in a settle place within.
And instead of now focusing on breathing from the control tower, looking down,
imagine that there is a kind of a canal or a tube from the brain down into the belly.
And as you exhale, all the thoughts and mental activity, awareness itself,
moves down that canal down into the belly and rests there, settles there together
to experience the movements of the belly as you breathe.
Where everything is allowed to organize itself around the movements of the belly.
If the mind wants to be at peace, you can support that by having the mind rest in the belly.
And as you exhale, all the thoughts and mental activity, awareness itself,
and mental activity, awareness itself,
all the thoughts and mental activity, awareness itself,
all the thoughts and mental activity, awareness itself,
all the thoughts and mental activity, awareness itself,
all the thoughts and mental activity, awareness itself,
Relaxing on the exhale and perhaps feeling how the scattered parts of ourselves
gather together, settle down together,
fit themselves together in an organized whole,
letting go, relaxing, allowing everything to settle around the breathing.
