So continuing again this reflection on not self. 
There's so many different teachings that we can point to and explore both as reflection and as practice. 
I think we've covered, I'm not sure how many we've covered, but there's, I have a list of some, I don't know, four or five more topics that we could talk about. 
Tonight, I wanted to continue looking at the ways the Buddha talked about how we identify self and a tool he offered actually. 
He often, very common in the suttas is this phrase. 
One should see experience and he'll explore experience from different perspectives either through the five aggregates or the six sense bases. 
One should see experience as it actually is with right discernment. 
This is not mine. 
This I am not. 
This is not myself. 
He often goes around pointing to this set of reflections which are basically trying to counter our habitual reflections, our habitual way of relating to experience. 
This is mine. 
This is who I am. 
This is myself. 
So he points to this as a, I think this is a really kind of very direct and simple in a way pointing to different ways that we identify, different kinds of identification. 
Last week, we explored identity view and the 20 kinds of identity views. 
And the four different ways of identifying with any of the aggregates. 
So I am form, feeling, perception, mental formation, consciousness. 
So I am that thing. 
That thing form is mine. 
So we could say, you know, I am the body. 
We went through this last time. 
The body is mine. 
The second one, I am in the body, the third one, or the form or whatever the body is in me. 
So different different ways of identifying. 
And that four part scheme, I think it's a useful kind of reflection. 
It's a place to kind of pull apart or as a reflection more than as a practice, I found as a practice, it feels pretty complex to look at. 
Okay, what, you know, here's identification, you know, okay, is it form or feeling or perception and which one of these four is it, it gets pretty, pretty heady. 
It can be useful to reflect on these things. 
And so like we did last time, it's like, yeah, sometimes I think I do that one sounds familiar. 
I am in the body. 
Yeah, I think I know that one. 
Or consciousness is inside of me. 
And that, yeah, that feels kind of like I know that one. 
So I think it can be useful to reflect on those but what I have found for myself at least and you may find it different so, you know, don't take my experiences being, you know, applied for you. 
But in the middle of practicing in the middle of being in a meditation sitting or just being aware of my experience. 
I haven't worked with that framework enough to have it be very natural and easeful. 
It's like I have to stop my practice for most. 
Okay, let's think about this and, and so it feels a little bit, a little bit more like reflection than a direct experience. 
But it really can be useful to, to explore through reflection, explore what kind of, how am I identifying right now and to actually think it through the Buddha and just just to point to this you know we in the in the west and these, in these days, we highlight in this tradition that we're a part of, we highlight the meditation practice and we highlight direct experience, pretty much above all else, you know, it's like that's, that's where we, we aim a lot. 
But when you look at the, the teachings that the Buddha offered, they're quite varied. 
He offered a lot of reflective practices, a lot of practices to help us kind of disidentify through using our intellect. 
He used he talked about a lot of ethical practices and relational practices and so he didn't just look just at mindfulness and let's just be mindful he brought in other things that will support our mind to have the perspective of right view. 
And this, the sentence that I read, one should understand experience as it actually is with right view. 
This is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. 
And that phrase, this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself is in quotes in the Sutta indicating a thought indicating using this as like a wisdom reflection. 
So this, this can be used as a tool for us, this reflection can be used as a tool for us in our practice, maybe and I've used it at times when I felt caught by something. 
You know, if I if the mind feels a little bit caught or agitated, sometimes this phrase will come into the mind. 
And that can help to create a little bit of space around it. 
I may not exactly see how I was identifying but I can, I can, it's just a little wisdom reminder that the mind is constructing this mess right now. 
And there's an identification happening here. 
And this is just delusion at work. 
So, so we can use this kind of tool as a reflection as practice as a support for our ability to meet experience. 
We often find that wisdom reflections and there's three basic categories we could say of wisdom reflections that point to the three understandings that the three we could say doorways of understanding for freedom. 
And that is the reflection on impermanence, the reflection on unreliability that experience is not reliable there's nothing reliable because it's impermanent essentially, nothing reliable as a place to land for lasting happiness, and the reflection on not self. 
There can be both understandings that come through direct experience, through seeing the impermanent nature of experience through understanding directly. 
This experience is not reliable as a place for happiness, or through understanding. 
This is just causes and conditions are rising there's no self here, but we can also use the reflections. 
Perhaps using, you know, if, if when we're caught, we can sometimes see what we're caught around if we're caught around like, you know, holding on to something. 
This is impermanent that might be a useful reflection to bring in. 
And so this reflection on not self, this is this is something that the Buddha pointed to as a tool for us, bringing in the wisdom at times when we are feeling caught. 
So I wanted to just unpack this reflection a little bit because I found it useful. 
I found this particular reflection really useful. 
And at first it was a little. 
Yes, I didn't quite understand the difference between the three I understood the difference between. 
This is not mine, and this I am not, but the difference between this I am not and this is not myself it was it was less clear to me. 
And, you know, I don't know if my understanding which grew out of my own practice in my own experience is what the Buddha was pointing to or not. 
So that's a caveat here. 
I have found maybe one place where there's a kind of connection to the way I understand it. 
And in any case, my, my reflection on these three as different and kind of deepening ways that we kind of more and more subtle ways that we identify that that I found it really useful and a kind of very easy three part scheme or three part way to see at what level am I identifying. 
So, and, and it fits very nicely with the order here because this is not mine. 
That's like the most obvious kind of clinging that we do when this is mine, you know when we cling to something is me as mine. 
It's an ownership. 
It's a kind of an ownership and the, the, the mine is creating the owner. 
And that's often, at least, you know, that's, that's, you know, this is a two year old kind of identification, you know, mine, this is mine. 
So this is a very familiar one to us. 
I think it's an early kind of identification is pretty obvious to us when it's happening. 
So that's one flavor of this, this kind of identification. 
And to me it's one of the most obvious maybe the grossest form of selfing that possessor, the one who thinks they owns who feels like they're the owner. 
And the second one, this I am not. 
To me, this piece is kind of that level of identification around the eye that feels like it does things. 
The eye that feels like it's in control of things. 
So, so this is this I this I am, I am the one who does who chooses who acts who decides. 
So it's, it's kind of like I as the subject of the sentence. 
So that that flavor of I, I think the control aspect that we talked about a couple, you know, some weeks ago, that to me is a big piece of this part. 
So, to can be a little more obvious in ways, especially around emotions. 
You know, I am angry and you know this anger is the anger is kind of propelling me to choose and to act and decide and make, you know, make decisions and make choices. 
I'm not with emotional identification, the sense I am, at least for me that that can be a big place for this kind of of identification. 
So this is not mine to say I am not and we can flip it around. 
You know that the way we habitually identified this is mine. 
This is who I am. 
So those flavors of identification that this is not myself. 
The language of that is kind of putting, putting the identification as the, not the subject of the sentence but the object of the sentence. 
So the me. 
This is, this is me this or in this, but this is not me. 
And so, you know, what does that mean, the me. 
The, the understanding that really helped me to see this as a different flavor of identification. 
At one point I was observing experience, you know, noticing the conditioned nature of experience, seeing how everything was coming and going of its conditions. 
And I could see so clearly that I was not in charge of it. 
I was not the subject, making any of it happen. 
And yet, it felt like it was happening to me. 
To me that's a subtler flavor of identification that, you know, that we're just like being impinged on, you know, that things are happening to me, I may not be in control of them, or making the decisions about them or, you know, the thing that was really so clear to me was that consciousness was doing its thing. 
I did not have any say about consciousness arising. 
It was happening. 
But it sure felt like it was happening to me. 
I wasn't doing it, but it was happening to me. 
And I actually went and reported this to my teacher. 
You know, this is very interesting. 
And I didn't make the connection to this teaching until several years later, actually, I was like, Oh, maybe that's what this is pointing to this subtler form of identification. 
My teacher just laughed and said, Well, just notice that that's what's happening. 
You don't have to see through it, you know, because what I said was I can't see through the me. 
And he said, just notice that you can't see through it, you know, just notice that you don't have to like do that. 
And in retrospect, you know, it's like, we can't see through it. 
I mean, that's, that's the eye trying to see through a sense of self. 
So we do just have to kind of understand this is not me. 
This is not myself. 
And, and just, you know, drop that in as a reflection, but understand, Sure feels like me. 
Sure feels like me. 
I'm debating, should I stop there, or I'll stop there. 
There's another there's another teaching about about this that I could go into but let's just see if there's any, any comments or questions. 
And I'm also curious if you have, you know, more general questions, I want to take notes if there's questions that feel like they're bigger than that I could follow up on next time. 
So I just, yeah, I want to just check in. 
Yeah, Betsy. 
My sense of when, you know, something feels like it's happening to me is like it's sort of this impenetrable, impenetrable duke, you know that it's almost it feels like it's inescapable. 
I can't stop it. 
I can't stop it right and pretty impressive like, yeah, there's, there's no way out of this one, you know, is what it feels like and Yeah, I mean it feels like kind of a heavy burden. 
And that that so that burden that you're talking about there is, you know, essentially, it is the, it's like a deeper kind of clinging around. 
Yeah, that these bodies get impinged on, you know, these, that's like, we can't stop that, you know, you can you can escape it for little bits of time apparently like in the john is you know you can get out of it for a little while, but, and sometimes we can, we can find our way to states that, you know, feel secluded or something. 
But in general, you know, that impingement of sight sounds, mild taste touch and things in our mind kind of continually bombarding us. 
And that is what's going on, and the, the, you know, that is in some ways what the Buddha talked about is. 
So it's a bombardment and it's also not stable we can't stop it in sight let me stop it here and just rest for a bit. 
You know, so it's got that kind of, it's that impermanent unreliable quality that we can't stop so it's like all three of those understandings of impermanent unreliable not cells are right there in that. 
And, you know, our minds really resist that. 
There's a very deep way that our minds basically want something to be stable, want something to be reliable, and that wanting is a sense of self, you know, wanting some kind of control. 
So it's like relief. 
Yes, it's looking for relief right. 
Yeah, exactly. 
It's looking for some kind of safety or security and it's looking in the wrong place. 
It's looking in its habitual places of some kind of place to land or to stop. 
And the teachings of the Buddha point to the relief comes in understanding that this is the condition and the letting go of the resistance to that. 
But it's a so deeply conditioned, you know, it is so deeply conditioned. 
But but the seeing of it, you know, the seeing of the dukkha of that, that is the way the path unfolds. 
I mean, it's basically you're seeing there you're seeing clinging. 
Yeah, you know, you're seeing a deep kind of clinging that no, I don't like this, it feels oppressive. 
And so, yeah, oppressive is what's happening. 
Yeah, that's, that's, that's the way through it is to see, you know, and to notice any relationship to that, you know, the fear terror, boredom, I mean, there's a whole host of kind of relationships that come as we start to really see. 
Yeah, that they just, there's no, there's no reliability anywhere. 
Yeah, I've noticed, just like, you know, how a dog shakes water off. 
It's just like, I just want to shake it off and just like, just be done, be done, be done with it. 
So notice that right that feeling of wanting to shake it off. 
That's the clinging. 
Yeah. 
No, that's the only thing that's in the way is the wanting it to not be like that. 
And it's like so hard to see that. 
Yeah, because it's such a deep kind of clinging. 
It's easy to see when you're saying it. 
It's very hard when. 
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly. 
I mean, it is not easy to see through these things. 
Yeah, it's so subtle. 
I mean, this is where the Buddha was pointing, you know, this is so subtle, nobody's going to get it. 
It's going to be hard to teach this. 
Or they'll start to get it and just say, Oh, I'm not going to deal with this and walk away. 
Well, yeah, but there's one thing is like by this point, you know, you can't walk away. 
Yeah, yeah, so you'd have to keep going. 
Which is one of the blessings in a way, you know, you do have to keep going. 
Yeah. 
And you do get a taste every now and then of. 
Oh, you know, just every now and then in places like that, the mind will just let go of that resistance. 
And it's like, Oh, this is so obvious. 
It's so obvious that it's just the not wanting it to be impinging that is the issue. 
But then the habit, it's such a deep habit, it comes back. 
So yeah, we just have to, we just have to watch it. 
Rain down. 
Yeah, cat. 
Well, Andrea, I think this relates to what we were talking about in a funny way for me with the meta. 
It's really difficult to see. 
I mean, it's difficult anyways, but it's really difficult right now I think for me to see when it's the practice itself. 
And, like, I've just been realizing these last couple days. 
It's not about switching up. 
It's like there's a loss of not being with my song. 
Like there's just this loss of 20 years of sitting at Cloud Mountain. 
And it's almost like a year now. 
And with my, it's different to sit physically with people. 
So it's like, I realized like, Oh, I look maybe like a long or cling after met maybe I should switch up the practice and do Meta and that will fill the longing and then I just realized like, I just had to feel the loss of not like being on retreat with you and Betsy and Olga and Kate like it's painful. 
It's like, I don't know. 
Many years of practicing together. 
And like the virtual thing think heavens were not that isolated and it's like, Yeah, that it's like that. 
Like that. 
And I, I just like, is it fair to call it clinging, you know, like, Well, I think longing is a good word. 
You know, I think longing is a good word. 
You know, and that longing. 
There's probably some clinging in there. 
But there's also some kind of movement towards connection. 
Yeah. 
And that's, you know, there's a wholesome wish in there that's connected towards the wish for connection and care and community. 
And that's, that's not unwholesome, that's wholesome. 
So, you know, you don't have to throw the whole thing out. 
You know, so, you know, the one thing that I found really useful around something like longing is really just seeing if you can let yourself be with it. 
I've had some huge understandings coming with being being with those hard like, you know, wanting connection feeling like it wasn't the right time and like you're feeling like I was holding on but like, but knowing there was some kind of love or something there and just like sitting with the whole mess or complexity of that. 
The threads that feel like they're connected with love and care and compassion and the threads that feel like they're, you know, wanting something to be different than it is. 
The sitting with it, the mind can begin to understand the difference between those two. 
So there's there's a kind of a movement towards connection that does feel like a kind of like a movement towards, but it doesn't feel like a reaching out to grab. 
It's got a softer quality to it, you know, and it's so that's I think the thing to just play with or you know in being with that longing. 
See if you can hold it in your mind not as not as wholly clinging, but as a kind of a complex mixture of of things and essentially what's going on is that there's some identification with, you know, with, you know, thinking it needs to be a certain way, as opposed to just understanding oh the longing itself is a wholesome wish. 
And for myself when I've seen that you know so the longing is just the wish of Meta. 
You know that that that sense of that that kind of wish for connection that's a wish of Meta. 
And then the relationship of identification slips in there and tangles it all up and not. 
And that's the part, you know, I sometimes use that analogy of a tangle right I think you've heard me use the tangle analogy. 
The tangle, I think happens because the, the truths of impermanent unreliable uncontrollable kind of get hooked up with or connected with the, the wishes for well being and happiness, and the identification and the kind of habit of mind that these two don't work together, you know, the mind just doesn't think these two are compatible, impermanent unreliable, safe, healthy, happy. 
No, those don't, those don't work together. 
And so it, it tangles them up in a knot trying to figure it out. 
It's not, we don't figure it out we basically begin to see they're not incompatible it's a belief they're incompatible. 
And that's where the suffering is. 
And so, so I've really found a lot of honoring what's arising whatever sufferings arising is some form of this tangle between these truths of impermanent unreliable not self, and this wish of well being. 
You know, all of our suffering has those threads in it back to love and compassion and back to wisdom and back to truth, but it's a big tangle. 
And the tangle is the mess the suffering, but being with that the teaching of understanding the suffering helps helps the mind to begin to, it's like being in a bath of some kind of lubricant that can begin to allow that not to untangle and the knot is a sense of self to you know it is that that the knot is both suffering and selfing. 
It's the same process that hooks them up, you know, so they're the same process. 
And the mindfulness with wisdom is a kind of lubricant that that allows the knot, the knot to begin to untangle. 
And then the mind starts to see those threads of impermanent unreliable, not self, and the threads of the wishes for safety and well being and happiness for ourselves and others, and realize that they're not incompatible that they can weave together. 
Form a strong cloth, you know, forma. 
So, so it's a, I think, having that kind of frame, at least for me having that frame around all my suffering. 
So I used to think, all of my suffering was like some kind of cancer, you know, and it was wholly bad it was just infecting everything and I needed to get the scalpel and the mindfulness was like the scalpel, and it was going to like cut that diseased part of me out and get rid of it. 
But it's like there isn't a diseased part. 
It's a tangle. 
Every piece of that tangle is wisdom and love. 
It's a tangle. 
And the tangle needs to be understood. 
So I found that a really useful kind of thing to understand and to hold that whatever suffering is arising. 
It's not about getting rid of it. 
It's not about like, you know, have it being the enemy. 
It's about understanding it and like honoring it with with wisdom and and mindfulness honoring it with with with presence. 
And that presence is the tool that helps the mind to begin to see the those threads more clearly. 
That it's, it's really just the glue or the knot that's the suffering. 
None of the threads are problematic.
