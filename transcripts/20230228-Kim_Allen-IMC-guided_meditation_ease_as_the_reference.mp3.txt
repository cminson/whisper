 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. Thanks to everyone for checking in. It's always nice to hear where you are and see you there. But now we'll go ahead and get started. So settling in for meditation together. You can see in the chat all the folks that are joining us. And just allow yourself to be in the seat that you're in. Closing your eyes if that's comfortable. And just softening the body into the meditation posture that you're using today. Perhaps feeling the contact of your seat with the chair or the cushion. Or whatever you're lying on. Or maybe you're standing. Just sensing the support beneath you. Maybe taking a couple of long, slow, deep breaths. And on the exhale, just allowing the body to settle in a bit more. Maybe taking in just the sense of the whole body in whatever posture it's in. And gently softening, softening the expression on the base. Softening the eyes and the eyesight bits. Can you even soften all the little muscles on the scalp? Softening the throat. Allowing the shoulders to be soft. Letting the shoulder blades slide down the back. Checking in into the heart area, sensing if there's any tension or tightness. Ache. And if there is, that's fine, but just inviting and softening. Letting the ribcage relax. And all the way down into the belly area. Maybe on the in breath, imagining drawing the air down even below the lungs, all the way to fill the belly area. Into the lower abdomen. Letting the hip joints soften. Down into the thighs, the knee joints, and all the way to the feet. And then returning to the sense of uprightness and with some initial softening and ease, seeing if that allows the spine to straighten up a bit more. Softness leads to a deeper kind of strength. Feeling the body supported through the middle and soft around that. And then in the mind, bringing awareness, mindfulness to the fore. Sense of being here, present for our experience. And that provides the stability and the strength in the mind. And everything around that can be soft. Letting the thoughts be soft. Letting emotional energies just flow in the background. Letting mindfulness be the spine of the mind. You can notice that there's a certain feeling of ease when there is awareness in the present moment. Even if what's going on in the rest of experience is something uncomfortable, something in the body or something in the heart. The simple fact that there's mindfulness of it, that there's presence, actually has a slight amount of joy and ease associated with it. We can tune into that as kind of a reference point. That feeling of simple ease when the mind is mindful. So the invitation is to use ease as the reference point. Some part of the body that's at ease and the ease of presence in the mind. As the reference point, something that we orient around. When the mind is entangled in a thought or an emotion or some reaction to the body, we can feel how that's complicated, not easeful. To the reference point of just easeful awareness of the flow of the present moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If the mind has become complicated and the body has tensed up because of thinking or entanglement, just gently re-prioritizing ease as the reference point. The ease of staying simple. Just being aware of what's happening in the present moment, softening the body. And if there are parts of the body that are painful or tight, then there's mental ease around how the body is. It's fine right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, I'm going to start with the three of ease compared to when you started with sit. Just allowing that to continue infusing into the body and mind. Noticing what happens if you just open to the possibility of ease or peace or contentment, whatever word seems to work. Sometimes we can be surprised to find resistance to ease. Like it's not quite allowed or not quite right or might harm us. And then we can just have ease with our resistance. It is interesting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You might just open the mind to some gentle reflection. Would there be some way that carrying a reference point of ease and presence and peace in some way could help with letting go of the various things that come up during the day? What are we willing to give up our peace for? We've finally gotten the puppy quiet a little bit. Are we going to let it lunge out and run around? I suppose that's what puppies do. Maybe that's what our mind will do. But maybe there's some unnecessary running around and lunging after things that our mind tends to do. Where we could just say, no, thank you. It's fine just being present. We might find that this is supportive for other people too. Not participating in the often escalations that happen as each person gets more and more excited and entrenched in their view or opinion. Just seeing if that might be supportive, this reference point of being at ease in some way.
