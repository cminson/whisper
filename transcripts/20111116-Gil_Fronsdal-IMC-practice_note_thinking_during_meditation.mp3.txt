Practice Note : Thinking During 
Meditation

One of the things to consider when you’re meditating is 
how you relate to thinking. What’s  your attitude, 
relationship , and involvement with thinking?  Sometimes  
people think they’re meditating, but really , they’re 
churning away in their thoughts. Sometimes people can 
be diligent enough to recognize they’re thinking , and 
then let go of it , and c ome back. Sometimes people can 
be in a dual track , multitasking. If they’re focusing on the 
breath in meditation, they can be with their breathing 
perhaps, but also in the background thoughts are going 
on. Sometimes  which one has the upper hand i s not so 
clear. You might think that you’re with your breathing or 
you’re trying to , but the upper hand might be with your 
thinking. Or you might be able to come back to your 
breath  – letting go of thoughts  and coming  back  – and 
then you go off into thinking pretty quickly again.  
 
So it’s important  to recognize what’s going on. If it’s 
easy enough for thoughts to recede and be in the 
background , and you can stay focused on the breath 
and get concentrated , that’s great. But  at some point , if thinking  in words or in images persists , you want to turn 
your attention and look at that directly. Just really fully 
acknowledge it, so that you’re not trying to multitask . 
You’re  not trying to also stay with your breath. You’re  
not trying to let go of your think ing anymore , but you 
completely  turn towards it,  and recognize that you’re 
thinking now. Really  see it , and look at it carefully.  
 
If you’re thinking with words – verbal thinking – one way 
of looking at or acknowledging thinking that works for 
some people  is that it’s like an inner voice  that’s talking. 
You may have a sense that there’s a place  where the 
loud speaker is for that voice in your mind. Some people 
will locate it in the back of their head , or in the middle of 
the head , or the front of t he head – some place that 
seem s to be the location where  you’re hearing that 
voice. Then  you bring your attention to that location , and 
hold your attention there very carefully to feel and sense  
what’s happening .  
 
Even if the thinking goes away once you look at it and 
acknowle dge it, don’t just quickly go back to your 
breath. Stay , and take in what the experience is now of 
not thinking , or what lingers. Sometimes  there can be a 
lot of energy or emotions in thinking.  The words might 
stop, but the energy, emotions, pressure, and tension 
that might somehow be connected might still be 
lingering. So, if you can bring your attention to that, just 
hold it kindly in awareness. Be mindful of that for a while . See what happens . Don’t be in a hurry to go to 
your breathing. If you go quickly to your breath, the 
thoughts might creep back in again.  
 
If you think more in images, you can do the same thing. 
Is there some location where the imag es are projected, 
like a screen?  Sometimes people may have a sense of 
it in front of them slightly. Sometimes it is in the back of 
the forehead. Is there some location where the images 
occur? And then in the same way , you can bring your 
attention  there , and give it a sense of location or  place , 
rather than thinking that is disembodied  or unlocated. If 
you can have a place where the images occur, just keep 
your attention there. Not to look more carefully, but to 
help you not be so engaged and caught in it. If the 
images fade away, there st ill might be something that 
lingers there in that place on the ‘screen. ’ There might 
be energy , emotio ns, feelings, pressure, or tension  
there. Just linger . Stay there  with your mindfulness , and 
feel or sense what’s happening there .  
 
There is a way of bei ng mindful of thinking , even after 
thoughts have stopped , that helps you take in the 
ecology , or the process of thinking  – which is more t han 
just the thoughts or images – and help that to relax. If 
you don’t relax the background energy, tension, 
pressure , and momentum, chances are that the 
background momentum is going to produce more 
thoughts as soon as you lower your guard.   
After thoughts are gone, i t’s very interesting to just stay 
there , recog nize fully , and feel or sense  what that’s like . 
One interesting thing  to notice  is that  there may be  more 
subtle thoughts operating. The coarser, larger thoughts 
have stopped , but there may be  very subtle thoughts 
still happening. Then  very gently  – you may have to be 
very gentle with your awareness  – do the same thing 
with that. Bring a careful, gentle attention to feel the 
more subtle thinking going on , and then see if it’s 
possible to gently let go of that as well. And then linger 
with that , and see what  happens . See  what’s left over 
from that.  
 
If none of this makes any sense, then you can just focus 
on your breath.  Thank you.
