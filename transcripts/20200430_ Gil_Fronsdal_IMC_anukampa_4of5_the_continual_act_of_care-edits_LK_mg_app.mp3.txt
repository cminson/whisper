I’ll continue  on this fourth  morning  to talk about  the 
Buddha’s teachings  on anukampā . I tentatively  translate  
this word  as ‘care.’ In doing  so, I’m bringing  into 
Buddhist  language  a new English  word,  which  is rare. I 
don’t know  that it’s ever been  used.  It’s certainly  not 
prominent  in the translations  of the Buddha’s teachings  
from Pali or from many  of the other  languages  of Asian  
Buddhism.   
 
Why English  translators  haven’t chosen  the word  ‘care’ 
is a topic  in itself.  I don’t know  the answer  to that. But 
by translating  anukampā  as ‘care,’ I am connecting  it 
consciously  with a very simple,  common  word  in 
English,  which  I think  has a certain  humility . It’s really  
important  in many  central  areas  of our lives.

We talk about  health  care.  If you go to a hospital,  there  
are many  departments  that have  to do with care.  
There’s the intensive  care unit, palliative  care, and 
spiritual  care where  hospital  chaplains  work.   
 
We use the word  ‘caregiver ’ in English . This can be 
someone  who’s a health  caregiver.  Or a caregiver  can 
be someone  who offers  care for children , or for the 
elderly  in a nursing  home.  A caregiver  can also be a 
family  member  who provides  unpaid  care for a relative  
in their home.  
 
The English  word  ‘care’ often  mean s to care for 
someone ’s needs  – physical,  emotional,  psychological,  
spiritual,  and social.  As human  beings,  we all have  
these  needs,  and we offer care for others . What’s nice 
about  the word  ‘care’ in this comprehensive  sense  is 
that it’s not just caring  for people  because  they have  the 
potential  for suffering  and we want  to help them  not 
suffer.  But there’s a much  broader  sense  of caring  for 
people  – just because  they’re people.  They  are human  
beings,  and they have  needs.  They  have  possi bilities,  
and we want  to live in a world  of mutual  care.  
 
This idea of caring  is so central  to human  culture  and 
societies,  but it’s often  forgotten  as people  become  
adults.  I’ve known  people  who, only when  they had 
children  themselves , were  able to realiz e what their  
3 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg parents  had done  for them  – the tremendous  amount  of 
caregiving  offered  to a child as they grow  up. Hopefully , 
that’s what’s offered.   
 
Sometimes  the tables  are turned.  When  parents  
become  elderly,  it’s the children  who become  the 
caregivers , offering  care in return.  A lot of this happens  
quietly  within  families.  It’s not big public  news  that the 
couple  down  the street  has been  staying  up all night  
caring  for their crying,  sick baby.  It’s a remarkable  act of 
care that this happens  in all kinds  of ways.  
 
We care for people  when  they’re happy.  We provide  
them  with more  opportunities.  One of the great  ways  
people  care for children  who grow  up in their 
communities  is by volunteer ing to coach  them  in sports,  
like soccer,  baseball,  and volleyball.  We offer care and 
create  a healthy  environment  for children  to grow  up in. 
 
I see the word  ‘care’ as being  broader  in application  and 
concern  than the word  ‘compassion. ’ And this is what  
we seem  to see in the teachings  of the Buddha.  As 
important  as compassion  is in the ancient  teachings,  
the word  karuṇā, often  translated  as ‘compassion, ’ is 
really  reserved  for a very deep  meditation  practice  and 
a state  of mind  and heart  that’s radiant,  abundant,  and 
expansive . But that word  is not used  in terms  of 
expressing  the motivation  for supporting  people  and  
4 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg doing  good  in the world.  The word  used  for this is 
anukampā . 
 
As I’ve been  saying,  it has another  meaning  than just 
caring  for people’s suffering  and avoiding  causing  
suffering.  It is caring  for people’s welfare  and 
happiness,  which  is broader.   
 
The Buddha  never  talks about  cultivating  anukampā . It 
seems  that he just assumes  it’s there.  In that sense,  the 
Buddha  seems  to suggest  that anukampā  is what’s 
there  when  one has abandoned  ill-will and hatred.  “One 
abides  with anukampā  for the world,” he says.  One 
abides  having  anukampā  – having  care for the world  – 
when  one has abandoned  ill-will and hatred.  
 
It is lettin g go of ill-will and hatred.  Those  are big, 
powerful  words,  but they also represent  the small,  
subtle  ways  that ill-will, and even  hatred , might  be 
present  in our little frustrations  and irritations  with others  
and with ourselves.  The slightest  bit can be there  when  
we are critica l, or have  aversion  to people,  things  or 
ourselves.  
 
When  the mind -heart  has really  shed  its ill-will, hatred,  
aversion,  and tendency  to complain,  and it really 
becomes  quiet  and open,  it is then that anukampā  for 
the world  arises.  
  
5 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg In this sense,  anukampā  is not doing  something.  It’s not 
conceiving  and thinking  about  “May all beings  be well. 
May all beings  be free of suffering. ” It’s the absence  of 
something  allows  this part of our heart  to shine  and to 
be here. It has certainly  been  my experience  that the 
more  I’ve shed,  settled,  and been  opened  through  
meditation  practice,  and the quieter  and more  sensitive  
I’ve become  – care seems  to arise, and this sometimes  
takes  the expression  of compassion,  loving -kindne ss, or 
friendliness.   
 
But ‘caringness ’ is more  fundamental.  The sense  of 
caring  – the feeling  of tenderness  and resonance  with 
people  – is broader  and simpler.  It’s humble,  because  it 
doesn’t come  from active  thinking  and reflecting.   
 
When someone  is a caregiver  in a hospital,  we don’t 
ask or even  expect  that they love or have  lots of 
compassion  for the sick people  who are there.  But we 
do expect  them  to care for those people.  
 
It’s possible  be caring  for people  for whom  we don’t 
have  a particularly  strong  feeling  of friendliness.  Care  
can be a much  simpler,  more  direct  activity , which  
doesn’t require  as much  from us as does  compassion,  
friendliness  or loving -kindness.   
 
I don’t want  to dimin ish the value  of compassion  and 
loving -kindness.  They’re fantastic , powerful  parts  of  
6 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg human  life, but they do require  a little more  from us. To 
have  it in the forefront  all the time, and to call on it in 
different  ethical  situations  might  be more  difficult  for 
some  people  than to have  simple,  ordinary  ‘caringness ’ 
for what  is there.   
 
Care  is so much  a part of human  life that maybe  we’re 
not human  beings , but at the heart,  we’re human  
carings . We’re social  creatures.  We depend  on the care 
of others , and they depend  on our care – perhaps  in 
ways  that may be the most  fundamental  aspect  of a 
human  life. It may be more  fundamental  than the idea 
that we are either  matter  or spirit,  or that there’s some  
essence  inside  of us. It may or may not be a spiritua l 
essence.  It’s kind of a material  aspect  of human  life, 
and this approach  is certainly  not the way in which  the 
Buddha  talks about  human  life.  
 
But what  if what’s fundamental  is not some  essence  or 
core aspect  of who we are – but rather  if the 
fundamenta l aspect  of what  it means  to a human  being  
able to care? 
 
Over  and over again,  we see in the teachings  of the 
Buddha , both directly  and indirectly,  that he expresses  
care.  He cares  about  relationships  between  people.  
Many  of the teachings  of the Buddha  have been  
interpreted  to be ethical  in nature,  because  they have  to  
7 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg do with taking  care of how we relate  to people  so that 
we don’t harm  them , and we don’t harm  ourselves.   
 
The Buddha  said that one of the motivations  for not 
harming  people  is not karuṇā (compassion)  – but in this 
teaching  at least,  the motivation  for not harming  people  
is in fact anukampā  – this caring.   
 
Perhaps  caring  is a bit of an activity  or an action.  That 
goes  along  with the Buddha’s tendency  to under stand  
human  beings  in terms  of their actions , rather  than in 
terms  of some  fundamental  essence.   
 
If anukampā  is an activity  more  fundamental  to who we 
are, then it comes  from letting  go of all the things  that 
get in the way, including  conceit  and self-preoccupation.  
It’s almost  as if anukampā  (caring ) is something  that 
comes  from the heart  when  we’re most  settled,  open,  
and present  for our experience.   
 
Anukampā  is not a thing.  It’s the activity  of being  human  
when  we’re most  grounded,  centered,  and quiet.  It’s 
simple  and humble,  because  it’s not connected  to 
concepts  and ideas  of who we are. It allows for the 
heart’s capacity  to care.  We become  the caregivers  of 
the world  – not because  we should , or because  it’s an 
obligation  – but because  it’s the fundamental  
functioning  of a liberated  heart  and mind.

  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg So, care for the world  and your relationships  with 
others.  It’s a beautiful  thing.  I hope  I don’t have  to 
convince  you of that.  
 
What  I really  hope  is that you’re inspired  in meditation  
or just mindfulness  practice  to discover  that – 
underneath  the layers  of reactivity,  fear, desires,  and 
attachments  – there  exists  a flow out of us, which  may 
be anukampā .  
 
Maybe  you’ll choose  a different  word  to translate  it other  
than ‘care.’ That’s fine. We’re not sure exactly  how 
these  words  should  be translated.  What  is important  are 
these  fundamental,  beautiful  qualities  of being  that we 
allow  to operate  from this deep,  Dharmic  place  inside.   
 
Thank  you for the chance  to talk this way, and to think  
about  this. We’ll continue  with one more  talk on 
anukampā  tomorrow.   
 
Thank  you.
