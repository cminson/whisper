 
 Practice  Note:  Longer  Term

It’s fairly  well-known  that mindfulness  is practiced  
with a strong  emphasis  in being  in the present  
moment.  You try to keep  your mind  from thinking  
about  the future  or the past.  That’s  certainly  true, but 
it doesn’t  mean  that you should  never  think  about  
the future  or the past.   
 
If you go on a long hiking  trip, which  you really  plan 
on finishing,  and you happen  to have  a little injury  on 
your foot, you have  to be very much  in the present  
moment  when  you put your foot down.  In order  to go 
that long distance , you don’t  want  to worsen  the  
irritation  in your foot. The future  – the idea that 
you’re  going  a long distance  – really  puts you into 
paying  attention  to the present  momen t, to now. 
 
It’s the same  thing  with our lives.  It’s nice to be able 
to think  about  having  some  kind of long-term 
happiness,  well-being , and peace.  But this takes  
some  planning  and consideration . You don’t  want  to 
just leave  it up to wishful,  magical  thinking.    
  
So, what  are the conditions  that need  to be put in 
place  to move  in that direction?  In our tradition,  one 
condition  is certainly  to be here in the present  
moment . Feeling  that your attention  to the present  
moment  now,  today , or this morning  is really  
consequential  will set the stage  for what’s  going  to 
happen  to you for decad es to come.  You’ll  pay 
careful  attention  to do whatever  you’re  doing  – how 
you attend  to your breath,  how you sit in your 
posture,  how you do your steps,  how you open  the 
door to go to the bathroom  or to go outside . You’ll  do 
this in such  a way that in the moment , you maximize  
a sense  of presence  and alertness.  Can you do it in 
a way that is most  vitalizing,  most  clarifying , or really  
here?   
 
For example,  when  you sit down  to meditate,  don’t  
just sit down  like you’ve  meditated  ten thousand  
times  before : “Okay,  here I am.” Rather,  in sitting  
down  to meditate  and taking  your posture,  you could  
say to yourself:  “This  is my long-term happiness.  I’d 
better  really  zero in, and take this seriously.  Let me 
sit in a way that maximizes  my sense  of presence  
and alertness.  What  is it like to be alert at the base  
of my spine , and all the way up the spine?  Where  
shall I put my hands?  How shall I sit so that this is 
really  important?  This is the final exam.”  If it turns   
 out that the final exam  of being  a human  being  is 
how you really  sit – in a way that is thoroughly  
present,  alert, and connected,  then you would  sit 
down  with care.  You wouldn’t  just go, “Oh, just one 
more  time to sit; here we go again.  Okay,  phew.”   
 
There is an example  in the suttas  that points  to this 
idea.  You’re  carrying  a basket  or a bucket  on your 
head,  as they do in some  cultures.  You’re  balancing  
it on your head , going  through  a crowded  
marketplace  with lots of people  and activity.  The 
bucket  is full to the top with water.  There’s  someone  
walking  behind  you with a sword,  and if you spill any 
of the water,  they will lop off your head.  Boy, then 
you’d  be present ! 
 
I don’t  want  to evoke  the fear in this example , but 
the idea is: “How would  you really engage  in this 
moment  here?” This moment  counts.  This is an 
important  moment.  Maybe  this moment  is going  to 
set the stage  for happiness  for a long time.  How 
would  you really  meet  this moment?  How would  you 
open  that door, as opposed  to thinking  about  
opening  the door like it doesn’t  count  – or that the 
door is in your way? Instead , touch  that doorknob  as 
if that is the most  important  place  to be attentive.  Is 
there  a way of paying  attention,  really  being  there  for 
this doorknob  in a way that evoke s some  kind of  
 attention,  presence , and mindfulness  that sets the 
stage  for the rest of your life? 
 
A traditional  idea in Buddhism  is that your last 
moment  of consciousness  sets the stage  for how 
you are reborn.  What  if turning  that doorknob  
happens  to be when  the meteor  comes  crashing  
through  the roof?  That could  be your last moment.  If 
that is your last moment,  how do you want  to be 
there  with that doorknob?  If you’re  annoyed  with the 
doorknob,  talk about  major  consequences ! You’l l 
come  back  as a doorknob  or something  [laughter].  
Anyway , I think  I’m making  a point. 
 
Enjoy  yourself . But really  give yourself  to the 
moment  in what  you’re  doing  as if it’s the most  
important  thing  – as if how you engage  in this now, 
is going  to have  long-term repercussions  for you. Do 
it well.
