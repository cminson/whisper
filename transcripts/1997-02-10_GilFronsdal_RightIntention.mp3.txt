 Tonight's topic then is the second step of the eighthfold path, which is usually translated into English as the right intention or right resolve. The whole pivot, the pivotal point of the Four Noble Truths in the eighthfold path is the issue of holding, how we grasp or hold on to things. We hold on to our views, our opinions, our preferences, our likes and dislikes. We hold on to the idea that we don't want something. We hold on to the idea that we want something to be different, that we want something to have something. And it's this holding or this grasping to wanting things to be a certain way or wanting things to have to be a different way, kind of demanding it, requiring it, tightening up around it, which is the pivotal point, the fulcrum, for understanding the Four Noble Truths in the eighthfold path. And from that point of view, seeing this pivotal issue of holding or not holding, we understand our suffering, we understand suffering, how suffering, how certain kinds of suffering arises out of holding, grasping, resisting, or a certain kind of possibility of ease or freedom or openness comes when there's no holding. And someone asked me last week, I don't quite remember the question, but the concern was something like, if the point of the Four Noble Truths is to live a life where there's no holding, that sounds like a life of detachment, which sounds like a life that doesn't try to engage itself properly with things that have to be taken care of. Aren't there sometimes, isn't it sometimes appropriate to stop or protest injustice in the world, if something terrible is happening? And Buddhist spirituality is not about renouncing the world, leaving the world's responsibility for the world. If anything, it allows us to empower us to respond more fully to the world, to what needs to be taken care of. It empowers us because the normal ways in which we hold, we cling, or grasp around an event hopefully are operating so strongly. So we can see the event more clearly what needs to be done, and the inhibitions, or the ambitions, or the fears, or the projections we have on the event aren't operating so much so that we're freer to respond appropriately. And maybe hopefully we can actually respond more clearly and more forcefully if necessary, rather than more limply. So the idea of Buddhism to kind of let go of holding is not an admonition or a teaching to let go of responsibility or let go of involvement. But you can be totally committed and involved with what you do without having to be holding onto it or requiring it or expecting anything from it, or afraid of what might happen because of this activity. We do it fully. So the words, I looked up in the dictionary today, just before coming down here, the word for right, right view, right intention, right livelihood, right action, right speech, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration, the Eightfold Path. And the word samma in Pali, one of the definitions in the dictionary was thorough, thorough intention, or thorough action, thorough livelihood. And the others were proper and right. But I like the way thorough, when we do something we do it thoroughly. And thoroughly does it, we do it in such a way that there's this kind of classic image in Buddhism of doing something without leaving any traces. And if there's holding, we leave traces. But if there's no holding, then the action is clean, leaves nothing behind it. There's no karmic consequences that linger because of this activity. So we have this thing at the fulcrum, which is the issue of holding. And then seeing on one hand, the suffering that might arise from holding and seeing on the other hand, the freedom that's possible when there's no more holding. So the Eightfold Path, then one way of understanding it, it's eight areas of our life we can look at, that are important to look at, are useful to look at, to try to understand the issue of holding in our life. This is an area we can look and study these things and see this is where you might be holding. And it's pretty obvious with views. I mean, all of us, we don't hold on to our views, our cherished views of what's right and wrong and who we are and whatever. So we hold on to our views and sometimes we create a lot of suffering in ourselves and irritation in our friends from holding on very strongly to opinions. I like the word to sometimes substitute the word stories instead of views. Right story and wrong story. What are the stories we live our life by? What are the views, the opinions? Because all of us live our life according to some kind of story. And sometimes a story has a bigger impact on our life than other times. We have stories involved interpretations, we interpret events. So I got in my car at our down here and I kind of realized, well, I'm going down, I have to give a talk. And I'm not prepared, which is the way it's supposed to be these months, right? Because I promised not to prepare for three months. But so here I was getting my job, oh my God, I'm not prepared. And there was this moment of fear or apprehension or nervousness that I was, oh gee, you know, I might blow it. I might not have anything to say or whatever. So I was like, I might not have anything to say or whatever. So these thoughts occurred to me and, you know, kind of unpleasant thoughts. And then I could see, I could reflect or I can kind of be mindful of what was going on. And I could notice a difference between what was actually happening and what my interpretation story was in the situation. What was actually happening was I was getting in my car. I was driving down here. It occurred to me that I had to give a talk. It occurred to me that I wasn't prepared. That was true. That's actually what was the case. The story, the interpretation was, oh, maybe, you know, I'll blow it. Maybe you guys will judge me terribly and I'll go home, you know, stick my hand in the sand. And, you know, now I want to talk to anybody for 10 weeks, you know, because it's just so terrible. But that's all interpretation, right? That's, you know, who knows what's going to happen when I come down here. There's no way of knowing. I might give the most brilliant Dharma talk anybody's given this year anywhere. And that's also interpretation, right? So there's an interpretation which is overlaid onto what's actually happening. And what's actually happening doesn't involve any suffering. The suffering arises from the story that I made about it. So when we look at Right View, the first step of the Eightfold Path, it's partly a call to be able to notice a difference between what's actually happening in the moment, what we can be sure clearly is happening, and what the overlay of interpretation or story is on top of that, to see that clearly. And it's very useful to cultivate the ability to be mindful. Mindfulness is the strength of mindfulness to see and investigate what's actually happening right now. To ask a question, what is actually happening right now? And what actually is the story that's attached to that? And many times the stories maybe are partially necessary, and we have to act based on some assumption of interpretation. But it's very different if we know that it's interpretation and we're basing it on assumption, as opposed to doing it because we think this is the way it actually is. And I think many times, many of us, we don't see the difference between what's actually happening and the story, the interpretation that we add to it. And then we think the story is true, and then a whole bunch of series of consequences of emotions and feelings and decisions are made based on what is really we're not sure about, but we are dead certain our opinion is absolute. So that's the place of a lot of holding, a lot of pain, is view. The second step then in the eighth full path is right intention. And it occurs to me to say that the eighth full path, Buddhism talks a lot about a path. It's a religion which offers a path. However, I like to think of the path as being something you create as you walk it. It's not, it doesn't exist, you know, separate from you. It's like you're going to find the path, and you know, and someone can point out the path so I can walk it and safely get home to myself or whatever it is. But you know, you create the path by the way we step, by the way we walk, by the way we engage ourselves in our activity. And so it's really up to us. It's really something we have to do, and it's not something anyone's going to give it to us. So it's really the, if one of the fulcrums is the holding, the other fulcrum is the person who holds, is us, is us and our responsibility we have in deciding how we live our life. And the eighth full path, and again, is eight different areas of our life we can look at that are very helpful to help us become a little bit more comfortable in our life, more at ease. So then right intention. And just before ringing the bell, I was thinking about right intention, and I was supposed to speak about it. And it made me kind of happy to think about intention, because I think one of the really precious and beautiful things about human life, about our lives, is the wholesome intentions that resides, I believe, deep inside our spirit, deep inside the core of who we are. I think there's a beautiful intention for freedom, for compassion, for openness, for friendliness, for liberation. And that if we sit and be still and listen and allow that deeper well springs of intention from our core to arise and surface, I think a really beautiful part of ourselves begins to live our life. And so I was thinking about intention then, and it made me kind of happy, because it's a really beautiful part of our spirituality, I feel. So intention, right intention. Intention makes a big, you know, so what motivates, what motivates our activity? And everything we do has a motivation that precedes it. And what is that motivation? The Buddhism doesn't have a Bible like Christianity does in a sense. You know, where you can say, you know, you can open page one and say, this is where it all begins. But the closest thing that qualifies for the opening page, opening lines of the Buddhist scriptures is the following. We are what we think. All that we are arises from our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world. Speak or act with an impure mind, and trouble will follow you, as the wheel follows the ox that draws the cart. We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world. Speak or act with a pure mind, and happiness will follow you as your shadow, unshakable. How can a troubled mind understand the way? So intention, the intention which we do things. This last week, I've been thinking a lot about, or noticing a lot, how behind some of the statements people make and I make in conversation, the real intention behind the statements being made, and the content of the statement, the information that's given, are not always, you know, in harmony or not necessarily, what we say on the surface isn't necessarily what we're trying to communicate. So sometimes we say things because really it's not the information that's important that we want to convey to someone, but we want to portray ourselves in a certain kind of good light. And so we want to make sure they see that about us, not because it matters that they know that or not, but because if they know that, then they can see us better. So for example, just before coming in here, I was talking to some friends and one of the things I said kind of just about just kind of letting pass, this kind of conversation was, oh, you know, oh, I'm not preparing my talks these days. But, you know, part of the intention of saying that was actually saying, don't judge me. Because, you know, I can't, I'm not really responsible for what I'm doing here. So, you know, that's a kind of small example. Maybe that was kind of an innocent example, but, you know, how much of our time do we say things like that? Because for the same reasons, we want to kind of protect ourselves or convey ourselves and make sure they see ourselves in a certain way. There's an intention behind the way we speak that's being expressed. And what is the intention? What's the true intention behind what we say? And an intention that wants to portray ourselves in a certain way arises, can rise out of suffering, can rise out of insecurity or fear, can arise out of ambition, can arise out of trying to control a situation, but it arises often out of a kind of holding in a situation. And whether it arises from suffering or not, the consequence is more suffering. To be able to live a life where the intention doesn't come from fear or apprehension or ambition or desire or clinging, but rather comes perhaps naturally out of the situation. In communication with someone else, having a conversation, what arises naturally when we're not imposing our will in the situation, but just sharing in the conversation with the exchange and sharing ourselves and sharing them with ourselves and doing all that? What are the intentions with which we live our life? Many of us have... What do we spend most of our day doing, most of us? Most people in our society spend most of the day working. What is the intention? What is the motivation that's behind our work life? Is it simply just to make money to get by? Is it to be of service in society? Is it to get ahead in the world? This is to have a higher status? What's the motivation that's really behind the work that we do? Again, the kind of motivation we have has a big impact on whether we create suffering or whether we don't. If our work, for example, is motivated by ambition and getting ahead of everyone else, I would suggest that you might get a little bit happy for a while, but that kind of happiness is not very satisfying. Deep, satisfying happiness doesn't arise out of ambition. You can do a great job and get ahead in the world without ambition or clinging or being motivated by fear or apprehension or be motivated by the joy of activity, the joy of being of service or the joy of doing some particular thing that you love doing. To look at right intention, to look at intentions in one's life. Buddhism, when talking about right intention, there's a list and they offer three right intentions. You don't have to take these as being kind of dogmatic, but rather just kind of maybe interesting. I think they're kind of beautiful. So this is simply a matter of avoiding unwholesome intentions, but it's also appreciating what wholesome intentions look like. So three wholesome intentions are, the first is not to hold. Not to hold, I consider to hold something to do. That's a nice thing. You can still take care of things, but you don't grasp onto it. The second wholesome intention is maybe I forgot, but the third one is, I'll remember it in a minute, but the third one is non-harming, is a hymseh. And not harming is kind of synonymous with compassion and care. So the third one is then to live a life which doesn't harm, to be motivated to live a life which doesn't cause harm to others or to the world around us. That's considered to be a beautiful and wholesome intention. And the second, I'm pretty sure, is loving kindness. The intention to be friendly, to be friendly with the world, friendly with our friends and strangers, to be benevolent, benevolent, friendly feelings of kindness, of loving kindness, acts of loving kindness in the world around us. These are considered to be wholesome intentions that actually lubricate our life, make our life a lot better, and it brings happiness just to our life, just as the wheels, just as a cart. Oh, as your shadow unshakable, and happiness will follow you as your shadow unshakable. So to live a life of non-holding, of loving kindness, and of harmlessness. I think of harmlessness as one of the cornerstones, one of the central ethical teachings of Buddhism. And I may have said this before here, but when I think about, you know, one of my early initial motivations to be involved in Buddhism came out of my strong feeling of wanting to live a life of non-violence. And it was particularly significant back then because it was during the Vietnam War. And I'm sure how it wasn't going to be drafted. And so where did my non-violent pacifist stance lead me? And did I have the ability, the spiritual ability to follow through on it? And I've always felt that non-violence is one of the cornerstones of Buddhist teachings. And I say it now because I feel like I don't have many references to it in many books or many Dharma talks that are put out here in the West. I simply don't. Go home and look at all your books in Buddhism, Dharma talk books that you have by Western teachers, and how many of them talk about non-violence in an active way. I mean, not too many. To be non-violent in our conversations. Someone I was on the phone today was someone and the person wouldn't stop talking. It was phenomenal. I thought, you know, and I'm trying to be polite and, you know, kind of looking for that little window to say, well, you know, thank you, it was nice talking to you, whatever. And somehow it was like the one story kind of somehow I found myself in the next story and you couldn't interrupt the story. But, you know, I wondered, wasn't the person paying attention? Isn't it kind of a violence to me to just kind of assume that I'm going to be listening to whatever, you know, after 10 minutes of non-stop, you know, just isn't a little bit... Isn't that... You know, it's a little bit in position. It's a non-violence in our conversation. So maybe I should stop talking. So now it's your turn. Yes. I really want to understand this thing you said and kind of mystify by wanting to understand this, the self-receiving nature of suffering. If we understand suffering, the definition of suffering that the Buddhism offers, as being that pain that arises from holding. It isn't all pain, right? We talked about that, but it's the pain that arises from holding. When we look at something or discern something very carefully, really present for something, and we don't add to that our judgments, we don't add to it more holding, we don't add to it a resistance to it, we simply see it as it is, very carefully and very intimately. The nature of... I'm not going to make some absolute statement here. I don't know. It's kind of metaphysics, if I do. But it appears as if the nature of phenomena, of the nature of holding, is that if you look at it carefully in a non-reactive way, it'll release itself. And part of the reasons for that is that holding requires an intention, requires our contribution. Holding happens... we're constantly recreating the holding. It isn't like, you know, you hold today, and then you're going to be holding them forever. You're always going to have that suffering. Suffering... it has its causes and its past, but it gets recreated in the present moment, moment by moment by moment. Suffering, for an animal truth, is really about what's happening right now. And so we're constantly kind of adding. In order for holding to be there, we're always adding the intention to hold. If we find a way to be present that's non-reactive, there's a way in which we stop adding the energy of holding to the situation. And what it wants to do, if the impulse to hold is no longer being added, it wants to release. If you hold your... you know, I did this exercise here once. If you hold your fist really, really tight, and then you hold it really tight, and you get to hold it really tight, okay? And as tight as you can. And you know the story now about how you catch monkeys in India? Now you don't... you stopped. How come you stopped? Was it easy to stop? You stopped because you stopped paying attention to your fist, and you got interested in my story about monkeys? If it's very hard, you hold tight enough with your fist, you have to constantly recreate the tightness. Otherwise, a natural tendency of the fist is to release slightly. And that's the... so that's why I talk about the self-releasing nature of suffering. Because that's really what it wants to do. Everything is crying out, wishing, demanding, requesting, begging of us, release us, release us. And all we have to do is let get out of the way, and it releases itself. Yes? In the part of the room today, we talked about how we are thoughts. And obviously we don't want to talk about how we're not our thoughts. Our thoughts are nothing, and they're just thoughts. So, I mean, am I missing something? It's a very good question. I don't like this translation. But as long as you guys grab this book, leaving the house. But I shouldn't complain, because I'm responsible for the book. And the translation comes up even not in that particular translation. Anyway, the translation is a poor translation of what the Buddha said in the Pali. So, we are what we think. So, we... I highly respond to you. So, what's your concern? Behind the question. Well, there's different ways maybe of looking at it. One is that, rather than taking... First, rather than taking kind of an absolute statement, our thoughts have a powerful influence on conditioning who we are. And rather than... We say sometimes, some people say, most of us don't, we are what we eat. Buddhism would paraphrase that by saying we are what we think. That the thoughts and the intentions behind our thoughts have impact and create a conditioning how we're going to be in the future. We're always thinking a certain way. We're then creating a habit to think that way in the future. So, part of mindfulness is paying attention to our cognitive world. It's kind of like cognitive therapy. One aspect of mindfulness is just understanding our thoughts and the thoughts behind our actions and the stories and the views and all that because of the big impact it has in our life. And it could be argued that the source of most of the things we do in our life arises from that cognitive world. That it's hard to see that and the interplay between the emotions and the body and thoughts is very subtle. And how one follows the other varies. Sometimes it's, if you're watching, you feel like the motivation arises first from the body or from an emotion. And then a thought arises from that. And sometimes a thought arises and then emotion arises and then a motivation. But if you follow everything back to its core, if your mind is really still, it seems as if that the way we think is really one of the kind of the source of a lot of our life. So that's just pointing out the importance of thoughts. That they're very, very important. And becoming aware of them is very important. But it's a tricky instruction because so many of us are so caught up in the world of our thoughts already. That to start being mindful of thoughts too quickly, we tend to tie ourselves up in knots because we know, only one thing we know what to do is to think more thoughts about our thoughts. So that's one thing, one way of kind of addressing it. But now the question of self and what is the self and is the self thinking, is it not thoughts, is self the body, is it not body and all that, is a great question. The question needs to be answered by first defining what you someone like you, or Buddhism or Buddha or whatever, or me, means by self. Because there's so many different definitions of where self is that unless we're very clear about what the definition is we're sharing, we can miss each other in talking about definitions. The self that Buddhism is concerned with and sense negating is a self as a permanent and absolute agent that's in charge and in control of your life and your situation and everything. That's sitting inside the control panels in the control room in your mind, there's this little guy in there pulling the levers and pushing the buttons and sometimes having to reset the computer and boot it up again or if you're lucky. And that kind of notion of that kind of solid agent is something which is said in Buddhism you can't find, it's unfindable. And if you can't find something like that you better not base your life thinking you have one when you can't find it anywhere. And if you want to take one step further they say it doesn't exist but technically what you say is you can't be found and what you can't be aware of and what you can't experience is not something you want to spend a lot of time worrying about how pretty it is and how its status it has and all the kind of things we're concerned about ourselves. So from that point of view we are not our thoughts, we're not our body because the we are, the I am, the self doesn't exist, as an agent doesn't exist. However, who we are in a more general sense, if we don't talk about it you know this individual permanent agent in the middle of everything. We talk about ourselves in a general sense of as a person with all these varied phenomena, varied psychophysical functions that are working together and harmonizing and not harmonizing and affecting each other and there's no solid thing permanent thing there's like you turn on the television and there's a person in television that exists. Well it doesn't exist as a person but that person exists as a projected image of all these electronic events that are happening there in the computer. Us as a general sense of a human being as a person we are kind of like that projected image. We're here result of many many different factors not just one single thing in the middle and so from that point of view we are all the things not only are we all our thoughts and all our feelings and our body but we're the whole universe in a sense. We can't really there's no separate self distinct from everything else. All these things feed into creating and making this sense of a person that's sitting here right now. So what I've done in answering you is shifted three different points of view or let's say it's about self two different points of view of understanding. One point of view is what's called the ultimate point of view in Buddhism. From the ultimate point of view you cannot find a self but from the conventional point of view the way most of us usually talk our language so we can kind of get along with each other we talk about kind of a general sense of a person being here and that general sense of a person being here is made up of many different factors that come together and we can talk about that. So that general person has thoughts has feelings has a body but we don't want to get caught with the notion that oh this is therefore who I absolutely am and then feel responsibility or feel guilt or feel like we're in control or feel like we're lacking control. What arises and one of the great freedoms that come from practice is to realize to what degree all this stuff that creates this general holistic television being that we are is impersonal. But impersonal doesn't mean lack of responsibility doesn't mean that it's not uniquely you but it means that we don't have to take it means that we don't have to hold on to any of it. Now does that help make you more confused? No it does help I guess I still see in discussions two different attitudes about thought. So that there's first the idea that thoughts are very important and paying attention to their subtleties and being very aware of them is very important and then on another night the attitude seems to be there's thoughts just they're nothing in a kind of which seems to be a completely different attitude towards thoughts a kind almost dismissive like it's just a thought so it seems like there's both an acute awareness and sensitivity and also almost a dismissive. So I admit that that me that I as a teacher and other teachers probably also go through little moods about what you know and how we want to you know how we're looking at something any given day right. So some days I might emphasize one part of it rather than another but can you imagine taking those two points of view and combining them so that you can do both of them. So that you're so so so so rather than being contradictory it's really that they're two angles of the same thing or you can be very attentive to thoughts and without dismissing them to be very very attentive to them but oh just a thought but just a thought means wow it's a thought isn't it amazing as opposed to oh this is who I am and I'm responsible for this what a terrible person I am for thinking all this. Yes. Okay so there's the hateful path which as I'm interpreting it seems to be things you do to be enlightened or to become free or whatever and yet so far the items in the path have been lacking in the verbs like there's not a cultivate the right intention or do this and get a right intention and so I'm wondering how and I know we're going to have right effort coming up. Here has been on you know not trying too hard to change myself but you know observing things you know I'll I feel very confused about how hard to work at developing the right intention and the right view. Well that's so that's hard for me to be able to tell you but so maybe we can say right viewing and right intending right acting right speaking rather than now the way that I tend to teach mindfulness in Buddhism tends to tends to it if there's two kind of divisions if you can divide instructions for Buddhism in two different ways there's one side that says you're perfect just the way you are things are perfect just the way you are and related to that sometimes it's a notion that practice is not about doing something it's more about getting out of the way and it's not trying to change anything but just simply being present fully and then in being present fully change happens by itself so I tend to be I tend to kind of lean over in that direction in my teaching I think you guys can tell me if that's right but it's changed over the years a little bit I used to be much more in that camp much more fanatically kind of purist but I tend you know I'm kind of getting you know softer as I get older and the other side is you can do things you can you can tame the mind is a classic Buddhist terminology you control the mind you you develop certain qualities strengths of character strengths of spiritual qualities within you you cultivate and strengthen your concentration you strengthen your mindfulness you you you follow the eightfold path not you know in an active way as verbs are you saying you figure out what is the right intentions that Buddhism says well right intentions are are not holding loving kindness and and and not harming so that's what I'm going to do by God you know you set yourself up and you set your life up and to do that and that's it can be very powerful to do that to actually engage yourself in a more active way the problem with that sometimes is that it ties into our our some of our tendencies towards striving and towards and it might be motivated by the feeling that something's wrong with me right now and so it can arise out of a kind of a kind of aversion to the situation and that aversion actually is more harm acting out of that aversion can be more harmful than actually help from the long term and a lot of Westerners you know a little bit neurotic about success and succeeding and failing and striving and ambition and all these things so to give too much this instructions and you know you know strive for liberation in the West is just I've seen too many times it's been problematic so however the eightfold path one of the reasons I like talking now about the eighth full path is that for me at least it's an indication that that there's more to the spiritual life than just being mindful and just allowing things to be and be mindful as best you can it's very powerful to do that and the more powerful more carefully and more thoroughly you can do that the more transformative to be in your life but there's a recognition that it's not so easy to do that it's not so easy to transform your life just through the power of mindfulness itself and that sometimes what's required of us is behavioral changes we have to change our lives and that's not something which is so popular I feel in a lot of Western Buddhist circles you know we're lay people to begin with and so you know we're not going to change ourselves too much you know forget about you know what about monasticism you know how about celibacy you know is that a good idea forget it um uh so and so you know you want Westerners kind of want to live a lay life and all things that go with that and they want to do a spiritual practice at the same time it's a great experiment but uh if the only thing that so as I said before is what a lot of Americans in recent decades have wanted is Buddhism to adapt itself to the west and to get rid of all its Asian cultural baggage which is an appropriate thing to do but if the only thing that changes as Buddhism comes to the west is Buddhism we don't have Buddhism pretty quickly and then it's appropriate that America or at least certain you know those people who practice Buddhism that they also they get changed and challenged by Buddhism and that certain behavioral changes some of them can arise just naturally out of practicing and in theory that can be enough just practice mindfulness the best you can and the appropriate changes will happen on their own but realizing and recognizing that it's very difficult to practice mindfulness as thoroughly really takes to really become totally free it is appropriate to do behavioral changes to change your life to actually do some things to create good conditions we do that we don't say we do that by going on retreat retreats are we're changing our behavior you know we go on longer retreats and we don't tell you that you're becoming monastics you know we're telling you before I come to retreat and be celibate for a week you know come to retreat and you know cut down on what you know on your speech don't speak so much and do all these things you follow the schedule you get up early in the morning all the things that a monastic does we don't tell you you'll come you wouldn't come but actually what so that's exactly what I discovered so um so but it is a kind of a change of our conditions that makes this situation as optimal as possible to develop and strengthen our mindfulness and our deep kind of connection with ourselves in our spirituality so in our normal life also if we can look at the way we speak speaking creates a tremendous amount of suffering and and then try to change the way we speak so we speak in a wiser way our livelihood the way we work the way we we live our life look at it honestly and maybe it's appropriate to change it so for example the lawyer came to me many years ago and asked on a retreat said you know I'm really really want to be a Buddhist practitioner it's really important for me but in the particular kind of law or law firm or whatever that I do this is not a general statement but lawyers just about him he said I'm expected to lie so how can I be a good Buddhist and lie at the same time and he expected an answer I mean like how to do it and certain professions certain activities are not sustainable if you do if you really allow your life to be informed by mindfulness the sensitivity that comes from mindfulness and I know people have quit certain jobs because it just was too painful to these jobs once you started becoming sensitive to what was going on but it's also sometimes possible and maybe appropriate to change your job before you become so sensitive that it's so painful so you realize oh Buddhism has certain guidelines about what kind of occupations are considered to be on inappropriate when it talks about right livelihood so maybe I won't do those I just trust that this is you know maybe I'll trust the tradition or maybe not I think about it makes good sense or whatever you don't wait for until mindfulness kind of makes it really obvious so then we change we so for example one of the things that Buddhism says is wrong livelihood is is dealing with arms you know weapons and Buddhism says very is very categorical about that and or dealing with intoxicants very strong opinions about that that is not right livelihood so if your job involves that and you're interested in and you're interested in looking at the eighth full path as you know something you've got you know acting you might think very seriously why does Buddhism say that and this is something not that you want to accept this blindly you know kind of like a commandment but you know what you know you know maybe I should look at this and maybe change my behavior so where you want to fall on the spectrum is is partly up to you know your own sense sense of what's most necessary for you you know what your own sense is of what you need and sometimes doing things actively and changing things is really appropriate and and sometimes we do it then we realize after a while we it was mistake the way we did it and that's what's beautiful about mindfulness is it self-correcting for mindful will learn from mistakes so where so you have to decide for yourself where you are in that spectrum and the and the the role of a teacher if you go talk to a teacher about that ideally would be to listen to you really carefully and get some sense from you of where you are on that spectrum and support you where you need to be rather than you know be a purist and say you should do it my way yes last one um the last thing you said before you start taking questions on violence yeah talking a little bit about that before and obviously war in general plays is not it's not non-violent but what about things such as you know defending yourself in cases not threatening your life or how that how you supposed to translate that into your own life which i take to be you're supposed to figure this out for yourself rather than take some kind of pure and dogmatic view and and part of it is realizing that it's situational so maybe uh maybe um you know your intention is to be a pacifist but you're also not going to be stupid you know if or you're not going to you're not going to you know if if there's if if what you're really strongly motivated to do in certain situations defend yourself maybe it's appropriate so you know but um what what impresses me is that a lot of people will for example will get themselves a gun for their home or get themselves you know some kind of weapon as the first line in defense without ever having learned any other methods or ways of defending themselves and and you know to be to be actively interested in non-violence isn't something isn't like we have this you know natural capacity and ability to know what to do with that means because it doesn't mean you simply don't do anything it takes creative and and creative action to be non-violent in an effective way defend yourself effectively in non-violent ways and you don't learn that naturally it doesn't you know something like so so how about training ourselves in it you know there's books on non-violent civil disobedience on all action um learning things to do learning maybe aikido where you're not supposed to fight with a defendant but rather with with the opponent but rather as my father took aikido when i was a kid and he came home and said oh what you're supposed to do you're supposed to love your opponent you love your opponent to defeat you know so so there's there's there's trainings so so once you've once you've trained yourself and educated yourself your options and what you might choose to do will be different than if you don't train yourself so it's really up to you you know how motivated you are to learn about this to find out about this and you know and it's i would say i would argue that it's basically situational but there's beautiful examples in the world we had one in the last week did you notice of non-violence in action in bulgaria it was hundreds of thousand people came and went on strike in bulgaria and it brought down the government isn't that something and then we had as an ecuador all these governments coming down tumbling down governments are fragile anyway so probably this talk was neither a disaster or the best talk of the year but we'll all go home and sleep soundly
