 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. I'm very grateful for Matthew who came and filled in for me yesterday. I was under the weather a little bit. I had a little bit of fever on Wednesday evening. A little bit of upset stomach. I woke up in the morning and the fear was gone. Very quickly in the course of the morning, after sleeping 12 hours, I started feeling pretty good. So I think it's passed and I'm happy to be here with you all. So when we're treated in an impersonal way, then it can be kind of cold. We can take it personally and feel like it's offensive, almost. Like somehow we've been ignored or overlooked or not respected. Sometimes when things are personal, we get offended easily. And we're holding onto some idea or we're threatened easily. Sometimes when things are personal, it feels really cozy and comfortable and safe. And then there's a third step, which there's no English word that I know of. Maybe make up a word something like under personal or pre personal or post personal. And that's when things have become so personal, so centered, so connected here, that we stop thinking about ourselves. We stop assigning person to anything, person to person illness to anything. And things are just can be as they are in the coziness and the comfort and the safety of the present moment. And in fact, to really be in this under personal way is it can feel that taking things personally, assigning personal value on them and what it means for me, myself and I can feel like using course, sandpaper on very smooth wood. It feels like it's a little bit too much. And what's nice is just to appreciate the comfort, the ease, the subtleness of our experience without the overlay of whatever it means to be to assume or feel that it's personal. This extra evaluation that sometimes is quite wonderful. So as meditation deepens, we start getting a feeling for how to meditate without taking it personally. It doesn't mean that it becomes impersonal in some cold kind of way. It means that we go deeper than what's personal, the under personal. And we can just be present in the simplicity of the moment, content. And if we're not content, then probably there's something that we're taking personally, something we're concerned with for me, myself and mine, something that bothers us, something that we want, something we don't want. And so we're using the course or sandpaper. But if we quiet down, then, and let go of this content of all forms and just content to be here, there's this under personal state where things just be in meditation in a very, very simple way and it's very satisfying. So assuming a meditation posture, and it's useful to take one that personally for you, supports your meditation. Each person's going to have a different posture. That's the right posture for them to meditate in. Sometimes the variations are very small. And to gently close your eyes and to feel at first how personal it is with the eyes closed to feel yourself, to feel the sensations of the body, to feel and recognize the thoughts you're having, to feel what's happening in your heart, the emotions that are present. Rather than judging them or reacting to them, feel out with the eyes closed how close they are to you. They're not someone else's sensations and feelings, they're yours. They're quite personal. Others might have similar feelings, but yours are your own. And then to take a few long, slow, deep breaths, breathing in and inhabiting this personal experience of yourself here and now. Exhaling and relaxing it, relaxing everything in your body. Exhaling and releasing. Breathing in and breathing out, letting breathing return to normal. You might say that breathing is personal. You might say that it's something different than personal. It's shared by all mammals. All humans are doing the same movements. It's something universal to breathe in, breathe out. And as you're sitting here, become aware of the temperature of your body, places where your body feels warm, places where it feels cool, places in between. And feel the temperature of your body as something that's deeper than personal. It's nature, the natural movements of how the body works in the presence of certain conditions. The warmth, the coolness, the play of warmth and coolness in the body. And how breathing interacts with it. Maybe in some more foundational way, below the temperature there's the solidity of the body. The hardness, the firmness against your seat or the floor, the weight of your body. Breathing in and breathing out, letting breathing in and breathing out. And out of that firmness and groundliness, there's also movement in the body, movement of the associated with breathing, small little movements of the body. And in Buddhist meditation practice, being aware of these properties of temperature and solidity and movement are three of the four properties that to tune into that are pre-personal, under personal. It's a way of having our experiences without the overlay of attributing a self for me, myself to it. So intimate, so cozy and contented to stay close to these basic sensations, properties that are at play in the body, sitting here, movement, temperature, softness and hardness, solidity. The water element property is cohesion. Anything that feels like it's stretching or being held together is considered to be the property of stickiness or lubrication. Stay close to these fundamental sensations as a way of being under personal, less personal than personal. Or if you can't do that, having a heightened awareness of how you do overlay the idea of the personal on top of your experience...........................
