So, continuing with sharing some reflections and some teachings about sympathetic joy,
vicarious joy, mudita, beautiful practice, a practice that in some ways, for me, I tell
myself it keeps me honest of what is going on in my life, if at any point I have some
like, well, I don't know, something is, you know, something is contracting, even if it is
very subtle. It's like, okay, let's check in with mudita, see what's here.
And as I mentioned before, there are some preliminaries that are just wonderful preliminary
practices or reflections that are wonderful. When we are practicing with mudita, prepare to
practice with mudita. And one is appreciation. Appreciation for what we have in our lives,
in body, spirit, mind, externally, internally, however, it is supportive for you.
You know, even when we wake up in the morning and we just see the sun and the blue sky,
oh yes, yes, okay, thank you, gracias, thank you, beautiful sky, yes. Or you feel at ease,
you know, this doesn't mean that it's on a permanent basis. It will be kind of a
setting ourselves up, you know, life includes a whole range of experiences from the joys to the
sorrows, everything. And it all, you know, relates to how it is that we approach it,
how it is that we receive it. So appreciation, appreciation that we're here, appreciation
that I'm giving you different examples that what a joy to practice in community,
appreciation for where you're at, appreciation for this breath.
You know, it's interesting, I was just organizing some files yesterday. And I just got this teeny
tiny note, you know, a piece of paper just like this big, like a square like that.
And it said,
live the day of today, live today like it will be your last day, because really, it may be.
And how timely. I just, you know, out of the blue, I was not thinking about anything,
you know, anything deep, I was just in a very mundane activity.
And I'm like, oh, okay, yes, being here. So appreciating that we can have moments of presence,
that we can have continuity in the practice for being present, even if we don't like it.
But at least we know we can discern. So appreciation.
And then there's the practice of gratitude. And it may sound similar, but there's a little
bit of a difference to it. I don't know, sometimes appreciating is like, oh, yes, yes,
yeah. And it's almost like gratitude comes after many times. And with gratitude, there's a quality
sometimes of acceptance. It's almost like, there's a little bit of equanimity or balance, okay.
Okay. I feel, yeah, I feel grateful. This may, yes, for the experiences that we like and the
experiences that are challenging or are not like, okay, well, what can I learn from this? Okay.
And just, you know, maybe at some point in our lives, we see, well, that was an experience that
taught me something or gave me an opportunity to go deeper in the practice. So gratitude
includes everything, everything, everything, everything. So appreciation, gratitude. And
then I would say another, another preliminary practice is that I really like to include
with joy before practicing with sympathetic joy is empathy.
Empathy. And is it just gives me an opportunity to touch in a very subtle and with the distance
that I may choose with experiences of people that I may not resonate very much, not the easy person,
not the benefactor. Yes, it definitely, you know, we can bring empathy and
it also may give us an opportunity to practice with people that we may not feel super close to,
that may annoy us once in a while or that kind of thing.
It's like you bring them to mind and there may be a moment that you remember different
experiences with this person that you appreciate. But you just, you just remember different
moments and different moments in the life of this person that may be challenging for them.
And so there's a sense because there's already a foundation of caring and relationship and maybe
that, you know, some seeds of love, some something there, the empathy may be, may be easy to come up.
So we're going to practice with all these formal D10 and we're going to start today
with an easy person and we will continue with the whole range of dear people in our lives for,
I'll be here quite maybe two or three times in the upcoming week. So it gives an opportunity to
share the full range of experience with Mudita. And one moment, one practice builds upon the other
and upon the other. So you may want to whatever you take from this tonight, today, see if you can
practice it during the day tomorrow, whoever comes into your path tomorrow that you feel comfortable
practicing with. Okay. So taking a posture that supports you, sitting, standing, lying down, walking.
And this I don't, I don't call this a preliminary, I call this a preparation and
arriving here, we need to be present to practice. So mindfulness, to establish mindfulness,
arriving here, settling in. And you know that you're arriving and settling in as you receive,
as you sense these body sensations in the body, feet touching the ground or the contact points
of whatever the body is sitting or lying down, standing or walking, touching the floor, chair,
couch. Letting the body breathe itself.
Receiving, making this a moment of resting, resting the attention of having to go to many
places, but just resting the attention here, in this moment, in this body,
even in my voice arising and passing, you can choose.
Highly and gently.
And receiving this moment.
And being embodied here.
And time to rest with alertness and presence.
Not having to control anything.
Knowing that all range of physical sensations may arise and pass.
Emotions, thoughts. And it's okay.
It's okay. Giving the space and respect and then maybe saying thank you and coming back
to become aware, present here, a key of your body, body, mind, heart. Holding the intention
of practicing with modita, vicarious joy.
And so just to prepare, start easy with these, your mind.
Just bringing some appreciation for your presence here.
Appreciating that we can connect and be together practicing, cultivating the wholesome
and respecting and allowing whatever comes up. Because we can discern and we can choose wisely
as we practice how to relate to anything that arises.
Gratitude for each of us here. Appreciating all of us.
Maybe also bringing some gratitude for anything that may come to your mind and heart that you
can be grateful for. But anything. Connecting with someone.
Gratitude also for being here. Gratitude for other aspects of your life.
Gratitude and appreciation.
And so becoming aware as you bring gratitude and appreciation, how does it feel in this body?
Just by receiving sensations.
It's okay, however it is.
Grateful that you have a place to connect.
Maybe some spaciousness in the body or just relaxing. Well, I'm here. That's enough. That's okay.
Mindfulness helps us to stay moment to moment seeing what is arising moment to moment.
Just receiving and resting here.
And so now, maybe bringing to your mind, heart or someone, an easy person that
just to bring them to your mind makes you happy.
And maybe remembering those moments maybe that you know of that this person have been happy or
just imagining that this person is happy or that has had a moment of
good fortune for anything. Bringing this easy person, easy being to your mind and heart.
Take some time here to have a felt sense of this person. You can imagine them in your mind
clearly.
Seeing how it feels in the body as you bring this person to mind,
this easy person that in moments of happiness you may have felt happy for them.
And so I will offer to you two or three phrases and you can make your own but just for having a
reference point I will offer some and you can continue bringing this person to your mind, body, heart.
Just say, may your good fortune continue.
I am happy for your good fortune may it continue and never
never, never leaves you, leave you.
I am happy, I am happy for your good fortune.
I am happy for the success that brings you
health, a healthy life. May it continue, so happy for you. May it continue your good fortune.
And you can repeat these phrases really having the image of this person
as you breathe in and as you breathe out, easy person.
A person that when you see their joy, their happiness, their good fortune,
you feel it for them, you feel this modita for them.
Being delighted, delighted by the joy of this person.
Keeping it very simple.
If at any point there is any contraction or
any struggle, maybe it's okay to go back to the practice of mindfulness and be with it.
And then when you're ready you can go back to the practice of modita for this easy person,
no need to force it, it's okay.
you
you
you
I am pleased and delighted in your good fortune. May it continue.
May it be so.
you
you
you
you
you
now kindly and gently maybe sending modita to this easy person
one more time and let the image of them fade away
taking a moment to really receive the response of this body being aware of the body
in physical sensations or breath or
in summary and specific of the body
that tells you that you're here
how it feels after practicing modita,
sending modita for this easy being.
so
now as you are aware here of this body
connecting with you your dear, dear
sense of you here, dear friend,
and bringing yourself the sense of you know an image of you right here meditating
like if it would be another being arising in your mind and heart
and then oh he's Bruni, he's Neil, he's Jennifer, he's you whoever you are
and then maybe
maybe sending some modita you can even use your name Liam
may your good fortune continue yes may my good fortune continues
Uva may it continues and never depart you the good fortune
yes may never depart the happiness this joy this vicarious joy in my life
in any moment that is present
and so acknowledging the modita in your life and sending modita to you
if possible in any way not even with words but if you there's a sense that there's modita here
for you too yes may it be so
whatever you are here in the states or any other places in this planet yes
may this good fortune in my life continues may I be able to see it and receive it
to feel it to sense it
and if it is hard nothing to force you just can stay with the practice of mindfulness
yes
yes I am delighted by this good fortune thank you thank you
you for these good fortune may it continues
and when it's not present may I remember it
and so now letting the image of you fade away and still be present here in other ways
then maybe now connecting with all of us here
knowing that we are in company that we're all on this path
and sending modita to all of us
yes may your good fortune continues may our good fortune success in anything
in continuous
may you remember may we remember
I'm feeling delight and pleased for the good fortune of this dear community
may it continues and may it touch everyone you come in contact with
when there's this modita present
and so now
shifting kindly and gently fading away the phrases of modita and closing the practice of modita
by connecting connecting again
and then main attention to the body maybe to the rising and passing of my voice
and then at the sound of the bell when I ring it take your time to receive the sound to receive
the beginning the middle the end and see how it resonates in the body
and as you listen to the sound as it fades away you can open your eyes whenever you're ready
so
I'm taking a moment to open your eyes and savoring, savoring this transition of looking
around, knowing that we're all together here and seeing how it feels now.
And so we're going to go now into breakout groups and so if you want to stay we'll do
groups of three and if you want to leave and come back later it's fine, but it will
help to prepare to set the groups if you leave now if you will not participate.
You can come back after 8 minutes, 10 minutes, encouraging you to stay, okay, okay, great.
So here we go and so the exploration here is how was for you to practice Mudita and
how it was, how you feel now after practicing Mudita, that will be interesting to see how
it is, how are you right now versus when we started, is that good, that's okay, clear,
okay, great, okay, we'll have around six, eight minutes and there, here you go, okay.
Oh, there you go, I ended in a group, did I, let's see, you're on mute, Ernie.
Thank you, thank you.
Now we have some time to share, anything you would like to share, how was that for you?
Or if you have any questions, any comments will be wonderful to share with all of us.
Take your time, this is Michael, it was one big Mudita fest full of joy, that's great
Michael, wonderful, oh, this is great and I have here in note my partners so beautiful,
yay, remember those moments, that's great, anything else, anything else you want to share,
did you notice, oh, wait a minute, here, Amy, yes, go ahead.
So I started the, that pretty activated, I think I was in like this state of, I think
valid, kind of like anger, and it was like, it had me a bit, but I still did the practice
and I did the practice with a dog, thinking of the dog and just the Mudita, this little
dog, Pandita, who does move her entire booty when her tail wags and just thinking of that
and how she moves and thinking about moving with her in that same way and how proud she
is of her outfits and her bone and just, yeah, that joy and it just really did shift the
energy, it helps me settle, you know, and it's just fascinating to kind of play with
the validated anger and where our voices and then also there's grounding and, you know,
like it's these, it's just, it's really the interplay, it's just really interesting to
me and I just wanted to say that.
That's great, thank you for sharing this, Amy, you know, it shows also that the power,
you know, when we're practicing and we trust, okay, well, let me shift and let me practice,
let me see what happens here and, and also to acknowledge and respect any other emotions
that arise, okay, this is here and there's Mudita with Pandita.
Yeah, it's Mudita with Pandita.
So thank you, thank you for sharing.
Oh, awesome, thank you.
Anything else?
I like Christine's cat there watching with us, not just purring on her lap, but watching
us.
Yes, yes, and who knows, you know, cats, we know our dear friends and we know when there's
Mudita happening also with them.
And so, you know, in the same way, there's maybe some delight within us and, you know,
it's like, oh, okay, oh, here's Mudita, there's like a sense of Mudita doesn't have to be
super expressive or anything like that.
Yes, please.
Hi, I'm rain.
And I was in Christine's group, and three of us were talking about her, her cat, like
we would ask a question to Christine and you could literally see that cat changes facial
expressions and like, let me think about that and do it like, but I swear she was meditating
earlier.
And then the second thing was that our group toward the end, we were saying how some of
it has to just just doing meditation, meditation in general, but when people come to us and
they want us to get into like, like someone was, there was a murder in my neighborhood
recently and someone wanted me to get all afraid and nervous about it.
And I was like, I'm not going to worry about it.
I don't go out to in the morning for drugs.
I don't think I'm going to get murdered.
And they were very upset about me not matching them on that fear and hysteria.
So I love this practice because it's so much more fun to meet somebody on a level of love
and their good fortune and I just, it's so refreshing, but that, yeah, that we're, I
was really, it was a delight for all three of us.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you for sharing this, yes.
Anything else?
Hmm.
Okay.
Well, so May Maudita continues for you, May it show itself in different moments of your
day, the upcoming days, and may you recognize it.
And so with this, we dedicate the merit to all of you, dear friends.
So now so happy you're here.
It gives me a lot of foodita too and so may the benefits of your practice bring fruits
for everyone you come in contact with, everyone including yourself, yes.
May all beings be happy, may all beings know Maudita and no peace, may all beings know peace.
Thank you, everyone.
And so with that, you cannot mute and say goodbye.
Thank you, Bernie.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good night.
Thank you, Maudita.
Bye.
Thank you, Christian.
Chaos.
Peace.
Thank you so much.
We got someone these days.
Bye.
