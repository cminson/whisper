The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Hello everyone, warm greetings. Very happy to be back here after being away
for a week. And someone here is loud, no hum, loud buzzing. So I'm also hearing
buzzing. Hum better now. It's the silence, audiophine here. Okay, so hopefully it's
all okay. Well enough. I'm sorry for the people with the buzz. I'm not sure what
to do. The heater is on, so I don't know if they were picking up the sound of the
heater here. It's a good morning.
There's a kind of a rule of the road, kind of a rule is the right word, but it's
that when you're driving a car, you vary the distance between yourself and the
car in front of you, depending on the speed in which you're driving. So if
you're driving slow, you might keep your, you know, one car's distance from the
other car. But then as you go faster, maybe a 50 miles an hour, you want to keep
at least five cars distance from the car in front of you. So there's enough time
to slow down and stop if something else, something happens. And certainly don't
want to tailgate. And so the same thing with our life. The faster our life goes,
the more space you want to have between your thoughts. That maybe if you're just
sitting quietly and just eliminating and thinking nicely, that it's fine. Just
let your thoughts do the speed in which they go. But when the thoughts start
tailgating, thoughts start kind of one after the other without any pause
whatsoever. And especially if the thoughts are going fast, then there's not
much room for a deeper awareness of what's happening. There's not much room
to stop and really see and consider and be wise about what is going on. So the
idea, the possibility of slowing our thinking down, or maybe not slowing it
down exactly, but giving space for thoughts, the space between our thinking,
our thoughts, and not to have the thoughts kind of run through our minds
one after the other, is one of the wonderful ways of tapping into
our own wisdom and also our own safety. We become safe, safer if we're not
tailgating our thoughts. Because then we don't see enough. They come so fast. We
don't really see what's happening. So with that as a background for this
meditation,
assuming a meditation posture in which you can sit in an alert way, if you take
a really deep, deep, full breath and let your chest fill with air, and then that
sense of openness in the chest, as you exhale, don't lose all of it. Sit with a
posture that allows a chest to be feel a little bit open, a little bit expanded.
Sometimes if you take a very deep, deep breath at the beginning, so much so that
you feel you're pulling on your shoulders as the ribcages expand upward,
then when you exhale, let your shoulders relax. And same thing if you take a very
deep, full breath and let your, the diaphragm when you breathe in pushes down
if you're relaxed and expands the belly. To take a deep breath and relax and let
the belly expand as fully as you can. And then as you exhale, let the weight of the
belly settle. And then your eyes are still open. You can lower your gaze. It's
comfortable. You can close your eyes. And then breathing normally on the exhale,
relaxing the muscles of the face. On the exhale,
softening the shoulders. On the exhale, relaxing the belly.
On the exhale, relaxing your arms and hands. And if it feels right, you can
adjust the posture of your hands. And on the exhale, relax your brain as if
the brain is a muscle. And then notice kind of the speed by which you're
thinking. Are your thoughts fast and tailgating each other? And if they are on
the exhale, can you soften and slow down your thinking? Maybe at the end of the
exhale, let there be a brief pause in your breathing. And a brief pause in
your thinking. So you begin getting a feel for there being space between
thoughts.
And then begin settling down into the body's experience of breathing.
Relaxing your thinking mind as you exhale.
Letting there be a simple pause in your thinking. At the end of the exhale.
And maybe with that pause, you can receive more fully the beginning of the
inhale.
Noticing the speed in which you're thinking.
Can you calm your speed? Calm your thinking down. Slow your thinking. And with
the slowest thinking that's available, direct your thinking to think about your
breathing. With the simplest shortest thoughts you can, thoughts of
recognition of the experience of breathing here and now.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your
thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your
thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And as you're sitting here,
if there's any degree of calm,
align yourself with that calmness. Allow yourself to feel the calmness, the
subtleness. Letting the thinking mind enjoy the calmness.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause in your thinking.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause.
And with that pause in your thinking, let there be a brief pause.
And as we come to the end of this sitting, perhaps you can consider
that when you have a traffic jam of thoughts, there's not much space in the mind to take
in other people, to really see them, hear them, feel them, recognize what's happening
with them in some fuller way.
But when the thinking becomes quieter, slower, it's possible to gaze upon others to look upon
them, to see them more fully.
And that ability to be present for others can be a gift, can be a form of generosity,
of care, of kindness, friendliness.
May it be that the calmness and subtleness that might come from this meditation today,
whether you know it or not.
May it be that it somehow comes with us into our life in the world, so that we're more
present for people, listening better, hearing better, seeing better, without the distraction
of a lot of thinking, preoccupations.
May it be that this meditation that we do serves for the welfare and happiness of others.
May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful, and may
all beings be free.
