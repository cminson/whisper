Now we'll transition again from standing or sitting to walking.
So I want to just offer a few words before we move into this next posture or next period.
It's helpful as we move into this period of movement, walking meditation,
to make an intentional orientation to dedicate oneself to the walking practice.
Walking practices sometimes can be tricky, especially with living our house and walking in the garden neighborhood.
We can easily get caught up by the areas of house projects and garden projects and chores that we need to do.
So maybe it's helpful to make an intention. This is a period that I'm going to offer to dedicate myself to the walking practice wholeheartedly.
And as such, I invite you all to maybe do whatever is needed for the body or anything that you need to take care of in the house to do it either at the beginning or the end of the walking period.
We will all be back here at 10.05 and David will be ringing a bell nicely to bring you back to the next session.
If you are not next to your computers, then I just remember that's when the next session begins.
Then a couple of words about the space and the path for walking.
So it's helpful to find a straight, relatively simple, easy pathway of 30 to 40 feet long.
And avoiding trying to make turns here and there. And if it's helpful at the beginning of the meditation to clear a pathway, and that's easy for you to walk, feel free to do that.
And also wherever you walk, a little bit of a clearing might be helpful as we're walking with eyes open.
And sometimes whenever we see, you know, a clutter here, a clutter there and we begin to instead of doing walking meditation and clearing the house.
So it's helpful to maybe just do a very light touch here and there if needed before you begin the walking.
And then the space is relatively simple for you to do the walking.
And when you begin to walk, you simply stand at the beginning of the pathway and then walk all the way to the end, stop, turn around, walk back and keep doing this.
And it's recommended to do this way because it's easy to find a rhythm in this kind of space.
And it's not very complicated. And so we don't have to negotiate our way this way and that way.
You can do it either inside or outside.
But allow yourself to be, to be simple.
And then in terms of how you walk, see a few words about this.
And the first thing is about the pace of a walking and the pace of a walking may vary.
And so if you're feeling sleepy or you're feeling very agitated, it may be helpful to have somewhat of a faster pace to allow for the sleepy body to feel maybe a little more awake alive to do slightly faster pace.
And for folks who may have agitation in the body, it may also be helpful to work a slightly faster to allow this agitating energy to find a way to, to course through us and the faster pace as a way to kind of bring some harmony between the mind and the body.
Now, if you find yourself quite settled right now and quite have a lot of sense of calm and ease, and maybe slower walking is good to match that energetic field you're in.
And so this is something that may be inviting for some kind of a discernment to see where you are, how you are with your own bodies, and then kind of allow yourself to then become in tune with it.
And the other thing to say is that don't make this a huge project to figure it out. Let the body speak for itself. And so in the way that you're not walking, but the walking, the body is walking you.
And so see if you can tune in, let the body be the guide in your walking.
And in terms of, once you're settled into a particular pace that you find ease with it, you can bring in some different practices that we've spoken about.
For example, I often bring in the element practice in my walking. So maybe you're resting your attention on the movements of the air element in the body, the energetic feel, the chi in the body, or you could rest on maybe the earth element as your feet come in contact with the body.
And so you can bring in some of the practices in. But again, a word of caution is to avoid making it very complicated.
As you can just stay with the sensations of the feet and the legs, maybe that's enough for meditation.
For some quiet labeling may be helpful to begin with. For example, moving left leg, and then saying left, moving right leg, just say right.
And sometimes that's useful. And if you find that your labeling is not matching your left and right, and you know you're wantered away, right? So now you can reset.
At some point, if you find you're quieting down, maybe the labeling is not needed anymore.
So you can just rest in the felt sense of the body.
I think those are the words that I'm going to offer in terms of walking meditation.
I want to leave you a poem by Thich Nhat Hanh about walking meditation.
And as maybe a way to inspire you, take my hand.
Well, you know, we can't do the taking my hand, but I invite this as an orientation of us doing this together.
So we will walk. We will only walk. We will enjoy our walk without thinking of arriving anywhere.
Walk peacefully. Walk happily. Our walk is a peace walk. Our walk is a happiness walk.
Then we learn there is no peace walk. That peace is the walk. That there is no happiness walk. That happiness is the walk.
We walk for ourselves. We walk for everyone. Always hand in hand.
Walk and touch peace every moment. Walk and touch happiness every moment.
Each step brings a fresh breeze. Each step makes a flower bloom under your feet.
Kiss the earth with your feet. Print on earth your love and happiness.
Earth will be safe when we feel in us enough safety.
May you walk in peace and happiness. And we'll be back here 10.05.
