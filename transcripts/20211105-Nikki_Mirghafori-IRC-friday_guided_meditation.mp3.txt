 Stepping, stepping into the stream of change. And every moment of experience. It's stability, with groundedness, with embodiment. How is the body in this moment? Relaxing, receiving the sensations of the body, of the breath. As if we were sitting at a movie theater. A movie theater that had really comfortable sitting where we could relax. Ah, and watch with interest, with curiosity, with care. This movie that is this life's experience, this flow of experience. The sensation here. The breath there, the thought comes and goes. An emotion that shows up, a friend. Stays in the body for a while and leaves. This passing show, interesting. Staying right here in this comfortable seat, stable, grounded, not toppled over. Relaxed, spacious. At the door of the present moment experience. As if you're at a revolving door, experience is coming and going in this moment, this moment. The revolving door of this moment, and now this moment, and now this moment. Always now. Always now. Watching, the arising, the staying, the passing, now. An invitation. As you stay embodied, bottom-heavy, the center of gravity, alone in the body, opening the senses, opening the entire body to sounds, to the sphere of hearing. Not so much going out to catch the sounds, but receiving, receiving, relaxing and receiving sounds. As they arise and pass away. In this moment, arising and passing sounds, space of hearing. Sounds arising, staying for a while and passing. Impermanence, change, a nitya. A nitya. A nitya. A nitya. A nitya. A nitya. A nitya. Without judgment, with curiosity, with care, wonder how is this mind, this heart, relating to change? No. No. See. Be aware of how change is held in this moment, which could also change from one's mind. From one moment to another. And it's all part of the flow, the stream, this river of being. Everything changes and it's okay. Can we be unagitated? No agitation? As the stream flows, in fact, observing knowing change, sometimes, can bring more stability. And when change is really known, when a nitya is seen, the heart can relax. The mind can relax. Oh yes, it's like this. There can be a lot of stability, spaciousness, freedom, and care for self and others. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
