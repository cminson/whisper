 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. One of the really fascinating and very important aspects of doing this practice, opportunity from this practice, is to become aware of the influence our activity has on ourselves. And in particular, what I emphasize today is the influence of your thinking. Thinking has a huge impact because thinking often carries with it attitudes, desires, aversions. Thinking is not so innocent. And some thinking can undermine us, can deplete us, can bring us tension. And some thinking can actually uplift us and inspire us and bring energy. And if you get quiet, one of the functions of getting quiet meditation is you can then be much more sensitive to the impact of your thoughts on you. And you can change them, not to deny what's happening, but to think about what's happening in a nicer way. Of course, we don't do a lot of thinking in meditation, but it could be as simple as recognizing that the thoughts that you're having are kind of negative. There's like a no or a oh no in them, and just kind of almost like an attitude. And like it just kind of permeates down into our body, maybe with very slight tension, maybe with very slight feeling of tightness or heaviness or depletion, or there's a squeezing little bit of the mind or pressure someplace. And then there's thoughts which are more like a yes, which again, just kind of like, oh, kind of opening and relaxing and uplifting, kind of positive. Not positive that denies anything, turns away from anything, but just simply how we be with it. And one of the ways to have a positive kind of ideation is even if we're having great difficulty, it's just, oh, it's really great that I have a practice to meet this. Wow, I can be present for this. I have the ability of stepping towards it with kind of an open arms, open awareness to be with it, that's so much better than resisting it or tightening down or getting on the bandwagon and being carried away by it or entangled with it. And just the recognition of that can be kind of, oh, it's inspiring. I can't do it well, but isn't it good? I'm trying something like that. So, whether first step, what I'm saying, is not so much changing how you think or your attitude right away, but start noticing the influence that the way you're thinking has on your body and mind. And it could be very simple, very subtle even. It could be little micro muscles that tightened or release. It could be little waves of something, some feeling that's either kind of depleting or inspiring, uplifting. But if you start tracking your thoughts and see the impact they have on you, you'll understand why some people get depressed when they're ruminating the same thoughts over and over and over again with no interruption. It's just kind of like the accumulation of it all is so difficult. So just to know that influence, once you know the influence, then you can say, is there another way here? Is there some way of thinking about this or holding it or viewing it that doesn't deplete me, doesn't limit me, doesn't contract me? Is there something that actually does the opposite? And it may be simplistic, but the absolute simplest thing that might do that is just try saying yes. Even if you don't know what you're saying yes to, or yes to being aware. Just that yes, I'll be aware. For some people, just that yes can shift the inner landscape a bit, the inner ecology. So the influence of thinking on you. So thank you.
