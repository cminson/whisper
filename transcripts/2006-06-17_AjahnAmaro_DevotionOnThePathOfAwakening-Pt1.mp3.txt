I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone today and I'm very glad to be here in the mid-Ponenzula realm once again
and under the guise of the Sati Center. I was explaining to Tantro Di Paolo and Bruno on the way down
that the Sati Center actually is a non-physical entity.
In the old days it used to move to different places so that gatherings would be in different houses
or churches or different spots. But now we meet here at this group with the IMC.
It's been a few years since I did a Sati Center event. I can't remember what the last one was.
But when I was pondering this idea of myself coming along and talking with Gil about different varieties of subjects
we could choose from, then I think it was he who suggested the subject of devotion.
And then when we looked at the dates in the calendar and thought it might be suitable,
then June the 17th came up as a suitable day that fitted everyone.
And this also happens to be Ajahn Chah's birthday. Hence, a picture of our teacher,
Venerable Ajahn Chah, he passed away in 1992 but still every year in his monasteries in Thailand
on the birth anniversary and death anniversary, conveniently placed exactly six months apart.
January 16th and June 17th, then the Sangha gathers.
So as we are gathering today, we're at the far end of the world here, you realize.
So they're all through today. In Thailand, it's already night time.
At 9 o'clock in the evening they'll be having a whole large community gathering, many hundreds, thousands of Ajahn Chah's disciples
gathering and having teachings, meditation, dhamma talks all night long.
So that's happening in his monasteries in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, all through Europe.
And finally here, we're at the end of the timescale.
So it's early morning here but they've already been at it all day long.
And these are other places in our monasteries all around the world.
So I thought this was a suitable theme and a suitable day to bring these together.
As one aspect of the whole realm of devotion is one's relationship to the teacher
and our guides in the spiritual life.
And normally at our events I preface things by saying please feel free to join in
or not with all the chanting and bowing and such like that sometimes people feel very uncomfortable with those elements
and I invite people just to sit back and listen and watch and observe the feelings that arise
if they don't want to join in or to feel free to join in if you wish to.
But since today the theme is that of devotional practice I would strongly encourage that people join in
and I will talk about the feelings of resistance and aversion and kind of negativity towards ritualism and superstition
and all of that good stuff.
We'll be looking at that kind of dimension of this realm and how it exists.
Not only in the Western world but also in Asia there are some monasteries that are completely ritual free.
And so it's not only in the West that people have tended to want to cut out the whole ritual devotional side of it
but it's a theme that you find in other places as well.
However I would strongly encourage, having said that,
since it's the theme of the day I would strongly encourage people to join in as best you can with the various different pieces.
And I thought before going any further that we could start with some chanting
and there's many different ones we could do.
I thought we would begin with a chant on the four Brahma Viharas,
the Divine Mind-States or Sublime Mind-States, so that's page 31 in the chanting book.
So I'll be kind and we'll start off with the English version but later on today we'll do the Pali version.
By the time you're all kind of oiled up and fully in the mood we'll go for the Pali version later on today
but we'll do the English one to begin with.
So this is on page 31.
And so just to give a basic guidance for the way that the chanting works,
those of you who are not familiar with it, the notation that we use is a three note system, a three note melodic system.
If the lead voice, like mine, is the, that's called the home note.
And so that if there is no triangle above or below a letter then you stay on the home note.
If there's a triangle above that letter or syllable then you go up one note
and if there's a triangle below it you go down one note.
If there's no triangle go back for the home note.
Very simple.
Should be, fail safe.
But anyway just join in as best you can and then if you're in doubt just listen to what the lead voice is doing.
Okay.
I will abide pervading one quarter
with a heart imbued with loving kindness
likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth
above and below, around and everywhere
and to all as to myself
I will abide pervading the all encompassing world
with a heart imbued with loving kindness
abundant exalted, immeasurable
without hostility and without ill will
I will abide pervading one quarter
with a heart imbued with compassion
likewise the second, likewise the third
likewise the fourth
so above and below, around and everywhere
and to all as to myself
I will abide pervading the all encompassing world
with a heart imbued with compassion
abundant exalted, immeasurable
without hostility and without ill will
I will abide pervading one quarter
with a heart imbued with gladness
likewise the second, likewise the third
likewise the fourth
so above and below, around and everywhere
and to all as to myself
I will abide pervading the all encompassing world
with a heart imbued with gladness
abundant exalted, immeasurable
without hostility and without ill will
I will abide pervading one quarter
with a heart imbued with equanimity
likewise the second, likewise the third
likewise the fourth
so above and below, around and everywhere
and to all as to myself
I will abide pervading the all encompassing world
with a heart imbued with equanimity
abundant exalted, immeasurable
without hostility and without ill will
so during today I will be drawing
somewhat upon this very handy little book
produced from Amravati Monastery in England
Buddhist rituals and observances
those whose eyes can't read at this distance
and so this is a little handbook
that was produced some years ago
about five years ago to help
introduce the same area of devotional practice
and that element to people in the West
and arose out of a couple of workshops
on the same kind of theme as we have today
both Ajahn Sugito and Ajahn Chandra Siri
Sr. Monk and none of our communities in England
so this covers many of the things
we don't have many copies of these printed up
but this does actually exist on our website
in PDF form so this is easily downloadable
complete with a beautiful typography
on the front cover
so I will be drawing upon this
a fair bit during the day
and so people would like to have copies of this
or to be able to use it
and that's accessible from our site
also when I was sitting down
pondering themes of way of introducing the day
and the basic questions
and issues of developing devotional practice
and how that fits in
and the way that we can relate to it
and what benefits or obstructions there are with it
I'd been pondering that
and sketching out a few ideas
listing up things and then I opened this book
and started reading the introduction
and I realised this is exactly what I wanted to say
so rather than just giving a suit of quotations
I thought I would actually begin
by reading some of this opening section out
and then giving little bits of commentary as you go along
and also there will be plenty of time
during the day for questions and discussion
and so maybe as I begin first of all
just to hold the questions for a little bit
when I finish the introduction
then we'll have time to open things up a bit
and you can ask some initial queries if there are any
The practice of Buddhism is most frequently associated
with the quiet, reflective and introspective aspects
of formal meditation
with little recognition or realisation
of the many means by which we can cultivate
such qualities as joy, gladness
and the uplift of the heart
The devotional aspects of our practice
as seen through solitary meditation
can seem pointless or even foolish
but experience teaches us that meditation alone
is not a guaranteed entry into the sublime
Do people agree with that?
Not a guaranteed entry into the sublime
it can be a wearisome struggle with a way with mind
any argument so far so good
This booklet therefore is about the recognition
and cultivation of those means
whereby we bring emotive forces into our daily lives
and so this is really what the devotional practice
and the term sada or faith
and also the term vandana which means devotion
this is really what this day is aimed at
so that the quality of vandana
or devotion, paying respect
and how that is connected to the quality of faith
and how it helps to develop that spiritual power of faith
and what it's doing is along with
as it says in this little sentence here
we bring emotive forces into our daily lives
so what you're doing with devotional practice
with vandana is taking our capacity to be emotional
our emotional qualities and abilities
and guiding those emotions towards spiritual
supporting our spiritual life
rather than being that stuff which gets in the way
of my spiritual life
which is a way that we can often relate to
when you think about emotions
we think about hating, loving, fearing
jealousy, anger, excitement
that these are not the only emotions in the lexicon
and so that devotional practice is very much aimed at emotion
it's aimed at recognizing our characteristics
our qualities as human beings
that we do have an emotional side to our nature
so it's taking that capacity for emotion, emotionality
and then guiding that towards very skillful objects
and skillful attitudes of working with those
so that then our emotional nature
our capacity to be inspired, to be excited
to be committed and so forth
that these are all tied together with things
that are going to support our spiritual life
we need to make the Buddha Dhammasanga
a vital integral part of our world view
to inculcate a clear sense of reverence and pride
in being disciples of the Blessed One
and a sense of fellowship with all those who have trodden
and currently treading the path to peace and truth
we can feel gladdened and uplifted
by the sense of aspirational belonging
so we are seeking to create a, and this is a useful phrase
a crisis-free zone
so when you make a shrine room or you have a shrine
or you're practicing these devotional practices
to create a crisis-free zone
to develop a sanctuary or refuge of our own
which we can call upon or retire to
not just in formal meditation
but at all times through our daily lives
this booklet is not concerned
with quiet absorption or introspection
it refers more to those outward forms of practice
which help us dislodge negative moods or mind states
and substitute in their place
a contemplative space of joy
and sadha or faith
although sadha is translated as faith
it refers more to a heartfelt sense of rightness
an instinctive, intuitive awareness that this is right
when our sadha is unshakably rooted in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha
they in return evoke a sense of zest
and enthusiasm to continue
and so this is one of the key pieces about a devotional practice
it's like tying our capacity to be engaged, to be inspired
and what he's translating as zest
there's chanda
and those of you who are familiar with
some of the other aspects of the teaching
what's called the four bases of success
the idipada
these are the four qualities that need to be present
for us to succeed in anything
whether it's fixing a car or becoming enlightened
it's chanda, interest or zeal or zest
you have to be interested
there has to be an engagement
if you want to do it, you have to be interested
there has to be a homing in to begin with
and then the second one is virya
it's energy
so the quality of faith is a lot to do with that initial
picking things up and engaging
that yes, this is worth doing
yes, this is worthy of attention
yes, I want to do this, I'm interested in this
once we're firmly established in the triple gem
and once we can call upon our sanctuary
wherever there's the need
we have a sound foundation for the cultivation
of concentration and calm
this is because the mind, being thereby lifted up
gains perspective on the realm of mundane existence
with all its worries, doubts and regrets
however, this is not a refuge
however, this is not a refuge
that we can simply conjure up at will
it needs the right conditions
and we must create them
we may have experienced a sense of uplift
a feeling of trust when we behold a Buddha image
visit a monastery or look at a shrine
there's an all-pervading sense
that beneath the superficial turmoil
and struggle of life, all is well
there is something beyond our limited vision
worthy of exploration, worthy of intense effort
and I think that's a short phrase there
a short paragraph
but it really evokes a lot of why we have Buddha images
why over the centuries we have these shrines
and temples and so forth
it's because of all the different perceptions
that we have in our life
the things that we pay attention to are affected by
then when we see, say, a Buddha image
or a shrine, these kind of perceptions
as he says, there's an all-pervading sense
that beneath the superficial turmoil
and struggle of life, all is well
there is something beyond our limited vision
worthy of exploration, worthy of intense effort
so part of having a shrine
and the beauty of the form
and the quality of symmetry
and then the way that the shrine is looked after
if it's well-tended and cared for
then that is evoking within us
a sense of the orderliness of nature
of the way life is of Dhamma
that there's something that even in the midst of chaos
of my mind and my busyness and all the things I've got to do
and the kind of ongoing struggles
and crises and hopes and so forth
there is this quality of strength
of stability, of peacefulness, of order
that we're not even necessarily spelling out conceptually
but just like the visual image
it has that effect, oh, right
and then maybe the brain says, oh
feels peaceful in here
oh, that's beautiful
but that's as far as we need to get conceptually
because it's not that the image is intrinsically beautiful
it's touching something in us that reminds us of that beauty
that stability, that orderliness
that's actually already in here
it's not say that there's order out there
it's reminding us like a mirror
oh, that underneath this veneer of activity
and preoccupation there's an orderliness
a balance that's already present
so it's like a Buddha image is actually a mirror
you might think, I haven't got a pointy head like that
didn't I?
I should have checked more closely
when I came out this morning
but essentially it's this kind of spiritual mirror
is the point of it
One purpose of this booklet
is to encourage us to develop our devotional practice
making such symbolic bodily actions
as offering candles, incense and flowers
chanting and bowing
to foster and support the meditative mind
such practices help us create
and focus the mind which otherwise might be drawn
towards those commonplace manifestations of the ego
are wanting something, are hoping to get somewhere
or the longing to achieve
acquire and possess some self-oriented goal
instead we should be seeking the very opposite motivation
to give up doing quote unquote anything
to cease the constant wanting
and to practice humility and relinquishment
only then can the mind settle into the loving
open space of chitta, of the heart
so that the devotional practice is like
helping to adjust the attitude
in going into meditation
as to what's going to really be helpful and beneficial
On occasions when silent recollection
is not strong enough to bring us to this space
we need to have recourse to actions
which will facilitate or catalyze this transformative process
a spontaneous unfettered response to another's need
be it by practical help, material goods
or the comforting touch of a caring hand
not only brings succour and support to the recipient
but arouses joy and gladness in the heart of the donor
With the cultivation of increasing sensitivity and awareness
situations inseparable from the very fabric of light itself
offer ample opportunities to recognize and overcome
the insidious demands of self
and to develop in its place an unrestricted tenderness
and compassion towards all beings
Although most of us could live at a prosaic level
in a reality for a while
once we begin to meditate and cultivate the mind
we feel the need to uplift and gladden the heart
rather than living by simply conforming to established customs
If we can find symbols and images
which come to have special significance for us
coming alive by our living relationship to them
then their very presence will help us check
unwanted, unskillful perceptions
such as worries, grudges or fears
which otherwise would come to dominate our thoughts
Furthermore, in adopting and developing suitable rituals
and integral part of our practice
we come to realize the inestimable role
they play in strengthening our resolve and motivation
offering as they do a tangible form
by which we can express our commitment and devotion
The use of devotional practices
is a way of cultivating wholesome trains of thought
wholesome patterns of thought
and developing symbols and images for our inner life
that are going to be things that we can refer to
and will support us
So then, recollection of the triple gem
So this is in particular how the use of certain forms
or verbal and visual forms
in Buddhist devotional practice
centre mostly around the triple gem, Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha
One of the fundamental meditation systems taught in the west
in the east also
is the recollection of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha
This is a method recommended by the Buddha himself
where one brings to mind, thinks about
and considers the quality of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha
One ponders over them and recollects them
rather as one uses a mantra or a rosary
taking them into one's heart to uplift the spirit
and displace other far less noble thoughts and intentions
This is no superstitious gimmickry
but a skillful practice to brighten the heart
by turning the mind towards an auspicious theme
The Buddha pointed out that all the time the mind was occupied in this way
it was free from far less wholesome thoughts
from worries, fears or anxieties
And there's a, let's quote a particular passage
So this is a passage
where the Buddha talks about this
This is in the numerical discourses of the Buddha
the Anguta Rinnekaya
and this is
Sutta number 10 of the Book of the Sixes
The Buddha is talking to Mahanama
When a noble disciple recollects the Tathagata
thus thinking of the, referring to the qualities of the Buddha
on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred or delusion
his mind is straight with the Tathagata as its object
A noble disciple whose mind is straight
gains the inspiration of the meaning, the inspiration of the Dhamma
gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
When he's gladdened rapture arises
for one uplifted by rapture the body becomes calm
and calm and the body feels happy
for one who is happy the mind becomes concentrated
This is called a noble disciple
who dwells evenly amidst an uneven generation
who dwells unafflicted amidst an unafflicted generation
who has entered upon the stream of Dhamma
and develops recollection of the Buddha
and so too with the Dhamma recollecting the qualities of the Dhamma
and then so too with the Sangha
and so that that little chain of causation that the Buddha describes there
is one that you find in a few different places
but it's worth reiterating
that when you recollect the qualities of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha
the triple gem
then that what arises from that is inspiration in the Dhamma
as he says gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
when he is gladdened then rapture arises
piti
for one who is uplifted by rapture the body becomes calm
it's called kaya samati
so that when we're delighted and joyful the body relaxes
for one calming body feels happy
that's sukkha, a kind of contentment or ease
and then
one who is happy the mind becomes concentrated
so that that's pointing out the relationship between inspiration
and samadhi, concentration practice
so that in other expressions where the Buddha talks about this
he points out it's also based on seela or virtue
that is because of seela and the heart being free from remorse
then there's gladness and gladness leads to physical relaxation
to contentment and then that leads to concentration
so that this kind of devotional practice
or bringing these recollections of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha
bringing those qualities to mind
it provides the ground, the supportive conditions for concentration
so as we all know that sometimes if you just come back from a busy day at work
and sort of put all the things away and then plunk yourself down to meditate
then the mind is still going the same speed as the traffic on 101
or maybe a lot faster
but it's by recognizing that there are ways that we can set the mind up
that have a profound effect
that if we want to put things in our favor
and we want to steer things in our favor and make things work for us
then by making that effort to prepare the ground
then when we actually go about the work of meditation
then it's going to be much more effective
so it's just like if you want to start preparing a meal
you clear off a bit of the kitchen tabletop first
you sort of clear the ground and make some space
and then organize your veggies and things
now we can start working
or if you're having an operation
cleaning the doctors and nurses
they clean their hands and put on the gloves and get on the aprons
now we can begin, the thing is prepared
the ground is set
so that's Angutra
number two to ten in the book of the sixties
such recollections and the gladness they evoke
function at a different level from ordinary mundane reality
they operate according to a different kind of perception
a soulfulness
there it is, soulfulness
yet we can dare to be soulful in this Buddhist circle
I think we can risk it
yet it is important to recognize also
that whilst not wishing to reduce our devotions to the level of a routine duty
it is psychologically helpful to adhere to a regular time for formal practice
as seen in the morning and evening pooches within a monastery
ideally we dedicate a room solely to our practice
but when this is not possible we create a shrine in a peaceful part of our living space
and rather than seeking excuses to avoid or postpone practice
the mind comes to accept an established pattern for the day
when we have a regular place and time for our devotions
so also those kind of concerns
of setting the shrine up as I was saying
and kind of making that a kind of helpful object
so like when we came today
then we just wanted to set the shrine up a bit
so I thought well we better bring our own candles and incense
because I'm sure they haven't got any of those there
probably no flowers either
so anyway, no blame
I was just a calculated guess
and of course I was glad to see that we had bought some along
so we could at least equip the shrine to have that
and then one of our friends here today
bought along these beautiful roses from her garden
also I took the liberty of dusting the Buddha a bit
when he showed up since it was the dust of the world
I live in Mendocino County
and he just walked out of the room
and after doing the dusting it's sapled again
so things get dusty easily
but when you are taking care of a shrine
or you are using a shrine
then that's always part of the process
is looking after it and taking care of it
so that there isn't an aura of neglect around that
and the sense of caring is brought to it as well
so now I'll just read the last part of this introduction here
so this last section is called Religious Occasions
another purpose of this booklet is to help newcomers feel more at ease
with the formal practices involved in relating to the shrine and the triple gem
on such occasions as births, marriages, house blessings and deaths
whatever the culture one always finds
that such occasions have a specific significance
there is a universal need to give them a particular place in the heart
and it is the role of religious ceremonies and rituals to do just that
by so doing our practice becomes more alive
and tuned to those particular occasions
by imbuing them with a special kind of auspiciousness
a greater attention to the occasion in all its detail
serves to convey the quality of that occasion more deeply
furthermore such ceremonies as taking the three refuges and the five precepts
have a valuable role in group situations
where there might be a number of people with no special affinity to one another
yet who feel united and bound in a common initiative
realizing in their collective devotions
a wider all embracing sense of fellowship and community
similarly when people from different backgrounds meet at the monastery to offer dana
to offer a meal
a very activity
that corporate generosity inculcates the sense of oneness
a feeling of belonging and kinship
finally apart from such observances for larger gatherings
there are more personal intimate ceremonies
each with their own particular significance
each bringing a sense of the sacred into daily life
so there are many ways including a diversity of devotional language
by which we can support and strengthen our practice
so there's a number of those kind of central themes there
that Ajahn Chanda Siri and Ajahn Sajjito bring up in that little introduction
and so during today hopefully we'll pick up on some of those
and I also would like to help introduce some of the basic mechanics of chanting
how one can chance most effectively and harmoniously
and also the ways of more completely meshing the quality of the devotional practices
and the wording of the things that we recite
into supporting the reflective, the wisdom element of our practice
as well as providing a basis for concentration
and within, I don't know how within this group things are customarily done
how normally you have your events
but in our monastery routine and our life
even though people think of the monastery as being a very austere place
this element of devotional practice it provides
as Ajahn Sajjito and Chanda Siri point out here
there's a whole kind of shape that it gives to our lives
these points both physical that you have the shrine room
you have the Buddha images
you have the way that you relate to them
as a continual presence in your life
and then you have the rhythm of the morning and evening
chanting each day
the ways of gathering together and joining together
so that along with the commitment to the meditation practice
and the inner development
that seeing that the main work of being in the monastery
is to liberate the heart
this is what we don't have a day job
this is our full time 24-7 job is liberation
and so we put aside a lot of other things
we have a distant relationship to our families
we don't have a sex life, we don't even have dinner
we don't have the range of personal activity
we live very communally so you can't just decide
I'll actually remember I think I'll go over to the coast today
can I take the car?
It's not a venerable Jodi Paolo
there's a work project done and you're supposed to be in charge of it
you're not allowed to drive
you can't use money to buy gas
so you can't drive over to the coast today
whereas you might think
well what's driving to the beach
what's such an ordinary thing to do
it's driving to the shops
none of that we can't do any of that
we lay aside the ability to make those kind of choices
and do those kind of things
so our life is extraordinarily restricted
it's simplified to a massive extent
however within that
part of what is involved in our lives
is these devotional elements
that they are sustained
now there are some monasteries as I say
that they minimize that completely
that's as a statement against the kind of overdone
superstition and ritualism
in many many Asian monasteries
temples the ritual and the devotional side
is 99.9% of what goes on there
and there's very little in the way of meditation
so sometimes there are monasteries
that are trying to emphasize the meditation practice
so they say okay nobody image
no shrine, no chanting
no nothing
just go to your heart and meditate
and that has a refreshing counterpart
to the kind of overdone
Vandana the devotional side of it
in many other places
but in most of the meditation monasteries
there's a continuation of that
the same element
there will have a shrine
there will be a Buddha image
it will be well tended
there will be pictures of the revered teachers
and other mentors nearby
and so it's recognized that
when you're trying to live a spiritual life
quote unquote
and you have an enormous sense of commitment
and you're ready to commit
to a great extent
part of what supports that commitment
is these ways of crafting our emotional nature
and the emotional side of our life
and employing that
drawing that in to support
both the concentrated side
so that every morning when we gather at 5 o'clock
we don't just sit down to meditate
we chant together for about half an hour
and so there is that quality of the group
of all these disparate people
physically living spread out
across this forest
and we gather into this one whole pool
and then at least attempts
to join our voices into a single
a single unified body
sometimes some of the voices are not quite
with it
not mine of course
yeah
I'm always alright
some of the voices are not quite there
and some of the bodies are not quite there
I don't manage to wake up with the alarm
but there's a powerful quality
just like within an ordinary meditation retreat
that doesn't have chanting
there's a powerful quality
when everyone's in the hall together
and you're all paying attention to the Dharma talk
there's a powerful quality there
even when you're waiting for the talk to begin
just that gathering together
you're all facing one direction
a single thought, a single mind, a single purpose
and so part of the power of chanting
and certainly within monastery life
along with the dedication towards liberation
the quality of sangha or community
is a great support for that
and so that that physically joining together
being in the same place
you're there at the same time, the same place
and you're all joining together
you're all facing the shrine
and again some people are not quite facing the shrine
they should be facing the shrine
that contraro element
something when those beings
who have to be nine and a half degrees off centre
their way of being in accord is being slightly off
you know what I mean?
that sometimes that's the way people are
but ideally everyone is facing towards the shrine
so you have this physical expression
of a unity of purpose, a unity of intent
and that then joining together in your voices
and you're not just joining together
in your voice singing
Oh what a beautiful morning
you know
or some other kind of favourite tune
but the content of what you join together to sing
is that we use these recollections
of Buddha Dharma and Sangha
so I thought we could also do
a chance some of that
for the first part of this morning
then we'll have a sitting for about half an hour
but that element of
recollecting, repeating
over and over again these sort of classical qualities
of the Buddha, the Dharma and Sangha
and so then they become really embedded in your consciousness
that you hear them over and over again
you have those themes, those qualities reiterated
over and over
so that very effort to recognise
it's not just me and my mind and my life
but I've got to attune to these others
now as I described about the method of chanting
there's the lead voice
and so one of the really interesting things about chanting
is that even if you are a skilled musician
or a skilled singer and you know the right note
the lead singer begins to say
okay that's the C sharp or that's an A flat
and you know okay he started on an A flat
and then you go to A flat and you stay there
the lead voice might have drifted to an A natural
or to a B
and so then you're off key
I mean this does happen I'm sure Bruno
was a musician
would agree that's what can happen
so the key to chanting in tune
is to listen
the way you stay in tune is not by me making the right note
but it's by listening to the lead voice
and then letting your voice go to that which you are listening to
do you understand?
it's really intriguing because it's a very powerful symbol
for spiritual practice
just in itself it's like if I know what's right
and I go ahead and do it
then I find myself out of harmony
but if the eye gets out of the way
and then there's this openness and listening
letting the ear listen to the home note
and then letting the voice go to that on its own
like the voice naturally following the listening
it's hard to describe how it works
but as soon as I am making the right note
it's always slightly off
but if you are guided by the listening
and just trust then your voice goes to that pitch
that's a powerful spiritual training right there
and that's how you begin the day
and then repeating the chanting
and it's the same every day
year and year out
and so then one of the other things that you find
as for the Buddha in that reading from the Angutra
describing how you are cultivating these wholesome thoughts
when you are thinking of those wholesome thoughts
you are not thinking about unwholesome thoughts
even if, as people might have noticed
sometimes you can be saying one thing
and feeling something very different
is this an experience people have had?
so it's not an uncommon experience
while you are chanting all these wonderful
profound beautiful qualities of the Buddha Dharma and Sangha
that your mind at the same time is going
I hate that guy
when we get to the morning meeting
I am going to tell him
even as the voice is saying
the he the blessed one
and so the mind is vowing eternal vengeance
or foul mutilation or just a planning escape
if I just, if I can put my things away
and if I sort of got the car
and then if I get down
how quickly can I get down Tom Kai Road
and get to Redwood Valley
then I will think I have gone to UK
but maybe if I hop over and go to Potter Valley
instead they will never find me there
or whatever it might be
you could just be planning breakfast
but the mind can be involved in very mundane
or course or distracted thinking
but at least when you are chanting
as the voice pronounces those words
then you are hearing your thoughts
in contradistinction to the exalted quality of the words
and there is a way that we can recognize
wow my mind is really off here
and also being 5 o'clock in the morning
sometimes our faculties are not as sharp
as they could be other times of the day
I speak from personal experience
so that even though when we are reciting the words
of the chanting
and bringing those sentiments to mind publicly
even if we are not necessarily feeling them
sometimes people in the West say
well if I am not feeling it I shouldn't chant it
I shouldn't say it
but it is actually in this way
it is a very helpful device
for us to be able to witness
the habitual patterns of our mind
by being like a mirror that you are holding up
because the mind does not go towards
reverence and joy in the wholesome
at 5 o'clock in the morning
it goes into the kind of primordial
sort of goes into the id territory of
like I hate, I want, I gotta
I want to go back to bed
I hate this Buddhism stuff
I want to sleep
I have it
and so on and so on and so on
so that you are able to
to use the situation
in many many ways
so anyway I thought
before we have our next
our next piece of the morning
and have a sitting period
we could do some of the
evening chanting in English
which you will find on page 9
so we will just
we will do this
as we
do in the format of a normal puja
so I will
move myself around for this
to the blessed one
the lord who fully attained
perfect enlightenment
to the teaching which he expounded so well
and to the blessed ones
disciples who have practised well
to these the Buddha
the Dhamma and the Sangha
we render with offerings
our rightful homage
it is well for us
that the blessed one
having attained liberation
still had compassion
for later generations
may these symbol offerings
be accepted
for our long lasting benefit
and for the happiness
it gives us
the lord
the perfectly enlightened
and blessed one
I render homage to the Buddha
the blessed one
the teaching so completely explained by him
I bow to the Dhamma
the blessed ones
disciples who have practised well
I bow to the Sangha
now let us pay preliminary homage
to the Buddha
noble and perfectly enlightened one
homage to the blessed
noble and perfectly enlightened one
homage to the blessed
noble and perfectly enlightened one
now let us chant a recollection of the Buddha
of the blessed ones
reputation has spread as follows
he the blessed one
is indeed the pure one
the perfectly enlightened one
he is impeccable in conduct and understanding
the accomplished one
the knower of the worlds
he trains perfectly those who wish to be trained
he is teacher of gods and humans
he is awakened holy
so now we'll hop to the recollection of the Dhamma
halfway down page 11
now let us chant the recollection of the Dhamma
he is well expounded by the blessed one
apparent here and now
timeless, encouraging investigation
leading in words
to be experienced individually by the wise
and then to the Sangha, page 13
now let us chant the recollection of the Sangha
they are the blessed ones to cycle
who have practiced well
who have practiced directly
who have practiced insightfully
those who practice with integrity
that is the four pairs
the eight kinds of noble beings
these are the blessed ones, disciples
such ones are worthy of gifts
worthy of hospitality
worthy of offerings
worthy of respect
they give occasion for incomparable goodness
to arise in the world
and then we'll finish with the closing homage, page 15
the Lord, the perfectly enlightened and blessed one
I render homage to the Buddha, the blessed one
the teaching so completely explained by him
I bow to the Dhamma
the blessed ones, disciples
who have practiced well
I bow to the Sangha
