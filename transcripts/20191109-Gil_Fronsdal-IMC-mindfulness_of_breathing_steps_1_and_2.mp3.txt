The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So to begin, something I'm intending to do as we go through the day with mindfulness of breathing
is to try to utilize a little bit of your imagination to support you in meditation.
In a certain kind of way, it's using the imagination to end imagination.
I'm impressed by how much we, many of us, imagine all the time.
Any time you think about the past, you are using some kind of capacity for imagination,
of reconstructing, of having an image, or conceiving something about what the past was like.
Any time we think about the future, there's a similar kind of act of imagination of sorts.
Not necessarily fantasy imagination, but there is an act of imagining what's going to happen.
Some of you who came here today probably had some rudimentary imagining of what it's like to be
sitting here, meditating here today, that probably supported you and probably brought you here.
You kind of thought ahead, what a kind of little bit it would be like.
And then if we're in fantasy, we're imagining, if we're making commentary about what's happening,
chances are that it has some role, connection to how we conceive or imagine things to be.
And even sitting down to meditate, kind of subconsciously almost, there could be an association
with meditation we bring with us that has to do with that association.
It's a little bit of use of imagination.
If you sit down and your association with meditation is like the statue we have here of the Buddha,
and that kind of stillness and uprightness and dignity that the Buddha represents
is supposed to kind of how you think about, you know, subconsciously what it's like to sit here,
a little bit that will be in the background for you sitting here
and maybe creating a little bit of a nice impression of how to be here.
If instead you bring with you the imagination of yourself as a lousy meditator,
I hope no one notices that you're meditating at IMC because you're probably the one person who doesn't know what to do.
That's also imagining an idea that you're constructing that, and even if that's subconscious,
that's kind of a wafting through.
It's kind of conditioning or influencing maybe even how we sit, the confidence which we sit with,
the agitation of the mind and that general feeling of how we are.
So we're already imagining a lot, and it might be possible to consciously engage the imagination
rather than having it operating unconsciously or automatically on its own,
but consciously engage it in a way that the imagination or imagining supports us and helps us and guides us
into being here in our direct experience.
So hopefully I'll offer some very simple ways of doing this through the day that supports these 16 steps.
And with the idea that we're not trying to get you to use your imagination in wildly creative ways,
but rather in rather very simple ways, maybe even nurturing ways, meaningful ways,
that really support you.
You really want to be here in your experience, connected here.
So that's kind of...
And if you want to participate in this little bit of instructions I'll give on the imagination,
I'd encourage you not necessarily take literally what I say as being how you're supposed to do it
if it doesn't work for you, but rather it represents a possibility
and you can reframe it or reshape it for yourself if something that you have works better.
So to begin, to take an upright alert posture,
and you might recall some of these statues, like the ones we have here,
of what it's like to sit confidently in certain dignity and uprightness
with a chest that's maybe a little bit open and certainly not collapsed or pulled in.
And you might gently close your eyes.
And then imagine that you're here at IMC.
You also can imagine what's actually happening.
If your eyes are closed, to recall this room, the sense that there's other meditators here with you,
the room with a large glass window and high ceiling,
then you could imagine or visualize yourself in your spot here in this room,
on your chair or in the cushion.
Perhaps having maybe a visual sense or a sense of yourself that you're here in this place at this time.
You wanted to be here today and now you're here.
And the here is not an incidental time and place.
It is the place.
In Buddhism, it's considered that any place you're meditating is the place.
It's a significant place to be.
This is your place now, sitting where you are.
And then you might take a few long, slow, deep breaths.
Maybe stretching a little bit your ribcage so that when you exhale, you can relax.
Settle into your body.
Stretching, opening, expanding your body as you breathe in.
And steadying yourself in your body as you exhale.
Maybe as you exhale, feel or imagine that the weight of your body is stabilizing itself on your seat or your cushion.
And then letting go of the deeper breathing, breathe normally.
And scan through your body to see if there's any place that you could relax or soften.
Soften around the forehead.
Maybe soften around the eyes.
No need to be actively looking with your eyes when you're meditating.
The eyeballs can rest in the socket.
Perhaps softening the shoulders a bit.
Letting them become heavy so they feel the gentle pull of gravity downward.
Perhaps softening your belly.
And then imagine again that you're sitting here.
Imagine yourself sitting here in your body.
And imagine what it would be like if you sat here and you were content to be sitting here.
Imagine what it would feel like to have a content body, a content heart, content mind.
Or imagine what it would be like to sit here if you felt safe, really safe, cozy.
Maybe even at home, here in your body.
What sensations of your body, what places in your body would you feel if you felt sensations that are associated with being safe or at home or content?
Imagine what it would be like to be this way.
Imagine how those sensations of the body, heart and mind would be a good place for the attention to rest.
Imagine what it would be like to breathe with ease.
To have a kind of ease and well-being at the breathing becomes a harbinger of ease, of peace.
The movements and sensations of breathing in and breathing out are themselves.
Supports for being here, contented, peaceful, at ease.
Imagine what it would be like if your experience of breathing was so full, so enjoyable or so compelling that it was more interesting than any other experience at the moment.
Then take some, take the time to feel your breathing and become familiar with it.
Imagine that all you have to do right now is become attuned to the experience of breathing.
Let's go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And if you find yourself thinking a lot,
relax the thinking muscle, relax any tension or pressure there is to think.
And consider or imagine that you're so much more than you're thinking.
You're larger than the domain of thinking in your direct experience of body and breathing.
In some way, imagine that experience of sitting here breathing encompasses so much more of your lived life here and now.
So of your thoughts in favor of entering into the world of your body breathing.
Okay.
Okay.
Imagine in a sense that you're sitting back in an easy chair and all you need to do is to watch your breathing.
Watch the experience of breathing in and out.
Noticing if your inhales and exhales are relatively short or relatively long and extended.
Whatever way they are is fine.
Settle back and observe the coming and going of inhale and exhale.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Imagine what it's like to be in a very peacefully quiet place.
Maybe you've been to a peaceful quiet place that was so delightful to be in.
And imagine that your mind, your thinking mind can be that quiet.
So that your attention can better experience the breathing.
Almost as if the breathing moves through quiet, peaceful space.
