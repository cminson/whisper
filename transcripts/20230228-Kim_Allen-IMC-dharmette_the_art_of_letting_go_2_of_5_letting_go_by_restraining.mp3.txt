 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. So, this week, we are talking about seven practices that lead to letting go. And we call that letting go is multidimensional. Sometimes we actively engage, sometimes we watch, sometimes we have some agency, but often we don't really control the actual act of letting go. We just do these practices and then the letting go occurs when and how it does. So, a very important way of letting go or factor in the process of letting go is a seeing. That was what we talked about yesterday. And we talked about it in the context of noticing whether wholesome states are increasing or unwholesome states are increasing, and then redirecting what we pay attention to or how we're paying attention, if needed. And we're trying to make sure to support the mind staying in a more wholesome condition. So, this method from yesterday actually weaves through all of the other six methods, because we often have to check if we're moving toward or away from suffering. And this seeing that we talked about first is actually the most fundamental way of letting go. And clear seeing provides the discernment needed for all of the other methods. And we actually didn't completely finish talking about seeing so I'll probably say a little bit more about it on Friday, since it's so fundamental. But for now, we'll move on to some other ways. And the next few that we'll talk about apply in particular domains of experience. So, yesterday I said, you know if it's a glass jar we would open it by turning the cap and if it's an aluminum can we need a can opener and so forth. So, today's method is called restraining. And it comes out of seeing actually if we see that on wholesome states are repeatedly occurring. When we do certain actions, then we might wish to restrain from doing those actions that would help right that would help our mind. And the teachings say that there are cases where we will experience taints, vexation, and fever. If we don't have restraint. And I think we're actually all familiar with what it feels like when we could have had more restraint. Sometimes that can be kind of painful, right. What we're actually restraining is the compulsion that leads the mind down a path toward Dukkha. I don't know why the mind sometimes wants to go toward Dukkha that seems to be one of the problems we inherit as a human being. And so there's this compulsion sometimes. And so we want to restrain that part of the mind that is, you know, running in the wrong direction for our own care right. There are three domains maybe to pay attention to. One would be compulsive actions. So like eating that third piece of pie. And this isn't sort of an obvious one, you know, as we sit there, after the third piece feeling bloated and with an amazing sugar high. We might be experiencing taints, vexation, and fever associated with not having quite enough restraint. So I think in that case, the terminology, we can get a sort of a visceral feeling that. And then of course, there's the area of speech. So I knew someone once who was working on refraining from complaining. And I was impressed that she took this on and over a several week period she tried not to complain either verbally or mentally. And what she discovered, and it wasn't so much whether she was going to succeed 100% or not, because that would be very difficult. But it was like a learning experience you put down the the idea, okay, not going to not going to complain and then see what happens with that, like observe how the mind is. And she discovered that complaining has a compulsive side to it. And she would, you know, come to mindfulness in the middle of complaining sometimes it was afterwards but as she got better at it she would become mindful in the act of complaining in the middle of it. And she would realize she realized that she couldn't stop. And in her words, I chose not to stop because it felt too good in the moment. But afterward, it did not feel good at all. So it's like this with complaining feels so good while we're doing it. I'm going to sock it to that thing that I'm complaining about. And it feels really good for a moment. And then but if there's mindfulness realize doesn't feel so good to put the mind in a state like that. So, there's an interesting practice you know could we will restrain in some way before we put ourselves into that not good feeling like before we have third piece of pie. So, there's an interesting practice I've heard about and used when practicing with restraint in the verbal realm. And it's a, it's an acronym. Wait, W, A, I, T. And it stands for, why am I talking. So I recommend this, you know when the mind is thinking about saying something, you just insert weight, why am I talking, and maybe it's fine, maybe what you're saying is useful or helpful or even compassionate. Maybe it's even fierce compassion our favorite. You know, but maybe not. And so maybe just putting in that question. You might realize whether or not what we're saying something that we really want to say, but really be useful and helpful and contribute to the situation. So then, you know, the third area that we tend to have compulsion. There's actions and speech and then there's also thought, you know, we do have very much I think if you're a meditator you know you have compulsive thought. So the tendency to just keep chewing over a memory or a fear or an anxiety about something. And if we repeatedly think about some topic and get upset. Could we choose to restrain that train of thought, or even at the subtle level of the mind. There can be ways of restraining that. I mean there's lots and lots of them out there so it's another area where we can't talk through all of that but you know there, there's the possibility of switching the mind to something that's what's called an antidote so you know if we are complaining a lot, could we switch to meta some kind of appreciation or gratitude for what for some other aspect of what's going on instead of the part that we're complaining about. Another thing we can do is deliberately reflect on the suffering that comes from such thoughts, you know, we're ruminating on something and if we are stuck in the topic of the rumination the mind is removed from the present moment, actually it's in a concept. And if we actually feel in the body, how, how much suffering there is associated with those thoughts sometimes that's enough with the mind is like, I don't want to. I don't want to be doing that. So, you know, there's a number of ways that we can do this I've mentioned some internal ones, but it's worth mentioning that the Buddha does talk about where ways that there can be external restraints in our life you know we don't have to just sort of knuckle under and take it on as I got to do everything internally. There was the case of a new monk named magia, and the Buddha gave him some suggestions to help settle his mind and stop thinking compulsively, and some of them were external. So the story is probably something that we can relate to. And so, magia was serving for a while as the Buddha's attendant. And so he was hanging out with the Buddha and there came a time when it was meditation time in the afternoon and he said, Can I go meditate by myself in that mango grove. And the Buddha kind of discouraged him and he said, That might not be such a good idea for you, magia, but he, he was really determined and he asked again and again the Buddha said, maybe not. He was really determined and he said no please I'm really devoted I really want to go meditate in the mango grove and so we said all right, what can I do it's about meditation, go for it. And so he went there. And he sat down for the days meditation, if you will, and the sutta says, but while magia was meditating in that mango grove, he was beset. I definitely I find myself empathically about being. I felt Jungins Wake up in my job LA. He just learned this actually by three kinds of unskillful thoughts, namely sensual malicious and cruel thoughts. And then he thought, It's incredible. It's amazing. taken on a spiritual practice of mindfulness and we're sitting down meditating so well. And lo and behold, all these terrible thoughts come. And what I love is that Meghia doesn't say, oh, I'm so bad. He says, it's incredible. It's amazing. How could this happen? So it was sort of genuine wonder. He went back to the Buddha and he said, this is what happened to me. And so then the Buddha took this as an opportunity to teach him. And he said, Meghia, when the heart's release is not ripe, there are things that can help it to ripen. And he names a whole bunch of them, but I'll just name a few. He says, good friends, companions and associates. This is the first thing that can help your heart to ripen. So Sangha, friends, companions, sitting with people, being in a group that's also practicing very supportive for a mind that is harassed. What does it say? Be set. So that sounds like taints, vexation and fever. Be set by difficult thoughts. And then second, he says, one can be ethical, conducting oneself well and associating the suitable people and so forth. And so then there's a way, of course, that is sort of an individual effort, but ethics are relational. So getting people around us who will also be ethical and will help support us in wise speech, in wise actions, this can be very, very helpful. And then also, the Buddha says to Meghia, it's very helpful when a person gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart whenever they want without trouble or difficulty. And then he says more specifically, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, arousing energy, ethics, concentration, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision. So these are lofty Dharma topics, but the chance to talk about the Dharma is also an external support that we can use that restrains the mind from running off into difficult thoughts and restrains us from difficult verbal behavior and actions. So it can be useful to have some good support around us if our mind is in need of restraint in some ways. And then we can see that also how we do the restraining matters. So for example, there's a text where someone is supposed to evaluate whether or not a teacher is good for them. And one thing they're supposed to check is whether it looks like the teacher is restrained without fear, not restrained by fear. So is a person who's leading a group restraining by fear of themselves, or are they making others comply out of fear, or is it a natural kind of internal restraint? So restraint by fear is not what we're looking for. We don't restrain ourselves because we're terrified of the consequences. We restrain ourselves because there's ease. We have a basis of ease. We know that it's more useful that way. In the Dhammapada, there's a chapter that opens with a rather remarkable stanza. It says, if one knew oneself to be precious, one would guard oneself with care. A sage will watch over herself in any part of the night. So we restrain ourselves because we know how valuable we are. We watch over ourselves in a protective way because we matter. Our inner life matters. Our heart matters. So I've noticed that here in the West, it can take some time for people to begin valuing themselves. We may have internalized a lot of criticisms, such that we don't really like ourselves, or we might have learned that it's better to take care of everyone else and not ourselves. But at some point, we have to make our own well-being a real part of the path. And that includes restraining the parts of our behavior, speech, and thought that are unwholesome, because that harms us. So it comes down to our heart, our citta, our heart mind. So we're a little over, so I'll just end with the Buddha says, I do not see even one other thing that when tamed, guarded, protected, and restrained, leads to such great good as the citta, the heart. The citta, when tamed, guarded, protected, and restrained, leads to great good. So this is a healthy, helpful movement. The citta is our emotional center, and it starts out entangled with all kinds of bad habits. It's been kind of beat up. And so then through Dharma practice, we disentangle it, unfold it, and it becomes free. But at the beginning, we have to protect it like a little seedling. And restraining is part of that protecting process. So when we restrain compulsion, it becomes less compulsive, you know, its energy gets weaker. And eventually those habits really don't sway the heart anymore. And so we come happier and lighter. So restraint can lead to letting go and freedom. All right. So thank you.
