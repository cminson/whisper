 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. We need your identity box for this next activity. So if yours is remotely... Yeah, bring it into this room, please. So there will be no assessment of creativity or spiritual development based on the appearance of your box. This is not an exercise in artistic expression. This is purely a vehicle for meeting. So this next session I'm entitling... I love this phrase for someone, meeting the stranger. We're going to do an exercising and look at meeting the stranger. So for most of you who came in here today, the rest of the room has been full of a bunch of strangers, right? I could show up for my shift as a chaplain and meet this many people before lunch. And then if somebody had a large family, there'd be half as many of you that show up at 4.30 when I'm trying to leave at 5. So there's a lot of meeting the stranger in ministry and chaplaincy. We're combining the practice of meeting the stranger with meeting one another and cultivating some connection between us in a way that can hopefully support each of us in having choice about how much people know about us, if there's things that aren't that visible, or how we could be explicit about how we identify in the world and what our social location is or different aspects of the cultures that we hold inside ourselves. It's also an exercise in taking a closer look at like, what is it like to have somebody tell me about themselves, including what happens for me? What is it like for them? What's my sense of them as they talk about themselves? Are they comfortable? Are they excited? Are they daunted? Are they not making eye contact? You know, like, are they cracking jokes? And then what's happening between us? Remember that little demonstration we did earlier? Like, what's the space between us now that I've learned something else about you? So this is kind of a two parter. We're going to break into three groups of five. Along with a faculty member, we're each going to lead the small group through a process of people showing their boxes, the outside and the inside and talking about yourself. And then the second half of the time will be... I just noticed the back doors open and the air conditioning's on, so maybe we could shut the door. I hate to air condition the city of Redwood City. We don't need to be leaving here, I'll do it quickly. Okay, great. I just noticed the two together. And then the second part in your smaller group, each person will be asked to talk about what was it like to meet this person and hear about them, you know? To what degree were you surprised? Had you already made some assumptions? Not in terms of like, can you identify with them or how different do you feel? But just even simpler than that, like what happens for me in relation to you once I kind of get a little bit of an idea of who you are? Does that make sense? Yeah. And then we'll come back to the larger group and do a little more writing about this experience to, again, kind of take on this idea that this is a practice, you know? Meeting the stranger. Is that a sacred activity? Is that a dangerous activity? Is that a heart-opening activity? How does that change depending on circumstance inside of me and around me? Does that make sense? Okay, yeah. We will not be giving feedback to one another again about the quality of your artistic expression. I will not be correcting you in your use of language about however you whatever you share, you know, like aside from egregious derogatory nomenclature, you know, we're going to really just be receiving what people offer and seeing what that's like and not really kind of responding to them directly. Because do you really want to introduce yourself and then get like unpredictable feedback at a time where we're just trying to focus on this really specific thing? Okay. And so what I've done is I've created three general geographic areas. So after this exercise, some of the people in your group may be a part of your small group. So you may get to know some of your small group in this exercise today. It doesn't work out completely cleanly, but close enough. So where would you like to be with your group, Paul? Out there. Okay. And can my group be in here? So I only have to go that far. Where do you want to be with your group? In the parking lot? Okay, great. Super. Really out there. Really out there. And then. Then I can take off our masks. That's right. You could have the deck. Okay. Okay. Now I want to be outside like you guys. The sidewalk. I'll punt. We'll see. We'll get there. Okay. And then Gil, pick a number one, two, or three. Paul, one or three. Okay. So with Gil in the parking lot, Christian Allen, a LL E N Conrad sage and Sharon. Paul.
