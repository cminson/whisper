The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So we're talking about the refrain of the Satipatana Sutta.
And the first line, which we covered somewhat, maybe never complete,
is the line that goes in this way.
One abides observing the body internally, the body in terms of the body internally.
One observes the body in regards to the body externally.
So that's the first line.
The second line is, one abides observing the arising dhamma.
One observes observing the ceasing of dhamma.
One observes the arising and ceasing of dhamma.
And the word dhamma here, dharma, usually in English,
is not 100% sure exactly what this means.
Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it as nature, quality and nature of something.
So observing the nature of arising in the body,
observing the nature of ceasing in the body,
observing the nature of arising and ceasing in the body.
Because the emphasis here is not what the sensation is in and of itself,
but rather the process by which all sensations in the body
have a way in which they appear and disappear.
And as it's tuning into the flow, the changing nature,
the appearing and disappearing, arising and passing,
is what this practice opens up to
when we're able to be centered and stable in the present moment,
when we're able to kind of settle back to abide and observe
without the mind jumping into thoughts,
jumping into concepts and ideas and reactions.
It's just there, very quietly, to observe what's happening.
So another meaning for this word dhamma is just experience.
It's the particular experiences that come in good.
So whatever experience that arises in the body,
we see it as arising.
Whatever experience is past, we see it as passing.
Whatever experience is, both see, arise and pass in the body.
We're observed that.
The third one means arising and passing
is that some things last a very short time.
They just, almost as soon as they arise, they're already passing away,
like a sound of a bell.
It's there, suddenly it appears, but then you're aware of it fading away.
And sometimes that happens quite quickly.
Some sounds like, if I snap my fingers, it both kind of arises,
appears and disappears almost at the same time.
And so as the mind gets more and more still and quiet,
this magic begins appearing.
And that is that all the things that we thought were solid turns out
their solidity is partly a function of perceiving it conceptually,
perceiving it through an idea, maybe subconsciously that way.
Or it seems solid because we're kind of holding onto it,
we're contracted around it.
But as we get deeper and deeper, more relaxed and settled,
and be able to tune into the momentary processes,
we see that even something which remains
in the remaining, it's coming and going, arising and passing.
So like, for example, you might have a constant rustling of the leaves
in the tree, in the wind, and just kind of say,
oh, it's just rustling all the time, it's just constant.
But in fact, the rustling, if you really tune into it,
is a lot of small little rustle sensations of leaves
that are coming and going and coming and going.
But the aggregate we take to be more of a continuous kind of solid thing.
So the same thing with the body.
The aggregate of pain in my knee can seem like solid pain.
But if we can settle enough and quiet enough and just open to the,
and receive the sensations of the pain,
often what happens is that we drop below the aggregate level
to the more particular sensations that make up the total,
and we see that those are sparking and passing away.
There's a dance of sensations all the time,
even in something that felt like it was solid.
And this dance of sensations and coming and goings
begins as we keep practicing, becomes more and more the orientation
of what we are aware of.
This can happen naturally by itself.
It's not like we have to go looking for it.
In fact, to look for it in this kind of way of being too soon
leads to a certain kind of imbalance,
and even imbalance meditation, or challenge meditation.
It's better just let it appear as we get more and more settled
into the practice, more and more here,
and relaxing to the place where we can just abide and observe
in a relaxed way.
But what can help and support this is to know that this is valuable.
Sometimes when people learn mindfulness practice,
they're supposed to always know something,
really go in there and know that's pain, that's tightening,
that's clenching, that's warmth, that's coolness.
And so it's kind of like focusing on the kind of,
I don't know if the concept is the right word here to say,
but on the thing.
But at some point what we're interested in is not the thing,
but to have a deeper intimacy that allows us to see,
to perceive, to sense, to feel,
that whatever thing that's there, whatever dhamma,
is arising and passing, how it's sparking.
And so the word aniccha, A-N-I-C-C-A,
often translated as impermanence,
literally means inconstant, inconstancy.
Because some things are, when we use the word impermanent in English,
some people think it means it's not going to last,
sooner or later it will not be there anymore.
But inconstancy here implies that something can be there,
like the leaves rustling in the wind, is constant,
but the individual pieces of sound are inconstant.
They come and go.
And our breathing, as long as we're alive,
our breathing is constant.
It's not impermanent in a final way until we die,
but it's impermanent or inconstant,
and it's not constantly there.
The breath is inconstant because it yields to the exhale.
The exhale is not constant because it yields to the inhale.
But they appear, they're inconstantly continuously there.
They're inconstantly, continuously reappearing.
And so a lot of what we see in the body is better described,
but it's inconstancy.
We see the inconstancy, the flow, the change, moving.
So at that time when we're able to just rest in that experience,
abide and observe, abide and just sense,
the observing is akin to receptive awareness.
So if the idea of seeing, the observing,
is not quite the right metaphor for you,
there might be some other feeling.
It's the receptive feeling, receptive perceiving.
It's closer to what it is than actively looking.
As we deepen into this kind of world of inconstancy,
it's not even receptive anymore,
because that implies a little bit of a separation from the experience
or duality or being a little bit active, like I'm the one receiving.
It's just things appearing and disappearing without us receiving it
or actively going to it.
It's just flowing in this field of awareness.
And so there's a whole bunch of degrees by which this happens.
Sometimes we just feel hints of it or small degrees.
Sometimes it's very all-pervasive.
But whatever degree it is,
it does represent a movement towards a kind of healthiness in the body
because they contract it and tight
and solid feeling of the body is normal as it is.
It's not necessarily a problem in ordinary life,
maybe even needed in ordinary life.
But it also can be the place where we get
physiologically congested or things get tense or tight or restricted.
And the blood circulation, nerve circulation,
I don't know exactly all the energies that exist in the body,
don't flow as smoothly.
And as we kind of open up to this kind of flowing nature, vibrant nature,
it can feel like the health is flowing through our body.
Even if someone is sick, maybe with incurable disease,
to have access to this level of meditation,
it just feels like this feels healthy.
And whether it actually heals disease, that's a whole other issue.
But it certainly feels good to have this deep relaxation and opening
and probably is good for the immune system and things.
But more important for Buddhism,
it's a stepping stone or it's an opening,
it's a way of being that begins showing us
the potential for freedom in a deep way.
And that will be the topic for tomorrow.
So abiding, observing the body
and its nature, its arising nature in the arising experiences,
abiding, observing the body and its seizing experiences,
abiding, observing the body in the arising and seizing of all these experiences.
So thank you.
I look forward to being here with you tomorrow.
