 Well, this is a real treat for me to be here because although I get down here frequently, can you guys hear me in the back if I start to fade away, make noises or something? Although I get down here relatively frequently for a variety of functions, this is the first time I've been here on a Sunday morning and I'm really pleased to be able to be here with you. When Gil asked me if I would be willing to come down and talk to you guys so that he could have a little bit of time off with his family, it took me about maybe five seconds to realize that what I wanted to talk about was the refuges because the refuges are a fairly noticeable part of the ritual that we find in our practice, in our centers, in our groups, but we often gloss over them and just sort of run by them without thinking a lot about them. So I thought I would just share some of my own contemplations about them and see to what extent that might be helpful to you. The concept of a refuge is interesting. My wife and I used to go when we would take a vacation, we could manage a vacation. You know what it's like, got two professional careers going and maybe you can coordinate a couple weeks a year. We went to Hawaii every year for years and we almost always found ourselves on Molokai because there was almost nothing to do there, at least tourist oriented. And every year we would think, well, we could go someplace exciting. We could go to Europe or Asia or New York. Well, not Los Angeles. But each time we thought of that, it was like, well, if we have to go off and do things and plan things and go look at that, we basically wanted to go someplace to just shut down, to get away from the phones and the crowded, the packed calendars and schedules and all the people wanting this and that and the busyness, the busyness, the busyness. Now it was a refuge. It didn't change anything here, but we were able to get away and we did it year after year after year. One of the things that's interesting on the Big Island, there's a place called the City of Refuge. And even though Hawaii is just beautiful, it's wonderful, the people who lived there before the European shut up seemed to be somewhat more brutal than I would have expected. They didn't have a real graduated scale of punishment so that if you stepped on the shadow of the king, well, that was the death penalty. It just went straight to the easiest thing, unless you could get to the city of refuge. And there were people who lived in this place on the Big Island, on the coast, and if you could make it to the city of refuge, you were safe. The refuge was a place of safety. So the concept of a refuge, you know, the refuges come up and we sort of, we take them, we look to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha for refuge. Sort of a different approach to this than we usually take towards the problems in our life, which is let's fix them. Let's get another job, another apartment, get another roster of elected officials. Let's, you know, more salt on our food, less salt, more carbs, less carbs. I mean, you know, we're going to fix it one way or another. We're going to change things. But the refuge, you know, in a storm, you can't, pretty much can't change the storm. Basically, you look for shelter, for refuge. And so the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, is there any water around here somewhere? The Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha are the refuges for those of us who are practicing on the path of the, thank you, on the path of the Buddha. So I thought I would go through the three of them and just think a little bit about what they mean, what they might mean, and perhaps you'll have some ideas of your own. To look to the Buddha for refuge. What does this mean? You know, each of us has an idea of who the Buddha was or is, what the Buddha is. Each of us have an idea. And, you know, probably there's a lot of overlap and a lot of similarity. You know, when I think of who the Buddha is or how I think of the Buddha, the first thing, just the first thing is that this was a person. So it's a human person, not a god, not some, you know, this was someone who was like us. And that's very important to me because the Buddha as a refuge is an inspiration for our practice. It's the idea that a person could do or become what the Buddha did or became. What kinds of things are those? You know, when the Buddha described himself in a lot of ways, and he's been described in a lot of ways, after his enlightenment, the first person who encountered him was apparently so struck by his demeanor, his presentation. You know, he was, who are you? What are you? And the Buddha's response was, I'm awake. What does that mean for us? You know, for each of us, it may mean a little bit different, something depending on our understanding. He's someone who has overcome greed, hatred and delusion. Someone who has, you know, who's mastered the paramese, the perfections of, you know, from generosity and patience and truthfulness to equanimity, the perfections of being human. I like to think that he's someone who was no longer a slave to the desires that arose, to the extent that they arose within him. No compulsion to act out or repress those things that might arise, free from the compulsion of the desires. And some of this stuff, you know, when you think about it, you think it's a pretty tall order. But the Buddha said, it's possible. It's possible for us as it is for him. He was just a person, you know, and he would say, it's, if it weren't possible to reach freedom, liberation, to achieve this, I wouldn't ask you to do it. But because it is, I urge you to make an effort. Sometimes I think about, you know, whether you'd have to be a mendicant to be a fully awakened being. I mean, if you were a fully awakened being, would you find yourself working as a resource analyst for the Department of Water Resources in Sacramento? I don't know. Is it necessary to, well, you know, for those of us who are still attached to our furniture, you know, does it mean having to give up all that stuff? How does it mean we hold that? I seem to recall Reginald Ray, who was the, is or was the head of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, commenting that if you took some of these, you know, very practiced masters who've been living in caves in Asia for years and who have as many different words for emptiness as Eskimos have for snow. Bring them over here. Give them a wife and a couple kids, a job, a car, mortgage, you know, and the March 2nd ballot. And, you know, how are they going to do? I'm not entirely sure whether you have to be a mendicant, but it's certainly a model, you know, and the model that the monks and the monastics set are a model and an inspiration for us. So the refuge of the Buddha is just the relief of knowing that there is the possibility of freedom, of liberation from samsara, from the torments of our desires, from the ongoing craving, the cravings that are endless, desires are endless, that there is a relief in that. Imagine what it would be like to not think that it would be possible to find relief. You know, my wife has had a chronic illness for some years and takes part in support groups and things for people who share her condition. And one of the things that she finds just stunning is how hard, how much harder it is for people who don't have the dharma in their lives, just, you know, whipsawed between hope and despair, to not just be able to see that the tide's coming in and the tide's coming out. The dharma is a refuge. The dharma is the second of the two refuges, and the dharma is kind of interesting. Dharma is often just referred to as the teachings of the Buddha. You know, we take refuge in the Buddha, we take refuge in the dharma, the teachings of the Buddha. The teachings of the Buddha are, you know, his map of the territory, his description of how things are. It's not a catechism that you have to accept, it's just a description of, you know, our experience and how our lives are. And it also includes a set of instructions, thank God. You know, we sort of need to hear this over and over again, because, you know, in my own experience, Anicha, Dukkha, and Anada, impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self, they're not always comforting, you know. But, you know, you hear them over and over again and you get the idea. The unsatisfactoriness of our experience, if satisfaction is an issue for you, our experience is going to be unsatisfactory. First noble truth. You know, the four noble truths are sometimes taken as beginner's dharma, but really, Aikema used to say, everything besides, everything after the four noble truths is excess dharma. Really, you get, it's all there in the four noble truths, in the just recognizing the unsatisfactoriness of experience, if satisfaction is an issue. We sort of don't want to hear it, but we can get reminded of it. And of course, the notion that the cause of that unsatisfactoriness is our desire for things to be different than they are, for things to be different. But the third noble truth, that relief is possible, that there is a cessation that's possible. Again, what a relief. And of course, there's the eightfold path, which is the set of instructions. So I like to think that the dharma is not just, you know, the teachings of the Buddha, it's not just that shelf full of the Pali Canon. It's not just, you know, or the Pali Canon, but now it's like, excuse me, it's libraries full of books and writings and dharma books of one form or another. And it's not just that stuff on the shelves. The dharma, the dharma appears in practice, it manifests in our practice. And the understanding, you know, in the eightfold path, and the understanding of the realities of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not-self. That can be very liberating, it can be very freeing. We had a death in our sangha recently, and we had a ceremony and lots of remembrances, and a lot of people talked about how hard it was not to be attached, and how difficult it was. And at a certain point in the conversation, what surfaced was, you know, our lives are impermanent. And it's not so much as struggling against attachment, fighting that attachment, or trying to, you know, somehow be indifferent to the sadness, but to just recognize the impermanence, which just knowing that it's impermanent going in was a relief for us, and to know that we're all impermanent, and to be able to look at each other to see that. Just that understanding is freeing, because you can struggle, you know, I should be unattached, I'm too attached, I'm less attached, you know. But just to recognize, so just the understanding, the right understanding is liberating. And of course, the practice itself, the elements of the path, right speech, action, and livelihood, the restraint on our behavior is liberating as well, because the tendency for us to want to fix things, and to, you know, act out on our desires for things to be different, and to make things the way we think, we all think, things would be better if we were running the show, right? I mean, we all sort of know how it ought to be, and if we were just in charge, and acting out on those desires, boy, you know, it doesn't usually, I like to think of myself fondly as a slow learner. You know, I'm still doing it, it doesn't matter how many years I've heard that, but practicing, you know, finding refuge in the presets, what a relief, to just write off certain kinds of behavior, just, okay, just write it off, what a relief, to not struggle with it, not struggle with how to behave, I mean, the idea is to maintain a, is it two social sciences, it's a behavior set, I've got a social sciences background, maintain a behavior set that doesn't add to the suffering of the world. It's a relief, it's a refuge to find the presets, and to at least have some guidance as to how to not botch things up, that doesn't mean that, wow, here we go again, but to know that it's there, and of course our meditation practice, which is also a refuge, I mean, sitting is wonderful, sometimes. But, you know, when you actually land on your breath, you know, that, wow, still there. So the practice of the Dharma is what manifests the Dharma. So refuge in the Dharma is refuge in our practice, hearing the Dharma again and again, and having our understanding grow, and then managing our behavior and our meditation practice within, within the range of our understanding. So we find refuge in the Buddha, and knowing that liberation is possible, knowing that it's possible to be free from the cradles, because the Buddha said, and he was like us. And to have his map, you know, as uncomfortable as the map may be at times, and the instruction sheet, find refuge in our practice. And then, refuge in the Sangha. You know, the Sangha is interesting, there's a little place in the Sudha Napada where the Ananda turns to the Buddha. I sort of imagine that they're sort of sitting there, okay, I've conjured up a big vision, but you know, they're sort of sitting there and they're looking out over the hundreds or thousands of monks amassed. And Ananda says to the Buddha, actually, I'm not quite sure how he addressed him, probably didn't, probably said, no, this isn't bad, this community life, this Sangha, this has got to be half the holy life. And the Buddha is reported to have said, well, don't say so, Ananda, it's not half the holy life, it's all of the holy life. And that's usually what's, that's usually as much as gets reported. You know, it's usually, in fact, you see it in quotes, you know, Sangha is all of the holy life. The Buddha went on, I mean, he didn't stop there, he said, the reason that it's all of the holy life is because it's in the Sangha that we find the support for the practice of the Eightfold Path. So it's not just, you know, fellowship, it's not just hanging out together and being buddies with other people who own copies of the Maja Manakaya, or at least have a copy of Gil's book. It's the venue in which awakening occurs. Now, it's in the Sangha that we hear about the Buddha and the Dharma. Now, there are lots of, there are a lot of different definitions of Sangha. You know, if you, there's a retreat that I go on every summer up at Vajrapani, which is a Tibetan monastery up in the Santa Cruz Mountains. And when you walk by the, you know, the food bar, there's a little sign at the front that says, out of courtesy, we serve Sangha first. And, you know, in this sense, Sangha refers to the people in robes, the people, the monastics. And there's a tradition in Buddhism that Sangha means the monastics. And, you know, you'll run into some people who say, well, if you're not a monk, it's the monks and the nuns. That's who Sangha is. And then the rest of us sort of are, what, Sangha wannabes? And then there's people who say, well, no, you know, the definition that you like about Sangha depends on all kinds of things, statements you want to say about practice and statements about who you are and all that kind of stuff. There's people who say, well, you know, if you're really committed and you're practicing the five precepts, or maybe even eight of them, and you've got a regular practice every day and you're committed to periodic retreat, well, then you're Sangha. Or maybe some people want to say, well, you know, Sangha is, you know, I meditate to some and I come to our gathering once a week and I hang out with people and we talk about, or maybe it's someone who read a book, you know, and thinks, yeah, I sort of go along with it. Maybe I'm Sangha, you know, or if you're up in Alaska in a cabin and all you've got is the polycannon. Have you got a, I mean, is there Sangha there? Maybe I have a little bit too much social science in my background, but I sort of think of Sangha as the culture of awakening. You know, it's the culture that supports our awakening. So it includes not just us here, it's not just the people who are here. Sometimes the word Sangha, you know, when people quibble over who is Sangha or what is Sangha, they're talking about which people do we count, who's in and who's out. But, you know, if I see it as culture, it's not just who is and who isn't, because sometimes the who can be doing things that aren't so supportive. And it also includes, you know, the rituals, the traditions, it includes the books, it includes the artwork and the artifacts, the things that remind us of awakening, that awakening is possible. You know, the Dharma talks, the oral tradition, the culture of awakening. And then we get away from issues like, you know, is engaged Buddhism about Buddhists who are engaged or is it about Buddhism that's, you know, I mean, you know, who do we count as what. But it's the culture of awakening. So for us, you know, it's each other. I mean, we're supporting each other. Sometimes it's hard to realize how much that support counts. You know, I have been leaving half day sittings in Davis for years. And most of the time we've got, it's a, Davis has a small song, it's this wonderful large room with a lot of people. Yesterday we had, there were half a dozen of us that were sitting for a half day. And over the years, you know, sometimes we have more, sometimes we have less. There have been a couple of times when I would show up and I would be the only person there. Boy, is it hard to sit for the whole time, sit and walk and sit. And then it comes time for the Dharma talk. That's usually, you know, I chuckle to myself. I actually should have given one one time because that would be a great story, but I'd never have. Usually at that point I say, well, you know, okay. But one other person, one other person, and it's easy, one other person, and we sit there for, even if, even if we agreed that neither one of us wants to hear me rattle on for 10 or 15 minutes. Just one other person. And so we support each other. So the refuge here, you know, refuge in those who support our practice, those who support my practice. What a refuge. Because without each other, without the culture that we've got, look at the culture, we have a Sunday morning where we get together and we can listen to some talk about the Dharma. We can plan some things together. We can enjoy each other. Personally, we can also cultivate our understanding of awakening, support our practice. So the refuge, the refuges, the refuge in the Buddha, in the Dharma, in the Sangha, are the refuge in the knowledge that liberation, that freedom is a possibility for us. It's not just for somebody off in a cave somewhere or someone in the past. It's a possibility for us to refuge in our practice, in the practice that grows. I mean, it's not the same practice we've got now that we had before. You know, it's a practice. It's like practicing the piano. It's not like you sit down, you know. I always think of that joke about the guy who says, Doctor, after the surgery, can I be able to play the piano? And he says, sure, great, because I can't now. It's something that we cultivate over time. Our practice grows. And there's refuge in the practice. There's relief in our practice, in our understanding, in the precepts that we practice, to the extent that we practice them. And in our meditation practice, in our metta practice. And refuge in everyone who supports our practice and in everything that supports our practice. Now taking refuge or looking to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha for refuge is one of the rituals that, you know, we've done this before. We do it before and we've done it before and we'll do it again. And in an interesting way, it's like, you know, it's not like you take refuge once and then it's done. It's like finding your breath once and saying, oh, I found it. And then figuring that's it. It's the practice of coming back to it and revisiting the refuges. The same way that we re-attend to our breath is the practice. There is the coming back part over and over again. So it's the re-establishing our connection with our tradition, with our practice, with our tradition. Now, affirming the refuges, recognizing the refuges is a way of stepping onto the path of the Buddha. But we come back to it over and over again. Joseph Goldstein says, being mindful isn't hard. Remembering to be mindful is hard. Taking refuge isn't hard. It's remembering that it's there. And so we do this as a ritual, a repetitive thing. It may be one of the most common of the rituals that we take. I'm not sure there's anything else that's more common than taking refuge. So what I would like to do is to end here with an opportunity for us to chant the refuges in Pali. Many of you know these and can chant along. And for those of you who are not familiar with the Pali form of the refuges, just to listen to how this is done and what it sounds like. This is probably the most common Pali chant. To reaffirm that we're looking to the Buddha for refuge, we're looking to the Dharma and to the Sangha. So we'll start with the Nāmā dāsa and we'll go through the refuges. Just for those of you who are familiar, please feel free to join. Nāmā dāsa, bhāgavato, arhato, samā, sambuddhasa, bhūdham sāranam gāchāmī, dhamam sāranam gāchāmī, dhamam sāranam gāchāmī, dhamam sāranam gāchāmī, dhamam sāranam gāchāmī, dhamam sāranam gāchāmī, bhūdham pīsangaam sāranam gāchāmī, tatyam pīsbuddham sāranam gāchāmī, tatyam pīsdhamam sāranam gāchāmī, Thank you very much. My only instruction is that no matter what I say or how far a field I wander, I have to stop at 11. So we have some time if there's anyone who has comments or additions or questions or anything about the presentation, please. My understanding is that some of the first definitions of the sambhura were people who were enlightened for various ages of enlightenment. And the theory of sambhura said that if you were pursuing a path to enlightenment, you'd want to hang out with no people who have been there for an idea. Mm-hmm. There have arisen a lot of different definitions of sambhura, and it's sort of like the platonic ideal type. We sort of have come to think that there really is some ideal type somewhere. And that is certainly one understanding of sangha, but it's like, you know what I mean about the ideal types, right? The right-angle triangle, what you draw on a blackboard isn't the idea. And there's this sense that it's permanent, that it's the ideal, that it really is there, even though it wasn't there 10 seconds ago. Anyway, but there are a lot of definitions of sangha, and they function in different ways. Please. For those of us who have felt that sambhura, who could be honest with that champion? Ah. The first phrase basically is an homage to the awakened, the self-awakened one. I mean, we're all working with an instruction sheet. Buddha had to do it on his own. The verses that are repetitive are basically buddham, saranam, gacchami. I look to the Buddha for refuge. I look to the Dharma for refuge. I look to the sangha for refuge. And that phrase that is repeated three times. Right? I thought you might be talking about the ceremony of seeking refuge. How is that different from, you know, just this champion of the refuge? Well, it's different. But in my understanding, the affirming the Buddha, Dharma and sangha as a refuge is a practice. So it can be done as a large-scale ritual, or it can be done as a personal kind of thing. It's like taking the precepts. The first time I took the precepts formally was with Thich Nhat Hanh. In a large group, there were 500 people. I'm full prostrations. You know, we did each one, and he did a little lecture on each one, and then we did full. Or you can just affirm the precepts. So it's the same practice. It's just a slightly different venue, different trappings. It's all part of the culture of awakening in that sense.
