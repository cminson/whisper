The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, so hello, hello and welcome again to Happy Hour. Wonderful to be with you and
practicing together. So, so for today's practice, there are two themes I like to
bring in and invite us to work with. One is that it's Friday, it's kind of the end
of the week, and also for some it's Saturday, those joining from, from
different time zones. I acknowledge that it's kind of the end of the week,
perhaps, or this way of bringing in some silence, some quiet, some rest, some,
some nourishment. And that theme together with another theme that actually they
can really go together. And that is the theme that I've been sitting with and
exploring because some of you know, and actually you signed up, I'm teaching a
course starting in less than two weeks called befriending mortality, befriending
mortality. And actually, I might as well tell you where that is for those who
might be curious, it might be piqued, it's could be find on Insight, Insight as
an insight meditation, insight practice. So it's insight.podia, podia.com. There's
all kinds of information there about it. Anyway. So Insight.podia, sorry, I
meant to say is the befriending mortality. So, so befriending mortality, this
perspective of, of the arc of our life, the arc of our life looking, and this is
a theme we worked with in last week also, which is worth a little meta from this
perspective, from this perspective of looking at our lives for this being who
is us, this being who has done their best, hopefully with no regrets at that
point, maybe there are some, but the sense of meta, the sense of love, the sense
of acceptance of all there is goodness, challenges, regrets, difficulty, just the
sense of complete acceptance and love, as if our inner Buddha, our inner
compassion itself is getting supercharged and really is taking on, we're taking on
that perspective of looking at our lives with, with sense of freedom, sense of
peace, sense of letting go and sense of ultimate love, complete love and
acceptance for ourselves, for all the mistakes we made for all the shortcomings,
all the quirks we had, and all the goodness, also all the goodness we
brought, as well as all the interactions, all the interactions, all the interactions.
So, so that is the theme, that is the theme for our practice tonight, and you
think about, if there is more I want to say about it, yeah, I see there is a
question about the course coming, I'll answer that later, Marianne, I see that
coming through, but in terms of our practice in this moment, to stay with,
to stay with, to stay with the sense of meta, this perspective, whether you're
new to happy hour, or you experience whatever you need to know, whatever you
need for this practice, for this guided meditation, I will share with you, I will
share with you, so relax, let go, enjoy the ride, and whatever rises, it's the
right thing that needs to arise, if sadness grief arises, if joy arises, if
freedom arises, whatever rises, trust that that's the right thing that needs to
arise right now, and as long as you hold it with compassion, as long as you hold
it with love, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, as long as you don't push it away as
a mistake, as long as you love it, you may not like it, but as long as you love
it, you're doing the practice perfectly right, there's no wrong here, there's no
wrong, okay, so with those invitations, I'd like to invite you to settle, settle in
your body, arrive, arrive here in this moment, this life, this being, here, this
body, landing, landing in this body, as always we arrive, we connect with
ourselves, letting the body be seated or lying down, feeling your feet on the
floor, grounded, to the earth, sit bones, hugging the earth, landing on the cushion,
your hands relaxed, soft, spread on your lap or touching each other, your neck and
shoulders, ah, letting go of any tightness or tension.
I'm noticing this breath.
It's amazing, lovely breath, morning breeze, fresh with possibility, giving
life, moving through your body, through your lungs, the lower abdomen.
You're doing the right thing, you're doing the right thing, you're doing the right
thing.
Letting go in this moment releasing, of course there are thoughts, memories, plans,
agitations, it's okay, it's okay, it's what this mind does, no judgment, no
judgment, releasing, releasing, ah here, so delicious just to be
here, taking a moment of refuge, quiet silence, this Friday, Saturday, whatever
moment in time, this precious moment in time has never been and will never
repeat, I am here, I am, I am, I am here, I am, so simple yet so profound.
I am here, now.
This may not always be true, but it is in this moment, I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now.
I am here, now, in this moment.
This will not always be true, but in this moment, I am.
Can I deeply connect and appreciate gratitude, taking refuge, just presence, the magnificence,
the mystery of presence, and I am, I am, I am, here, right now, I am, now.
Wow.
Thoughts arise, planning, let that go, release, just be here, simple.
Let's be here, I am in this moment, not complicated, not what if I'm not, just I am, simple.
See the magnificence and the simplicity of not thinking, just being, connecting with I am, here.
Free the incredible to just be, to exist, to be conscious and aware.
I am.
Not I am sad, I am good, I am bad, I am worthy, I'm just, I am, just amazing, amazingness
of I am, here, now.
I'd like to invite us from this perspective, connecting with the amazingness of just being,
being here, now, existing, at this moment.
What if this were the last moment of our lives, I'm taking the perspective of, oh, this precious, beautiful, amazing being who did his or her their best.
Letting there be sense of love, tenderness, even heartbreak for this being who was you, is you.
Without any judgment, from the perspective of your inner buddha nature, your inner buddha, your inner karnyana, just loving.
This being who walked this earth at times, jumped with joy, with love, with care, sometimes
crawled with sadness, with pain, sometimes was alone and lonely, sometimes was connected, interconnected with loved ones, friends, family, was touched and touched many lives.
Of course, everyone of us has everyone.
Loving, loving this being who is me, who was me, unconditionally.
As much forgiveness as possible, they did their best if they could have done better given all the causes and conditions they would have.
This being who walked this earth at times, they did their best if they could have done better given all the causes and conditions they would have.
Here we just open up to love.
From the perspective of a compassionate, compassionate inner Buddha, inner divinity, just love, just
held in love, and if there are areas in life that perhaps call for more love, more care,
more forgiveness, see what's needed right now, both for yourself and other beings you
are entangled with.
You can also just choose the time of this being who is you, and a vulnerable time, the
challenging time to just love, to just love this being, and recognize
the goodness of having hung in there, so recognizing the goodness, the beauty, and
offering love.

There's only one of you in the world who has ever been and will ever be.
You are unique.
You have this unique being with this particularity.
It's to express.
It's amazing, deep potential to care, to love, and for wisdom.
Thank you for watching.
You still can, you still can.
Time is short and you have time.
We are all beings everywhere.
Wake up, know capacity, the magnificence of their goodness, their buddha nature.
We are all beings including ourselves.
Know how precious and limited our time, our precious human birth is.
And may we use it wisely and compassionately.
Thank you, thank you dear Sangha, for your practice showing up.
Mark, I see your hand shut up, please.
Many times I'm completely out of sync with what you're talking about, and sometimes like tonight I'm totally in sync with it.
Early this week I was watching a TV program and there was a song playing in the background for just a couple minutes about a little girl and her made up little world with a little house where she fed her guests bark and leaves and it went on.
And I was intrigued and so I looked up the song afterwards and I found it on YouTube and I played about half a dozen versions of it and went to bed and I woke up the next morning, this is a few days ago, just feeling that I had lived, I was satisfied with my life.
I had done all that, that I needed to do, I was ready.
I died this afternoon.
That was absolutely fine.
There was no problem.
I, you know, I certainly had made loads of mistakes and it all wasn't perfect perfection, but it was.
I was happy with this life and it was enough. I was satisfied and I was ready to go.
And in case anyone else would want to know, I'll put the link to the song in the chat.
Thank you, Mark. Thank you so much for sharing that beautiful reflection part of your practice. Thank you.
Thank you for the benefit of all sun gone beings. And yes, please do share it in chat. Actually, I need to change the setting so everyone can see it.
And also, please share it if you like in the Google groups. Thank you, Mark.
Yeah, Claire, please.
Thank you, Nicky.
I raised my hand because this is such a beautiful coincidence.
I was on the phone about two hours ago with a friend who had had a serious accident.
We were talking about her medical needs and so forth and then somehow we got onto the subject of death.
And, you know, if she had, how seriously she had injured herself.
And the thing that I shared, you know, so this was, you know, just to follow on to that conversation.
But what I shared with her at the time is that I have had a near death experience.
And it was, it was really, it changed me forever in terms of the way I live my life, the way I see myself.
And the gratitude I feel for having had the life that I've had.
You know, as I lay on the stretcher, I thought, you know, it doesn't really matter now.
I, as the previous speaker just said, I haven't done everything I wanted to do. I haven't done it all very well.
But I've had a chance and I've tried hard and I will, you know, always be grateful.
And I'm no longer afraid of death because I was able to look at it and say, it's okay.
Whatever happens, it's just fine with me.
And so there you go.
Thank you, Claire. Thank you also for sharing your sense of ease and freedom with the inevitable.
It's just part of life, death. And also the profound shift that near-death experience has had.
In fact, I was looking at some studies on, it's called post-traumatic growth.
And one thing that happens after some such traumatic experiences,
the post-traumatic growth is one's priorities shift the way one shows up.
One's actually lives more fully and more completely.
And yeah, there's a lot of research on post-traumatic growth.
So thank you, Claire, for sharing your insights, your experience live really first-hand.
Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.
Any other reflections you can share? Oh, yes. And now I can come back.
So you can share your reflections if they're privately sent to me.
I won't read your name. If they're to everyone, I'll read your reflections and your name.
And there was a question about the course that I had mentioned, befriending mortality.
One person had asked that they have too many conflicts and work conflicts on Wednesdays,
for the four Wednesdays on their courses starting January 26th,
whether it's possible or appropriate to sign up and listen to the sessions after they're recorded.
That is okay. We're allowing that option because it's not just listening to the recordings,
but they're also homeworks and the reflections and the participation in that way with the Sangha online
through writings and reflections and sharing that you're more than welcome to participate
in even if it's not possible to be in all of the live sessions in real time.
Jerry says sometimes ego gets in the way of accepting death and then one gets lost.
Absolutely. Of course, that is so natural and normal. Of course, it is.
If it wasn't, if it were easy, it wouldn't be a practice. It would just, it would be perfect.
We would just have it all, we would all have it, whereas there was so much about ego.
It's so hard for the ego to contemplate its own demise.
Hence, terror, management, theory and psychology. Anyway, there's so much I can say about this,
I'll save all of that for the course anyway.
Any other reflections from the meditation tonight before we turn to small groups?
Any, any like to share? One private share, very powerful happy hour.
Thank you, Sangha. And thank you to you. Thank you for your practice.
Yeah. Yeah, it was a powerful one for me also. Really powerful ones.
So many different aspects to the guidance tonight and especially at the end when I invited you
to realize, oh, I still have time. I still can show up with love, with forgiveness.
For me, I felt this burst of energy and determination, gumption, brightness.
Yes, I'm still here. I won't always be. And yet what precious agency, how precious.
So dear ones, how about we turn, how about we turn our attention at this point to
practicing in small groups in, in size of roughly three.
And, and the invitation is to start with about 15 seconds of silence.
And then here we are, these beautiful, amazing, impermanent beings.
And whatever you like to share to support others practice your own practice as little or as much as you like to share, you are welcome.
So be kind to yourself, be kind to each other. This is where the practice really the rubber meets the road in these small groups.
So, so okay, so I'm going to open the rooms and here we go. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other.
Okay, we're closed. So we have a couple of minutes for any reflections that might have come up from the practice from speaking with each other that can be of benefit to yourself to be held witness or for the sangha.
Any questions, confusions, aha moments, it's all good.
So, since your sangha, what would be helpful to bring up the share really close.
Greg, please.
I was just sharing with the other folks that I had the curious experience of finding myself in an ER and being a young buck trying to sort of get up and then being told by the attending physicians that they may not be able to save me.
As in don't move. Don't be a don't be a young buck. We don't know if you're going to survive. So don't try and make any movement at all. And it was just curious how absolutely sort of the average no trumpets were playing no angels descended.
It's just this sort of averageness of this existence and I have to say, it inspired a real curiosity about whether that was like a normal and average or a desirable reaction to the core existential challenge to me as a little old person.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Thanks for bringing that up and I so appreciate how you are sitting with that, not taking it as good or bad, but as oh interesting.
This is one experience that showed up out of so many different experience that could have possibly showed up in that moment. Well, this is the one that showed up.
And I'm curious, oh what, how, feeling into that what does that feel like what does that say what is just exploring it a little more and and be curious for it to continue perhaps to continue to open up.
Thank you, Greg.
And Rachel, I see your hand please.
Hi, Nikki. I was in your Marana Sati retreat a few years ago.
And I just signed up for your course also. So I'm looking forward to that.
I'm not sure if it's a question or just an observation but do you know how there's this concept of worse almost practicing for our death in a sense right where we're working with being comfortable in the moment and and being able to tolerate you know uncertainty and all of that.
And lately, I've been, I've been doing a lot of meta practice a lot and a lot towards myself and others. And I've been thinking backwards in time. And I don't know if there's a, is there sort of a parallel teaching in Buddhism that we're not just practicing for our death but we can actually send
Meta back to our younger selves because that's what I've started doing and it seems like it's really helping.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, beautiful. That's, that's great. Keep doing that. It's what, what, what lights me up is when I hear that, ah, I'm doing that and it's helping.
It's helping. Like, wow, this is working. This is helping. So yes, trust even, even before I turn into the Buddhist, you know, the Buddha said on his deathbed, which again, talking about death and your clear important message, be a light unto yourself.
Be a light unto yourself. And what I'm hearing Rachel is like, is that when you're light unto yourself, like, yes, this is working. This is helping. This is opening something up for my humanity, for my being, the way I'm loving and showing up.
So absolutely, yes, keep, this is beautiful. Please keep practicing in this way. And yes, I can, you know, talk about, you know, practices, etc. So I think I'll just leave it at that. So yes, keep doing. This is great.
All right. Thanks so much for sharing that. Lovely. Yeah. And we close with this last reflection in chat from Soy Min. I was thinking about the experience of moments, fear I've had, the habit of being kind to others and ourselves.
I feel it would help in being kind and calming ourselves in those moments. Yes, absolutely. Very much so. The metta is an antidote to fear, especially in those moments of challenge being afraid and being kind to ourselves and others.
Yeah, another beautiful insight. So thank you all. Thank you for showing up. Thank you for your practice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Deep bows to each and every one of you for your beautiful practice.
May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you. And now I...
