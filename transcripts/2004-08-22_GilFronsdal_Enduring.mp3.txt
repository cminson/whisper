 Just before the bell rang, my mind wondered, just in time. And it wondered too if I was gonna give a talk and I had a topic in mind and I thought that maybe the perhaps kind of a theme of the talk or kind of the background of a talk is the question of when to be silent. A lot of people are interested in right speech and when to speak and how to speak but it's also the question of when not to speak, when to be silent. And there are certainly times when the impulse to speak can be quite strong and maybe it's inappropriate to say what needs to be said. So I'm gonna do this today is gonna read a story or tell you a story from the time of the Buddha as part of your reflection on the question of when to be silent. And before that I'll tell you a story, personal story, of a good number of years ago now I went with a group of people up to Abhayagiri, the monastery that Ajahn Amrul, Ajahn Pasanno are the co-abits of. It's a Thai forest monastery and the monks live there and we were going up in the morning and they basically have one meal a day the monks do around 10 o'clock 11 o'clock in the morning and it's often the custom for lay people when they go to a traditional monastery especially when they come before lunchtime is you bring an offering of food. And so the group of us are growing up there and and we all did our various preparations at home and gathered together and carpooled up there in various cars and a lot of people had brought meals food different dishes for that particular meal we were going on a Saturday. And my reflections before going was oh well a lot of people visit the monasteries on the weekends but they get very few visitors on the weekdays and so they can get a lot of food on the weekends but perhaps it'd be good if I brought some dry goods and different kinds of food they could use and have in the kitchen and so they can feed the monks there during the weekdays later. So I got several bags or get to how much but I got quite a bit of you know dry goods that they could use and when I got there in the monastery I was very happy to offer that to the kitchen and as I hear this is for the monastery to use whenever you see fit. And my friends bought all these wonderful dishes you know casseroles and stuff and I didn't think about it again until we all got ready for the meal served to be served. And the way they serve the meal we all kind of sat around edges of a room and those who are the monks they sat kind of along one edge and the monks get served first so the people came out of the kitchen with the different dishes and they would offer to the abbot and he would take some he'd pass it and next monk would take it down the line and then eventually come to us and we would take what we needed from that casserole. So a number of things came through. Well just before when the kitchen came with the dish and was gonna bring it to the abbot they announced who had offered it. And I came very clear to me very quickly that all my friends were gonna have their names announced that they were so generous and wonderful and thoughtful they brought food and my name was not going to be spoken because I didn't bring anything for that meal I brought lots of stuff for future meals and I sat there in the corner of the room but me but me but me you know I brought things too you know and it was funny it was funny to watch my mind you know the concern about how I was seen by others and concern to get credit and that I should also be someone who's important or you know a generous person to be seen that way and and it wasn't enough just for me to know that I was being generous in my own heart but you know it was important to be seen that way especially in relationship to my friends who were being seen that way right so I kept my tongue until today and then I could tell you make up for it. So I think the wise thing to do in that situation was to have been silent there was no need for me to get credit for what I'd done look for credit just I did a nice thing and I didn't think I didn't need to get credit for what I did and the fact that maybe I looked a little bit you know odd in relationship to my friends who were so generous do I need to kind of you know it's okay people if they want to look at me as being odd for that reason you know I mean I didn't have to defend myself or build myself up and so I just kept quiet and then there are circumstances where maybe I found myself where someone came along and basically was critical kind of kind of coming along and pushing and pushing and kind of going to criticize and point out what's wrong and right and I'm right or you're wrong and all that and and ten twenty thirty years ago I think I would have pulled into that conversation and still sometimes I am more than I need to be but I think I'm much quicker now to you know some when it's appropriate or interesting or useful to get involved in that kind of conversation just not to get involved oh that's interesting what you say or or just kind of change the topic you know I don't know you know that we don't talk about that or just be silent or then there's a silence that I sometimes wonder about when I feel like I want to complain about something what's good does my complaining have serve anything you know I see my wife sitting there in the kitchen and she's not doing any particular it's a great time to complain and you know and so I see this kind of thing bubbling up my mind this you know and it's not gonna serve anybody any good to me to complain is that complaint is not about anything particularly interesting or I can change anything it's just that something's not things are not happening according to my preferences and in fact complaining would probably just you know not create a particularly good mood in my family in my house and so I could see the complaint go to my mind and that's interesting and I think it's better to be silent no need to say it and there are times occasionally times when I feel the complaint arising and it's not just a kind of a thing drifting to my mind it's easy to let go of but there's an impulse behind it like it seems and it takes a little bit more attention to know oh does this need to be said or can I just let it go don't eat I don't need to complain it serves no purposes so that is a background I'll tell you the story from the time of the Buddha in the time of the Buddha there were various groups of renunciants of wonders of contemplatives of different traditions who are wandering around India and some of them were in the order or the tradition of the Buddha people he'd ordained and then there were other traditions also the Jains had their order and they're running around and different kind of orders wandering around and they basically followed this more or less the same lifestyle where they were living as simple mendicants had very few possessions they wandered around India often with a begging bowl often wearing some kind of robes or maybe sometimes naked still in India you can find people all kinds of renunciants walking around and back then they'd walk around and it seems that back then as today people in India were quite or not were quite willing willing enough to feed take care of renunciants these contemplatives and so they would offer them food and so you could be you could devote your life to contemplation to the spiritual life because local villagers and townsfolk would feed you every day and and therefore you could you could get by and if you needed medicines they could often give you medicines or if there is shelter needed sometimes they provide you a little bit of shelter but your basic needs were taken care of and this still happens in India today it's quite a wonderful tradition and there are people who go to India who don't know any English any any any Hindi or any Indian language Chinese monks Japanese monks and Westerners who go and they continue in that kind of a they put on renunciation garb and they wander around and they sit up by in the morning they sit under a tree or something and people will come along and feed them you don't have to speak the same language because people basically know the system and know you take care of renunciants and so there are these different traditions wandering around the Buddha once was staying right outside the town of Sabati Saravasti I think and with a group of monks and they would go into town every day to get their requisites their food and medicine and things they needed and it seems that the townsfolk preferred the Buddhist groups and so some of the other wonders got a little bit jealous of what was being offered to the Buddhists and they wanted more for themselves they wanted to get more of the support from their local people maybe also praise because the Buddhists were being praised a lot for their lifestyle and teachings or whatever and so another one of these groups came up with a scheme and their scheme was a they called upon one of the women who renunciants in their tradition and none in their tradition named Sundari and Sundari means beautiful as I understand and so it helps the story if you kind of imagine and she was quite beautiful not required but maybe it helps and and so they called upon her and said we like to ask you a favor and she says oh for my fellow monastics in my tradition I'm happy to do whatever you'd like you know I would even give up you know my life for you she said something like that and so they said well what we what we would like you to do is every day to go and hang out in that woods over there where the Buddha and his fellow monastics live hang out they just go to hang out there and make sure you go kind of on public days when a lot of people come and just show that you know that you're there and hanging out and it's obvious so she doesn't quite understand but she's an easy thing for her to do and so she hangs out there and and you know it's there for several weeks or several months it goes regularly and it gets known that she's always frequenting the Buddhist in the woods there in the forest where the Buddhist lives and and then after some time the her her compatriots call upon her and say well thank you very much for all your services and we have one more thing to ask you to do and we'd like to meet you this evening in the woods there and one of our monks will follow you there so you feel safe and and you'll go back into the woods and so they took her at night when everyone was sleeping I guess and back into the woods and and then they killed her and then they buried her in the woods there so someone who done them a favor right awful story so then the next morning these this these group of murders monastic murders went to the king of the town king of this called passadi and said oh our wonderful nun passadi sundari is missing will you help us look for her it's very unusual that you should be gone and the king said you have any idea where she might have gone I wish it might be they said oh it's been noticed that she's been spending a lot of time in the woods where the Buddha is in his fellow monks so all your what you go look there says the king so they get together a group of people it's like they have a warrant then right the king said go there look so they get a group of people together and they go out into the woods where the Buddha is and they go searching around until they come to this little shallow grave and they dig it up of course they found them because they put it there and so they they dig up the body and they say oh they can pick up the body and they carry it back into the city saying out loud to everyone who could hear oh look what these Buddhist monks do these terrible Buddhist monks you know this beautiful woman you know here they hear how could a man I don't know what the wording of it but this is something like how could a man sleep with a woman and then kill her afterwards so here they're accusing the monastics not only of killing her the Buddhist monastics but also having slept with her and since the people had seen her kind of hanging out there in the woods for quite some time it was a little bit of a believable story so the people in the town believed the story and the next morning when the Buddhists came into the town to get their alms they were met with criticism and abuse and the people said you aren't real monastics you're terrible how could you have done such a thing and and they came home that day to the woods without any food at all and so they went to the Buddha the monks and said you know this thing has happened we're being accused of this murder of this woman and now the people in the town are reviling us and what should we do and the Buddha said don't worry this will blow over in seven days so just be patient keep going into town every day for your food don't worry if you get anything or not but go every day with your food and every day if people revile you revile you then just very calmly keep your keep your cool stay calm and just recite this poem or these verses and he recited he gave a verse and and that verse is go something like this the false accuser goes to hell and also the one who denies the deed that's been done both these become equal in the hereafter people of base actions in the world beyond so if someone if someone accuses someone falsely they'll terrible things will happen to them in the ancient kind of cosmology they go to hell as does someone who denies what has been done and so what they're saying here the Buddhist monastics is basically they're professing their innocence but in a calm way they're saying look we're innocent they're not criticizing the others you're just making a kind of a general statement that those who make false accusations will end up with terrible consequences and those who will deny what has been done but also so the Buddhists are basically they're denying that they murdered this woman but they but they feel you know but they didn't murder her so it's okay thing to say they're not they're not claiming they're not denying something that didn't have that that did happen and so every day they go in and after seven days the townspeople begin to understand that Buddhists are kind of staking their they're kind of making a vow they're kind of staking their you know their lives their future their spiritual lives on this say what's called a statement of truth and after a while the townspeople feel that what these Buddhists are believable and so then they start feeding them again and the whole scandal at least in relationship to whether the monks get fed or not gets passed is over and then the Buddha is told that the whole episode is passed over and he says uncontrolled people pierce one with words as a battle elephant is pierced with arrows on hearing harsh words being uttered a monk should endure them without hate I don't know how a battle elephant is pierced with arrows but there's an image often used in in the suttas of being like an elephant a big kind of elephant used for battle has really tough skin and having abuse thrown at you be like that elephant where the where the arrows just bounce off or the little darts don't really make an impact and the elephant just continues going into battle to not let things bother you so here the Buddha said even with hate if you receive if someone hates you or criticizes you then don't meet hate with hate don't respond in kind but rather bear bear it carry it along just don't defend yourself necessarily though they are defending us little little bit with this verse but don't speak up don't with anger or hostility and what he's pointing to is a virtue which in the ancient tradition was considered very important in India is very important Indian Buddhism not talked about very much here in the West and that's the virtue of forbearance it's a little bit different than patience forbearance has a quality of kind of enduring or holding your tongue or not not giving in to the strong impulses that might come up kind of kind of just just bearing what's happening so even if a strong feelings arise inside of us to have maybe patience with our feelings or forbearance bear them without giving a word to them with expression to them so to to be endured be patient with abuse with criticism to know when not to speak when we are being criticized is also important so it's a very powerful story since someone gets killed and we have examples in the modern world just in the papers these days of maybe not people being killed for this kind of purposes but people seemingly or people making all kinds of accusations to each other and it's hard to know who and then people saying no you know back and forth it goes but it seems that in this world today just as in the ancient world there are people who are quite capable of making false accusations for their own purposes and then the question is you know how do we respond to that how do we deal with it how do we live with that how do we live with it when it's towards ourselves these things so that was the basic ideas I want to share with you today what I want to do in the second half of the morning was to ask you all what you think about holding your silence or forbearance or knowing when to speak when not to speak up knowing when not to respond to criticism or knowing when not to respond to criticism with aggression or hostility or unuseful defensiveness what has been your experience with this and what yes so it will pass this back here and when you get it you can flip the switch on that's on the bottom I had an incident happen last Sunday when I found that I was a confidence that I had shared with someone was betrayed very unskillfully having found that out I called that person who had betrayed my trust and spoke this I was very upset and because I was upset I inarticulately expressed my frustration and in thinking about it further this week he got all defensive and and in thinking about this I today discovered that he had completely under misunderstood what I was upset about and he thought I was upset because I well anyway so I'm trying to decide whether or not to call this person today and explain that he misinterpreted why I was upset and instead having read your article on anger this morning I tried to look inside and I discovered that it was caused by hurt and so I'm trying to decide whether or not to call this person and explain where my phone call had been coming from and to clarify this this incident and explain why I was upset and throughout the week I've gone through well I'm just gonna write them off clearly he's not a friend of mine if you would do this to me and and whether or not to be silent and just let it go and hope that it will blow over and I've really been struggling with this and I want to handle it skillfully and I'm fairly new to all of this and I have been unskillful for a lot of years and you know I'm hoping to get it soon so maybe you can shed some light on this for me one of the things that occurs to me is that different personalities have different personality styles how to deal with conflict and some people hide in silence or inappropriately silence just don't deal with conflict and some people hide more being aggressive and throwing themselves into it and sometimes you have to be kind of careful with knowing everybody's personality styles one's own and also others to kind of know what's the best approach silence isn't always the best and sometimes speaking isn't best and figuring out what to do what it sounds like to happen to you is that from your point of view you were betrayed which was an unfortunate circumstances and then you handle it badly and it made kind of things worse so sometimes I've had success in situations like that to say let's start over again you know I don't know what happened I don't know what happened there but could we start over again I've mediated conflicts between four-year-olds and that worked has worked amazingly well a few times let's just start over again because if you get engaged the four-year-olds it's just hopeless sometimes boy and but if you you know let's just start that this is a activity from the very beginning again anyways to start again we start over again and talk about what's going on and then the second time around if you get the chance is to maybe talk more from you know I felt really hurt and like you to understand my hurt and maybe we could talk about that and see what happened and try to understand clarify that's David you have to please pass the microphone hello here well I I agree I think it's oh it's much more useful just to speak your truth and not blame other people and you get you know things work out much better that way however I'm really upset because the Republicans are so effective at playing dirty this this whole deal with John Kerry you know not being a you know the the the the the falsehoods that are being spread about him as a in the war are really taking a toll on the Kerry campaign and I kind of wish the Democrats knew how to fight dirty or that they would and that they would talk about Bush's war record or lack of war record or some something like that that they could find some kind of nasty thing to say about Bush that would be as effective so you know that I think the result is Kerry will you know very well could lose the election and by their bad speech and and you know bad things will continue to happen to our country as a result of their bad speeches happened to Clinton yeah so it wasn't a question for me so luckily I'm off the hook well let me let me add what do you think I should have been silent so the I don't have a response really response the wise response especially from kind of this place here sitting here to that kind of situation I do have a lot of faith in the power of individuals and the power of good and goodness and it might not necessarily have the kind of we now that we might not be able to cause a change and decide if we want to see by staying good people but I have a lot of faith in the tremendous power of goodness and so it might take invisible routes in society how it works things out but I hope that that anybody who chooses how to act and live their lives does it from their best intentions from good intentions and that we keep taking refuge in that coming from that and whoever decides to respond to accusations of any kind and their times are definitely people need to respond I mean the story here the monks didn't a sense respond they had a subversive they said that that whoever responds they always respond from a place of good intentions good heart and and I think that has tremendous power it's probably an act of faith perhaps that to put my trust completely in that but if someone doesn't I think that society will just things could get a lot worse than they seem I don't know you know I don't know if if you know violence begets violence hate begets hate fighting dirty dirty just creates more fighting dirty so that's what my tendency is to cry to say well let's let's try to be as active as we can doing what we feel is right but let's always try to come from that place which speaks from the greatest good so I know that's not a very satisfying answer but that's how I feel it would be nice yeah then everybody can hear how's it how's it going now we've had that like microphone for a few weeks so how do you guys feel about having a microphone in the hole good yeah underneath the switches in the bottom a friend of mine whose wisdom I've always respected said when in doubt don't and I think that kind of sums up a lot of you know if you feel that you have the right answer to something then you know go ahead and say it or do it but so many times you really kind of know deep down whether something's right or wrong so if you're tempted to say something that may not be wise very often that's a good time just to remember when in doubt don't the Buddhist expression that I've heard is when in doubt bow yes is there a sutra with a Buddhist says if you're if you are if you do you if you know you're you're wrong don't say anything if you're not certain and don't say anything and if you're sure you should be silent for a while and make sure that you're very sure I don't know the sutra but it's good good I think the struggle for me would come from the fact that silence feels like acquiescence and if someone's saying stop and you go to this place of not responding I think people interpret can interpret silences that person's on your side who agrees with you or their criticisms correct or and that's what leaves me kind of wondering about this yeah I was in a conversation recently where it occurred to me that by not participating in the conversation the person would think that my views were different than what they are and however to participate in the conversation meant to participate in something that was quite contentious and also created an atmosphere and created a kind of way of talking way of being way of looking at people and that just also didn't seem right it kind of coming pulled into someone else's kind of contentious nature and and so I reflected you know what's more important here does it matter how this person sees me that this person misunderstands who I am or that's that person's responsibility if they want to make conclusions about me based on on the silence and or do I get myself pulled into that world playing that game and I chose not to play the game and let the person see me and it's feels a little bit awkward to be you know to know that then someone will have a perception of me that's a little bit off but I'm sure it happens all the time anyway I'm intrigued that you alluded so gently to the public arena and they asked about it as you always say in the talk when you're sitting there your role is not to be a Democrat or a Republican or a against for that that I had a second that last part I'll speak up I'm always against the word I'm recalling returning to the demonstrations in San Francisco and coming in someone who were shocked to find was actually supporting for you you are sure how to handle that in the teaching setting and I think it can be what should be displayed where in the saga instead of a very central public display of anti-war stuff that you should be on the table it was a summer issue that for against for it was that this should be a setting in which all people including George Bush should be comfortable right it's it's at this point when you you've published people bring up their public as well as their personal points that you have that I have some discomfort I think of one hand very positive spray and either silence your words which is nonviolent civil disobedience and the other hand of all lifetimes and the flow of aggressive political movements that have killed hundreds of millions of people and the last sequence in the United States the 1980 day on the caucus and the pain and the pre-port this is one thing that is obviously another in which it appears to the pros that silence is a death knell and that playing dirty on a national level is successful a number of people have voiced their concerns today that it appears to them that it is successful and that the short run is really the long run in a society that's as powerful as ours and I can't quite reconcile personal responses based on the students and common sense with public roles so that there's a consonance in the country that the people that are ethical happen to be the people that are willing to have chosen for leadership positions for all of us and that we don't simply take refuge in the comfort of the cushion I don't think that the cushion is meant to be an escape at all but I think as you said I did make an illusion to what goes on in the news but accusations go on in all directions and it isn't just one party versus another, people in both political spectrums do all kinds of things and I think everybody is capable of the same behavior and I've seen behavior kind of in both sides that seem kind of bizarre I think it's worthwhile always to come back as a baseline to look at the fundamental ethics of what we're choosing to do and to be challenged by that and a person might in the end choose not to do the ethical thing, I hope not but I can imagine, but I hope that anybody who does something unethical will do it first by looking very carefully at what is ethical and questioning any other motivation they might have and also to look very carefully at other ethical alternatives to fighting fire with fire and I'm very inspired by Mahatma Gandhi who would spend a long time in reflection, in retreat, thinking and thinking about how he could respond to the British when he was dealing with them and he didn't do the automatic thing or the quickest thing, he bidded his time and took his time and reflected and one of the results for example was the salt march, he thought and thought and thought what to do and after many many reflections he thought I'll just march to the sea as a protest to the salt tax and gather my own salt and that was a really pivotal moment in Indian history, the fight against the British and it was a real simple thing of what to see in gathering his own salt but it took a long time for him to realize that's what needed to be done I feel very sad, as I've said many times before, about people who quickly will go towards solutions, aggressive solutions or quickly will often buy a gun or willing to use a gun without first having done the research or the thought or the study that it takes to look at what are the alternatives to that that might be possible and do we support those alternatives and do we support those alternatives in a long term view it might not be that if someone for example chooses to do the ethical thing, it might not be this election for example that we're fighting for but it might be in ten years by setting the foundation for something very different to happen in ten years because of the momentum or something so my faith in the ethical solution is a faith, it's kind of invisible, it's easier sometimes to look and be into that which has immediate effect and that's why a gun is often so promising, you just get a gun and take care of it and not a lot of people want to go and spend a long period of time taking, learning non-violent methods of self defense because that's time consuming and we have important things to do, recreational opportunities to do and you know, we just get a gun so I think that as, I think it's all too easy for people to choose the easy solution and aggression is often seemingly the easy solution and I hope that people who have some real issues will spend a lot of time thinking creatively about what are the other possible ways of dealing with these kinds of conflicts but don't sit in the cushion, sit in the cushion so maybe you can have the creativity but please be creative over here please I just wanted to say that I propose the earlier things, it's important to remember that we're not losing and we haven't lost yet and you know, part of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and everything like that is about creating the illusion of like inspiring hopelessness in us and you know, just by getting angry and upset about it, you're buying into that illusion, you're buying into their TV ads and their fronts so you know, I think Gil is right now is a time to you know, practice faith and practice hope in the context of the political choices that we have to make so I'll hand over here and then the last one and then we'll stop I'd like to agree with or say something to the idea that when things come up they need to be responded to so there's the short term and the long term and I always, I guess I want to agree with this lady here that sometimes when you're silent about something that's wrong that can be like a complicity with it so I'm sure you know everybody can see that but I think that a lot of what this is about is a dialogue and that there's communication and there should be communication and the question is how to communicate effectively and in a way that is constructive so I feel like I get a little bit nervous when about this idea of silence, like sometimes silence is appropriate but sometimes it's kind of like copying out too I think and that's, I guess that's a danger to me so I completely agree about that and the underlying theme that I was hoping for today is the challenge for all of us is to explore when is silence the most appropriate response, the healthy response and my suggestion is that, my observation is myself and many people that I know is that the healthy, there are certainly very important times when to speak up but a lot of people have a tendency to speak much more than they need to and I think where a lot of people need to be challenged is not helping them to speak but I think people need to be challenged to encourage them to speak that's for sure but I would say that kind of as a generalization I think a lot of people need to explore a little bit more that particular place, those particular circumstances where silence is the right situation I'm not suggesting when that is but there are certainly times when silence is probably the best choice you find yourself in a family gathering and there's a tremendously heated, angry, venomous discussion about politics so you go to the kitchen to wash your dishes because you don't want to be pulled into that atmosphere of poison that everyone's talking about and then you can say something like oh that was an interesting conversation you had, sometime later if you'd like to hear my opinion I'm happy to offer it to you and then people only if they ask so the challenge today was not the challenge of when to speak but the challenge is to reflect and think about when is the times to have breakfast for parents, to have patience and hopefully you'll have the wisdom to know when to do that wisely so yes please I would really like to see our attention to the attention of people who are both political beings and without watching I wouldn't want to listen to this part of it expressed because I think this place of wisdom in all of them and the person who can help all of them really understand this is my question that's very clear that I think that I first learned this lesson at the San Francisco Zen Center where when I was living there they had a neighborhood foundation the Zen Center had this little foundation or little thing kind of helping in the neighborhood association they kind of ran and helped and so they knew some of the difficulties that exist in the neighborhood and they knew some of the difficulties that renters had in some of these kind of almost like tenement apartment buildings and they knew how these kind of tenement, the owners of these apartment buildings were kind of not even the most ethical caring people and so the question was should the neighborhood association get involved with this conflict disputes between the renters and the owners of these apartment buildings in such a way that it would antagonize the owners and I remember the Abbott saying very clearly that he did not want to set up that kind of antagonistic relationship with the landowners, with the apartment owners because he wanted to make sure that they felt comfortable and welcome to come in the morning and sit in meditation also in the meditation hall and if the Zen Center was seen as being involved in the conflict then it wasn't a comfortable place for them to come and I think that's a very important to remember that it's also very important I think to have a place where people can meet outside of some of the normal social roles and conventions that we often live by and traditionally in Buddhism going to a monastery, if you go to a monk or nine or if you're a great person to live in a monastery the idea is you put aside your social roles and social positions and meet more as humans rather than as the different roles that you have to kind of cut through those barriers and I don't know if that should always be the case but I think that society needs places where we can step out of our normal roles and see that our roles are just roles and that we don't have to hold onto them so tight and kind of see that who we fundamentally are is not the role and sometimes having places we can go to do that is very important they say in Japan, I've been told that in Japan that Japanese have that with their offuro, with their baths I've been told that many times that Japanese will go to these public bath houses and they all take off their clothes and go in the hot tubs and the saunas and their social roles and statuses fall away when they're all naked but then they put on their clothes and then it's all back to the whole saunas so maybe a Buddhist center could also be that kind of place where we can drop our roles and meet at a different level but we often meet at and doing that hopefully create a more peaceful world so well I hope it was satisfying enough today, I felt some dissatisfaction it's good to be, it's also good to be dissatisfied yes? I just have a comment about playing dirty I believe that if you are going to play dirty even though you're using the argument for battle and people still don't expect you so I would always believe that don't play dirty because eventually she will come out and people will expect you later I can tell you a quick story about Dennis Kucinich who is not known about politics per se but just about his story he was elected mayor of Cleveland on this particular platform and then he was almost blackmailed by the local bank to sell the public utility but he was elected so that in order to save the public utility so it wouldn't be privatized so when he was blackmailed by the bank, he refused to blackmail and Cleveland became the first city in America to default on its loan with a bank and the people in Cleveland couldn't understand why their city was the first to default on a loan and go bankrupt and so they voted him out of office so he just went out of office and waited many years and I don't know how many years later but a good number of years later, ten years later there was an article in the Cleveland newspaper that said Kucinich was right and then he was called back from his political retirement and was elected congressman from Ohio so for him he had to wait ten years what he felt was the right thing and what he thought was the ethical thing to do and then he had to go to a political wasteland for ten years and eventually it came out what had happened and he was voted back into office so may all of us certainly be challenged in exploring how to be more ethical and also have fun it's really fun to be silent when you feel this impulse inside oh, oh, let me tell you how it really is let me tell you, I really brought some food for you monks I really brought it feel that energy and that impulse and be surfing on it you gotta, you know, please have fun too with your silence thank you
