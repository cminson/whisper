Practice Note: Establishing Clarity

The word ‘clear ’ is an important word . It has a number 
of meanings , but one I’d like to mention now is be ing 
clear about what’s happening . If you are sitting 
meditating , and you are thinking a lot , wandering off in 
thought , it’s easy to be kind of aware that you are 
thinking . You can  perhaps  kind of  let go of it, kind of  try 
and come back, kind of  be with your breath . But if the 
mind’s really thinking , stop and be clear , “This is what 
I’m thinking about. I’m thinking. This is what’s 
happening now. ”  
 
Be clear when you sit down to meditate, “I’m here to 
meditate. ” Be clear about establishing yoursel f with 
some clarity  – some sense of clear purpose . “This is 
what I’m doing now. ” Then, when you sit down , you are 
not still thinking about what happened earlier in the day , 
or what’s going to happen later in the day , or other 
things . You’re really clear : “This is what I’m doing. ” 
 
For walking meditation , when you start doing walking 
meditation , be clear, “This is what I’m doing. I’m going 
to be walking now. ” Or if there’s a strong emotional 
state , or a strong concern present as you are walking , maybe even stop in your tracks , and become really 
clear , “This is really a prominent thing. This is really part 
of what has to be acknowledged when I’m here. I’m 
feeling this way.” Really acknowledge it . If you are 
caught up in some concern , stop. Look it in the face , 
and say, “I’m really concerned about this. ” Be really 
clear.  
 
You can leave aside  aversion  or judgement . Just be 
completely clear that t his is what’s happening . Part of 
mindfulness is to have this  clarity. Sometimes people 
don’t have clarity because they are trying too hard to get 
into the nuances of what’s happening , as if s omething 
special  is supposed to be  happening .  
 
Be clear about what’s obvious . Sit down and become 
clear . With that clear acknowledgement  that this is 
what's  happening , then you’re in the present . You are 
clear about what’s happening . That’s all you are asked 
to do .  
 
Then you can make a choice about what to do next . 
You can decide this is not wh at you want to do . You can 
then become clear, “When I meditate , I’m going to stay 
with my breathing. When I walk , I’m just going to be with 
my feet .” Be clear about that. Or you can become clear 
that what needs attention is your thinking . Or what 
needs att ention is your feeling state . Your choice is n ot 
think ing more , but really bring ing attention to stay ing present.  
 
You might experiment today with the level of clarity you 
have about how you acknowledge things . Experiment 
with not be ing mindful in a causal way . Some people 
have a checklist approach to mindfulness , where you 
just quickly note something  and go on . Instead, actually 
stop, and give time to really acknowledge and be clea r 
about  what’s happening now . Then see what happens 
in the wake of that kind of relaxed clarit y, where there’s 
no hurry to make anything happen . Just be clear, “Here , 
this is what’s happening. ”   
 
So, with that , I’m clear I’m supposed to go and meet 
with people now . Thank you.
