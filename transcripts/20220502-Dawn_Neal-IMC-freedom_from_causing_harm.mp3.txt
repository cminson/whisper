The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Well, welcome again. Welcome again to Happy Hour.
And I'm going to pick up on a theme by way of introduction that came up towards the end of our last Happy Hour,
which was a discussion and comments about this beautiful wish for being free from harm and especially from causing harm.
And this came up at the end of Friday's Happy Hour, and I just wanted to highlight how beautiful that wish is.
It's so central to our hearts, to our ethical lives.
And while it's a very beautiful wish and aspiration, it's not one that's always possible in today's world, maybe in any world.
Things are complex, right?
We cause impact by our very living, right?
So two principles are kind of helpful to remember not to get bound up in this.
First, I really want to emphasize this, when we're able to avoid causing harm to ourselves or others, it's something worth feeling really good about.
To almost even celebrate within, to recognize our own goodness and allow that to support the practice, the practice of meditation, any kind of spiritual practice.
And the second principle is, given this inextricable web of interdependencies in our lives and ecologies and economies, sometimes we can cause harm directly or indirectly through ignorance, delusion, our own pain.
And if we realize it's happened, it's really important not to cause further harm within ourselves by unhelpful cycles of guilt or self hatred.
It actually doesn't help.
We all make mistakes.
Instead, it's helpful to internally at least and sometimes appropriate externally to acknowledge it, repair it, if at all possible.
And above all learn from it.
So as not to repeat a mistake in the past.
These kinds of mistakes are human, right?
We all make them.
I haven't met a perfect human yet, maybe you have.
So, may I be free from harm and causing harm?
I'm going to clarify that phrase for those of you who are here the other night too.
I thought I'd gotten it from a specific chapter in a book by Sharon Salzburg, who I've also sat with and taken instruction from. And I looked back at my book and my notes, and it turns out that they seem to have invented it.
But it was based on some very specific phrases that she used.
These phrases are also valuable. So I just want to mention them to drop them in your mind before we start practicing and you're welcome to use them if you wish.
The first is may I or you or we be free from suffering and the causes of suffering, such as ill will and envy.
The second one is may I, you, we be free of anger, enmity and bitterness.
So those more specific, right?
And may I, may you, we be free from harm and causing harm.
That was inspired both by these phrases and by how central non-harming is as an ethic in Buddhism and Buddhist practice.
There are many, many places in the ancient teachings of the Buddha where freedom from all of these things, anger, enmity, bitterness, ill will, envy, all of it is important.
But the wish to be non-harming is central. It's often described as the motivation to embark on the path of practice itself, like to really seriously embark on it.
And so it's a really beautiful motivation, impulse to transform a life, to transform life, one breath at a time, one intention at a time, one moment at a time.
A really famous teacher in the Thai forest tradition of this lineage of Buddhism, A Chan Cha says, the future is the child at the present.
If you take care of the mother, she will take care of her child.
So, by refraining from harming or aspiring to being free from causing harm, it takes care of the present.
And this is where loving kindness practice kind of shades into the central ethic of Buddhism.
This wish to be free from suffering, from causing harm, kind of protects our hearts from our own impacts, right?
And then lead to a certain kind of sense of goodness, a foundation of blamelessness during practice that's very settling, very, very helpful.
And the wish itself is something to be celebrated. In a sense, it's core to loving kindness, and it's also core to all of Buddhist inspired meditation practice.
So, core wish of meta.
So, those are the reflections. Please take what's useful and discard what isn't as we head into meditation.
For now, what I'm going to do is I am going to disable the ability for people to unmute themselves in case we have some late arrivals.
And I'm going to ask you to settle back, turn off anything that beeps, blurs, buzzes, vibrates or otherwise distracts on your devices, including the one that we are on together.
And if you like, please feel free to turn off your camera during the meditation.
Turn to the side and look elsewhere as we practice.
I will of course stay on screen, unless something big comes up the door.
So, settling back.
Noticing your feet on the ground.
Noticing the support beneath you, whether it's a mat, a cushion, a chair, any support at all.
Relaxing into that support.
It can be really helpful to soften your eyes and if they're not already closed, to close them.
Perhaps starting with setting the intention, the aspiration for what this time of practice is for you.
Maybe it's as simple as taking care of the present.
We wish to be free from harm and causing harm.
Or any other wish.
Making a moment for the knowledge, that aspiration.
Then allowing the mind, the heart, the body to unify in this moment.
Bringing them together.
Perhaps taking one or two deep, slow breaths.
I didn't go any excess tension on the exhale.
Allowing the attention to suffuse through a whole body.
Like water suffuses to respond.
Noticing, acknowledging any sensations that are there.
Or they're cool.
Weight or lightness.
Tension or relaxation.
Allowing whatever they are to be there.
Just acknowledging.
Noticing to where the skin of this body meets air or cloth.
Perhaps where the sounds around you meet the ear drum.
Noticing the integrity of this body.
Sleeping the attention through the whole body.
Allowing the heart mind to settle.
Perhaps.
And the gentle emotion or sensation of the breath in and out.
The chest or abdomen.
Or even through the whole body.
It's easier for you.
Resting on sensation or sound instead.
Applying these instructions to that.
Allowing the breathing to be natural.
Riding, surfing on the waves.
The in breath and out breath.
Riding, surfing on the waves.
Perhaps thoughts, emotions, energy from the day.
Seeing how gently and kindly that tool can be included in the
field of the practice.
But for now, letting it feed to the background.
Gently and kindly returning to this moment.
This breath.
This sensation.
The whole body.
Riding, surfing on the waves.
Allowing the attention to collect.
If it feels right.
Especially noticing the sensations.
Of breathing in the chest.
Perhaps the diaphragm.
An inclination.
Towards offering cultivating the intention.
Of kindness, of care, of love.
Noticing the sensations.
But accompanying that intention, if any.
Offering in the out breath.
Receiving, noticing.
The in breath.
And then perhaps like a gesture.
Offering or letting go.
Into a pond.
Allowing the intention of kindness to ripple through this whole
body, this heart.
Going to offer a few phrases.
Please feel free to use your own language.
And there's few words that you wish even one word.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be saved.
May I be free from harm and causing harm.
Pilling into that wish.
Allowing the intention to ripple through the body.
Perhaps like water ripples.
In the wind or from that pebble.
Through every cell.
Every bone, every muscle.
Through the skin.
May I be saved.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be free from causing harm.
And perhaps appreciating the beauty of the intention itself.
And perhaps appreciating the beauty of the intention itself.
And perhaps appreciating the beauty of the intention itself.
And perhaps appreciating the beauty of the intention itself.
To direct these wishes through this body, heart and mind.
Including the cell.
Directing them towards someone.
This dear, easy to wish kindness towards.
Benefactor of some kind.
Friend, child, pet.
Even a revered figure.
Allowing these wishes of kindness, care.
Friendliness.
Directed and offered towards this other one.
Perhaps accompanied by a slight smile or hand on the heart.
May you be happy.
See.
See.
Breathe.
Breathe.
See.
People noticing how it feels to offer these wishes.
Receiving how that feels.
Be dedicating yourself to the offering in your own words.
Images, gestures.
Simple.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
Allowing your rhythm to build internally.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
Rippling outwards.
And again, staying with this being, this rhythm that feels right for you.
It feels hospitable, can also expand the circle of love and kindness and care.
Outwards.
Towards any beings that happen to be in the path of these intentions.
As they ripple outwards from you.
Offered outwards.
Perhaps the beings in the building or the neighborhood or the region.
Expanding outwards.
As far or as close, this feels right.
Be happy.
Be healthy.
Save.
Pray.
From your own language.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
Be turning the attention to the intention of loving kindness.
And allowing whatever is there in that same spirit of kindness.
Allowing whatever is arising from the heart, the body, the mind.
To be suffused, soaked, rippled throughout with these same wishes and same intentions.
No apart left out.
Everything included.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, again staying where it feels right or feels good.
The invitation is allowing loving kindness to spread outwards in all directions.
These intentions.
Perhaps radiating like a star.
Or spreading in the wind.
River of air.
Be all beings.
Be happy.
Will be.
Same.
May all beings be free from harm and causing harm.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And then in the final moments of this meditation.
Founding again in this body, this seat.
Noticing what sensations are there, what intentions are there.
Internally, wishing yourself and all of your sangha mates here in this Zoom room well.
May we be happy.
Healthy.
Safe.
And free.
May others also be happy.
Healthy.
Safe.
And free.
And may we be part of the growth of kindness, care.
And may we be part of the growth of kindness, care.
Love and around.
Thank you.
Thank you all for your practice.
To stay with yourselves for a moment, but turn your video on and just take a moment.
Those of you who are comfortable doing so, scrolling through the Zoom room.
And just sending little pulse, no finger snap of kindness, care.
Do the other tiles, use other practitioners, the other people.
And sharing this practice with tonight.
Taking each other in, whether it's a blank tile or a name or a video.
Knowing that as you're sending these wishes that you're receiving them.
You're sending them to each other person in this Zoom room.
Beautiful.
Thank you.
I'm changing the settings to allow people to unmute themselves. If anyone has a question or comment or an observation, I'd love to hear.
This was for you or anything else you want to share about it.
I can't, I don't know if I can see all of you so you can either use your Zoom hand or just unmute yourself.
If it's easier for you.
You're also welcome to put it in the chat. You don't have to say it out loud.
That was lovely.
I just want to say thank you for leading that I often have a hard time with meditation it's kind of hard for me to like, really like silence the thoughts that are always running through my head.
I don't know, I really enjoyed that a lot so I just wanted to say thank you for doing such a great job.
Thank you Mateo. I'm glad that it supported your meditation.
Any other comments?
Claire saying feel enriched.
Use to phrase Larry asks integrity of the body.
Could you say more about what you meant by this, sure.
So, to me one of the things I find really helpful is to ground in the uniqueness, the visceralness of the body, even just a simple fact sometimes I say integrity of your skin.
The fact that our body, our organs, our life force is while always in dialogue with an influence to buy an influencing our environment there's also a kind of uprightness and integrity within the living nature of the body itself just by its nature.
So, that's kind of the internal attitude or stance I have towards bodies, and that there's a certain kind of uprightness of even unassuming power and unassuming grace that can happen from being embodied.
We don't always feel it, but that's what I meant.
So, Mary, did that help?
You're welcome to have your own interpretation too.
What if the body has illness?
Well, as someone who's had a number of chronic conditions over the years, I'm well familiar with that, there is still, even with cancer, a way to tap into your own life force.
To find the integrity, the will, the wish to live even, or even the letting go has an integrity to it.
So, we're not talking about perfection here, or even classical health, but a kind of healing that's possible, and even a healing that happens in my role as a chaplain can happen in the dying process.
That there's an integrity to that too.
It's not easy.
It's not fun.
But it's possible to ground in the integrity of being in some way at peace with what is.
And it's not always easy to get there, I would say that.
But the wish of Mehta is the wish for that healing, separate from the physical healing, but the heart healing that can happen.
With a love and an intention for kindness.
So, I want to give you a few minutes, those of you who want to participate in breakout groups. So the encouragement is to stay. I know some people like to drop off.
You're also welcome to just stay in the Zoom room and not accept the breakout room invitation.
So, I'm going to assign them automatically.
The invitation here is to talk about what speaks to you in the Mehta meditation, either tonight or in general, what supports you in your own intention for being kind and non-harming to yourself or to others, just to grow in your own practice.
So, I'll send you off. It will be about a five to six minute meditation tonight regardless of what the timer says. Okay.
So enjoy.
We'll see you on the other side.
Welcome back everyone.
Hi.
So, open floor.
How was that for you? Those of you who are in the breakout room, is there anything that you learned by something that came out of your mouth? Yes, Neil, please.
So, you know, at the very beginning, you had that phrase, you know, may I not cause harm to myself.
I don't quite recall exactly what it was, but I just found it to be such a lovely phrase.
And I know you said it was the phrase you used last week.
I think that was Friday. I take it right. I was kind of dozy Friday because it didn't register with me at all as having been heard, right?
But it was, you know, I just found it, it's just such a sweet wish, you know, and you're talking about not running into, you know, cycles of self-blame, you know.
I mean, something I could like need to remind myself of about a million times a day. And it was just, you know, it was just very nice for me. I thank you.
Thank you. I'm glad it's helpful. And yeah, it's may I be free from harm and causing harm.
That's my formulation. But as always, please take anything you hear and adapt it, use it creatively, shift it, make it your own, right? So, so it's kind of a shorthand for so much of the practice as a possibility.
Any other questions, comments? Yes, Jerry. Hi.
Welcome back.
Thank you very much. And so if you're being away, it's always a pleasure to be back with all these.
I read it, folks. So, anyway, I have to, I did find myself feeling, as always, with that is one of my favorite practices, because I, I feel so much better after it, like, physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally, it's just like, I feel like I've been
enveloped in warmth and love. So thank you very much to all of you.
You're very welcome.
And from the whole group, right? This is a group effort, all of us together. Greg, hi, please.
Hello, hello. I just wanted to thank you for the metaphor of the pebble in the water and sort of the concentric rings radiating out.
It's interesting, I studied stoicism as well. And I tend to think in terms of those concentric rings is less and less control as things move away from me.
And I was thinking about the applying the practice of meta to that and being this, and maybe it is just a little pet, a little pebble of influence, but that idea of radiating meta out to, to everybody around me and just trying to be that source of good energy.
I found that sort of comforting and useful and something I could carry with me. So, thank you for that.
You're welcome. Wonderful.
It sounds like you already have the
what feels like to me one of the central insights of the meta is the ripple effect, right? That notion that we do in ways that we cannot see and don't always have any idea about
that kindness can have a ripple effect and far reaching effect.
I want to respond to someone asks, can you please send Nikki our love and best wishes? Absolutely.
I will make sure she was happy to hear that the group sent her a little meta last week, and I'm sure she'll be happy to hear it this week as well.
We are almost at time. So, just an invitation again, look around the room for a minute and acknowledge who you're with, your friends in this practice, your friends and these beautiful intentions, right?
It's really something lovely that on any given night at least 30, 40 people want to be doing this just in our little circle and there are many, many other circles like this around the world everywhere.
So may all beings be free from harm and causing harm. May all beings be happy, safe and peaceful. And may all beings know the highest freedom, the freedom of awakening.
Thank you all so much for your practice and wishing you well.
Thank you.
Bye everybody. Take care. Bye everyone.
