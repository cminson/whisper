 These weeks that I am speaking these last few weeks, the subject has been the five faculties. That's the most common translation in our scene of what's called the indriya. And the, these are very important factors of meditation. They're very important faculties or capacities we have. And when I was practicing meditation in Thailand, I was told that traditionally vipassana teachers in Thailand, when they are listening to students give their... Listening, listening. When meditation teachers are listening to their students talk about their meditation experience, they're trying to listen to their experience through the perspective of these five faculties or capacities that the students have. And to see which of these need to be strengthened or which we need to come into balance or how to work with these five. And the five which we're going through are confidence, sometimes called fate, but I think confidence is a better translation. Effort or energy or engagement is number two. And the third one is mindfulness. And the third one, the fourth one is concentration. And then today we'll talk about what's usually called wisdom. And the word for faculties, the five faculties comes from the name Indra, which is one of the chief gods of the Indian Pantheon in the time of the Buddha. And it's kind of like the god who kind of controls. Back then at least the things changed up there in the skies. But back then it was the one of the chief controlling kind of gods, gods are kind of charge of the heavens, I guess. And so they had certain kind of power of control over things. And so some people then will translate these five faculties by the word five controlling faculties. So there are five things which control the spiritual life or controlled meditation. It might be an unfortunate translation into English because we have such a strong association with idiot control. With control freaks. And so the idea of control might not be the best. But if you think of the number of things which control the car that you're driving, certainly the driver controls it, the engine controls it, I guess the transmission system controls it. Various things kind of control how the car is driving, the speed controls it, and all kinds of things come into play. And you can adjust the different parts of a car to a certain degree in order to control better, get more control or less control or something of the car. So it's also said that these five faculties that are cultivated in meditation, developed or strengthened, can be developed to the point where they become rather than called faculties or capacities or potentials, they become powers that we have, powers we carry with us. So they become like strengths that we have kind of here with us, rather than something we potentially have that we can kind of develop, but now they're developed, so they become strengths. And it said that these five faculties can control a lot of different things, but one of the things they control is that they're opposites, that when you develop these strengths and develop these capacities, the opposites won't be there. So the opposite of confidence is doubt. So if you develop, if you have a lot of doubt, then part of what needs to be developed is confidence. And it's confidence will push aside or not make it possible to have the doubt there. Then if your person is sluggish or lazy or lethargic or various kinds of things like that, then the energy factor is the medicine for sloth or laziness, to arouse the energy, to arouse oneself in practice. And when we're aroused properly, when there's a really strong vitality, really strong engagement in spiritual life, then sloth is not going to be part of it. And then mindfulness is what is the medicine for what's usually translated into English as heatlessness. I have no English situation where we use the word heatlessness except in Buddhist texts. I guess they used to talk more about it. Any of you use the word heatless in your day life? Yes, but you know what it means, right? And so to be careless or to be negligent and not to be careful. And then the concentration is the medicine for a scattered, agitated, restless mind. So when there's a lot of agitation, then we develop concentration too. And then wisdom is what is the medicine for ignorance, for not knowing. The word for wisdom in the five faculties is in Pali is panya. And some of you might know it better in the Sanskrit version, which is prajnaya. And it's most commonly translated into English as wisdom, which probably is fine in many situations. Though I prefer in these five faculties, it translated differently, translated as discernment. And it's fairly common for translating English, Buddhist words into English to need to use different English translations in different situations, like the word dharma, there's like 52 meanings of the word dharma. And so you have people translate, will translate it differently depending on the context. So in the context of the five faculties, I prefer the word discernment than wisdom. Wisdom, Buddhism is often considered to be a wisdom tradition. The word wisdom is sometimes synonymous with truth or reality as it is, or the ultimate reality, ultimate teaching. Wisdom is a very powerful word in Buddhism. And sometimes Buddhism, as I said, is called the wisdom tradition, where wisdom and compassion are the key pillars or the wings that support the tradition itself or the practice itself. And wisdom is a great word. I love the word wisdom. I think it's such a so evocative in my mind. There's so many different things that are wise, many different aspects to wisdom. And I think everybody will have a different angle on wisdom to different people develops or different kind of perspectives of what is wise or different ideas. And I came across this in the last few weeks. I thought this was very wise. And I thought I'll share one little piece of wisdom that someone came with. This is a book called Novice to Master. And the subtitle is, An Ongoing Lesson in the Extent of My Own Stupidity. Now, is that really wise statement or is that a foolish statement? Anyway, this is a Soko Morinaga, who is a very famous, I guess famous Zen master in Japan, who died a few years ago. He was abbot of some very famous monasteries in Kyoto. So he's not any old fool. If I were to sum up the past 40 years of my life, the time since I became a monk, I would have to say that it has been an ongoing lesson in the extent of my own stupidity. When I speak of my stupidity, I do not refer to something that is innate, but rather to the false impressions that have cleverly stockpiled layer upon layer in my imagination. Whenever I travel to foreign countries to speak, I am invariably asked to focus on one central issue, just what is enlightenment? This thing, enlightenment, however, is a state that one cannot understand only through experience. It cannot be explained or grasped through words alone. Through practice, Zen training is not a matter of memorizing the wonderful words found in the sutras and in the records of ancient teachers. Rather, these words must serve as an impetus to crush the false notions of one's imagination. The purpose of practice is not to increase knowledge, but to scrap the scales off the eyes, to pull the plugs out of the ears. Through practice, one comes to see reality, and although it is said that no medicine can cure folly, whatever prompts one to realize I was a fool is in fact just such medicine. So, you know, he kind of begins talking slightly about enlightenment, and what he offers is not the definition of what enlightenment is, and in a wondrous way all the glory of enlightenment, but rather says as he matured, as he developed his practice, he became increasingly aware of how foolish he is or was. And maybe that's a flip side of enlightenment. The enlightenment, clear seeing of our nature, who we are, of seeing of a possibility, shows us also how we have been living. It shows us the foolishness we've been living by, the delusions we've been living by, the unnecessary attachments and clingings we've been living by, the unnecessary fears that we've been living by. And so it's really seeing something and seeing what is not necessary, and scraping the scales from our eyes, and seeing anew. So that was one kind of version of wisdom, someone who understood, you know, something. Another little piece of wisdom that I like, as someone once said, offered that a wonderful question to carry with you in your practice, as you go about your life. Sometimes teachers will give students one question, and they have to carry that one question with them, and until, maybe until they die, but to carry that one question with them as their guide in their spiritual life. And this one question that one person was given was, what is left out? What's left out? Ask that over and over again, what's left out here? What's being left out? Is my neighbor being left out? Is my feelings being left out? Is my environment being left out? What am I leaving out here? What am I leaving out of awareness? What am I leaving out of my heart? What am I close to? What am I... And so, you know, to hold that question over and over again and ask yourself that question is a wise question, and it can lead to wisdom if we really kind of apply it in all kinds of situations in our life, partly because many people find themselves closed, shut down, or turned away, or attached, or stuck in some way. And what's being left out is a kind of a question to kind of open up into a wider sense of reality. So Buddhism is a wisdom tradition, and wisdom is said to be acquired many different ways. Buddhism does not denigrate the kind of wisdom that can come from study, from teachings, from reading. In the old days, they would... they called it wisdom that came from listening, because they didn't have books. And there's one form of wisdom. It's the wisdom that can come from reading, or listening, or learning from others. And the second kind of wisdom is the wisdom that can come from thinking, reflecting about our lives, thinking about our lives, thinking about truth and reality of practice. And that also is not denigrated. It has a place in Buddhism to reflect and think and to contemplate. Sometimes I occasionally am around people who have done Buddhist practice for some time, who have some idea that they're not supposed to think, that thinking is somehow bad, and thinking is an enemy to spiritual life. But my own experience has been that thinking has been a very important part of my overall life as a human being. And I'm very grateful for my thinking. It's gotten to me certainly into plenty of trouble, but it's also something that has been very valuable. It's gotten me out of trouble too. Then the third kind of wisdom is the wisdom that comes from practice. And this is kind of a hierarchy. So the wisdom that comes out of practice is considered to be the most profound and most important or the most transformative form of wisdom. And this coming out of practice means that it's coming out of your own experience, your own life, your own practice. The Buddha once said, I can only point out the way, the path. You have to walk it. There are certain things that other people cannot do for you. So some other people, this guy says here in this book, he says other people can't pee for you. Certain things you have to do for yourself. And so in that category of peeing and things is developing deep spiritual wisdom. No one else can do it for you in the depths of it. You have to do it for yourself. You have to practice and engage in some way yourself. And that's acquired through practice, through engagement. And when you come to the five faculties, then a certain form of wisdom is the wisdom that comes from discernment. And discernment here is much bigger than thinking about something or understanding things analytically. In fact, thinking about things in meditation can be a hindrance to meditation practice, to analyzing what's going on in some analytical contemplative or cognitive way can get in the way. Though it might have a very important place in other parts of one's life. In meditation, we don't want to investigate or be discerning in a thoughtful way if it makes the mind more agitated. So what is discernment or what is wisdom here as these five faculties? As a faculty, it's something that we all have. It's something not only we all have, but it's operating all the time to a certain degree. And what we're asked to do in meditation is to strengthen it or highlight or heighten our capacity for discernment. It's said in the Buddhist tradition that sometimes that a mind which is liberated or a mind which is, they don't say it this way, but just say it lightly, a mind that's in a natural state that's not colored by greed, hate and delusion or fear or attachments. That's not trying to gain anything or becoming anything or push anything away. The mind is just at rest deeply with itself. Will also be involved in discernment, in the process of coming to wisdom, in cognition. Sometimes it's called the cognitive functioning of emptiness. And you can watch it. I see it in young children, very young children. Their minds are awake and alert and discerning and understanding what's going on in life. There's kind of curiosity. I'm amazed at my one and a half year old as fascination with tinker toys. There's a lot of discernment, a lot of engagement there. No one told him to do this. He's not being propelled by fear or anything. It just kind of seems like it's just natural functioning of his mind. So in meditation also, we want to kind of allow the natural functioning of discernment to move through us and not put it in hold or not squash it or inhibit it. One way of talking about this, I believe, is to say that we are supposed to bring our intelligence with us into meditation practice. That meditation practice is meant to be to use all your intelligence. Now we know nowadays that we have lots of different kinds of intelligences. It doesn't mean that you have to be intelligent. You know, some kind of comparative way like, you know, 180 IQ or something. What it means is that whatever intelligence you have, we want to use it. We want to engage it for the purpose of developing the spiritual life and developing the path of freedom and liberation. So as a five faculties, it's the discernment faculty which tracks and gauges how things are going. It's the discernment factor that discerns or discriminates or sees differences between what's going on. It's a discernment faculty that can notice, oh, right now I'm tense. It's possible not to be tense. This is what's useful to do in order to let go of my attention. It's a discernment faculty which will notice, oh, I think I'm straining. Mindfulness notices I'm straining in my practice. It's a discernment factor that says, oh, what would happen if I just relaxed my eyes, my jaw, my shoulders a little bit? Maybe that would help. I wouldn't strain so much. It's a discernment factor that kind of finds its way to how to make a correction, how to adjust what's going on. So mindfulness recognizes that, oh, I am pretty laxa-daisical in my effort here. I'm just kind of here meditating, but I'm not really here. I'm just kind of like my mind wander freely up and around and all over the universe it goes. And occasionally I remember to bring it back. But mindfulness recognizes not only that I'm not so present, but recognizing, I'm not really putting much effort into this. I'm not really that serious. I think it's enough just to kind of be sitting here and something will happen by magic or whatever. And then it's a discernment factor that says, oh, now that I've recognized that I'm being laxa-daisical, what is a wiser way, more useful way to be present in my meditation? Do I need to arouse more energy and more effort? Do I need to apply myself more in what I'm doing here? And maybe that's the case. But it isn't just simply asking, saying, do I need to apply myself? The sermon shows you how to apply yourself or suggest various ways. Oh, to apply myself, what I need to do now is sit up straighter. What I need to do now is to heighten my mindfulness, try to be more mindful, more clearly mindful moment by moment what's happening, have more continuity of mindfulness and more strength than mindfulness in the moment right now. So discernment kind of helps us find the way, sees the possibility of the way, sees the path in the forest, for example, or searches out the path in the forest. I believe to some degree this discernment is operating all the time. And what we're asked to do in looking at these five faculties is how to use discernment in a way that strengthens or heightens or improves or develops our spiritual life. And for that, and for the purpose of discernment, we need to know for what is the purpose or what is the goal that we want to be discerning. Wisdom is not just simply wisdom in the abstract, but there's a sense of a goal or a purpose or a direction that our life is about. And if you have a sense of a goal, then you can talk about being discerning. What is discerning? What is helpful for finding that goal, for pursuing that goal, for, you know, where is this, what, how do I find that? If I know I want to go to Los Angeles, then you can ask the question, which roads will take you there? But if you don't, if you know, you know, you want to go somewhere, but no one's told you where, then, you know, it's really hard to find your way. So some sense of where you're going is really necessary. And that's part of the wisdom faculty, is you already reflected and thought well about having really good sense of what you're doing and why you're doing it. The thing about this is that there's a lot of different things you could do that are wise. There's a lot of different spiritual teachings about what the goal of spiritual life is like, including wonderful spiritual teachings that say the goal is to have no goal. But that's also to have some sense of where the path is. Oh, the path is found in not having a goal. The path is found in not being, directing myself in any particular direction. But even that involves discernment. Oh, now, right now, I'm goal oriented. What I'm trying to practice is a goalless practice. I'm not trying to make anything happen. But that's what I'm, but my mind is trying to control what's going on. I'm trying to manipulate. Mindfulness sees that and discernment says, okay, how do I correct for that? What do I have to do here? Do I have to do nothing and just see it? Just be mindful and be honest what's going on? Or do I need to let go of something? Let go of my efforts. Let go of my will. Let go of the ideas I have of trying to improve myself. Let go of the ideas I have of self, of me, the one who's doing this thing here. So there's a process of engagement with our life, with our practice, which is enlivening. And part of what in all these five faculties is what enlivens the practice. We want to develop meditation to the point that we get absorbed in what we're doing. And getting absorbed in what we're doing is helpful if there's faith or confidence, if there's engagement, if there's mindfulness, if there's concentration, and if there is discerning, if there's questioning, if there's looking and wondering and exploring, how is this? What's going on now? And if you're really absorbed in this present moment experience and you find it's fascinating, you're not going to think about the future. You're not going to think about the past. So you're not going to plan your plan the next day or whatever you get caught up in. So discernment is one of those things that helps us get absorbed in what's happening. One of the important aspects of discernment is that it's self-correcting. And what I mean by that is that when you hear that part of meditation practice is to be discerning and to be looking and wondering and kind of looking, what do I need to do now? And how do I make a correction here? How do I let go of this? What's the right thing to do here? It can sound like there's a lot of doing in meditation practice. It can sound like there's a lot of efforting, a lot of technique, a lot of analysis, a lot of contemplation and thinking. And it can give you a headache because most people are already so stressed out that mostly what they need to do when they sit and meditate is to do nothing for the first 10 years just to cool out. And so it's very powerful to have a practice of practice of don't doing, don't have a goal, just let go, just be, just be here because we're so used to becoming and doing and getting and all these things. But it's discernment, hopefully, will tell you, oh, right now what I most need is not to listen to talk on discernment because that's just not what I need to hear because what I need to hear is just relax. Discernment is what tells you, oh, what's happening now in my practice is I'm analyzing and thinking too much. What's happening right now is I'm too controlling in my situation. I think I'm in charge and my controlling and thinking that I'm in charge just getting in the way. So using mindfulness to discernment together, it becomes self-correcting. We feel the tension, we feel the way in which we get contracted or get agitated by how we're practicing. And then we make a correction for that. We adjust for that for the purposes of becoming more peaceful, where the purposes of becoming more calm or more concentrated, more at ease or happier. So if you have some sense of what is useful to develop in practice, then you can kind of sniff your way forward to what is helpful to get there. And if you have a sense of developing peace and calm is really key to developing a meditative mind, then you use your discernment just to the extent that it helps you develop greater calm and peacefulness. Part of the goal of meditation is to develop a very still mind, which is also very vital. The image that's used in the ancient text is that of a candle flame which is unflickering. It doesn't move, just completely still, but you know that the candle flame inside is very dynamic. It's very bright and alive in a sense. And so the same way with a mind that's very still is also very alert. And so to use a sermon to see how can I cultivate a mind which is stiller? If I think too much about what I need to do, I'm not going to be very still. So how can I be discerning and still at the same time? How can I use that spectacularly of mind to lean into or feel my way into a place of greater stillness that's not dull, but actually is quite keen or quite charming? It's the role of mindfulness and discernment to know also when we should not be discerning at all. It comes to various points in practice where we should not even be involved in that activity of being discerning what's going on, but actually just leave things alone in some radical simple way. That's also an important place. So what is the role of mindfulness and discernment? So discernment, making a distinction, seeing differences and seeing which side of the differences are helpful and which side of the differences are not helpful. And then learning how to engage in what's helpful or pick up what's helpful or to let go of what's not helpful. And there's a lot of things that a wise life or a wise life can do. And so I think that's a very important thing. So for example, a person might discover that their life is a lot saner, a lot calmer if they meditate every day. And so they do the work, the reflection to see what would it take to set up my life so that I can meditate every day. That's a function of discernment. We're discerning, we're making a distinction between things, sanity and insanity. And we're figuring out, oh, this is what I need to do to develop more sanity in my life or more calm. And so then we do those things hopefully and set things up in such a way that we can do it. And then we sit down to meditate, for example. And we find out that in meditating, that the mind is just really, really agitated. So you could just sit there and allow yourself to just be with the agitation. It might be useful sometimes. Sometimes I do that. I just be there with my thinking mind, my restless mind. And just being with it, not doing anything with it, not pushing it away or fixing it or doing anything. Sometimes it's very wise for me because it just settles by itself. If you leave it alone, it quiets down. Other times I don't quiet down after a while. Other times I get a sense through my experience and my history of being with my mind, knowing it or whatever, that the particular kind of agitation I have right now, really what it does, it requires some careful attention. It's kind of like a friend who's agitated who just needs to be able to have someone to talk to so they can really hear you. Sometimes the mind needs some very quality attention from yourself. And so I need you to pay attention to this agitated mind, what it's like, the feelings behind it. Maybe there's fear or anxiety or irritation or anger or something, which is kind of fueling and keeping agitation going. You need to listen really carefully. That's what's needed right now. And then discernment maybe says, oh, well, how do I listen to it? How do I be with it? Do I do it just listen to the thoughts and the quality of my thinking? Do I feel the emotions or do I feel how it's being manifested in my body, the physical aspects of being agitated? So discernment kind of finds our way with the agitation, where to put our attention, where's the key, where's the door that helps us really connect with what's happening in a wise way. Or I'm sitting in meditation and no longer agitated, and perhaps I'm sitting there and the mind is beginning to get quite calm. And I find myself now the mind just kind of drifting off into kind of pleasant thoughts, kind of daydreams almost. And it takes a while maybe to catch on to that. And after a while, I catch on. I really, oh, you know, spending a lot of time just drifting off. My mind is just kind of daydreaming. And I could do this, but this is not particularly useful for me to have the mind drift so much. Maybe what I need to do is to really bring a keen mindfulness to the drifting mind, really see clearly what's this like for the mind to be kind of so kind of lethargic or kind of so calm, just drifts around. Or maybe what I need to do here is to try to just gently, very gently, because I don't want to lose the calm I have, but very gently try to arouse a keener sense of knowing what's happening in the present moment. Or maybe what I need to do is just develop a little more emphasis or oomph behind focusing on my breath, because I need to kind of have more energy in developing greater concentration. I'm already calm, which is good. Let's say if I can use that calm to get absorbed in my concentration, get really developed into a kind of more concentrated state, not just a calm state. And perhaps, you know, I'm calm and concentrated and very present. And then I notice other things going on. I notice, for example, I might notice, for example, how proud I am of my practice, my conceit. This is really great. I hope other people are noticing all this. And I say, you know, if I pay really honest attention to that thought of conceit, it's really unpleasant to have it. There's a certain kind of pleasure in knowing I'm the best meditator on my block. But, you know, that's a kind of superficial pleasure, because if I go underneath that pleasure, it's actually masking a greater sense of discomfort when I have that kind of thinking. So I'm making distinctions again between, you know, different aspects of what's going on. And I see, oh, you know, I don't think it's so useful for me to be caught up in this conceit. I could just let it go rampant, or I could do something about it. One thing I could do about it is just be very mindful of it. So mindful of it that I'm not caught by it. Another thing I can do with it is let go of it. I'll try to let go of it. Look at that. I let go of it. I'm so good. It's so tricky, you know, the mind, right? And then, and then I might notice that after, you know, eon of time, a long time, so finally this conceit to whatever this can begin to dissipate a little bit enough to see that, you know, I'm really everything that I experience, everything that is happening to me, I'm always understanding through the perspective of the self, myself. This is happening to me. I need to do something about it. I need to become a better person. It's a self-improvement project. It's, I'm trying to make it better me. I'm trying, you know, it's all about me in some way. I'm the one who's making the practice. I better, I better try more. I better be more discerning. I, I, I. It's great. It was great when I was living in Japan, learning Japanese a little bit, because I kind of spoke Japanese like I speak English. And, and Japanese very seldomly use the pronoun I. It just implied, you know, when you speak. So, you know, if I said, you know, going out the door, in the context you'd understand, I meant I'm going out the door, but you don't say the I, but I, but I didn't, you know, I couldn't quite do that. So I was always starting sentences Watashi wa, which is the way you say I. And it became so, you know, weird, you know, to always be saying I, I, I, I, I, I, I, because no one else said it hardly ever. And, but if I'd stayed in America, it wouldn't have seemed odd. Because we say I a lot and no one thinks twice about it, right? We're supposed to make I statements. And so you notice, oh, there's always eyeing going on, eyeing this, eyeing that. What would be like if I don't do that? Or let go of that? Or what would be like if I discover that part of life of my experience that's independent from eyeing. And there's various ways of doing that. One way, for example, is to notice is again, is to bring mindfulness to the process of eyeing. There's a lot of eyeing going here on here. Everything's about me. I'm having to the perspective of me. It's not exactly conceit, but everything's around me. My experience, my, I'm the one who's doing it. What is it like by just being very keen mindfulness? Really see this, be very honest and hold it in awareness for a while, this activity. Every time it arises, hold it. Just that. The number of things might happen if you do that. One of the things is it might relax and let go of. And you might find this wonderful thing of being present for reality without doing so through the thoughts or the ideas or the construction of a self that is experiencing things. And that's a really sweet thing to experience. The other thing that might happen is you might discover that mindfulness or the awareness which is aware of the eyeing is not the same thing as the eye. And what do you do? So what's that then? And then you can be discerning, see that difference between the awareness which doesn't seem to have any eye in it and the eyeing which seems to have a lot of eye in it. And what happens if I just kind of lean into that part of my experience where there's no eye, into that awareness where there doesn't seem to be any eye. You can't even say in awareness that you're aware or anybody is aware, just awareness kind of floating by itself in a sense. What happens is you just rest there. So what I was trying to paint here is a whole series of questions or explorations that is part of what discernment does. And that discernment is a very important aspect of human life and a very important aspect of the spiritual life in the Buddhist tradition. And sometimes it's called wisdom, sometimes I call it discernment, what's going on. And it's something I think to be treasured, something to be really celebrated and enjoyed as part, as aspect of human life when it's used wisely, when discernment is used discerningly. And today's talk was mostly a celebration of it or kind of focusing on highlighting that aspect of our life. Remember that the five faculties operate together. So even though the talk today was all mostly about discernment, you have to remember that this is one fifth of these five faculties, which have to come into balance and work together. If you overemphasize discernment and under emphasize the other four, you'll get in trouble. But you need to have them all four kind of working together. So there's the appropriate amount of calm or concentration, stability that goes together with the discerning. But there's clear mindfulness, clear seeing of what's actually going on. So the discerning doesn't get abstract or theoretical or and there has to be a certain amount of engagement or applying oneself. I can be very discerning and as I like to say, it can be like reading the menu. I can have all these ideas of what's useful to do and then I'll do anything about it. You have to order the food at some point. And discernment also needs to be together with confidence. And the confidence part is that part that's also connected to faith, which makes it a sermon to make sure this discernment is heartfelt. There's a heart, what we put a heart into rather than just some kind of intellectual exercise that we might think it is. Sometimes we hear about wisdom or discernment. We all have the capacity of living more than deeply peaceful lives, living lives which are liberated, connected to compassion. We all have the capacity of living lives which are sane. And the purpose of Buddhist practice is to become sane. I hope it all happens to you soon. To all of us. So excuse me for my foolishness tonight. Thank you.
