The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Hi everyone and welcome. This evening I want to talk about the topic of resolve.
And maybe resolve is a burdensome concept, like you have to work at something.
The ancient word for it is aditana. One person translated it, one book translated it as a
foundation. The word can mean something, literally can mean something like closer to the English
words to take a stand, to stand in something or a special place to stand. It's a place where we
kind of come out of, take our stand, stand on or supported by. And part of the value of this
resolve, some people translate it as a vow or aspiration, is that to the degree to which
Buddhist practice encourages us to let go deeply or brings us to a place where the ordinary idea
of self is not operating so much or where brings us to a place where we no longer can live with
some of the values we've been living with before, some of the orientations or purposes of our
life that we had before. It's easy to feel disoriented, it's easy to feel a certain kind of
what's the purpose or how do I orient myself now? The Buddha said once, you know, nothing
whatsoever is worth clinging to. Well, if nothing's worth clinging to, and I've been clinging my
whole life to something or other, to be motivated to know what to do, then what do I do with that
clinging? Do I just sit at home on the couch? You know, what do I do? And so in this kind of
context, Buddhism offers resolves, aspirations, vows, a certain kind of orientation and way to
live in the world that can guide us, can support us, can be a place to stand, standing place,
orientation, a foundation for ourselves. And in our early Buddhist tradition, there are four
resolves that are taught. And the idea is to stay close to these. These can guide us, these can
support us. So when in doubt, live with these resolves. And I think of them as being so important,
such a good foundation or place to come from, that if someone asks you, you know, what do you do? I
think in modern English, basically, they're asking you, what's your work? I think that's what they
mean. It's almost synonymous. But I think sometimes in our modern society, career and work is kind
of overrated sometimes, sometimes people's sense of worth comes from the worth comes from the work
they do, or their status or their, what, you know, their, their depreciation that people think, oh,
this person's special is because of their work they do. So someone asks you, what do you do? One
answer is you can say, oh, I do these four resolves, I stand in these four resolves. So they're,
they're that important that it's, you know, that might for some people be actually be more important
than a career or work that they would, this is this would be the guiding principles of a life.
So the four, there's four resolves. The first is to be resolved on wisdom. The second is to be
resolved on truth. The third is to be resolved on letting go or giving up, relinquishing.
It's a wonderful word, the Pali word here, because the word can also mean giving or generosity.
And the fact that these two, the word for letting go or relinquishing also means to give or be
generous is kind of a fascinating topic. And the fourth resolve is to resolve on peace. So wisdom,
truth, letting go and peace. These are worthwhile places take a stand or to be oriented. You can
ask yourself, as I'm sitting in any situation you're in, how do I relate to this wisely?
What's true here? What's really the truth here? What's the, the significant truth of the moment
that I'm overlooking and not noticing because I'm involved in my desires or my fears or my
planning for the future. But what's the truth of this moment? What is it that is appropriate to
relinquish here, to not hold on to anymore, to let go? And how is this letting go in the moment
here a generous thing to do? Not a diminishment of self, not a diminishment of our life or not
impoverishing us and letting go, but something that is generous. In generosity, maybe that comes
from a feeling of inner wealth, we have an abundance of wealth. And of course, we happy to
let go so other people make space. We don't, we're not impoverished. And then, then where's the
peace here? Is there peace in this situation, a peacefulness? Is there a place for that here?
Now these might seem kind of like maybe artificial or strange orientation to have as we go through
the life. But when we think about what many people are actually resolved on, maybe sometimes
unconsciously, they don't even know they're resolved on things, what people mostly do with
their lives and make the center of orientation of their life. These are pretty good resolves to
live by. Some people are resolved on greed. Some people are resolved on complaining and
hostility and blame. Some people are resolved on fear and anxiety. Some people are resolved on
hanging on to the past and memories and ideas. Some people are resolved on fantasies of the
future or delusions of grandeur of some kind or other or resolved on being safe. I like the little
quote, the little cliche that says that a boat is safe in a harbor, but that's not what the boat
was built for. So we know if we spend a lot of time trying to keep ourselves safe, we weren't
actually built to be safe, to be always safe. To be resolved on that, maybe we shortchange
ourselves. Some people are resolved on money and wealth, status, power, all kinds of things. Some
people are resolved on being loved, being respected. And some of these, of course, are not
necessarily wrong to be oriented towards. But if they're the center of the life, maybe that's not,
maybe we're missing out on something. Maybe we're diminished, but those resolves, if that's really
what we're all about. These four resolves, I propose, it's different that if we resolved on
those, they don't necessarily prevent us to do all other kinds of things. They don't replace
the things that we might do in our life. But if we take our stand in these four resolves,
that will radically change how we do all the things that we do. And maybe some of the ways
in which we engage the world are not so healthy for ourselves and for others. And to engage in
the world to do these things that we do, but to do it from a different orientation can be powerful.
So these four resolves. So the first resolve is wisdom. And this is to be wise about how we
view our situation, to be wise how we approach our situation, wise in what we do and how we
understand what we're doing. And just to ask that question, what's the wise thing to do here?
What's the wise approach to this? What's the wise way of seeing the situation?
And then it's almost like I can repeat myself in some of the ways that we view
are not particularly wise. If we look through the filter of our greed, ambition,
our hostility, our blame, our anxiety, and those aren't really wise ways. It doesn't help us see
clearly. It doesn't help us to see how to live usefully in a good way. So are there different
ways of seeing, different ways of relating to the situation we're in? Oddly enough, one of the wise
ways that Buddhism emphasizes to what we look for, what we study, is to study where the stress is,
to study where the dukkha is, to be wise to notice where there's tension, where there's suffering,
where there's pain. Not so we can suffer more, but so that we can... it's wise to understand
that it's happening, that it's there, so that we can be within a different way.
Part of wisdom is to be with what's challenging, with the stress of the situation
in order to understand it better, to understand particularly our contributions to it.
What are we doing that contributes to the way we feel uncomfortable, or stressed, or
afraid, or upset, or whatever it might be? And to... it's wise to study this,
wise to look at this, to understand it. And if there is ways that we contribute to our own stress,
then maybe we can let go of it. We know what it is. But if we ignore the suffering we have,
the stress we have, the tension we have, and we ignore then our contribution to it,
then there's no way of knowing what we can do personally to make the situation better.
One of the ways that's not wise is to spend a lot of time blaming others, being resentful,
or complaining about others. I'm certainly... I'm sure there are people who are definitely
appropriate to, I don't know, blame for things that happen in the world.
But if we're resolved always on blaming other people and never look at ourselves,
we once again limit our lives. We narrow our lives. And this movement of looking at ourselves
wisely, and where our suffering is, where our tension and grasping and clinging is,
and letting go of it, is actually a movement that opens us up, that there's the opposite
of limiting ourselves. It creates more an unlimited way of being in the world.
And so to be resolved on wisdom, and this is one of the... what I just described today was in the
core forms of Buddhist wisdom, that be wise about our suffering, or truth, to be wise about what's
true, to know the truth, to ask what is true here. And of course there's many things you can say is
true. You know, so someone asked me, you know, what's true in the moment here? I can say, well,
there's a blue tape within the floor that's crooked. And, you know, that's not gonna...
that's not the kind of truth that will set you free, unless you're a Zen master, they can say
things like that. But the... you know, but it's not gonna go that far. But, you know, if I'm sitting
here, what's true might be that I appreciate sitting here with you. I value that you came here today,
and I take your interest in the Dharma seriously, and I feel like I would like to
offer something to you that respects your interest in coming here. That's true.
That has a different feeling to recognize that than to recognize that
that someone put the tape down crooked. It's okay for me to say it, because I was the one who did it.
And the...
And I suppose what's true as well is that I have a teeny bit of apprehension, nervousness,
maybe a little bit, that here we are back in person again and teaching in person. And am I...
am I offering something that's useful for you and helpful and worthwhile your time to come here?
So I don't know how useful that truth is, but I recognize it that that's also here.
And so rather than having that concern be something that, you know, eats at me or
bothers me or inhibits me or, you know, I just recognize it's there. It's true. And knowing it's
true, then it's like, okay, you know, it's like, it's okay. It can accompany me. It's not going to
interfere with what I do here. I'm not caught up in it and concerned.
So I don't know if those are good examples, but the idea is to recognize that what's true,
what's really true here, what's true that has to do with our suffering, what's true about our freedom,
what's true about our appreciation of things, the love of the moment,
what's the truth that brings this moment that we're here into a kind of
fullness, into a life, into a place where we can meet other people and be connected and
feel grounded and feel like, feel like it's wonderful to be alive.
Is there a truth that would provide that for us? What if there is?
Wasn't that kind of sad not to stop and notice it and recognize it?
So discover what is true. And part of what the Buddhist tradition emphasizes is important
is to recognize the truth of where we're grasping, where we're clinging, what we're clinging to,
what we're resisting. Because if we recognize the truth of that, then there's hope to release it,
to look through it to the other side. But if we don't see the truth of that,
then we can't do that work. Sometimes it's the opposite that we can see as a truth.
We can see the truth of our freedom, the truth of our vitality and connectedness to ourselves,
to others, to the world that comes when we're not caught in the grip of clinging or resistance
or preoccupation. And to recognize that truth and to live it and connect to people and be present.
And then this truth of relinquishment, letting go. If I use the word giving up,
it might be kind of depressing. There are all kinds of relationship connotations.
But it has the word giving in it. And the word chagat, c-a-g-a, the word for
relinquishment also means generosity, giving. And you find that in Buddhism,
in the Buddhist language, it's all these words that have this double meaning, generosity or giving,
and then letting go. And we find that in English. The word giving up, apparently originally,
it was related to the word, the expression to offer something up on the altar.
Like some sacred thing. And I don't know if that's true, but that's what I've read.
And to offer up. We have the expression giving in, to give into someone. And it's, you know,
it's a little bit depressing that you're giving into someone, but they're going to have the word
giving in it. So maybe there's a deeper and wonderful way of giving in. On the freeway,
sometimes I like to give way to people. Someone's coming, you know, wants to merge into my lane.
And, you know, I probably have the right to be there. I probably, you know, you know,
it looks safe. And, you know, and I have the right. And that took a long time to get into
that lane. And not someone wants to get in front of me. They're coming off, getting out to the freeway.
You know, I could, you know, just kind of like,
me, insist that I get my way and let them kind of deal with the shoulder of the road.
But I like, what I like to do is give way here. You can have it, please. So to give way, give in,
give up. I don't know if there's other giving words, give attention. That's not giving up,
though. I like the expression giving attention. But to let go. So what can we relinquish here?
Where it's a, where it's a healthy, wonderful place to take a stand. Where do we relinquish?
Not so that we're diminished, but so we're somehow, we become bigger or more alive or more
present. Or life feels more worth living than being closed in and held down and holding on to
something. What are we holding on to? What are we holding on to? What are we clinging to when we're
feel socially awkward with other people? It's remarkable and sometimes offensive,
this Buddhist idea that I think it's Buddhist. Other people can say it too. That, you know,
certainly there's a lot of attachment when there's conceit of being special. But these
Buddhists say that there's going to be just as much conceit in being shy. That's what's kind,
that's kind of like, what? Shy people, aren't they? That's because they don't have much self
or they're kind of like, but there's still a concern with the self there. Where is it
appropriate to let go of self concern? Because the self concern we have is limiting us.
And certainly shyness can be limiting, but so can conceits of grandeur that I'm special.
Even if they people agree with you and so it feels pretty good, it's actually limits ourselves a
lot. It actually becomes a snare or a world to live in. And to let go of conceit. Wow, what a great
thing. And so what can we really, what to take a stand on relinquishment and let it be a kind of
generosity? What would it look like if there's a benefits, a form of wealth or happiness that
comes from relinquishment? To relinquish out of a place of abundance or to relinquish, to tap
into the sense of inner abundance that's not dependent on material goods or status or all kinds
of things. And that's one of the great possibilities of meditation practice is to discover in the
simplicity of meditation or to awaken a feeling of inner abundance that comes with that freedom,
that comes from a fullness, that comes from no longer limiting ourselves with fear and
all the different things we can limit ourselves with. And to both feel like relinquishment is
almost like an offering of that abundance outwards. It's not a giving something up, it's a gain.
I'm fond of the idea that I think some people when they think of letting go,
they think it means we're going to drop something. And in the teachings of the Buddha, as far as my
reading has been, I think it's rare forever he talks about letting go of anything. But he just
talks a lot about letting go of the clinging. And if you hold something and you let go of
the clinging to it, you might still be holding it. If you respect everything, you don't let drop
things. You hold it. And with this gesture now, this is a gesture of generosity, like here or
safety or something here. And then we can use our wisdom to know whether it should be given to someone
or put down or do something. But to let go, so with this movement, with the palm of the hand
facing upwards and just holding the whatever is there, rather than dropping something,
which maybe is not so healthy. But this, then we can put things down if we need to.
So to take a stand in relinquishment, that's generous, that releases a certain,
freezes a certain generosity, that maybe both comes from abundance and provides a sense of
abundance. And then the fourth resolve is the resolve of peace. And there is a really good time,
excellent time, to be resolved on peace. Really good. There's a particular circumstance where
it's really a good thing to do. The best time to resolve on peace is when it's better than the
alternative. And how often do you think that occurs? That it's better than the alternative.
If you have a better thing going on than peace, by all means, forget about the peace.
But if the alternative isn't as good, you might want to consider it. I like the word ease rather
than peace. Somehow the word, peace is nice, but ease has a, for me, a more embodied feeling.
It's also how I act, how I live, what kind of process that go on inside. There's an ease to
what happens. Whereas peace in my vocabulary feels a little static, where ease is more dynamic.
You might not have that associations, but take a stand on peace.
The alternative is to take a stand on war, on conflict. Take a stand on
being in opposition with reality. Reality is not cooperating. The weather is not good.
It's raining. Doesn't reality understand that today was not the day to rain? I had important
things to do. To be resolved on peace, one wouldn't then be angry at the clouds.
One would say, well, where's the peace in this circumstance? Where do I find my peace? Where
I find ease with whatever is going on? It's not an acceptance of the situation. It's not
condoning the situation. It's not becoming passive in the situation. But it is operating from a place
of being peaceful, being at ease, being calm, perhaps, tranquility, in engaging, in doing
the things maybe that we have to do. There are times in my life where I was younger, where
I was quick to be alarmed by situations, like, ah, we've got to do something.
So like I would call 911. I did a few times, like, oh, there's some terrible going on. We have to
call 911. And then after a few minutes later, I think, was calmed down. I looked at the situation
and said, there's not a problem here. So I hope that never happened to any of you. But the ability
to be peaceful or calm, let's us see the situation clearly. I haven't had this situation, but I have
a lot of friends who had dangerous things happen to them. And because they stayed calm,
there was some creative thinking that arose for them in the moment to take care of the dangerous
situation at the time. One person I know was being held up in San Francisco by some teenagers or
something and looked like a dangerous situation. And so the person suddenly found himself saying,
you're no Christian. What would your mother think? And that kind of stress, you know,
just stunned them a little bit. And then he ran away. You had a little moment there that
somehow got them off guard. So I don't recommend that strategy, particularly with
that, but something in him as a strategy, but something inside of him knew that that was to do
that. And so, you know, this creativity or this intuition or this kind of understanding situation
well, when we're peaceful, that we aren't if we're anxious. So someone might ask you,
you know, where do you come from? And conventionally, they might say, where were you born? Or where did
you grow up? Or where did you live last? Or where do you live now? But if you want to say what's
maybe where you're most coming from, if you're resolved on these, you can say, oh, I come from
a resolved under I come from the resolve on wisdom, truth, relinquishment and peace.
They might even ask you, who are you?
Oh, you might say truthfully, the one thing that seems more true than anything else.
It's not what they're asking for, but it might be more true as an answer that you might say to them,
oh, I'm, I'm the resolve on wisdom, on truth, on relinquishment, on peace. So these things
can be that central that you could answer that way. But chances are, if you did, you'd annoy
some of the people you say. So you probably shouldn't do it that easily.
The, but there might be some people seems appropriate. They might appreciate it.
They might be inspired because it's unusual in this life to have people who live
on really base root, root their lives on beautiful values, beautiful, inspiring values.
And I think that's what Buddhism is recommending and pointing to. It's not just a life of meditation,
a life of stress reduction, a life of being calm, but it's a life that's really rooted or centered
on some inspiring values and possibilities. And these four resolves can be seen as part of that.
And then when you had these experiences or where the self seems to dissolve or where
it seems like meaning is not found anywhere or disoriented from kind of having let go really
deeply, then these provide a foundation to hold you. These provide a place to stand. And you know,
it's okay. It's okay because I'm committed to wisdom, truth, letting go, generosity, peace.
And what a great place to come from. What a great place to be resolved. What a great place to
base one's life on. Especially if you can understand how these four resolves,
how healthy they are, how they really bring forth a kind of delightful spiritual health
to ourselves and the world around us. So four resolves.
If you have better resolves, great. And if these four resolves are the better alternative for you,
you might want to consider them until you find something better. They're pretty good.
You're not going to go wrong with them. So thank you. Those are my thoughts.
We have a little bit of time. If I just take five minutes or so, if any of you want to
ask a question or comment or say something about any of this, you're lovely to
hear your voice a little bit now. Kind of feels very special to be together.
Yes. And maybe also say your name when you start.
Hello. Ryan is my name. I think what resonated for me most what you're talking about was about
truth. And I thought it was an interesting contrast that you said kind of this objective
truth, like that there's a blue piece of tape on the floor. That wasn't as meaningful a truth
as this kind of subjective aspect of your experience. It was like the kind of feeling
apprehensive about what you're saying. That's not kind of an objective, objectively verifiable
truth, but it's almost like an opinion. I think from maybe our more standard way of looking at
things, those kinds of things you're talking about are like the less important facts. And so
just the fact that you're kind of calling attention to the fact that there's this like
aspect of our inner experience that is not even really a fact or it's just kind of an
aspect of our feeling tone or the way we're relating. That's kind of the most fundamental
truth. Like I thought that was really, really interesting. So thanks for saying that.
Yeah, yeah. I think that that's very important what you're saying. And the distinction you made
between facts and truth is very important. And I think I like to think of truths as being aspects
of the heart. So like lying about something is an aspect of the heart. It's kind of an illness
of the heart. And some people lie a lot. And you might say that in a way that's factual.
But you might also, someone might recognize, I really spent my life lying. I lived a lie. Boy,
I wish I knew that truth before. It's not just a fact then. It changes them in some deep way.
So in India, the Mahatma Gandhi, Gandhi coined this term.
It's the Sanskrit word is Satya Graha. And some people have translated it as the power of truth.
Some people, it's like adhering to the truth. So anyway, it's beautiful. I said, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody else? Well, thank you for being here. And I hope to
see you again sometime.
