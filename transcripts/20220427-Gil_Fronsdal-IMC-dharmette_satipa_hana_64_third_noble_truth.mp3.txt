The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood

So today I want to offer an alternative interpretation of the second noble truth.
The one that is how this truth is taught in the ancient teachings of the Buddha.
The more modern one is that craving is the cause of suffering.
That's the second noble truth.
The more common one in the ancient texts is that the second noble truth involves seeing the arising of suffering.
Seeing the appearance of it without any explanation for why it's there.
The search for reasons for causes is a little bit challenging at times and sometimes will lead us astray.
It takes us away from the simplicity of our experience in the moment.
There's certainly a time and place to look for causes for why things happen.
It's a wise life that understands conditionality and causes.
But it's also one that lends itself to thinking a lot and reflecting and analyzing.
The Satipatana practice moves us towards more and more really abiding in direct experience.
In direct experience, the idea of cause becomes less important.
You can still see it sometimes in the moment.
You see, oh Derek, I was grasping at something in the moment and I saw there was suffering in that grasping.
So you can see there the causality.
But there's another way of seeing and that is simply to see that suffering arises and that suffering ceases.
It appears and disappears.
And the Suttas emphasize this insight into arising and passing of many, many things.
Not just suffering.
Suffering is like the umbrella term perhaps for all the things we become aware of.
We see the arising and passing of the aggregates, the arising and passing of the faculties,
the arising and passing of perceptions, the arising and passing of thoughts, and feelings.
So it emphasizes the arising and passing of things, rising and ceasing of it.
And the simplicity of that experience is particularly valuable in deep, concentrated practice of Satipatana.
In ordinary states of consciousness, the world of cause, cause and effect, thinking about things,
is an all very common phenomena.
As the mind gets quieter and quieter and quieter, more and more focused, clear and clear,
it's not inclined to look at experience through the lens of analyzing it and reasons and cause and why and what's going to happen,
but become just a simple, simple experience of the moment of the river of change flowing by.
So I want to say again what I've said before that coming as a last exercise of the Satipatana Sutta,
I think we can assume that this exercise on the Four Noble Truths represents a deep level of practice,
a mature level of practice.
It's not easy to come into this as a beginner, this level of seeing this kind of insight.
And we get a sense of that from the refrain that we've looked at.
The refrain for each exercise talks about this very thing,
seeing each of the things we're looking at, the phenomena of the body, phenomena of feelings, phenomena associated with the mind,
and see it arise and pass.
And the aggregates, the hindrances, the fetters, the seven factors of awakening,
all those at some point, what we're seeing is they're arising and passing.
That's what's emphasized in the refrain.
And sometimes you start seeing it so quickly that the text talks about, first it says,
seeing arising, seeing, ceasing, and then it talks about seeing, arising and ceasing.
Rising and ceasing happens very fast.
In deep, subtle practice, the moment-to-moment experience of direct experience comes and goes.
And so when suffering arises in that kind of context, it's not overwhelming.
It's not so difficult because it doesn't persist.
It comes and it goes.
We appear quickly.
There might be this orientation that happens when we live in a world where we expect things to be constant.
We want to hold on to certain things for it to be oriented and know ourselves and know the world around us.
Know we're safe by knowing certain ideas are settled.
And so there might be a period of disorientation that some people feel as the mind gets quieter and quieter in meditation.
And the usual ideas, usual ideas of self, the things we're holding on to, depending on, are no longer available
because they had to be constant, some level of constancy in order to hold on to them.
But when things come and go, there's a whole different way that we're asked to relate to it.
So to see the arising of suffering is to see its contingent nature, to see it's not permanent.
It's not solid.
We can see that it arose from a time and place situation where it wasn't, didn't exist before, it arose.
And if you see it cease, we know that it comes a time where it's no longer to be there.
And that begins to loosen up the grip of the mind or the resistance of the mind, the fear of the mind that we have.
But we just start appreciating that there is the emptiness of it all, the freedom of it all,
the lack of that this is not something to be worried about or upset about or cling to.
And this deeper, deeper seeing of things arise and ceasing, the constant and constancy begins to loosen up the grip of our attachments.
Some of the deepest attachments we have, we had to let go of a lot of attachments to get to this level of meditation.
A lot of preoccupations fall away as we're getting concentrated and subtle.
And what's left is some of the deepest attachments, attachment to self.
Even attachment to life itself.
And those are all ways of interfering with the flow of change, becoming the flow of change.
And so as things begin to loosen up, massaged, relaxed, let go of, then there is more.
Then at some point there can be something in the mind gives away.
It's maybe a little bit like, say you're standing in the river, a real river, and the river is just flowing.
And you're walking deeper and deeper in the river, and it's not dangerous the current.
You know how to swim.
And you can just feel more and more the river flowing against your body as you walk out into the river, deeper and deeper and deeper.
And then you just feel more like you're very light, you're floating, it feels very comfortable.
But it gets deeper and deeper until you get to a place where it's deep enough that you're not touching the bottom.
And suddenly the current, the gentle current, picks you up and starts carrying you down the river.
As we let go into more and more the flow of change, there comes a time where the bottom is not there, and we start becoming carried in the current, carried in the stream.
And that's the meaning of the Buddhist idea of stream entry.
The word for stream, sota, means current. It's entering the current.
And it can be seen, the current of change that's always here.
I like to think of it the current of non clinging, non grasping, not holding onto anything, but then beginning to flow in a Dharma current.
The Dharma flow that starts flowing through us, because it's the Dharma current that we're in, is the current of non clinging, non grasping.
And this begins to carry us on a dharmic path, a dharmic life.
And so the third noble truth is the truth of the ceasing of suffering.
And it means both the seeing together, the arising and ceasing, the inconstant change and coming and going.
But it also represents at some point when the bottom of the river is out of reach, falls away, there's a more dramatic ceasing that goes on.
And it's a ceasing that changes things.
So for example, in the analogy of going in the river, when you're no longer touching the bottom and no longer keeps you kind of stationary,
then the current has a chance to carry you.
And so it marks a very important change in going across the river.
And so going into the river.
And so the third noble truth involves not just seeing the arising of ceasing of things, the constant coming and going.
But it's when we really become the coming and going, relax into it, that there's a more complete ceasing that is more than just the particulars of the moment,
but a ceasing that feels just much more holistic, more inclusive.
And this changes kind of the whole flow, the whole current, the whole understanding of what Satipatana practice is.
And I'll talk more about that tomorrow.
So the second noble truth has two meanings, and both of them are good.
They have their value in different contexts, often much more ordinary states of mind.
Seeing cause for suffering is very helpful.
In deep meditative states of mind, looking for cause just keeps the mind busy.
And there we want a deep meditative.
We want to just kind of rest in the current, the arising and passing of direct experience.
That's only possible if we have some level of stability and concentration that we're not distracted, we're not wonder off in thought.
We're really here.
And then we see we're living in arising and ceasing.
And now the second noble truth is the arising, seeing the arising.
And the third noble truth is really appreciating the ceasing, the passing.
First, initially kind of just as it comes and goes, the ceasing comes and goes, until finally the ceasing becomes much more comprehensive.
And then that opens the door, understanding for the fourth noble truth, the Eightfold Path.
And that will be the topic for tomorrow.
So thank you very much.
