 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. And just a feeling into really just what a beautiful thing and doing the practice together on a day like this. I just want to offer some appreciation and gratitude. So I want to continue to talk a little bit about being available. And this word, being available, was introduced to me by one of my teachers, Philip Moffat. And his teachers, and his students, who are also my teachers, Dana Di Palma and Tuwari Sala, the past few years doing some practices with them. This word was very prominent in their teachings. And over time, I found a lot of connection with this word. So today I want to maybe just share some multidimensionality of what it means to be available. I use an analogy. And so some of you may have played with young children and maybe you have your own. And had your own or you have watched them. And this analogy is like the parent or adult watching kids play in the playground. And so you're just there being with them and let them play in the sandbox or slides and you know, whatever may be there in the playground. You just let them do what they do. But you're there. They know you're there and you know you're there for them. And there's a sense of being available. It's a little bit like, you know, the parent or the adult being at the playground with the kids. And today I'm going to use an acronym to unpack this a little bit in this acronym of opera. O P E R A. So the first sense around being available is that sense of openness. That's the O. Being open to be there and not kind of the opposite of it is kind of like, you know, lightly clutch down or being closed down. And just kind of like when you're going to the playground and you're kind of relaxed and softened and open and do what's there and what's available, what's happening there. So there's a sense of being open to what is there. And then P is present. And so sense of you're right there for the kids, the play and everything that's happening. And you're not kind of drifting into, I don't know, your books that you brought along. You want to read the book or, you know, other things that may be happening. And so this being available evokes also this sense of being present and your own mindfulness practice with the means is mindfulness is a front and center here when you're available. And then the third letter, E opera spelled right, E stands for easy equanimous and some sense of equanimity. And for me, it was this sense of when you're in the playground, you know, you don't just go tinker around ordering around, you know, you should do this, don't do that. You know, you just sit there and let the kids be and let the kids play. And so there's a sense of, you know, whatever is happening, allow them to happen just as they are, it's not getting caught by, you know, big emotions and storms that may be happening or inside of us or, you know, some things that are really pleasant. You get caught up, you know, I don't know, an ice cream truck coming by and then all of a sudden you get off and go get ice cream. And so now you're not available for this. So there's a sense of being centered and equanimous with what is happening and not getting caught up by what is happening. And so that's another sense of being available. And then R stands for released or releasing. What is it releasing? It's releasing the agendas we may have, the expectations we may have and releasing control that one may have. And there can be a lot of this happening in our meditation on the cushion that somehow we want this meditation to unfold in some way that, you know, my mind is telling it. But this releasing has to do with sit back, sit back and relax and then let whatever happens show up as the way they show up. And so releasing the self centered agendas, releasing the control, releasing expectations. And so that's R. And then the last letter A, A here stands for a week. And so availability has a sense of a wakefulness to it. And so it's not like, you know, you're sitting on a bench watching kids and next thing you know, you're falling asleep, taking a nap and then you're not available. Yeah. So, so there's a wakefulness is there and there is some sense of participating with what is happening, but also not tinkering with it. So you're there, you're accompanying with what is happening and but then you're not going to fix anything. And that a wakefulness is available in this whole domain dimensions of availability. So that's opera open, present, equanimous, releasing, released of self centered agendas and then awake. This is not to say that those are, you know, necessarily all the dimensions to availability, but those are maybe just a set of pointers that I can offer today. And as you practice, kind of explore what it means for you in terms of being available to the practice. And overall, the overarching sense of availability is not to try to figure it out with our minds, but dropping in into our felt sense. Availability may have a felt sense in your body and it may be softened, but alert. And it may have some somatic resonance in you and may have some heartfelt quality in you. And for me, sometimes there's a sense of being available all of a sudden kind of the kind of heart space opens up ever so slightly. Kind of like a ready to receive something that's being offered by our life. And so explore this through your direct experience, the felt sense experience. And maybe also, you know, with that, letting go of trying to figure out and analyze it and let that tell you what it is. And we can also in our practice, and notice when we're not available. And so sometimes, you know, when we're sitting, we all have this kind of experience before, you know, when we're sitting down, all of a sudden, we're starting to work on the projects in, you know, for my backyard. And so now, all of a sudden, we are unavailable for what is happening here. And so there are also, it's possible to notice when we become unavailable to our lived experience. And so those are probably the words that I want to offer today as part of the practice and exploration. I invite you maybe even just, you know, throughout the day, periodically, drop a question. Am I available for this right now? Whatever this is that is happening right now. So I might be available. Ask this question gently. So I think those are all the words I have for today. sub.
