Practice Note : Noticing What Is Relaxed 
in the Body

Many people have a strong tendency to be selective 
about what they pay attention to. There may be many 
things to be particularly interested in or worried about. 
There are biases and ideas about what is important. 
And, often, people don’t pay attention to what is most 
useful. For example, people who worry a lot pay a lot of 
attention to their worries , even just the sensa tions in the 
body.  
 
One thing that is useful to do when you meditate is to 
give some attention to the place in the body where you 
feel grounded, stable, or centered. Notice where in the 
body you feel calm and settled. Spend some time to find 
the place in the body that feels like a resting place for 
your attention, a place that feels centered.   
 
Find that place, be with it, breathe through it for a while. 
See if you can use it as a reference point for anything 
else you pay attention to. It is as if you are being aware 
from that place in the body. Many people are aware 
from the control tower in the head, which is not usually a nurturing place.  
 
Then, see if you can feel in your chest, stomach, or 
torso a sense of stability and groundedness. Or, 
perhaps that s ense might be elsewhere, like in the 
hands or feet. Then have that as a reference point for 
whatever else you pay attention to. In this way, if you do 
pay attention to anxiety or something difficult, then it’s 
done from a context, a place  that is stable, c alm, and 
settled.  
 
This practice can be done either in sitting or in walking 
meditation. It can be done at any time  during the day. 
Then, hopefully, parts of yourself that have often been 
overlooked can become a support for you.
