So, this evening I would like to talk about the hindrance of restlessness and worry.
And it's the tendency of the mind to go elsewhere.
And I know none of you know anything about that on retreat.
In this road trip we're on, it would be like being at that in New England where you have
those roundabouts and you go around and around and around and around.
And so, it's that tendency of mind that's always on the ride.
Another image I have of restlessness and worry is like being in an amusement park.
And you've got all these speed rides.
You've got the roller coaster, the fast wheel, ferris wheel.
I remember growing up there was the one called the rotor or the rotor where you stuck to the
wall and it spin around really fast and then the floor dropped out and it's like, ah!
You know, it's nothing you could do.
You were just caught gravitationally against the wall and the speed and the floor dropped
out.
The good news is the ride ends at some point, so there's hope here.
So the characteristic of this hindrance is there's a sense of overwhelm and fear.
There can be agitation there, fantasy, exhaustion, high judgment, ambivalence, and then there's
just being downright bored with your own thoughts.
That's a big piece of the spin, just being tired of your own mind.
In the outer world, in the marketplace, sometimes what we see with someone who's taken the form
of this hindrance is that they are busy all the time and it's a particular way that our
outer environment supports this hindrance of being busy, busy, busy and active and multitasking
and doing a lot of things.
So there's a lot of reward around it.
A friend of mine that I work with says that he was embarrassed that his wife on Facebook
all the time is always listening, everything she's always doing and she's so tired and
she's doing all this stuff and she's getting all these things done and she's just so tired.
And I said, well, why is that such a problem for you?
And he said, because she's showing all the things that my mind does that I don't want
anybody else to see, so she needs to stop so I can feel better.
So there's that sense of this just speed and actually it has kind of a momentum and addiction
to it that moves very quickly.
The person that kind of embodies this in the marketplace might be prone to have an accident
where they bump into things or hurt their ankle because there's a sense of being out
of body then under run has an archetype.
We also worry about the world and we worry about our loved ones and we worry about ourselves.
There's things that we worry about.
These are, this restlessness and worry quality is a sense of trying with all your might but
not being able to get out of it, get off the router ride.
So we can see this in the world with different things that are changing before us like in
the climate and maybe with our children that are doing things that we can't control, things
that happen in our relationship that we just can't seem to make any difference and we're
kind of left with ourselves and the aftermath of it.
I read a statistic once that said that 99% of what we think is rehashed and then 80% of
that 99% is negative.
So that's the spin of it, that we're rehashing, rehearsing, repeating, reliving in this state
of restlessness and worry.
And what's really unique about this particular hindrance is that it tends to like to dance
with the other hindrances.
So you can have restlessness and worry and then it'll grab in a version.
So then you're in this state of being in that high speed of restlessness and worry with
that twinge of ill-will and hate or it can attach itself to greed.
So there's the wanting mind, our sloth and torpor.
And as Gil will speak about tomorrow, doubt.
So any one of these other hindrances can add a particular flavor to the experience of restlessness
and worry.
So it's really good to notice how that plays out.
And the world is just one big nervous system in a way.
We're always kind of touched by other people and I've been in a major state of restlessness
and worry as I've prepared for this retreat.
Can you just imagine sitting next to Gil?
I just have to say this because I've been preparing for this since he invited me a year
ago.
This is my secret.
You've been coming in and telling me about your restlessness and worry.
I'm going to tell you about mine.
So he sits here without a note anywhere to be found.
And if I don't write my name down, I'm not going to remember what it is sometimes.
And everything that comes out of his mouth is golden and just jewel-like.
And I sit in my chair and I shrink into something like a little raisin that I put out on the
table yesterday morning.
And then my mind kicks in, you know, oh my gosh, I think I'll leave now.
What could I possibly have to say after Gil, you know, the person whose iPods I've been
listening to for a long time.
So there's something about how we compare and contrast ourselves with this restlessness
and world swirl.
There's actually a distortion of scale that happens where we, what we see is not really
quite what we think it is.
So it's a funny kind of thing that happens because the activity of restlessness and worry
is actually trying to maintain a sense of self.
So there's selfing activity that's going on with the restlessness and worry.
There's an attempt to maintain a sense of self because the alternative is unknown and
frightening.
So the activity is actually intending to hold it together, the sense of self that we have.
But it doesn't work, you know.
And we can't stop.
We can't seem to ever get it right.
There's that addictive quality about it where there's just enough delusion in it to have
you believe that if you just keep working harder at it, something might happen because
there was that one time where you were really working hard at this and a really brilliant
thing came out of it.
So you believe that if you just keep on with it, if I just revise this talk on five more
times, I'll be like Gil.
I'll be able to come without notes.
It's probably going to be in another lifetime, but that's all right.
So there is that sense of measuring and comparing and judging and hoping and shrinking and, I
mean, it's all in the spin of restlessness and worry.
We're all one big nervous system.
We can also become restless and worried when we're out of our sense of integrity.
And this can happen on this practice because what happens when we're practicing is we learn
a lot.
We get a lot of information about these amazing teachings.
And then we compare ourselves to whether we're there or not.
You know, these teachings were meant to be a life's work.
You know, many lifetimes actually.
But when we hear them, we think we should be there already.
So then that gives us a nice perpetual kick in the behind where we're always not quite
measuring up to what we think should be happening.
So that's a piece of it.
So we know the teachings.
We lose our capacity to witness what's happening because we're swooped up by it.
And then the principles that we know to be true are just hard to live with any length
of momentum, especially when we're swooped into restlessness and worry.
So our view is distorted.
The Buddha said that restlessness is worry, and worry is like water full of dye.
There's a certain distortion when you look at the water, and it's unclear.
And that's what we're dealing with.
It's kind of a weary manifestation of clinging, the worry-ness aspect of it.
And there's a version that we have towards the unclarity, towards the uncertainty that
is occurring with restlessness and worry.
We don't know what's going to happen.
We don't know how to put it to rest.
And so we wear ourselves out.
The other thing that happens with this hindrance is that we worry about our restlessness.
So not only is this the hindrance of restlessness and worry, but we worry about our restlessness.
It becomes a vicious cycle.
So this selfing piece is useful because there's an attempt to clone ourselves so that we can
replicate ourselves and feel a little safer in our world, but it doesn't always work.
We're frightened of the emptiness that is in the absence of restlessness and worry.
Now this is an activity of mind.
We're not doing it on purpose.
It's just kind of the thing that the mind does.
But we hop on it, like Gil was saying earlier.
We hop on the boats that's floating down instead of staying on the banks.
But we're hoping that we can replicate ourselves and secure ourselves and reassure ourselves
for some future time.
But the Buddha taught that the self was never real, that we appear solid and concrete, but
that's an illusion.
And that who we are and what we are is a series of processes that are constantly changing
all the time, constantly changing.
I knew I was in trouble as I was preparing with this retreat.
The night before I came here, I had a dream about identity theft, was a dream about identity
theft.
I was in the back of this SUV and with two people and then the people came and robbed
the car and took us away to this really huge warehouse that was immaculate and clean.
And there were a bunch of people in there.
They actually looked like they were having a good time.
But everybody was stripped of everything.
Every piece of ID and everything was gone, clothes were gone, everything was gone.
And they were in this big bin over here and they were like being repurposed, all of these
pieces of identity.
And then everybody else was just sitting there having a good time and it got the sense that
they had been there a long time.
So it was almost like identity theft is not so bad.
I mean, there is another place I could be living without my stuff and my stuff can be
repurposed somewhere.
Maybe somebody else wants it.
The truth is that we can't control what happens.
We can't control, you know, all of it.
We can't control our thoughts.
We can't control our lives.
We can't control how we respond to it.
And I love what Donna Fauves has to say about this.
She says, there is no controlling life.
Try corralling a lightning bolt, containing a tornado, dam a stream and it will create
a new channel.
Resist and the tide will sweep you off your feet.
Allow and grace will carry you to higher ground.
The only safety lies in letting it all in.
The wild and the weak, fear, fantasies, failures and success.
In the choice to let go of your known way of being, the whole world is revealed to your
new eyes.
So that's a particular way we can look at how we hold things and the promise of the
letting go.
And the task of meditation is to discover and see the true nature of who we are, to
see that there's a lot more there than our sense of what we're seeing.
There's a lot more to what's arising and passing away than our clinging to it.
The idea here is not to try to eliminate restlessness and worry.
Because if you could do that, you would have done it by now.
You could be there already.
So it's not that we are trying to make it go away.
We're looking at how we have a new, a different relationship, a more wholesome, a more liberating
way of being with what arises, regardless of what it is.
The idea is to relax the grip on the ego, to relax the grip on the ego.
Because the contraction that happens around us, the suffering that happens is very burdensome
and it weighs us down.
And there's a way that through our practice we want to balance the ego's need to do things
with our inherent capacity to just be who we are, to just be.
So there's a few strategies I'd like to offer around this hindrance of restlessness and
worry.
The first one, I think, is to really bring the practice of mindfulness into the mix in
a big way.
And here's a way to kind of hold experience.
Banti Gunanatara, in his book on mindfulness in plain English, talks about the quality
of mindfulness, especially as it relates to this sense of spaciousness and fixation.
And being what happens when we are really kind of taken away with restlessness and worry.
He says it this way.
He says, awareness happens just before you start thinking.
A flashing split second just before your eyes focus and your mind, your eyes focus just
before you focus your eyes and your mind on the thing itself that's arising.
Just before you objectify it, clamp down on it mentally and separate it from the rest
of existence.
Just before your mind says, oh, that's a dog.
The few seconds just before you conceptualize it as a thing is mindfulness.
This soft, unfocused awareness contains a very deep knowing that is lost as soon as
you focus in and fix your mind and objectify the object as a thing, as a dog.
Once the mind perceives, mindfulness is quickly passed over.
And mindfulness practice teaches us to prolong that moment of awareness.
So this is the experience of restlessness and worry can feel like we're really locked
in on the object of what's arisen.
You know, we're kind of fixed in it, we're in it, we're up against the wall with it.
And what Bantiji is suggesting is that we open that lens to see that there's something
to be seen before that happens and as that subsides.
And the minute that we lock in on the object, then mindfulness is lost, so the view is narrowed.
And the idea here is to open the view, to put a little space around what we're worried
about, what we're experiencing so that we can see more clearly.
There's another poem by Wallace Stevens who talks about 13 ways of looking at the black
bird and he says it this way, I do not know which to prefer.
The beauty of inflections are the beauty of innuendo.
The black bird whistling are just after.
So the beauty of inflections has to do with the foreground and what's arising.
The beauty of innuendo has to do with the background just after.
So we want to see not just one or the other, but what's it like to not have a preference
to see the wide open space of awareness.
So meditation, this practice we're doing, gets the mind out of the way so that we can
focus on a wider experience.
And the Buddha teaches us that we don't have to know as much as we need to tolerate not
knowing.
We need to look at how we tolerate not knowing and break ourselves out of the trance.
So another thing, another strategy here is to not believe your thoughts.
So because the thoughts can be distorting, it could be a distorted view.
And some of this is looking at our relationship to what it is that we believe.
So I saw this thing on Facebook that said, my doctor asked if members of my family suffered
from insanity, I replied, no, we all seem to enjoy it.
So what is our relationship to what it is that we believe?
And Winnicott says that we are poor indeed if we are only sane.
That's another way of looking at it.
But there's a term, Pappanta, in our tradition that talks about the proliferation of thoughts,
elaboration of thoughts.
So it's kind of like being at the amusement park and you know the cotton candy machine
where you start with the skinny stick and it goes around the cotton candy before you
know it.
You've got this big thing of mostly sugar that you can carry around now.
And Pappanta is the proliferation of thoughts and we can run off in big ways with our thinking.
And Mark Twain, of course, says that I've suffered a great many catastrophes in my life.
Most of them never happened.
That's another way that we're with this sense of not believing our thoughts.
Can we not believe what arises?
And this whole sense of scale and distortion happens and we can see it sometimes very immediately
like I was raised in a family of eight in South Central Los Angeles and my mother worked
a couple of jobs so my oldest sister kind of took care of us and she hated that job.
She wanted to do other things than other people.
So when I was growing up, I just experienced her as this huge frightening, oh, I mean
I was scared of her most of my life, just scared of her.
And it would take me a few years, I'm not going to tell you how many, before I can actually
put into perspective, this practice had a lot to do with it, that she was only a couple
of years older than me and a few inches taller.
But my experience of her, my mind experience of her was huge.
She was so much bigger than she actually was.
And I could then see that she too had her own form of suffering that she was living
with.
So restlessness and worry is like the other hindrances, they're meant to be touched and
known and to know your particular regular visitors, you might have a top 10 list, you
know, a little playlist in your mind that plays regularly around like, do you love me,
you know, or do I measure up, you know, or whatever the tears of a clown.
I mean, you know, you know, whatever the playlists might be to become acquainted with, what is
the recurring themes that I dance with, you know, what are these, let me give them a proper
name so they can know that they're welcome.
I can't help myself, that might be another playlist, you know, so just become acquainted
with the themes and to actually be entertained by them, you know, to see them on the big
screen and to allow them to reveal themselves to you.
Another thing we can do, I think it was recommended a little earlier in the week is to drop the
object of our agitation.
If we can, sometimes it's difficult to do this, but the idea is to drop the storyline,
the object, sometimes it's outside of ourselves, oftentimes it is, to drop that and then turn
inward to see how it lives on the inside.
How does restlessness and worry live on the inside?
What's that like?
And what you see when you move in close there is you see how you suffer very directly.
That's how you know restlessness and worry when you can touch how it lives loud inside
of you.
It's not just a projection or a story outside of you, it's very much an experience that
we can come to know.
And we want to look at that with a sense of relaxed and tender awareness.
Gil led a beautiful guided meditation earlier today that took us into the subtlety of experiencing
these tender ways we are touched by what arises and how we can sit on the bank and watch it.
And it doesn't mean we don't feel it, it means we're not being taken away by it.
And the other thing that's important in dropping the object of our agitation and allowing ourselves
to experience is to also open our awareness again with the mindfulness idea, open our
awareness enough to see when it's no longer present.
This is, and worry is not a forever state of mind, there are times when it's not there.
So we want to become acquainted and not be surprised when we find that, oh, I'm not stuck
on the wall, the ride's over, the floor's come back up, we can rest there.
And those are moments of freedom when we touch in there and surprise ourselves with
our own seeing.
What's important is to stay in the present moment as much as you can.
And don't get ahead of yourself or behind yourself.
Alan Watts says that the past and future are real illusions.
They exist in the present moment, which is what there is and all there is.
Maybe 15% of our time is on the present, where we are open to both fear and magic.
Fear and magic.
My Tibetan teacher said to me once, she says, don't feed the fear.
So she told me this story about the Buddha who was tossed out of a 200 story burning
building.
And right around the 100th floor, someone, you know, saw him coming down and she leaned
out and said, oh my goodness, are you all right?
You know, that impulse, are you all right?
And the Buddha replied, so far so good.
So the body and the breath is always right there with you wherever you are.
Be mindful of the body and the breath and to notice, allow and relax moment to moment,
breath by breath.
These are moments of freedom.
You might ask, where in the body do you feel safe?
You know, maybe that can be a question that you ask right where you find yourself.
Stuck, where in my body do I feel safe?
And noting can be a beautiful way of cutting the storyline and kind of simplifying what's
being seen.
So it's like a sword that cuts through all of the chatter of the mind and you can just
name what's happening.
Here is a mind that is thinking, thinking, planning, fantasy, fear.
It's like this, being right there so far so good.
Another way of noting is to just name the feeling tone, the shortcut of pleasant, unpleasant,
neutral, pleasant, unpleasant, with things arising and passing away.
Another strategy to keep in mind is that often restlessness and worry is rooted in deep love
and care, that what's underneath that agitated mind is a huge capacity for love and care.
So we want to feel into that and become acquainted with this part of us that cares and it's not
always so easy.
But the idea is to bring an atmosphere of warmth, compassion and non-resistance to the
moment, warmth, compassion and non-resistance to the suffering that you're feeling and the
deep capacity to care.
One way we can do this is to explore our relationship with calmness.
Being an aversive type, I didn't have any language about calmness for the longest time
but here's a few reflection questions you can consider.
What supports you in being calm?
Since you've been here on this retreat, when have you felt the most calm?
How much importance do you give to calmness?
Sometimes we fast forward through looking for the thing to something else to arise.
Part of the most common conditions that cause you to lose your calmness.
So during practice one of the things we can do is turn into any feelings of calmness that
we have to be acquainted with those times when things are calm.
One of the most amazing things that happened to me this year was actually coming here to
this retreat a few months ago to the teacher's retreat and we went on a whale watching outing.
We got on this boat and we had a guide and they took us out on the ocean, it was just
pretty amazing.
It was on my bucket list so I was just like in heaven.
And one of the things that was such a surprise was the whales had a certain rhythm.
And the guide was teaching us about the rhythm of the whale so they had a pattern of coming
up a little, then coming up some more, showing more of the body.
And then there's the crescendo of the tail, you know, so everybody's waiting to see,
oh when is it going to come again?
And then it declines back into the ocean and disappears and it's like what happened?
And then we're all waiting to see it again.
But the interesting thing that happened was when it declined into the ocean it left a
footprint on the top of the water.
It was this huge smoothness on the surface of the water after it descended.
And all of the other waves all around the ocean continued.
But there was this clearing of smoothness after the whale or the thought left its appearance
to us all.
And it stayed like that for quite a few seconds and then the rest of the ocean just kind of
caught up.
But that was amazing to me.
And that's how I can see calm happening where, you know, we might be surprised by calmness,
but we have to keep our eyes open to see that it's actually right there.
And that happened again and again, the whale was leaving a signature of calm.
And we knew something big had been there.
So calm can be a delightful surprise that touches us deeply.
Another thing to think about is the Buddha.
The Buddha in its iconology is an image of serenity and peacefulness.
The dignity of the posture, the sitting steel, in its own right has a quality of calmness
just to place your attention there.
I remember living here in Santa Cruz many years ago, you know, Santa Cruz was a place
where you went not only to indulge in spiritual materialism, but to actually have some enlightening
moments every now and then.
But I remember living back here, it was in the eighties, and I was just trying a lot
of different things while I lived here.
So there was dreams and there was a yoga and there was, you know, I was right out of graduate
school, I was just so lit up about all of the experiments of spirituality at the time.
I remember going to a breath workshop.
And there was this image that I had that night after going to sleep of this Buddha, I didn't
know it was a Buddha image at the time, but it was this big guy on a little flower on
a lake and it had big ears and it had my face on it and it was floating around on this
lake very serene like.
And what was amazing is that there was this thunder and lightning and all this showering
of things and actually the lightning and thunder had images of people on it that I knew, you
know, coming down on on me on this image on this little flower, the flower was just slowly
turning this way and that.
But what I remember most poignantly is that the image was was unmoved by it.
And this was at a time in my life where I was pretty moved by everything.
So to see an image like that in this dreamlike state was very powerful for me, but the power
part was because I recognized it as something that I was and wanted more of.
So I think that was my first introduction to Buddha nature before I knew anything about
the Buddha seeing this image here.
And the idea of some of the images that we see of the Buddha is a sense of equanimity
to stand in the middle of things and not be knocked off your center to when you don't
have the need to interrupt or interpret or make things other than they are.
The Buddha said that the earth is my witness tomorrow.
One of the beautiful things about the equanimity practice and Buddhist teachings of the Brahma
Viharas are statements like this, whether I understand it or not, things are unfolding
according to a lawful nature.
Things are unfolding according to a lawful nature.
All beings meet their joys and sorrow according to a lawful nature.
And there's a certain letting go that I feel when I practice with these statements.
Things are just as they are.
No matter how I might wish things to be otherwise, things are as they are, a sense of letting
things be.
May I accept things as they are.
So the idea is to rest tenderly in what is occurring, to rest tenderly there, to establish
a sense of stability and being in your seat.
And after we've had, you know, there's times when we know a lot of things and we've done
a lot of things and we understand a lot of things, it's time to just kind of let some
things go.
And I like this little autobiography in five short paragraphs.
Some of you've probably heard this by Portia Nelson, it goes, I walk down the street, there
is a hole in the sidewalk and I fall in.
I am lost and I am hopeless.
Chapter two.
I walk down the street, the same street.
There's a deep hole in the sidewalk, I pretend I don't see it.
I fall in again.
I can't believe I'm in this same place.
Chapter three.
I walk down the street, the same street.
There's a deep hole in the sidewalk, I see it there, I still fall in.
It's a habit I guess.
But my eyes are open.
I know where I am.
Chapter four.
I walk down the same street, there's a hole in the sidewalk.
I walk around it.
And chapter five, I walk down another street.
So after a while with these, with the hindrance of restlessness and worry, after we know it,
you know, sometimes we can just say I'm not going there, I'm not to date.
Thank you, Mara.
Just sit down here next to me, let's work something else out.
Just not going there.
And another strategy is to find, is when we find our way and feel our way through a sense
of silence and stillness, and this is again, returning to the mindfulness.
The calm, still place of awareness that Gil offered us earlier today.
And we find this oftentimes in solitude, where we discover life as it unfolds here and now.
I like what Bill Hooks have to say about this.
She says, knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving.
When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape.
And this includes our thoughts.
When we can be with our thoughts, we can befriend our thoughts, when we can allow them, then
we don't have to use them as a means of escape.
And this kind of leaving yourself alone or the sense of stillness, staying on the riverbank,
as Gil said, can be a beautiful foundation for exploring restlessness and worry and also
freedom.
So there's nothing wrong with restlessness and worry.
It's just the thing that the mind does.
And the idea is to allow it to be there without interference, elaboration, proliferation, believing
it to be the absolute truth or a permanent truth.
But when we don't acknowledge restlessness and worry, we miss that we're suffering.
And we also miss when we're not suffering.
The Buddha said that freedom from restlessness and worry can feel like being free from all
debt, including material hunger and consumption.
That's what we get when we are no longer clenched and so solidified by this hindrance.
The Buddha says nothing whatsoever is to be clung to as I, me, or mine.
And in the absence of restlessness and worry, one abides unagitated with the mind inwardly
peaceful, unagitated with the mind inwardly peaceful.
It doesn't mean things are not happening.
It means that we are still on our seat with open eyes and open hearts.
So let's sit together for a few minutes.
Let's get started.
You
You
You
You
Whether I understand it or not
Things are unfolding according to a lawful nature
You
All beings meet their joys and sorrows according to a lawful nature
You
You
You
You
You
Things are just as they are
You
It's not our work to force someone's growth to our liking
It is the work of love to admire the beauty before you
You
You
You
You
You
May I rest tenderly with what is
You
May I rest tenderly with what is.
May I rest tenderly with what is.
May I rest tenderly with what is.
May I rest tenderly with what is.
May I rest tenderly with.
These few words are enough.
If not these words, this breath.
If not this breath, this sitting here.
This opening to the life we have refused again and again.
Until now. Until now.
Until now.
