So continuing this series on
respecting anger, being wise to anger. I think there's a lot of wisdom to seeing
anger as a signal, as a message, as a messenger. And to see anger as a signal
means that when then we would slow down in order to see what is it a message of,
what is it a signal, what is it a symptom of. And rather than giving free
rain to anger, giving in to anger without a deeper reflection and looking, in
mindfulness practice you want to kind of stop for anger. It's kind of like a bumper
sticker would say, I stopped for anger. In order to really attend to it and see
what's going on, there's a lot of energy and anger. And that energy that we
have, we want to be able to use in a healthy way, an appropriate way. And it's
not always appropriate for ourselves or healthy for ourselves to follow along to
give in to the anger and the expressions of anger as it kind of wants to do it
without some deeper respect and attention to what's going on there. And so I
think it's a good policy to think of anger as an invitation to stop and take a
deeper look what's really going on here. So there's two very interesting areas of
what can be about anger I feel. And so first in terms of what else is going on
here is that anger can be a reaction to something we're feeling inside. In fact
it might be useful to assume it's always a reaction to something we're
feeling inside. Even though overtly we might think we're being angry at
something outside of us, we might be angry at the technology and it's
because technology is fault that I'm angry. But the byways of anger is that
the technology, I'm just making this up, it didn't happen this morning, but the
technology is not working. And that not working meets my desire for it to
work, to have everything go smoothly. I have a certain kind of desire to
experience the technology, use a desire, technology. And that desire then is
frustrated. And that frustration is uncomfortable. And that discomfort is
something I don't like to feel. So now I'm reacting to the discomfort, to the
frustration, and I want to fix something in the world. So and that gives birth to
the anger towards the technology. Or it could be that the technology we have is
very important for us and without it working properly what rises inside is
fear. And the fear is uncomfortable. And so then we can, and so it could be that
the anger arises because we don't like to be uncomfortable. It isn't so much that
we maybe don't like to be afraid, but we just simply don't like to be
uncomfortable. Or it could be that we feel don't like being afraid. And so
we're blaming something, we're attacking something, we're directing
our anger in some direction. And it could be externally, it could be
internally. And there's all these different emotions, difficult, uncomfortable
emotions we can feel inside that are too uncomfortable for our system to feel. And
so we want to blame, we want to the outrage of anger, the strength of
anger can arise out of inability to stay present for something that's
internally uncomfortable. So the message of anger in that case is just that.
There's something happening here that I'm uncomfortable to feel. Don't be
sidetracked by the so-called technology, that which is external, because
whatever's happening external is going through a few different steps inside of
you to become anger. People are very, I've noticed over the years of being a
Buddhist teacher, people are very quick to justify anger. And inevitably if I
gave a talk on anger, it seems like someone always want to justify, isn't it
okay to be angry in certain circumstances? And yes, depending on how we
define anger, it's never okay to be hostile. But what it misses when we
justify even justifiable anger, it misses an opportunity to understand ourselves
better. And that's what we want to do in this mindfulness practice. And as we
understand better the steps internally that happen before anger occurs, then
it's also possible to stop earlier. If there's fear, to stop and experience the
fear, and discern is there another response to fear, another way of going
forward that doesn't require anger when there's fear. If there's
frustrated desire, when we recognize that, is there a different way to go
forward rather than get angry at technology? Can we reassess the desire?
Can we have a different relationship to frustration? Maybe one possibility is
just let ourselves be frustrated and not have that expand or grow into what we
would call anger. So anger that has is a message sometimes of what's going on
more deeply within us. Sometimes anger is a sign that we should look and see
what's happening in the world, that the world does need our attention, that
something is the source of the anger in the world. And that also has to be
taken into account. And maybe it can be seen and understood and responded to
better when we have kind of relaxed around the anger and looked at the fear
or the discomfort or the loneliness or the despair, all the uncomfortable
emotions that might be the trigger for anger. If we can learn how to breathe
with those and rest with them, then we can look out towards what's happening in
the world and not act unconsciously from the anger, unwisely from the anger.
And then study. What's happening here? What's the situation like? So one of the
things I like to use anger for is a reminder to study. Study the situation.
Study what's happening in me, studying what's happening externally. I want to
say a few more words about this inner study to oneself. So I said anger is
often a result of difficult emotions that are preceding it in a sequence of
steps. But sometimes anger is the preceding step for other emotions. So for
example, we might feel angry. And then the reaction to that is to shut it down,
to be ashamed or to be embarrassed or to be afraid, to be angry towards the
anger. So there can be the reactions to anger which are not so healthy. Many
years ago I read someone who claimed that the most common cause for psychosomatic
illnesses is repressed anger or even just anger by itself. People get angry
enough and they can have a heart attack. And so sometimes depression is a
symptom of repressed anger. And so for some people giving certain degree of
freedom to anger that's been repressed is really important. And so
discovering their anger is necessary. I mentioned earlier, many years ago
someone taught me that we experience our strength. There's strength in anger.
And if we let go of anger too quickly, we might let go of our strength as well.
And the strength we want to keep. And so if we are too quick to let go of
anger, we might be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. And that's why
I find it invaluable to do for myself one of two things if I'm
really angry. One is to sit and meditate and really take it into account and
really be present for it. And the other is go for a long walk. And there's
something about the long walk that allows the anger to have different kind
of freedom than when I'm meditating. And it courses through me. And I
just kind of keep into my body, keep paying attention, being here for it
until something deeper about it is revealed. Until I understand some key
part of it that's the trigger or the key thing that's holding it in
place. So anger as a messenger, anger as a signal to be respected as such. And if
we repress our anger and hide our anger and we just get bottled up. And it
can be very unhealthy psychologically and physically. So giving some
expression or some expression is the right word but some allowance to feel
anger and be angry for some people is very important so they can study the
anger. So they can stop and look at it more deeply and see what is going on
here. So anger as a signal, anger as a messenger, anger is always a secondary
phenomena. A secondary response to something. Often a secondary response to
discomfort, some kind of discomfort that we're experiencing inside. And that the
anger to things in the world or even anger towards ourselves probably has
gone through a number of steps before anger arises. Some other emotions, other
attitudes, other beliefs in sequence happen until it becomes anger. So you
might, if you have an opportunity to, that you end up being angry today, you
might take your time to really study it and look at it and see what might be
underneath it or what might be the trigger for the anger internally, not
the trigger that's happening in the world. And to see what the other emotions
are that are connected to it. And if you end up the day without any
anger whatsoever, but you're not feeling well, if you feel depressed or sad or
despairing in some kind of way, you might want to take a little peek
underneath that and see if there's some anger that might be there. You won't
necessarily see it there, not necessarily there. But sometimes that can
be a key that can unlock some of the forms of depression, despair, that
people, when they're stuck in it. So there's so much to be said about anger
and hopefully these simple words give you something to look at and study and
we'll continue tomorrow. Thank you.
