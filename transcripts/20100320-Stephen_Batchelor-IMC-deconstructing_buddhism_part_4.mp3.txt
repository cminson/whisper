First of all, just a comment, a little bit relevant to what the last question was about. 
In the Buddha's second sermon, which he gave also in the deer park at Saanat, I think he does again suggest a very different understanding of what causes suffering. 
I just read the relevant passage of the text. 
He says, What do you think, monks? Are your body feelings, perceptions, inclinations and consciousness permanent or impermanent? Impermanence, sir. 
Does what is impermanent give rise to happiness or suffering? Suffering, sir. 
The source of suffering seems to be impermanence. 
That was the very fact that nothing stands still, nothing lasts, everything is entropically running down. 
In other words, this makes sense of the idea that Saba Sankara Duka, all conditions are Duka, Saba Sankara Anicha, that Duka is built into the very fabric of the world. 
It's built into the fabric of space-time. 
It's not some simple subjective feeling we have in contrast to feeling happy. 
The world is, in a sense, not the kind of place where we can realistically hope for eternal well-being. 
It's not made that way. 
It's structurally unreliable, tragic, entropic. 
But let's now go on to the point I've been trying to get to all day. 
Namely, what are these tasks concerning each truth imply in terms of practice? What does it mean to fully know suffering? Duka parinya. 
Pari means fully or totally or completely. 
It's an emphatic, an intensifier. 
We all know that we are born, that we age, that we get sick, that we die, that unpleasant things happen to us. 
We know that. 
But the Buddha's suggesting we don't fully know. 
We don't really know it. 
If we really knew it, really, really, really, really knew it, our lives would be transformed. 
And that, I think, is the crucial point. 
And I would suggest that the practice of the dhamma in the broadest sense and the practice of mindfulness, awareness, the practice of vipassana, which is, of course, what characterizes vipassana is that we don't just notice things more mindfully. 
We notice that they are impermanent, that they are dukkha, and they are anatha. 
That is the practice of fully knowing dukkha. 
Fully implies not just having a better understanding of Buddhism. 
That's not going to help much, but it means actually transforming the quality of our experience through disciplined self-awareness, disciplined awareness of the world, the practice of satipatanna, the grounding of attention, the grounding of awareness, so that, and we experience this, I think, in retreats particularly, we find that after two or three days when the mind's chatter has died down a bit, when we're no longer preoccupied with what's been happening and what we're going to do when the retreat ends, when we get into the spirit of that concentrated attention, a lot of what normally obsesses us falls away of its own accord. 
We find that we're content or that we find that the actual experience of the body-mind and the world from moment to moment is adequate. 
We don't need anything else. 
Because we have opened our minds, we've opened our hearts to the condition we are in. 
Normally, in our craving attachment, hatred, fear-driven existence, we skim over the surface of life. 
We don't really allow sufficient opportunity for stopping and going into depth. 
We could say fully knowing is deeply knowing. 
Really touching in a non-conceptual, deeply felt sense, the actual fabric of our existence. 
And we start with a breath. 
And I don't think we do that just because the breath is a good object to get more concentrated on, but because breath, in a sense, grounds us in the sheer presence of life itself. 
And as we look into the breath as impermanent, let's say, we begin to notice, not intellectually but experientially, how each breath is one breath less. 
Each breath is a signal of our mortality, of our fragility, of our vulnerability, that our whole existence depends on drawing insufficient oxygen from the atmosphere to oxygenate the blood, to keep the heart pumping, to keep the brain going. 
That our very existence here and now depends upon a single breath. 
Now, again, we know that, but do we really know it? Do we fully know that in a way that it hits home to the point where our life is suddenly revealed to us as something extraordinarily mysterious, almost, and almost a wonder at the fact that we're here at all? And as we open ourselves to this impermanence, to this dukkha, this momentariness of our existence, it doesn't, as some critics of Buddhism would say, let us make us become more morbid and gloomy. 
People say, oh, suffering, what a miserable way to start teaching. 
But that, again, is a very superficial reaction based on a version, because we don't like suffering. 
And this, I think, is the real challenge of the Buddha's dharma, is to transform our distaste for suffering and to recognize that suffering is the door that opens up the possibility of a radically transformed sense of who we are in this world with others. 
And it takes time, because we are driven by this enormously strong habit of craving. 
So when we're sitting in meditation, even though we know that it's a value and we have had great experiences in doing it, it's often very difficult to access that level of depth and stillness and awareness that we may find on retreat or at other times in our lives. 
It's as though the whole of our organism is primed or is geared not to fully know suffering. 
It seems almost instinctive. 
And I'm sure we've all had this happen all the time, that how difficult it is just to sit quietly and notice what's going on. 
The mind would far better be doing, would far more be preoccupied with some trivial event or some silly memory or some anxiety about something that might happen next week or not. 
That's our, and I think the roots of that are in our biological, the legacy of our biological survival instincts. 
The craving to me has a remarkable resonance with the idea in modern biology of how evolution is driven by the desire to survive. 
The selfish gene, there's a kind of selfishness genetically programmed into us. 
And this I think is why the Buddha said that there is nothing so great in this world as the power of Mara, craving. 
It's not just a mental event that we can switch on or off. 
It actually characterizes our whole psychophysical existence. 
The Buddha calls the five aggregates Upadana Khanda, aggregates of clinging, meaning that the aggregates of the body, the mind, the perceptions, the feelings, they are all infused with this deep attachment and clinging to keep going. 
And that's what the Dhamma is seeking in a sense to go against. 
It's to go against that stream, the stream, the Mara Sutta, the stream of the demonic, the demonic being that which freezes us into a fixed image of who we are, driven by a compulsion to get what we want and get rid of what we don't like. 
And it's very difficult, in fact, to go against that. 
It's very, very difficult, but that I think is why the four truths are so challenging, is because they start with our willingness to turn about in our lives from a preoccupation with surface and sense gratification and becoming famous or whatever it is, and turning deep down into the core of the fact that we are alive at all and that we're going to die. 
When I was a Tibetan Buddhist monk, every day we used to have to spend half an hour meditating on the fact that death was certain, the time of death was utterly uncertain, and if that is the case, the one thing that is certain could happen at any time, how then do I live this life now? What are my priorities? What really matters? I think if we could really come to experience ourselves in such a way, we would fundamentally be challenged in many of our assumptions and our priorities and our preferences in such a way that another way of being might begin to emerge, and I think that is what the Buddha is describing here, that if we fully know dukkha, craving and grasping begin to die down, they begin to fall away, or if they don't, and let's face it, they don't, we don't any longer feel compelled to follow their imperatives. 
And this I think is one of the great things that I learned in doing the book on Mara, the devil, is that although the Buddha overcame the power of Mara on becoming the Buddha, that didn't mean that Mara stopped appearing to him. 
Mara is still there, Mara saturates the world, and so even the Buddha is constantly having to deal with Mara. 
All of the dialogues, or most of the dialogues in the canon with Mara occur after the Buddha's awakened. 
Right up to moments before, about three months before his death is the last recorded encounter. 
So in a way it's a little humbling and a little daunting perhaps to be aware of what the Buddha is suggesting that we face and that we open up to and that we acknowledge and that we address in our lives. 
And if we begin to somehow ground our experience in that existential openness, then we don't have to somehow push aside our pettiness, it begins to fall away of its own accord. 
It no longer makes any sense anymore, we undermine its raison d'Ãªtre, its rationale. 
In other words we start to grow up in a way, we become more mature, we become more, in a way we start to take our lives far more seriously. 
I think that's often what it means. 
And through that process that the power of those habits, the power of those attachments and so forth begins to fall away. 
It becomes less and less what defines us as who we are, less and less of what propels us to act and to speak and to get this and get rid of that. 
And that can lead to moments in which we really know for ourselves in an experiential way that we are free not to act on the prompts of craving. 
Now, again, we don't just know that sort of superficially, as a theoretical belief. 
The Buddha describes many, many times the fact that we can actually know this for ourselves in a way that it makes a qualitative difference to how we are in this world. 
And that experience, the stopping, the cessation of craving, which doesn't mean that it stops forever. 
The Buddha is a good enough psychologist to realize that these may just be momentary glimpses. 
They might be periods of some minutes or hours if we're lucky, before the habitual drives reassert themselves. 
But in those moments, we really have no doubts that in fact we do not have to be the victims of our attachments and our fears. 
And that is the experience of nirvana. 
Nirvana is the stopping of greed, of hatred and delusion. 
It's also the experience of what is rather misleadingly called the unconditioned. 
Now, again, the unconditioned is a favorite of Buddhists because it seems to bring God back into the picture. 
And I think the Buddha uses the word precisely because it did have that meaning in the culture of his time. 
But again, he gave it a radical different meaning. 
This is from the Asankhata Sanghuta, the connected discourses on the unconditioned. 
He's at sovereignty and he says, monks, I will teach you the unconditioned and the path leading to the unconditioned. 
Listen to this. 
And what monks is the unconditioned? The ending of greed, the ending of hatred, the ending of delusion. 
This is called the unconditioned. 
Now, what he's done is he's turned a noun into a verb. 
He's saying unconditioned means to be unconditioned by greed, unconditioned by hatred, unconditioned by delusion. 
In no way does he suggest that it is something called the unconditioned with a capital U. 
It's the experience of not being conditioned by these things that grants us liberation. 
Liberation not as an end in itself, but liberation, freedom to live otherwise. 
Because it's from here, from this point that we enter the stream, stream entry, sottapati. 
Now, how does the Buddha understand the stream? He's talking to Sariputa. 
This is also in the Sanghuta Nikaya. 
Sariputa, he says, this is said, the stream, the stream. 
What now Sariputa is the stream? The noble eightfold path, venerable sir, is the stream. 
That is appropriate, seeing, thinking, speaking, acting and so on. 
Sariputa, this is said, a stream entrant, a stream entrant. 
What now Sariputa is a stream entrant? One who possesses this noble eightfold path, venerable sir, is called a stream entrant. 
Now, some of you might be, again, slightly surprised by that. 
Because normally, in Buddhist orthodoxy, stream entry is described as the abandoning of the view of individuality or egoism. 
It's the overcoming of doubt and it is the overcoming of what is usually translated as rights and rituals. 
The word is actually sila-bhata, which means virtuous conduct and vows. 
In the Sutanipata, verse 231, it just says, you overcome sila-bhata, you overcome virtuous conduct and vows. 
In later texts, it becomes sila-bhata paramasa, attachment to virtuous vows. 
But I think the Buddha is actually saying something rather more radical. 
He's saying you become free on stream entry from regarding morality as a question of following certain legal prescriptions, following rules. 
Another quality that he uses to describe stream entry is that you become independent of others in my teaching. 
You become autonomous. 
You become free in the sense not of being liberated from something, but you become liberated to do something. 
Free to act according to your own lights. 
And this is not just something that monks and nuns attain after great hardship. 
This is Marjama 73. 
There are not only 100 or 500, but far more men and women lay followers. 
My disciples, clothed in white, enjoying sensual pleasures, who carry out my instruction, respond to my advice, have gone beyond doubt, become free from perplexity, gained in trepidity, and become independent of others in my teaching. 
So what has, I think, happened is that stream entry has become sort of raised up to another kind of private spiritual experience that you get after lots of long hard work in retreat and preferably by becoming a monk or a nun. 
I don't want to diminish becoming a monk or a nun because I did that myself and it was one of the most valuable experiences I ever had. 
And all of my work is based upon having had that training. 
Again, if we look at what's called the Sotapati Sanyuta, the connected discourses on stream entry, it's at the latter part of the Sanyuta Nikaya, I keep referring to this, the connected discourses of the Buddha. 
It's a two-volume set in English recently translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi. 
And it's interesting that the very last sections are on stream entry, is section 49 or whatever it is, which is entering the eight-fold path. 
And the final section is called Satchasanyuta, the connected discourses on the truths, the Four Noble Truths. 
So again, we get this same pattern, the eight-fold path leads to the Four Truths. 
It precedes the Four Truths, even though the fourth truth is the eight-fold path. 
Now, most of the passages when the Buddha describes stream entry do so in the following way. 
Monks, a noble disciple who possesses four things as a stream-enterer. 
What for? A noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha. 
He possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma. 
He possesses confirmed confidence in the Sangha. 
He possesses the virtues that adhere to the noble ones. 
Now again, this of course is the form, this is the refuges. 
And we don't normally today associate stream entry with taking refuge. 
In fact, we think of taking refuge as doing some ritual whereby we join the Buddhist club. 
We become a Buddhist in a public way. 
And we recite the refuges. 
And here we have the Buddha saying again and again and again that taking the refuges, having confirmed confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, is tantamount to entering the stream, entering the eight-fold path. 
What I think that does is to recognize that taking refuge is not just a matter of reciting a few sentences. 
It's actually an affirmation of a transformation of what really matters to us in our life. 
That we turn around in the depths of our experience, our priorities, what counts, what our lives are for. 
They are not for just sort of getting some sort of pleasure every now and again. 
But the challenge is to be fully awake, to have confidence that you can actually do that. 
The confidence in the path itself, the Dhamma, the practice of the Dhamma, to have complete confidence in that, that that's something now that you are committed to. 
And likewise, confidence in the community. 
And again, the Buddha defines the community, the Sangha, as anyone who has entered the eight-fold path. 
A layman, a laywoman, a monk, a nun, equally. 
In other words, it's a commitment to a community of shared ideas and values and practices. 
And a commitment to the virtues that adhere to the noble ones. 
In other words, those virtues which run from everything from mindfulness to concentration, to patience, to trust, to all of the different things that we get all the lists of in Buddhism. 
They're the virtues. 
So stream entry, therefore, is far more than just some personal experience that we might get at some moment in meditation. 
It might be that. 
But from these texts, it's quite clear that it has to do with a complete reorientation of our primary values, not just within ourselves, but also in relation to the world, in relation to the community, in relation to every aspect of our lives. 
How we see things, think about them, speak, act, work, all of that becomes a practice. 
So if we go back to the first sermon, fully knowing suffering, fully knowing suffering becomes the opening to a way of life in which this habitual craving begins to fall away or become less and less dominant in one's life, which leads to moments where it actually is suspended or stopped. 
And we have a certainty that we do not have to live that way. 
We are free not to live that way. 
And that moment, that experience of the stopping of craving, is what allows us to enter the stream, to enter the eightfold path, the fourth truth, in the ways that the Buddha has just defined it. 
And therefore, and again I've done that in a very sketchy way, but I hope in terms of much what we've been looking at today, you can perhaps see what I'm trying to get at, that the four truths as four acts take us primarily into the eightfold path. 
The eightfold path I think is the key to the Buddha's dharma. 
And it's interesting actually that the very first statement in the very first sermon, the Buddha says, I have awoken to a middle way. 
And in one of the very last teachings he gives to the monk Subhada, who approaches him as he's lying on his deathbed in Kusinara, Subhada wants to see the Buddha, Ananda says, no, he's very, very sick, you can't. 
The Buddha over here says, no, let him come. 
And Subhada then asks him, you know, how am I to know what teaching that I hear is your teaching? And he says, wherever you find the teaching on the eightfold path, that's his final injunction to this disciple, this new disciple, who he then admits into the order, and shortly after that, probably the next day or so, dies. 
So the Buddha's awakening, if we go back to that now, is an awakening to this process. 
It's ongoing, it's processual, it's open-ended, it's a constant engagement with the world as the world is inevitably changing and shifting and unexpected things are happening. 
And going back to your question, this is why I think it's useful to get a clearer picture of how the Buddha operated in his world, because his life was one of constant interaction and engagement with his world, with the society, with the kings, with his ambitious family, endless hassles with his family. 
And he's constantly involved in dealing with strife. 
And people often say, well, look, in the Pali Canon, you hardly ever get the Buddha giving teachings on compassion or love. 
It pops up every now and again. 
Whereas in the Mahayana, we talk about love all the time. 
But actually, and this is another reason why I feel it's so important to have a good sense of the Buddha's life, is that his life is the teaching on compassion. 
Not what he says, it's easy to say, you must love everybody. 
It's very difficult to live in the world in a compassionate way. 
And that is illustrated not through what you say, but through what you do, how you deal with the actual exigencies, conflicts of life itself. 
And the Buddha's life demonstrates this. 
He didn't have to go and spend 45 years doing all this, trying to establish his community, trying to establish his teaching in the face of all kinds of opposition. 
And as the story pans out, in the end, getting into all kinds of crises, his world starts to fall apart, and his last journey, as recounted in the Mahaparanibbana Sutra, is really a story of failure at one level. 
But again, like the Christ story, it's a failure which is a triumph. 
It's a passio. 
It's a passion that although it appears to be, you know, he dies bereft largely, then Mahakasa comes along and takes over the whole show. 
But the fact that we're here today still reflecting on these things, and they're still speaking to our condition two and a half thousand years later, is I think the greatest witness, or the greatest illustration of the victory of the Buddha's teaching, the fact that it's still alive, it's still around. 
And I'm afraid we have to be thankful to Mahakasa Pa. 
So that's all I'm afraid we have time for today. 
Now, I know this is crassly self-promoting, but the reason I'm here in America is to promote this book. 
And there are not copies for sale here, but I've been given these little stickers, if I can open this package. 
Here we go. 
Oh, all right. 
Oh, God, they're a bit tacky. 
And if you like, they're called gold border name badges. 
I'm willing to sign them and you can stick them in the copy of the book. 
So you've spent numerous hours speaking about the backside. 
The bad side. 
The back side. 
The back side. 
Can you, because you've had extensive experience on the Mahayana side, can you speak about the front side, which is the turrets on the building? How do they relate to the foundation of the building? Oh, thank you. 
That's a good question. 
Well, I think in different ways. 
I think there are certain elements of the superstructure, the turrets, the big building, that are entirely in accord with these foundational teachings. 
And there are other elements that are a little bit more questionable, at least in my lines. 
So I think it's not a question of, and this is why I said, I don't want to destroy this building, but I think in order to understand it, we need to maybe take it apart a bit and see what's at the foundation. 
And that will enable us to see, as it were, which parts of those superstructure are built on sound foundations and which are perhaps more wobbly. 
Right. 
What comes up to me is the basis of, let's say, since you spent time in the Korean Zen situation, taking the stereotypical Zen responses of form is emptiness and emptiness is form, or that all sentient beings have Buddha nature. 
These are two, from the way you've just described, that clearly aberrant, if I could use that word, vantage points that don't appear in the original Pali sutras. 
And so I'm just, where I'm going with that is, do you feel as though doctrines of that nature are responses, as you described, potentially historical responses, rather than, let's say, call them philosophical outcroppings of what originally happened? Well, actually, I disagree. 
I think the heart sutra, for example, which you quote, you'll find passages in the Pali canon, I think that are quite in, the Madhyamaka philosophy, of which the heart sutra is, in a way, a kind of illustration, I think is in accordance with certain statements that you find in the Pali canon. 
I don't have time to go into it now, but I don't believe that is an aberration. 
I think the problem with it is that it presents itself in a rather metaphysical guise. 
It's less concrete, it's more abstract, and it becomes a kind of a slogan. 
I get sick of it when people say, isn't form emptiness an emptiness form? Well, yes, but what does that mean? But I feel that the core of that is actually quite compatible with the early teachings. 
And likewise, Buddha nature, depending on how we understand Buddha nature, and again, there's enormous differences within the Mahayana schools. 
When I was taught this in my Tibetan training, the Geluk tradition, the text we studied was called Rick Chidan, the commentary on the Buddha nature, recognises that the origin of the idea comes from the early texts in what is called the Arya Gauta, which I've recently found is in the Angutra and Ikhaya, one of the early doctrines. 
It's very different to what we've subsequently come to know as Buddha nature. 
Buddha nature is also problematic because it's a wrong translation. 
There is no equivalent to the word in Sanskrit, Buddha nature, it means womb of the Tathagata, or more usually, family of the Buddha, Buddha Gautra, not Buddha Swabhava. 
That was a problem that occurred from the translation from Sanskrit to Chinese, and then it entered into English as Buddha nature. 
And Buddha nature, of course, sounds suspiciously like a true self or something. 
You know, I don't have a self and I've got Buddha nature. 
But again, the idea does track back to the Pali Canon in Arya Gauta. 
And it also, I think, at least in some understandings of Buddha nature, it's really just a way of recognising that because we are not a fixed self, and not a static ego, therefore, by knowing that deeply, we are able to transform ourselves into a Buddha. 
That is how it's understood in the Gelukpa. 
In the traditions that think of Buddha nature as some kind of, as you mentioned, there's already a Buddha in here just waiting to get out, which could be useful as an inspirational idea, but to take it literally, I think you've got all sorts of problems. 
So then we're back to what you said before about basically words being used in not the original fashion, such as Buddha taking words from the Vedantic mindset and altering them. 
Then as we go along in the historical context, different groups pulling words that Buddha may, in fact, have used or that the Canon uses and altering them in ways that either fit their historical context or that basically makes them get more brownie points somewhere along the way. 
Yeah, I think that's broadly the case. 
It's a very complex story, but I'm not suggesting, and I really want to emphasize this, that all of the superstructures somehow wrong, it's not. 
What I think one has to recognize is that Buddhism is a living organism that is continuously reinventing itself and adapting itself to different social historical situations and coming up with different ways. 
That goes off like pure land Buddhism, the idea that there's Buddha or Amitabha in some heaven somewhere and he's vowed for your liberation, you just have to recite his name and you'll be liberated after death. 
That, frankly, I can't see has got much to do with what the Buddha was teaching. 
And other things too. 
So it's really a question of differentiation, learning how to, but in order to do that, you need to be clearer about what the early tradition was actually saying. 
It's got muddled too, as I've been doing all day. 
I think the for-truth doctrine has been tampered with, frankly. 
So I'm not just critiquing the Mahayanaists, I think all, we have to stop, I'm exhausted, I'm sorry. 
It's ten past five. 
It's Caroline.
