 So our speaker this evening is Tarania. She's been offering instruction in Theravadin Buddhist teachings and practices since 1990. She's a student of Western forest sangha, the disciples of Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sameto, and is a lay Buddhist minister associated with the Abhayadiri Forest Monastery in California. She served as a resident teacher at the Insight Meditation Society in Berry, Massachusetts from 1996 to 1999. And she's currently teaching at the Berry Center for Buddhist Studies and also in Dharma Centers in the United States. Namo Tasa Bhagavato Arhato Samhasa Bhutasa Namo Tasa Bhagavato Arhato Samhasa Bhutasa Namo Tasa Bhagavato Arhato Samhasa Bhutasa Vramdhamang Sangham Namasami So always nice to be here with this group. I do enjoy coming to California. I had the good fortune of coming a couple of times a year for a few years. And now it seems to be reduced to just once. But I'm always glad to come by and meet with this community and give Gil a little relief, a little time off for vacation as well. So it serves a dual purpose. And tonight I have always racked my brain about what to talk about. But I just kind of go with what's up for me in my life and my practice and hope that in some way either a combination of that and maybe a little bit of intuiting what's going on with all of us as human beings, I can offer some things that are helpful. So tonight I wanted to look at this whole question of suffering, insight into suffering. I think it's really tricky. It can be a really tricky thing to come to understand what the Buddha is saying, particularly in the Four Noble Twos, where he's saying that there is suffering, that it has a cause, that it can end, and that there's a way to the end of it. And just what he means by all of this, because it's certainly subject to at least a lot of confusion, if not outright misunderstanding. And it takes, at least for myself, I know it took me many years just to begin to get some inklings as to the subtlety of what this teaching is about and the subtlety of the experience that he's trying to point us to. So I wanted to talk about a discussion that I had recently with some of the nuns in a community of lay women at Chithurst Forest Monastery in England. I usually go and spend a couple of months a year just living with the nuns in that community. And there's a lot of really neat things about doing this. If you have time and can spend time with these monastic communities, their way of life brings many, many rich teachings, both directly and indirectly. Just kind of plugging in to what the Buddha set up as a lifestyle can be very helpful, let alone actually interacting with people who, in many ways, I consider kind of professionals in this area, living their whole lives around the practice and trying to understand things. Well, one of the things that we do in the nuns community is every week we have this little gathering on Friday afternoon that we call ladies' tea or nuns' tea or whatever. It's kind of like it's not unlike this gathering right here tonight, only it's a much smaller scale. There's probably about 10 of us sitting together. And it's a wonderful environment where this little cottage that the nuns live in is kind of like a little hobbit hut. It was built in the early 19th century. It has that feel, very thick walls and very cozy. You can see where people used to use the fireplace to cook their meals and what have you. So we gather on the floor in the living room, which is probably all of about maybe 13 by 12 room, and pass around the tea. And everybody gets comfortable. Very cozy, very quaint. It's all done in a spirit of spiritual companionship, spiritual camaraderie. Let's get together. And if nothing else, just be together as dhamma friends. So a lot of the time, the things that we talk about are just maybe newsy, catching up on what's going on in each other's lives and enjoying that kind of friendship with people who are devoted to dhamma as well. But the idea is really to sort of bring to the table things that are going on in our lives. And the nuns will make themselves available then to help us process it, to help us look at it in a way through the eyes of dhamma. We're so patterned and so conditioned to try to cope with life's situations through mechanisms and means, conditioning, that isn't always effective. And I don't know about you, but for me, it's taken me many years just to try to think in Buddhist language, to try to come at things through the eyes of the Buddhist teachings. And this particular setup is very, very helpful for doing that. So this one Friday afternoon, the troops gathered. And this one woman came in, and she was obviously distressed. But we took our time to relax and settle and pass the tea around and what have you before one of the nuns had said, OK, so what's up? What do you want to talk about this week? And so then you could see this woman was just ready to blurt out. She just really needed help and wanted to talk. So out came this very distressed situation in her life, where she was, it was a work situation where somebody, apparently, I don't even remember all the details of it. But it was one of those things where somebody in a position of power and authority was making a lot of decisions unilaterally. And there's big decisions that affected a lot of people's lives in negative ways, harmful ways. And not including them, not inviting any kind of debate or discussion about it. Well, have you ever been in a situation like that? It's not pleasant. And how to cope with it, how to deal with it. So as I said, she was obviously very distressed. And as she explained it, you could see all the rest of us just wanting to get in on it and wanting to come up with ideas and things to do, how to deal with it. So we did that. That's almost the first immediate response that we'd come up with when somebody has a problem, isn't it? It's like, well, have you tried this? And have you tried that? And the kinds of solutions that we were coming up with were things like, for example, she felt that she had no allies. She felt nobody felt the same way that she did. She was aware, for example, that what was making it even more stressful was that a lot of people were backbiting and forming little cliques and going on about building the case and just getting all caught up in the dilemma. So there was a lot of behind the scenes. And this was all very, very difficult for her. So she just assumed that she just didn't have anybody in the situation that felt the same that she did and really could begin to address it. So anyway, so we started with that. And we said, well, maybe there's somebody. You could write a letter. You could do emails, all this kind of thing. So maybe you could have you tried going over their head, talk to the boss, talk to the person that's responsible for them. Or is there a board of directors? What kind of procedures do you have for grievances? And then we came to like, maybe you could form a committee. Maybe you could gather people together and do something on that level. And it was kind of like this feeling. Once we got to the point where we're forming a committee, we knew we were going down the wrong track. You know, the feeling, as you, I'm sure you can relate, of all of these remedies, these solutions, these approaches. And every one of them, they all leave you flat. Or they're not getting at it. You know, you can feel it. They're not getting at it. They're going to get at something. And they're going to engage us in a lot of activity, and a lot of dealing, coping with the problem, but at the getting at the heart of the suffering in this situation. So at that point, you could feel it. We had kind of exhausted a lot of those sort of worldly remedies. And there was this long silence then. And it was almost as if, like in the silence, we were getting a grip and trying to remember what the Buddha taught us. And then somebody spoke up and said, well, now this is it, isn't it? This is just what the Buddha is talking about in the first noble truth. There is difficulty. And we recall this litany that he puts forth in that first noble truth that we have to associate with things that we don't like. We're going to be separated from things that we like. And we can't always get what we want. That's the language. That's the words of the Buddha. That's the language of the first noble truth. And so with that, we're just putting that on the table and in the mix. You could feel the whole energy in the room just shift. This is the way it is. It's like this sometimes in life. And for myself, I had this feeling like sort of like being on an elevator where it starts to go down just a little bit too fast. And all this heady, cerebral energy that's trying to do it right and get it right and fix it and make the world a more pleasant place, the kind of stuff that has us all completely exhausted with life. There's something that we can do to make it not be this way. That kind of energy that you could feel that just drop out of the room completely. It was like a stud. And then this woman, it really got her. It went right to the heart just because we had exhausted all this other stuff. And there was this emptiness. There was this space that had been created. And so it went right into her heart. And she just started to cry and cry and cry and just really feel the reality of the situation that she was in. And others of us were moved in the same way. It was very real. It was very authentic. It was like now we're getting at the core. Now we're getting at the heart of the matter. Life is like this. And there are people who are very difficult. And sometimes it's us. Sometimes you're the jabi. But sometimes you're the jabber. This happened to be a moment where she was the jabi. And feeling that and just letting that into the heart. So the teaching of the Buddha is really to get it that day after day. The things we have to associate with things that we don't like will be separated from things that we like. And we won't always get what we want. This is simply the way it is. And what he's getting at in this teaching is that it's the not seeing of this truth. And the not just holding that, bearing it, allowing it to be that way. Just feeling that. That that is the issue. The suffering or the conditions of life are not the issue. What happens is that if we don't get it, that it's like this sometimes. Then you move into these incredible states. Which we know, we live in these states of resistance and wanting things to be some other way. So here's where you see the five hindrances get engaged. It's right when things are uncomfortable and unpleasant. The mind will start going into wanting things to be some other way. This isn't the way it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be this way. You can feel that scramble going on. You could feel the aversion and the resistance, the fighting. Or here comes sloth and torpor. We just get depressed about it. Or bury our head in the sand. Or just go and sleep it off. Or the other thing that the unawakened mind comes up with is anxiety and worry and restlessness. This kind of energy that she was clearly caught up in. Just going over it and over it and over it and over it. And really soaking in the anxiety. Creating anxiety and soaking in that. And then the mental hindrance of doubt and confusion. Where you can spin out for hours, for days, for weeks. Just trying to figure out what to do. And all of these are, in a way, the unawakened mind's best guess at how to cope with this condition of suffering. It's because we don't see. It's because we don't get it that this is the way it is. That we're turning to these strategies, these apparent remedies or responses that just don't work. I mean, when did worrying ever help? When did aversion and hating the condition ever make it better? Or getting depressed or burying your head in the sand? It's like over and over again, the mind keeps turning to these responses. And it's amazing. It's amazing that we don't seem to pick up that they don't work. So Buddha is trying to point us in the direction of something that actually does work. Instead of making things work worse, how can we make things better? So Buddha is wanting us to open to this truth of difficulty. So this is what we did in this gathering. And as I said, the woman who had the issue just started to cry and feel the pain of the situation that life brings. It certainly, we comforted her. It's not to say that you just stand back. I mean, you can feel actually in the direct experience of opening to the truth of difficulty. You can feel like that opening to the truth of difficulty is wisdom. That is understanding. And you could feel very directly how it is that wisdom and compassion are constant companions. They're right together. They're always right together. When there is the wisdom to know the way things are and to open to the way things are, then right away there's compassion. So the automatic response to suffering then is to hold somebody in it, to comfort them in it. And so this was part of the experience of our afternoon. Just getting in touch with that. This is the truth. People treat us badly. There is difficulty. And this is really why we have the precepts, why the precepts are so important, because they're trying to help us all to at least try to diminish the amount of harm that we do to ourselves and each other so that we're not fabricating difficulty, increasing the harm that's done in our lives and with other people. But the truth is, and I think this is what has to be understood, is that even with all of that kind of effort, even with the precepts, there is always going to be harm. There is always going to be difficulty. And we have to get that. It sounds so heavy, so morbid and so morose. But it's an amazing thing what happens when the heart acknowledges and receives this simple truth. It's like all of the resistance and the fighting and the contracting, I mean, we live in a headache. We live in this constant state of wanting it to be some other way. All of that can be released through the months and years of practice. You can just feel the letting go, the whole system can loosen up and stop being so contracted. And sometimes I find when looking at difficulties in my life that if I can just get to this point, that sometimes that's all we need to do. It's uncanny, but sometimes just nailing it that, oh, it's like this, there is this difficulty, is enough to sort of burst the whole bubble of added suffering and difficulty. Can you feel that? It's like you're just entering, you go, oh, I get it. I'm not awake, the world isn't awake, and we're just constantly jabbing each other. That's the way it is. We're doing the best we can, but this is the condition that we find ourselves in. So you have a good cry, and if you're like me, you might kick in a few walls or something occasionally with some of the difficulties, but at least one is being real and authentic and acknowledging the way that things are. So for myself, it took me many, many years, I think, to begin to get it. That insight into Dukkha was not going to be fun. There's an opening, at least a period of time, where this experience of letting oneself feel the pains of life, feel the difficulty of having to associate with things we don't like and be separated from things that we like. That that, you know, everything that was preventing me from doing that before, that that experience of resisting that, that was worse than letting go of that and actually just feeling it. And that, yeah, there's hurt, and it's not fun, and it's not like all of a sudden you're going to get to a place where the jabs of life, you become very neutral about them. I don't think that happens. I think that you actually continue to feel the ouches, but what you increase is the capacity to just say ouch when it hurts and let it be. You know, the good news is that Dukkha isn't the only characteristic of life. There's also impermanence, so whatever it is, it's going to move. It's going to move on through. But it's like waves. You reach this peak and then it goes down, and it comes up and then it goes down. You start to, at least for myself, start to experience practice as like an opening to the rhythm, the waves of life, the pleasures and the pains, and it's all okay. Suddenly, I don't know about you, but I feel through the months and years of practice that there's so much more alive. This is life. This is the way that it is, and there's no fighting it, and no resisting it, no wanting it to be some other way. So the insight cuts through a lot of this reactive patterns. Once we get insight into Dukkha, then the five hindrances don't have a leg to stand on. They have no basis. They can't react. They can't have a life in the presence of wisdom and understanding. And that understanding can be a little hard one. I think we have to get that, but there is difficulty in life. So just back to our little group. At this point, there was kind of a long silence, another long silence in the room, which is kind of soaking in this realization. And it's unsettling. At least we found it unsettling. And what came up out of the silence was some obvious questions that I think any reasonable person would ask, which is that, you know, is the Buddhist saying that you don't do anything about difficulty? What about that? Is this a teaching that says, wake up and be miserable? Roll over and be a doormat? Or just accept that this is the way that it is, and there's nothing that you could do about it? I think it's good to reflect on that. I expect that many of you have that same question. Is that what he's saying? And I think that clearly he's not saying that it misses the subtlety of the teaching. What he's getting at is trying to get us to a place where we remove that reactivity, that reactive patterning, so that what you're left with is the condition. And when you can feel the condition, and there isn't any resistance to it, then you're much better equipped to deal with it, to address it or not. It doesn't matter. As I said, sometimes just feeling things is enough. And you find you don't really want to address it. The practice is always what's going on here in this heart and how I'm working with that. So definitely you do that. But then there's a lot in the teachings, certainly practices around kindness, practices around compassion, and comforting each other in the difficulty, comforting ourselves in the difficulty. So he's not sidestepping that question altogether. But I think in a way, it's really that the Buddhist teaching is almost as if he doesn't get involved in the details of that level of activity. Just trying to get us to feel the truth of difficulty. And once you do that, then what to do about the conditions of the situations of one's life, it's almost like it takes care of itself. At least that's been my experience. You finally sort of go, oh, okay, well, that's not a good way to be. I need to address this with that person. Or this is untenable. Let's get together and talk about it. You get this much more level-headed, clear-headed response. Like it reminds me a lot of Gandhi. Can you imagine somebody just being so clear that the people in his country were being mistreated, that he could actually just go up to the English and say, I think you should leave. This isn't working. And that they did. Without a lot of violence. It's amazing. But that's the kind of response that is possible through getting it, that there is difficulty and that this is harmful. That kind of thing. It's interesting. A number of years ago, I used to work, I helped to form, I didn't actually work in it, but I helped to form a battered women's shelter. And one of the things that always came up in that was, we were talking about it with people, was, well, why do women stay in that situation? And certainly it's very complex. And I don't want to diminish their suffering or try to oversimplify it. But one of the things that we saw consistently was that there was a way that they just didn't accept that it was even happening. They would explain away behaviors and try to fix it in their minds or ignore it or deny it in one way or another. And it was always a breakthrough transition for these women when they just got to the place where they went, wow, this is not good. I'm being mistreated. Feeling that and letting in the truth of the experience that they found themselves in. And then you could always, it seemed, after that kind of breakthrough, there were some shifts, there was some action that could be taken. And it was always a lot more clear-headed and effective. So I don't think in any way the Buddha is saying, don't do anything about it. As I said, I think it's more like he just doesn't get involved at that level. Just as practitioners, our job is to get it to the point where, in the situations that we find ourselves, that our first line of defense, if you will, our first response is to open to and receive and allow how this situation feels. And then you can investigate and explore, put some flesh on the bone of what's going on with us. But at least then we're kind of like turning around and facing the monster. You're not picking up these habitual, foolish, reactive patterns of greed, hatred, and delusion. You know, this actually getting somewhere with, not only with the condition, but with the experience of insight. This is a fact of human existence. Can we get that? And can we allow it to be in our lives? And then feel the amazing shift that that makes in our psyche. It's like at least removing that layer of mental torment that is resisting and fighting and not wanting it to be that way. At least that much. Then you're really positioned for even deeper insight into the truth of the way things are. So I think all in all that the Buddha is just really trying to get us to relieve some of the stress in our lives. Just get us to admit that life is like this. And just releasing at least this level of psychological suffering so that we can receive life. And as I said, and I'm curious to hear some of your thoughts on it too. I mean, don't you find that the process of waking up is bringing about a much greater happiness, a sense of wellbeing in our lives? It's so ironic that a lot of that is coming from opening to the truth of suffering. It's wild, isn't it? So these are some thoughts I have on the subject. I wanted to leave some time if people have some comments or questions of your own. I hope some of this is useful. And I suspect you have some ideas as well. Yeah. I just said, I think I do. Whenever I feel the pain, it may be painful, pain, very painful at the time. But when I'm there with it and I feel it, I don't have to do anything else. Like go eat or go do this or that. But it's very hard to stay there sometimes. Yeah. And then she's saying it can be hard to stay there. Like you want to open to the feeling, but it's hard to stay there. And so this is a good point and really brings home the importance of the daily meditation practice, either in the formal practice or throughout the course of the day that just consider part of what's being done, part of the training that's taking place in our sitting, you know, that simple experience of coming back to the settled feeling, coming back to the breath. We're actually training the mind in that. It's no small thing to stay with things as they are to stop running off to other either thoughts or ideas or conditions or reactive patterns, you know, doing something about what's happening instead of just being in what's happening so that there's, you know, it can really, I mean, through the years of my own practice, I know I've increased over the years this healthy respect and for the daily sitting practice, you know, what that's doing from my mind, just helping me to stay with things as they are. And the other point you're making about it, you know, being maybe hard to bear, but it's interesting too. I've watched that in my mind too, that the bit in the mind that's saying, I can't bear this, you know, the one that's going crazy, you have a look at that one. It's so interesting because it's like, you can actually see self-view in that moment, you know, it's like, you actually are bearing it. We actually already are bearing it, but there's a notion in there that is just a reactive pattern that's trying to get away from it and it comes out in this kind of voice, you know, I can't bear it, you know, but you are bearing it and if you weren't, you know, it'd kill you and you wouldn't care, you know, it's fine, you know, we're doing fine with this stuff. What else, any thoughts? Yes. It sort of seems as though the, that act of separating the simple truth of suffering from the proliferation of thoughts is an important part of the process because so much of the suffering is just the wonderful way in which we embroider. Yes, yeah, exactly, exactly. Yeah, it's like that, oh, what's that Woody Allen saying? He says, like, you're just getting reduced to, get rid of the man-made torment and just settle for ordinary everyday suffering, you know, that's basically a lot of what the practice is doing is relinquishing the reactive bit that is a lot of our suffering, the mental torment, psychological torment and just getting with the ordinary birth sickness, aging and death, associating with things we don't like, being separated from what we like and not getting what we want, you know, that ordinary everyday suffering. Yeah, just today I had a situation where someone had committed to taking care of my dog for a week, I'm leaving town and I got over there and it turns out that he could not keep the dog where he was, someone else told me that and where I'm at now versus a couple years ago is I didn't really expect whether or not the dog was going to get to stay or not, so I wasn't upset. So it was really the expectation of while I was going over there and I was told it was going to work out. When I got there I really did not have an expectation one way or another and then a half an hour later I found out that I can't even go on the trip the day that I was told this is today, that I was going to be able to go and I was like, oh, well, okay, that's no problem, now I can do this, this and this because I'll be in town. That's great. And so it's really letting go of that expectation and someone shared with me the idea of coming over to IMC and not expecting it to be here or not, that it could burn down and if I was expecting it to be here then I'm setting myself up for a reaction one way or another. It's not that I don't want it to be here, I mean I don't want it to be here and all those things, but it's really that expectation level is there's a subtlety to it that if something happens I'm open to, hey, it happened and so just the whole fighting it and I almost enjoy it because now the situation with the dog is going to be even better. We're going to have someone come stay where we live, someone who we love and so it's just going to be great and so it turned out to be better. That's great. No, I mean your point is well, I love that. I mean that's just part of the fruits of practice and whereas the old way it would be like you could worry and go nuts about that and it doesn't even go that way. It's like don't you hate it when you go crazy and it doesn't even happen. It's like you exhaust yourself hating somebody and you find out it wasn't even that person, it was somebody else. It's like wow, you just wasted all that energy. It's amazing. Yeah, I want to pass that back there. Well, I like the fact that once you focus in on the suffering, somehow you are taking yourself away from that narrow restraint situation and connecting yourself with the suffering of the world. It's just a much shorter step from yours to everybody. This is how it is for yourself and for everybody else. It's a particular sort of situation that keeps you trapped in yours as opposed to others, especially if there's some person involved like that lady concerned. Yeah, yeah. It can bring compassion, equanimity so much easier. Exactly. One thing I've noticed in my own life and practice is that in reality there's only one mind and the mind doesn't know self and other. So when you're really open and receptive then it doesn't make any difference if it's your pain or mine. It's all felt the same and I use it. Some of the more recent and very painful examples of this are like the tsunami last year where, you know, look at the reactions that people had. I mean we were devastated as if it had happened to us and something when it's that severe, it has a way of breaking through all of the usual patternings. It's so in your face. You can't turn, the mind won't even turn to greed, hatred and delusion as a response because it's like real, it's authentic and you get nailed with the truth of suffering. And the experience of it is the same as if it yours or mine, it doesn't make any difference at that level. Can you feel that? I'm sure you've seen it. You can't discern. Yeah, one more. I work at an adolescent center where we treat substance abuse cases and the implications of this are so huge in that field. I mean it just bounces all over the place at every juncture how suffering is being denied and it's compounded. Yes, exactly. And I have an opinion about people who use drugs and alcohol. It's been my observation that really 201, they are people that are highly, highly sensitized. They actually feel pain deeper than many of the general population but don't have the systems for coping with it. And so they turn to anesthetizing it. It's too great. But as you say, the implications of the Buddhist teachings for somebody like that to understand, to really get it that it is the way it is and that it is bearable. Not to diminish how painful it is but it is bearable. And as a therapy to get them to feel the harm or the pain that they're adding to it by the response that they're picking up, choosing. Yeah, I remember this similar thing where there was this film out a number of years ago. I think it's still going around. That was done in India in the prison systems, doing Vipassana, doing time. You know that one? The one scene that almost everybody seems to remember from that is the point where one fellow feels, gets very deeply in touch with the pain of the harm that he has caused. And this warden, the woman warden, who said that she actually had this revolutionary idea that to rehabilitate prisoners, that what she needed to do was to get them to that place. That the only way that they were going to be free was to really feel the pain of the harm that they have done. Let alone the pain of the harm that's been done to them. But starting with that, and only then would they be able to be rehabilitated. So her whole therapy, if you will, her whole approach to incarceration was designed to get them to that place. I said, wow, what a great idea. But it's not often the approach that's taken. So I hope some of this has been helpful. It's been fun for me. And I look forward to seeing some of you again Thursday or next Sunday, and then I'll be here again Thursday after that. Okay, so take care.
