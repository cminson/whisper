The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So on this fifth talk on becoming wise towards emotions,
I want to talk a little bit about attention to the source of our emotions,
where the emotions arise from, and certainly there are layers of sources from within.
And a little bit, I talked about that yesterday, is that certain emotions might have other emotions
that are the source for it, or that immediate predecessor for it.
Anger might be hurt or fear.
Joy might be varied, the source within us.
It might be praise to our conceit, and we're so energized, joyfully, about that.
Or it might be this delightful sense of freedom or ease that comes when conceit disappears,
when it's not there.
But in the teachings of the Buddha, there's a distinction between two sources,
or two kinds of emotional lives.
One is, I like to call, dharmic, and the other we call nondharmic.
Some people might call it spiritual and worldly.
Some people call it, you know, there's a variety of things they call this.
But at the heart of the Buddha's teachings on mindfulness is this distinction between
that which belongs to the sensual world and that which belongs to something deeper,
that is the nonsensual world, and spiritual and non-spiritual.
It's not a criticism or a denigrating of what's maybe non-spiritual or that which is essential.
But there is a distinction between that which, emotions that get triggered by our reactivity
and those emotions that are not arising reactively to something,
but rather emerge, flow through us, arise out of us, almost independent of the conditions around us.
So if I am in a hurry to get somewhere, driving somewhere,
and someone is driving really slow, my eagerness, my strong desire to get someplace is frustrated.
And I might get angry or get afraid, reacting to the person who's driving slow.
Another situation, same situation, I might be trying to go somewhere,
maybe I need to get there on time, but I'm driving in a relaxed, open way.
Someone's driving slow and I see it and I say, oh, someone's driving slow
and looks like someone who maybe is old and is just trying to drive carefully.
So I let it be and I use it as occasion just to relax.
And in that relaxation, that just being the situation, there's now room more deeply
that I'm not reacting to anything, but there's a feeling of contentment
or a feeling of gratitude for the day and the sky and things like that.
There might be a sense of care and love for the person driving slow.
And it's not being triggered by what's out there, it's just kind of a natural kind of upwelling of warmth
for someone who's driving carefully and caring for them.
We sit and meditate and we might feel like we're very ambitious
to get really deeply concentrated right away and that ambition to get,
and maybe we have a bad feeling for ourselves, we feel like we somehow don't succeed very well in things in our lives
and meditation is supposed to help us and it's supposed to be an alternative to the challenges of life
but I have to be successful in meditation and then we're not getting concentrated.
And so already there's a built up tension behind doing the meditation.
And so when meditation is not going successfully, we react to that.
We get angry at meditation, angry at ourselves, angry at Buddhism, angry at the world.
Reacting, I think of it more as the surface level of who we are.
We're carrying the tensions and stresses, emotional, physical, mental.
And those stresses, when they're touched by the world, they get triggered.
When we have a great capacity and lots of space and ability to be open, to be relaxed, to be present
and without those surface tensions, stresses, then for someone who's really mature in this practice,
there are no triggers.
Things occur and they don't...
So if we hold up, in Buddhism there's the idea of holding up conceit
and something comes along that threatens that conceit, there's like a collision
and then there's a reaction to it.
If there's no conceit, something comes along and criticizes us
and normally maybe it doesn't hit our conceit, it just goes right through.
But that's going right through that capacity to not be caught, not be reactive,
not have something up there that inside that the world hits
makes room for the upwelling of a lot of wonderful emotions.
There's an upwelling of healing, upwelling of movement towards harmony, movement towards unification.
There's upwelling of contentment or peace, sometimes joy and happiness.
And that which is up that wells up is not reactive.
That is what's dharmic.
Dharmic emotions, dharmic feelings are those that arise in the space
where kind of an empty space in a certain kind of way, empty of tension
and empty of holding on to certain emotions, empty in having certain kinds of demands
on the situation or expectations or cravings or ambitions
or a strong sense of self that we're protecting or hiding or something.
And so the dharmic emotions are those, the kind of nondharmic are the ones that arise
when there's a collision with something hard inside of us.
That's the nondharmic.
The dharmic is when there's nothing in there and there's space
and things can go right through, but more importantly there's space for things to well up.
And the classic analogy for this, similarly for it, is that of a mountain lake
where there's no rivers or rain that fills the lake,
it's getting completely refreshed from an underground fountain, underground spring
that's welling up from the bottom of the lake, spreading this fresh water throughout the lake.
So in the same way, we're not depending on input from the world around us,
the rivers coming into the lake, and we're not depending on the rain,
all the thoughts and ideas we have in the mind in order to have this upwelling,
but rather there's more like a subtleness, a relaxation,
a real sense of presence, a tension to hear,
and then an upwelling as a chance to arise.
We have within us a tremendous dharmic capacity for a flow,
for a naturalness of positive emotions, things like love and care and joy and contentment,
gratitude, delight, compassion, beautiful, beautiful states.
But they're not states that we make happen reactively,
they are almost like a gift that comes when our capacity to be present is expansive and open,
and we're patient and available without the stirring up or the agitation of reactivity,
of a lot of desires that are pushing us around, a lot of aversion pushing us around,
there's a subtleness happening.
So this distinction between those emotions that are born out of our reactivity
and those that emotions that arise from a deeper upwelling
that is not a reaction, but is more like the innate capacity of our system,
the psychophysical system, to express itself, to manifest something
that is responsive and in harmony with our environment and with what's happening.
So I don't know how well I've articulated this,
but I think maybe well enough this distinction to maybe give you something to reflect on this weekend.
To think a little bit about the source of the different emotions that come through over the next few days
are the emotions, more reactive emotions, even the joyful ones,
they're reacting to something that's happening in the world so that it's touching,
so hitting something inside there that then just reacts.
Or is there an upwelling? Is there a naturalness?
Is there a kind of a, almost as if you're getting out of the way and something wells up?
A dharmic joy, dharmic happiness that doesn't depend on the conditions of the world.
Reactive emotions depend on the conditions of the world and the world being ourselves as well.
The dharmic are those which are independent, non-dependent in a certain kind of way.
So then one announcement that some of you might be interested in that in a few weeks,
a couple of weeks at July 9th through Insight Retreat Center,
we're going to have a day-long retreat online on Zoom that I'll be teaching.
And if some of you would like to kind of continue this deeper away, then for a day-long,
you can go probably to the InsightRetreatCenter.org website,
or at some point in the next while it'll probably be an announcement about this on the IMC website too,
on the what's new. So thank you all.
And I was thinking that maybe on next Monday, next week,
maybe to continue with a theme of emotions, but maybe to go through and choose five different emotions
to consider and reflect on how to practice with and how what we've been talking about this week might apply
to particular situations. So thank you.
