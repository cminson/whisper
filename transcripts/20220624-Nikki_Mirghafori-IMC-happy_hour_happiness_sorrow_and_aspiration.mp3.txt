Here we go. Great.
So, hello and welcome to Happy Hour everyone, wherever you are, whatever time zone you're in.
And for today's Happy Hour, I wanted to give the guided meditation inspired from a few quotes on happiness.
I wanted to share a few quotes on happiness. I thought that would be fun to do that tonight.
Given that this is Happy Hour, so let's talk about happiness. So here are a few quotes that I wanted to share with you.
The first one is from Mother Teresa and she says, there is no key to happiness. The door is always open.
I love this one. There is no key to happiness. You know how people say the key to happiness is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There is no key to happiness.
The door is always open. I love that. I love that.
It's kind of synonymous with what something that we've worked with and I've shared before the title of this book, happiness is a choice you make.
It's just a matter of choice. It's always available. It's always here.
And so that's one quote. Let's keep that one in mind. I love that one. Here's another one.
Here's this one is from the Dalai Lama. Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
I like that too. It's not something that is made, but it just comes from your actions.
And I think to that I also add because in Buddhism actions are not just physical actions, but actions of speech and mind and decisions are actions of the mind.
So these two quotes are related.
And this one is from Marcus Aurelius. A stoic philosopher. And there's a lot of similarity, by the way, between stoicism and Buddhism.
And this is a great one, actually. Very little is needed to make a happy life. It is all within yourself in your way of thinking.
I'll read it one more time. Very little is needed to make a happy life. It is all within yourself in your way of thinking.
And we've seen echoes of that in the other quotes and also in what we've practiced.
Oh, this one I like too. This is a good one.
This one is from Chinma Yananda Saraswati.
And they say, don't put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket.
This is a good one. Don't put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket.
Okay, I'll give you, maybe I'll share one more. These are so good. I was having so much fun. I couldn't choose which one to just choose once.
I thought, yeah, I'll just, you know, as my little intro, I'll share these different ones and let you maybe for yourself see which one you relate to the most.
This one is from Milton Erickson.
And they say, life will bring you pain all by itself. Your responsibility is to create joy.
Life will bring you pain all by itself. Your responsibility is to create joy.
Okay, one last one. All right, here's the last one. Okay, really, really last one.
This is from Friedrich Koenig.
And the quote is, we tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have, but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have.
One more time, we tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have.
But rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have.
Okay, so I could continue, but I think that's enough to set the stage for tonight's practice together.
Guided meditation. I'll bring some of these themes in and, yeah, let's begin together. Let's begin.
I'd like to invite you all to get into your meditation posture, whether it's lying down, it's sitting, whatever it might be.
Inviting yourself to land, to land in your body.
Greeting, greeting this body, this moment. Whatever is present. If heartache is present, welcoming that, embracing that.
Sadness, if challenges in the body, pain, it's all okay. We don't have to push anything away for happiness to be here.
It can contain everything. So embracing, embracing whatever is here.
And releasing, releasing the body, releasing the body, the tightness, the hold, the tension.
The forehead, starting with the forehead.
Softening, softening this part of the body, the forehead, usually signaling how much tension, tightness there is in the rest of the body.
Softening the jaw.
Inviting your teeth to relax. This is almost like a call-on. Say, what? How do I make that happen? It's an invitation to make your face relax.
Inviting your ears to relax. The muscles behind your face.
No need to hold up any mask. As if you're attending a loving kind of spa, and your face is getting an internal massage.
Lovingly, relax to your muscles. Relax. It's okay.
Every breath, massaging the muscles of the face.
Hanging out here for a moment.
No rush. Not rushing anywhere.
Inviting the breath to massage your neck and shoulders.
Noiting the breath to give a mental massage to your heart, your heart center.
Holding, making space for whatever is present.
Especially if there's tenderness. If had a challenging day, or days.
No need to hold up any mask.
No need to hold up.
Inviting the abdomen, the back to release. Feel calmed, cool, or warmed, whatever the need is by the breath.
Comfort it.
Sit bones, landing on the seat, release. Releasing the tension, your upper legs, your knees, your lower legs, and feet.
No need to hold up any mask.
No need to hold up any mask.
No need to hold up any mask.
Letting the breath move throughout the whole body, calming, soothing, like a lullaby.
If there is pain in your heart, or any challenges in the body and the mind, let them be held kindly.
As if there is a loving presence, loving embrace, holding you, holding whatever is challenging.
With care, with warmth, don't have to be any other way, any different than how you're showing up right now.
Having that trusting that for every being there are ten thousand sorrows.
This being human is tough.
And there are ten thousand joys.
Letting the challenges, the sorrow, be held with kindness, with compassion.
And knowing that the capacity of our heart is expansive, it can hold joy.
Our good fortune can turn to it.
Any moment.
Not putting the key to our happiness in someone else's pocket, or even in our own pocket.
No key needed.
Mother Teresa said, there is no key to happiness. The door is always open.
Not in getting what we want, which is endless. The list of what we want is endless.
The mind will always come up with something else to want.
Of course it does.
It's the nature of samsara, wanting this, wanting that.
Not a sin to want, not a problem. It doesn't bring happiness, but to appreciate.
To appreciate.
What there is already, this amazing life, being alive.
Having agency, being able to think, being able to touch other people's lives.
So many gifts.
To be alive, to have this precious human life.
I'll read another quote from the Dalai Lama. Let it drop into your body, into your heart.
See what might bubble up.
Every day, think as you wake up. Today I am fortunate to be alive.
I have a precious human life.
I am not going to waste it.
I am going to use all my energies to develop myself.
To expand my heart out to others.
To achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.
I'll read the quote one more time.
Not to think about it, let it shower your heart.
Feeling the energy of this quote in your heart, in your body.
Maybe something rings true for you, comes alive.
Here we go.
Every day, think as you wake up.
Today I am fortunate to be alive.
I have a precious human life.
I am not going to waste it.
I am going to use all my energies to develop myself.
To expand my heart out to others.
Enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.
Let us sit with the reverberation of these words in our bodies, in our heart.
Not thinking, just breathing or being breathed.
See what else might bubble up.
Performed time for reflection.
In silence externally, and maybe even internally.
In silence externally, and maybe even internally.
In silence externally, and maybe even internally.
In silence externally, and maybe even internally.
In silence externally, and maybe even internally.
In silence externally, and maybe even internally.
And whatever rises, whatever percolates, can we have kindness, acceptance towards whatever arises.
Even if it's a crowd of sorrows, can we be kind to whatever arises.
Needed with a smile, a generous smile, with a security blanket, a safety blanket.
And also knowing that every moment, we can turn, we can know that our heart is so expansive.
We can contain challenges, can contain joy, aspiration, can contain happiness,
knowing the blessings of our precious human birth, and all the opportunities we have been given.
All the gifts we have.
Every day, think as you wake up.
Today, I'm fortunate to be alive.
I have a precious human life. I am not going to waste it.
I am going to use all my energies to develop myself.
To expand my heart to others.
To achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
As we approach the end of this practice period,
knowing in your heart that you are cultivating yourself,
that you are using your energies to extend your heart to others, to yourself, to others through Mehta,
that you are walking this path towards awakening,
and knowing this, not evaluating your progress every moment, every five minutes,
but knowing that you are practicing.
This, in and of itself, is a cause for happiness.
Knowing this brings up happiness in the heart.
Let us together gift with generosity, another act of cultivation.
Generously give, generously offer our goodness,
our actions of mind, speech, and intention.
Decision to create joy, happiness, to extend our heart.
Offer this goodness to all beings everywhere.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you all.
Thank you for your practice.
We have some time for any reflections you'd like to share, anything that came up,
any questions, any complaints, everything is welcome.
As we've weaved through a few themes, the quotes on happiness and joy,
that it's about turning our minds to it, and also the inspiring invitation of the Dalai Lama,
any reflections that came up for you, anything that shifted or moved,
and anything that didn't work, it's all okay.
Sharing your reflections for the benefit of others.
Fred, I see your hand, or trying to raise your hand, I see it's a clap,
you're trying to raise your hand.
I was trying, thank you.
So I just like to say what I experienced and see what you say.
So I was feeling a little agitation, you know, some sorrow.
And I was trying to then open my heart simultaneously, so that all these things would exist together.
Not like a mental process where you can't really think of three disparate things simultaneously.
It seems that emotionally or psychologically you can, I think.
And I wasn't trying to have a battle royale between them, but just let them coexist because they were going to anyway.
Though maybe the sadness and agitation would be there without my bidding, and I needed to open up to the heart being more welcoming and more loving.
So that's my experience.
What do you think?
Love it, Fred.
I love how you're talking about these disparate, perhaps, or different emotion states coexisting, their sense of sadness, agitation, and then opening your heart.
Letting them coexist in a way, that's what I'm hearing, there's this coexistence of.
And I think that's what I was actually inviting you to do tonight, which is invite, allow the heartache or challenge to be there.
And for there to be also be a soothing, for there to be a soothing, comforting and welcoming of it, and to know that maybe there could be a little bit of joy, happiness, acknowledging that, oh, yeah, there are gifts here, as well as aspiration.
So it's like a big soup.
It's like that's our human condition, right?
All of these things present at the same time.
So that was that was the crux of my invitation and what I'm hearing is that actually, yeah, you were working with Patrick.
Yeah, it's not like I'm pitting them against it's not like the comforting supposed to make them go away.
It's like, yeah, it's all present.
That's what I'm hearing was was happening for you.
And that's lovely.
I don't have a sense of it being a success.
You know, it's just all things are present.
Yeah.
I, I've been thinking often on sometimes during a happy hour of the ending of a novel that I'm embarrassed to say I can't remember, but it was written by Anthony Mira.
And it involves really terrible things that happened in the Chechen war.
And at the very end, there are a couple of survivors who are maintaining a hospital in the midst of immense suffering.
And they do this with a kind of, they do it with duty and determination and occasionally joy against all odds of things turning out well.
But, but a young girl escapes, and they know that she's alive and that she will go on to do good things in the world.
She's like there.
She's their heart who is their who is their missionary out in the world.
It's, it's almost worth the pain of reading this book to reach the last pages of it.
So anyway, thank you.
Thank you, Fred.
Thanks for sharing that.
And, and also what you were sharing about the book, there's a sense of yes, even in the midst of so much challenge.
There was sense of joy that you were talking about this book and, and also referring back or connecting that to what you were saying.
It doesn't feel like a sense of success or like, oh yeah, I've managed.
And yet that is what the quote unquote success here is, is, is allowing all of this to be is, is the, is the recognition.
That's it.
The recognition that all of this can be that the sadness, the challenge can be there with the comforting, the soothing, the meta and with the aspiration and with the joy that all of these can be present together.
Doesn't have to be one or the other.
And actually that is amazing.
You, you may see, you know, I wonder if you feel like there is, is there more to this? Well, maybe there is more to it. Maybe there isn't. Maybe this, this is it.
Maybe this is exactly it.
I don't know if there are more you want to comment or if it feels complete for you.
But yet this is, this is it.
This is exactly it.
It's, it's the full catastrophe of being human. And can we embrace the beauty of the full catastrophe as you beautifully just talked about.
Thank you.
Thank you, Fred. Thank you.
Yeah.
And one reflection, one reflection coming privately and it is, I have been feeling jealous and being left out for the past week.
I'm not really mindful of it, but it feels a bit overwhelming. I was wondering if you have any suggestions on how to be with it. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I think being mindful of it. It's the person who wrote the reflection, you know, when, when jealousy or envy arises feeling left out. I think what can be even more helpful than, than just being mindful of it, mindful of it is like, okay, I know you're there, I know you're there.
But I would actually recommend being with it with compassion, really holding it with compassion because there's a lot of pain when one is feeling left out when feeling envious and just there's so much pain.
Holding that pain with a lot of compassion instead of blaming oneself like, oh, you shouldn't be jealous, you should be, you should rise above us. Well, in this moment, sweetheart, it's okay. It's just, it's hurting for whatever caused some conditions in the past, childhood, this, that, the world,
the world, zeitgeist. Yeah, this is, this is what's here right now. So that's, that's what I would invite the person who wrote that and others who might be going through this to, to really turn towards it with compassion, just give it a lot of space.
Hold it with compassion and see what it might, what's underneath it, what's underneath the feeling jealous feeling left out, what is, and is, and as you hold it with compassion and care, maybe there is a sense of generosity that arises from that generosity towards yourself,
soft generosity towards others when it is cared for, when it is really held completely. I hope that makes sense. If you give the hurt attention and really hold it with compassion and some generosity from the hurt can arise.
You're welcome. When reflection on YouTube touched the nerve, the guided meditation, I think they're referring to, so many tears and so much love and comfort. Thank you. Ah, thank you for sharing that.
Lovely. So dear friends, let's turn as a Dalai Lama talks about to expand my heart to others. Let's expand our heart to others in small groups. So I'll create the breakout rooms and see if you can extend your heart to others in any way that that is accessible.
Extend your heart to yourself. Not pushing, not trying to hard, but just extending your heart. What is it like to show up with an extended heart that holds suffering and joy and aspiration and jealousy and all just it just holds the full catastrophe of being human for yourself and for others.
And again, speaking just from your own experience, not managing others or, or managing the group, just offering what you like.
Also, you can just offer your silence when your turn comes a pass.
One sentence with your one, one nugget of one of thought, the next person, the next person, they'll come back to you. So you'll go through it a few times. So the rooms are created.
And we'll actually hold on. Let me. There we go. The rooms are created. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go.
The rooms are all back and we are at time. So I'm thinking we let's respect the time. I will stay a couple of minutes extra on zoom if there are new reflections questions you like to share, but let's bring this session to a close.
And a nice time connecting with each other. Thank you all for showing up for practicing for cultivating your heart, extending your heart to others.
May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thanks, everyone.
