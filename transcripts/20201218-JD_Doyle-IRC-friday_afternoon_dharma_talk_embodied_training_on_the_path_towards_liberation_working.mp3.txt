It's so lovely to be here with all of you on this retreat.
Today I'd like to talk about this embodied training that we're on in this practice on
the path to liberation.
Okay, thank you, bells ringing, that was my alarm.
All right, thank you.
So thank you for my support, for your support Eric.
So I'd like to talk tonight on this embodied training that we are engaged in on our path
to liberation.
And speaking to this process that we're in as we come on, come in retreat, you know there's
a real way that I think of retreat as a way that we're coming home to ourselves, that
we're dislodging ourselves from kind of our ordinary operating in the world, even if we
are still in our ordinary places.
There's this ordinary way that we may behave in the world where we do something and we
receive something and there's these operations and these procedures that happen.
That's very transactional, like I'm doing this in order to get that, and then I do this
and I get that, and on retreat, we're really stepping into this mystery of all the causes
and conditions that have happened up to this time, that means that we all have arrived
here together in this space to practice for the liberation of ourselves and all beings.
And so we're seeing ourselves through this lens of freedom, through this lens of freedom
not just for ourselves but for the world, for all beings.
And so this is this path of caring, of kindness, where we shift to really looking at our actions
with reverence, this sense of the sacred that we were talking about earlier in the retreat.
And in the Buddhist training, in the talking of what it means to be on this path, there's
three parts that are often spoken to.
And many of you will be familiar with this, well, the many Buddhist lists, and this one
is the Sila, Samadhi, and Panya.
And so when we look at our path and our training, we can look at it through this lens.
And Sila, S-I-L-A in Pali is often translated as ethics or virtue or morality.
And that is thought of as a real foundation to what we're doing, that the way that we
are living in our body and our speech and our mind, and engaging with each other with
this undeniable love.
How are we creating a whole integral integrity, how are we creating integrity for ourselves
and for our world?
And then the second aspect of the path is Samadhi, S-A-M-A-D-H-I in the Pali.
And that is translated in many different ways, and the very narrow sense of translation is
concentration or meditation, which is what we've been focusing on here.
And in a broader understanding is this harmonizing of mind, this way that we can bring the mind
together and harmonize mindfulness, meditation, and this whole aspect of the cultivation of
the mind.
And then the third part is Panya, which is P-A-N-N-A in the Pali with the little funny
squiggles on the ends, N-Y-S.
And that's wisdom or insight.
And this is not the wisdom that we have trained in most of our schooling in this culture in
the United States, where we get book learned and we get an analytical mind that is very
useful in solving problems and things like that.
But this is a cultivation of wisdom, where insight arises, where we're seeing clearly.
And so it's an experiential knowledge of the way things are in the world, the way things
have come to be.
And so you may get the sense when you know there's some people who are super smart, like
you may be like, wow, they are really learned, they've gotten maybe a PhD or two or two
masters, and then you're like, but are they always wise?
So this wisdom has this bit of an intuitive aspect to it, that where we're realizing
or perceiving the true nature of reality, not as we want them to be, not as we break
them into our perceptions and concepts around them, this wisdom is not a conceptual understanding.
It's seeing clearly into what are called the three characteristics, which I'm not going
to go into tonight, but I'll just mention.
So the wisdom is seeing clearly into the three characteristics, which are impermanence, that
the world is changing, that there's no abiding self, and that there's no there's this thing
called unsatisfactoriness and stress that arises.
So these are the three things that we can use to help understand wisdom in this way.
So we may seem like we're just focusing on this one aspect of the path here during our
retreat, this middle part of Samadhi or meditation, but really we're bringing along these other
two, it's kind of like a hologram, but you can't actually separate them.
And so this integrity and the wisdom will come along and depends on this kind of almost
the perspective and how we're looking at it.
So there's ways of knowing and ways of seeing.
And so as one engages through one, the others can be cultivated and vice versa.
The Buddha says it like this in the Mahapari Nibbana Sutta.
Such is Sela, such is Samadhi, such is Panya.
When Sela is fully developed, Samadhi is of great fruit and benefit.
When Samadhi is fully developed, Panya is of great fruit and benefit.
So this really speaks to the underlying necessity of the foundation of looking at our ethics.
And one of the things that I think about ethics is this in our retreat right now, where some
of many of us are engaged, more some than others, with other people is like, how do
I apply this path not only to the inner mind states, but to this outer world of people
who say and do things during my meditation retreat, wait a second, this is not supposed
to be happening.
And so how do I act with integrity within all of that?
And so I'd like to suggest that we can use this same practice that we've been doing
all along for meditation, this practice of the four foundations that Bob was talking
as mentioned is called the Satipatanas.
And we've been focusing a lot on the contemplation of body, mindfulness of the body, the body
sitting, the body moving, the body doing dishes, the body brushing teeth, the body eating,
just being mindful of the body.
And then this morning, this contemplation of mindfulness of Vedana, of feeling tone.
And this is noticing the accompanying, I really like the term valence that Bob used of valence
of each moment.
So I'm eating and pleasant, but then I eat another bite, it's unpleasant, and then the
next one neutral.
So noticing both the body and the accompanying valence of it.
And then the next two are contemplation of the mind, like what's happening in the mind.
And then the fourth one is the contemplations of the dharmas, the Buddhist teachings.
And so today I'm going to be talking a little bit in this about these mind states.
And the Buddha, you know, at least for me, this instills great confidence in me and the
power and transformative process of this path.
The Buddha says about this path of the four Satipatanas, that this is the direct path
for the removal of worry and sorrow, for being without vexations, for attaining great
knowledge and wisdom, for accomplishing the realization of Nibbana.
I don't know, I would probably sign up if I heard that, it's pretty good advertisement
that this is the direct path, this one that we are all practicing here, for removal of
worry and sorrow, for being without vexations, for that insight, that wisdom, for accomplishing
Nibbana.
Now the translation of Nibbana that really lands well for me is that Nibbana is this
heart, mind, body that is free from greed, free from hatred, and free from ignorance.
So the realization of what it means to be free from these forces of hatred, these forces
of greed, and the forces of ignorance.
So this path that we're on, this unfolding, while it may not seem like we're getting close
to being free from greed, but just that watching, that attending to the mindfulness, the loving
awareness that we're cultivating of coming back to this moment is a piece of this path.
And a lot of times we focus on the first two, the greed and the aversion, and I will talk
a little bit more about them later, but I wanted to start by inviting us into ignorance.
It's not a really fun place to begin, but it's actually this place that it's not very
fun to acknowledge that I'm ignorant, but there's so much that I'm ignorant about.
You know, I don't know how you're all thinking or feeling, especially because you're not
in the room with me.
I can't even get an energetic sense.
I don't know if this is the right talk for you at this time.
Maybe it is for some, maybe for not.
I don't know if I'm going to do a good job.
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.
There's so many things I'm ignorant of.
And because there's so much ignorance, I often try to pretend like I think I know.
I set up my perceptions, the way the world will run.
I'll say this, you'll do that.
And then, you know, like if it was the movies, there'd be a happy ending or maybe it's a
thriller and there's not such a happy ending, but you know, there's this way that we think
the world runs and then we create the world in that image.
And so I invite ourselves into kind of some of what Bob was referring to in, you know,
the not knowing this uncertainty of the world that we live in.
And certainly there's enough that we can see right now that really lets us know the truth
of the changing nature of our world, this uncertainty of our time.
There's been so many changes this year that I could never have imagined would happen that
the truth of uncertainty is something that I've really come to cherish this year because
I didn't believe these things would happen.
Or how many other things are possible for my life, for our lives together collectively.
And yet there is this sense within me that I want to have a constant world, that I want
the world to be a certain way, that I want these blocks that I can just sort of like
when you're a kid and you build your towns and then you drive the cars or the people
going in and out of the stores and everything to be a certain way and we hold onto that
view.
And so that's an interesting place to notice that even though with one hand we can see this
uncertainty at this other hand that there's still this belief in the constancy and there's
some comfort in that belief.
I have a children, many of you know, amazing Shambhala meditation teacher in the book,
When Things Fall Apart, Heartful Advice for Hard Times, it's very appropriate for us.
She says, we think that the point is to pass the test or overcome the problem.
But the truth is that things don't really get solved.
And they come together and they fall apart.
And then they come together again and fall apart again.
It's just like that.
The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen, room for grief,
for relief, for misery, for joy.
So we have this idea that there's like this linear path that we're progressing on that's
always almost like those signs that all the corporations want to see that the arrow is
always going up and that we're always getting better.
But how does that myth really support us when that is not the world, that the world is that
they come together and they fall apart and they come together again and they fall apart
again.
And it's just like that.
You know, and Pema Children's other book and sometimes I think all I have to do is read
her titles and she says the other book comfortable with uncertainty, 108 teachings on cultivating
fearlessness and compassion.
So this really is this way that we can build stamina with this discomfort of the world,
the ever changing nature of the world, this mindfulness, this transformative power, these
teachings of the Buddha, because certainly the Buddha lived in a world that had war,
that had famine, that had hardship, that had poverty, that had caste system, that had inequality.
And yet there is a way that we can transform ourselves in relationship to these situations
in the world.
And so one of the interesting things for me as a practitioner is that the Buddha offered
us some teachings.
And yet as you read the Buddhist teachings, there are ways that, you know, they kind of
are moving a little bit for this person or that person or sometimes how do I engage with
these teachings?
What does it mean for me in my particular location and who I am?
And so what I'd like to offer tonight is focusing on five mental forces, because this is the
third thing, the mental factors that the Buddha described that have been around for, you know,
over 2,500 years that we can still practice with now.
And so these are characteristics of the mind that we often take personally, but since the
Buddha described them 2,500 years ago, they know they're not personal, they're just forces
of the mind.
And in Pali, they're known as the five nivarana, N-I-V-A-R-A-N-A.
And I bring that up because as soon as I say the English word, everyone's going to be like
eh.
So in English, the translation is hindrances.
And I think that's quite unfortunate because like the excitement about studying anything
that's a hindrance does not sound like we're on that path to liberation.
It sounds like it's that, you know, off-ramp where you end up with your flat tire over
there and, you know, I'd really rather be on that super highway, the one that the Buddha
says leads to freedom.
And so I bring up this place because these are mental factors, these are forces of the
mind that we all have.
And yet it's so easy for us to get caught, caught in them.
And in translation from Pali, the word that's often used instead of hindrances, the closely
related word is coverings.
And so in this way, the hindrances cover our minds so that we kind of think we're going
in the right direction, but we're have like a veil or a covering.
And so they hinder our ability to see clearly in our capacity to develop this stable balance
to mind.
The Buddhist meditation teacher, Gloria Terania Ambrosia calls the hindrances the coping strategies
of the unawakened mind, because it said that we all have the hindrances until we are awakened.
And so these are our coping strategies, our coping strategies.
But if I think about this word coverings, I could also think about the hindrances as
being sort of disguises or facades or almost a way that we think we're masquerading as
being awakened, like that we get some sort of taste or flavor of a little bit of freedom
and we think maybe that's it.
So I wanted to share this quote from James Baldwin about masks because I think it really
helps to see how we can get caught with these masks.
And you probably have heard this quote because it's often used.
And he wrote, love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without.
And no, we cannot live within.
Let me read that again.
He says, love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without.
And no, we cannot live within.
So to me, when I think about this aspect of love, it leads me to this sense of the integrity
and ethics of life.
And he continues in this quote, and he says, I use the word love here, not merely in the
personal sense, but as the state of being or a state of grace, not in the infantile
American sense of being made happy, but in the tough and universal sense of quest and
daring and growth.
So this way that we take off these masks and engage fully from this heart and this place
of love so that we can open to these places that could be challenging and difficult with
the sense of daring and hope for growth.
And I think this way of looking at it as a mask to me was really helpful to think of
because I don't always know the masks that I'm wearing or the mask that other people
put on me.
And this is a place that I'm just ignorant.
And ignorance is not something that's my fault if I don't know it, I don't know it.
But I can learn and pay attention with my mindfulness practice.
And then we can begin to see where we're mistaken in our understanding.
Sometimes I don't know about you, but sometimes I have like an inkling, like you get a sense
of like, there's something not exactly right here, but I don't know what it is.
And I have begun to with my mindfulness practice to begin to able to feel that in the body.
Luckily, as many of you probably have friends who are also meditators and so like, it's
probably four or five years into my practice, maybe longer, I'm sad to say, but I was walking
with this friend and I made her stop and I was like, I just had a gut feeling.
You know, I hadn't like every people always said you have this feeling in your gut that
you know something, but I had never quite reached at it at the same time.
And so I was like, wait, wait, I have to feel this.
I just had that gut feeling when you said something.
And that's the process of like something happens and then we can attune to what's happening
here in this heart, mind, body, and we can begin to see clearly take off those masks.
So the reason why I bring up these five hindrances or five coverings is because we can directly
practice with them.
So often what will happen is that something will arise in our life and we think it's our
fault.
I did this, this is wrong, I need to fix it or you did this, this is wrong, you need
to fix it, they did this, this is wrong, they need to fix it and we just kind of keep going
on and on.
With these we can become to know and we can learn how to practice for ourselves and in
community.
And so the basic instruction, the lowest bar, if you will, of the Buddhist teaching about
the hindrances is no one is present, no one is not present.
So everybody check in right now, let's just start with the first one right now, sense
desire, is it present?
Is it not present?
Well then you get like, well how do I know if it's present?
Sense desire would occur in one of the six senses, so the ears, the eyes, the nose, the
mouth, what did I forget, and then the mind.
So are we wanting something?
Is there a wanting?
Do I want a certain taste?
Do I want a certain smell?
Do I want it to feel a certain way?
Is it here?
Is it not here?
And the not here is a really interesting one because if it's not here, then we can celebrate.
Wow, I'm not craving any sense desires right now.
And then there's that place where the Vedana, which may have been neutral, may get to be
slightly pleasant, and we can rest in that knowing that it's possible to just be contented
right then.
And so we can, when we do this, we can drop into the body and we can kind of figure out
what is the attitude in the mind.
And I would like to suggest, having worked for over 20 years with students, children
kindergarten through mostly elementary, but also middle school, that instead of thinking
of this as your homework, that you think about this more like you're at recess, like you're
on the playground.
And so that it's not something that you have to do, but it's something that you play with,
that you play with, like, who wants to feel like in the body, I feel anything in the toes?
Am I on the monkey bars right now, or am I going down the slide?
You know, what does it feel like?
What is happening for you in the mind?
What's happening in the mind?
Does somebody in front of me in line for the tether ball and I'm getting frustrated?
Or did I just, you know, feel the success of getting that tether ball around the pole?
Like bring that lightness that can kind of begin to open up that sense of identification
that it's my fault that I'm feeling this craving, that rather than these are things
that go through us.
So I wanted to share a couple of the descriptions of the Buddha offered us, because these hindrances
are so rich that the Buddha also used lots of metaphors to describe them.
And since we're thinking about them as masks, I wanted to use these metaphors that he offered
that have to do with a pot of water.
And I think somebody mentioned how often looking at them like use a pot of water as a mirror.
And so for this first, first hindrance or covering sense, desire, the Buddha described
it this way.
And so just thinking about yourself when you have like in your seeing something or for
example, and the Buddha says, if there is a pot of water mixed with orange, yellow, indigo
or crimson dye, and a person with good sight should consider their own facial image in it,
they could not recognize nor see it as it really is.
So too, when someone abides with their mind, pervaded with sensual desire, overcome by
wanting.
So here's this person who's looking in this pot of water and then there's all these colors.
Sounds so beautiful.
Like wouldn't that be fun to just see myself as like this multicolored, you know, it's
like I'm going to a party or something.
So that might be part of it.
But is that really seen clearly?
Is that going to what's going to lead towards freedom?
It's not to say that we can't have fun and wear colors and things like that.
But this is when do we see clearly because once I know I'm not seeing clearly, then I'm
seeing clearly.
And one of the things that sense desires points to is the mass that we think that we're liberated
when we get pleasant things.
When things are going well, there's this accompany thing of like, I must be doing something
right.
And then when things aren't going well, then there's a thought of like, I must be doing
or you, you know, depending on how it is.
So being able to have this space between the pleasant helps us see that there are these
causes, myriad causes and conditions that are happening that bring rise to the pleasant.
Where did these colors come from?
How are they arising?
What is that?
What is happening now?
And then the image that the Buddha offers for the second one.
So this is the first two are kind of coupled.
The first one is the senses I are wanting.
And the second one is very similar of the aversion of not wanting or pushing away.
No will or aversion that's often called.
And this has many ranges could be dislike or irritation or frustration or rage or hatred.
But the image here is also quite, quite visual.
And he says, if there is a pot of water heated over a fire, bubbling and boiling, and a person
with good sight should consider their own faced image in it, they could not recognize
nor see it as it really is.
So too, when someone abides with their mind pervaded by ill will overcome with aversion.
So when we have this mask of irritation, there's a sense, I mean, we can feel it.
And this is where we can come into the body and we can feel that bubbling, the fiery.
And then, you know, sometimes we seek to push things away.
That's the aversion.
And oftentimes the Vedic can be quite unpleasant.
But at the same time, I mean, if we think purely of the fire, there are times that we
want fire to cook our food or to do different things.
So it's not necessarily the fire is bad, the anger is bad, we don't need to make that association
or I am the personal personality that gets in there.
Seeing this vein of like unpleasant boiling helps support this.
So I was hoping that we could practice for a moment with these two different mind states
just to see what it's like to embody them.
So the first thing I would like you to do is just to bring to mind something that's
pleasant, some sense desire just for this exercise, make it an object.
Think of something that you really want to could be your favorite meal or maybe there's
a shoes that you like or just something that you find pleasant.
And then close your eyes and imagine like it's just out in front of you and then reach
out your hand if you would like to and see what it feels like to be reaching for that
whatever it is that thing that's going to provide this pleasant sensation, that pleasant
sensation to be in the mind, it could be in the eyes or the ears, maybe it's beautiful
music, notice in the body what it feels like.
Now take your other arm and if you have your arm and then just gently bring that arm back
and support it and notice what it likes to be to feel back in balance if you will because
if you're like me when I'm wanting that pleasant leaning into I'm off balance and so that's
kind of where we get caught because there's that sense the wanting to get so exciting
that we can think just about there and it's really there's an excitement in it and that
can be a mask that I'm going somewhere I'm getting something but who is this eye that's
going somewhere?
What is this thing that's impermanent that I want to get?
Where is the suffering in that?
So now let's just take the second one here, this experience of aversion.
So for this one if you care to play along here is just clench your fist if that's available
to you just like something you really don't want happening maybe just a little something
just like I'm going to bring it to mind a little toddler as I do it I could just sort
of feel that sense all right and now imagine you're doing this in your meditation practice
and you want to stop so you're just like making like you can take your other hand and see
if you can make it stop like can you make this contraction like and you want I don't
want to have aversion going to make it go away you're probably not getting very far
with that but if you take your other hand and you just provide some support just not
needing to do anything just surprising some support and you might and like my hands pretty
tightly grasped so it's not like coming on done very quickly but you might begin to
see that with support there might be some opening
and I bring this to mind because it's really important to allow us the time and the patience
and the perseverance with these so-called hindrances that are our path that they actually
can be gateways to opening but they're not going to do it because you know I'm going
to crack this aversion right now it's not a linear process like that and the other thing
that I want to speak to with these hindrances as well is that sometimes there's an intuitive
sense of the body especially if we've had traumatic experiences that these experiences
of our version or wanting something might be hooked in with histories of our families
of our culture and so paying attention to that sense of resistance that resistance might
be telling us might hold some wisdom in that point so that way of like I'm going to get
to this bottom of this you might want to hold it with some more spaciousness
so the other two other the next two the hindrances are some that we've already spoken about because
they often come up early on in retreats and the next one is sloth and torpor which is
the tiredness that happens in the body and the sluggishness in the mind and then the
one the other one that is like the flip side which is the restlessness and worry so this
is the agitation in the body or the mind and these as I say these are mental factors that
are arising in us for due to causes and conditions and sometimes we begin to think that there's
a problem that we think that there's something I did on that but they're really just factors
that are happening in the mind and the body and so the images here I want to share because
I just find them so helpful and some people I know can really help to grasp what they
mean by listening to the Buddha's teachings here so for sloth and torpor the description
the metaphor is a pot of water covered with algae and water plants and a person with good
sight should consider their own facial image in it they could not recognize nor see it
as it really is so too when someone abides with their mind pervaded by lethargy and
drowsiness so there's just like you just can't there's something happening that clouds the
mind that doesn't allow us to see clearly and then I'll give you some practices around
this but let me describe the restlessness and worry image before I do that so for restlessness
and worry the description is if there is a pot of water stirred by the wind agitated
swirling producing wavelets and a person with good sight should consider their own facial
image in it they would not recognize nor see it as it really is so too when someone abides
with their mind pervaded by restlessness and worry so the sense of agitation you're looking
to try to see things clearly but it's like a windy day and all those leaves are like
whipping by and I'm trying to see clearly but the conditions are such that it's just
hard to figure out and so remember the first thing that the Buddha says to do is to know
that the hindrance is present so knowing that agitation is present always so windy day like
the weather oh there's algae today on the pond you know in the summer if you see a pond sometimes
is grown as algae it's just not seen clearly or that it's not there wow it's not a windy
day it's a sunny day so just knowing that it's present or not and then coming up and
checking in with the body the other thing that I find is helpful especially with these
ones with the body is inviting spaciousness so so often what we tend to do is we try to
attach to the object so the object could be the breath or the body or the sounds but if
we do spaciousness we can think about what is what is around those sounds so for example
when if you've ever looked at first graders handwriting or kindergarteners handwriting
you know when they first start writing and they start writing all the letters and there's
no spaces between them they're just writing writing writing and they can tell you what
this says but you don't know but then they start and you can kind of see and they'll
put like two fingers between the words and then you can begin to make out the words well
so often we are focused on the words but not the spaces so we get fixated on I you know
a certain aspect a way of being and we can create and look at the spaces around it just
and some of you may be music musicians and you know that the spaces on the music are
as important as the notes and so we're putting the spaciousness so we can see the space around
the forms and take a different perspective if we take a different perspective that can
open up the energy from sluggishness or agitation and can really help us practice with these
mind states so that we don't identify and solidify around them and the last hindrance
is that of doubt let me share the image for this because the image is quite evocative
to me the Buddha says if there is a pot of water that is stirred up turbid and muddy placed
in the dark and a person with good sight should consider their own facial image in it they
could not recognize nor see it as it really is so this is doubt not being able to recognize
because there's a lot of turbidity and muddiness and in addition to that being all shook up
it's placed in the dark I don't know about you but like sometimes there's things in
the back of the closet that I'm just like I know something's back but I can't find
it and I'm just like trying to find these things that I thought I knew and it's just
like I thought this you know just kind of like coming up against that so once again
being for me it's been really helpful to be like I'm trying to make a decision I'm like
what should I do and I'm like oh this is doubt this is doubt I don't know what to do here
it's not clear I'm in the back of the closet trying to find that thing and so these these
are these habit patterns of mine that I'm thinking I'm trying to find clarity from a
spot where the conditions are such that the clear seeing is really hard to to be with
and so one of the things that I think happens is that if we can have this continuity of
practice with the the foundations of mindfulness then we can see these mind states when they
arise the sense desires the version restlessness the sloth and torpor the doubt and we can
come into the body and we can begin to know you know what happens in the body oh what
does doubt like in the body and so they're rather me like oh my gosh I don't know what
to do you be like this is doubt this is what doubt feels like hmm right now doubt is unpleasant
or maybe this agitation is actually kind of pleasant right now I'm feeling like oh I can
run you know I have this so there's this sense of really going into this complexity but simplifying
our practice as we go into it and really understanding that we might not be might not seem like
we're kind of going where we think we want to be going because the path is a little
unclear because we really aren't on a linear path we're each on our own path and we're
doing that collectively just as we're all supporting each other in this minute and so
as we are each doing this we're supporting each other with the care and the abiding with
each other and that's part of the integrity that practices that inclination towards kindness
for ourselves kindness for each other and so to me it's really important to remember
that these hindrances these masks coverings are the path that they themselves are the
gateways to awakening that this freedom from greed wanting the world to be a certain way
what if it's just unpleasant right now what if it's a windy day and so they also be gateways
to knowing ourselves because we can begin to know the patterns the habit tendencies
of each one of us these habit tendencies that have been conditioned by our culture by our
family by our society and we can see how they arise in each one of us and so as we get to
know them within ourselves they can be gateways to freedom and our relationships with ourselves
and each other and we can begin to see how our perceptions the world arise and with
mindfulness and loving attention we can uncover how to attend how do I attend like a garden
how do I attend this body heart and mind with these patterns these histories knowing that
I have this practice mindfulness compassion kindness and so this uncovering of these covers
we can with so many things in Buddhism we can intend towards it and then it will unfold
of its own accord not in the way we want or the way we think it will or the way we think
it should look it's kind of mysterious in that way this gradual path and sometimes it
feels like oh I'm on a roll and all this insight and then another another point it just feels
like we're stalled but that could actually be something you know percolating under the
surface something beginning to germinate so this path requires so much patience and perseverance
and commitment and the commitment is to being with ourselves with as much kindness and caring
and attending as we are to understand the hindrances and how they're hindering us from
this way of being free from greed free from hatred free from delusion and because when
we don't know hatred in ourselves it's hard to know when we're giving that to someone
else when we don't know greed in ourselves it's hard to know when we're being greedy
in relationship to others and so this internal and external becomes seamless for how we engage
in the world.
One of the images that I really love for the path is and I just I guess it was a couple
years ago I read the image of the Buddha as the great blossomed one like you know that
he had blossomed into being and I find that that supports me a lot because each of us
will blossom and you know we're not a monochrome crop you know we're not gonna all become the
cornfield you know in lines and each become we're going to blossom into who we truly are
as we tend to ourselves and supportive in our communities and so that's what I would
hope for each of you on this path as you practice with these mind states with these practices
that the Buddha offered us so that we can live a life of integrity that brings us insight
and wisdom and moments of calm for ourselves and for all beings so thank you for your kind
attention let's just sit for a moment.
Thank you so much we have a
