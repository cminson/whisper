 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello and welcome everyone to this rendition of happy hour practicing together. So this week we have dedicated happy hour to the practice of appreciation, gratitude, giving thanks, appreciating such a beautiful lovely practice and as I shared with you on Wednesday of having practiced it for me with you and also throughout the week with the theme of thanksgiving, giving thanks, this appreciation has been coming up not just on the cushion, not just on the formal practice for me but also in the informal moments which has been lovely. This is really and I hope that has been the case for you and in fact, you know what, let's do this a little untraditionally if anybody would like to raise their hand and share the moments they've realized, they've noticed in this past week, appreciation, gratitude coming up in formal moments and the significance of that. If you like, let's take maybe one or two reflections. If not, we'll move on. Yes, Bill, please. We before we were talking about, you know, thinking of what if we didn't have an advantage of what that would feel like and I didn't consciously plan to do that but in an off moment, for some reason, I started to think of grade school and of a girl who was mentally retarded and it just struck me how different my life would be if I didn't have mental capacities that I have now. And so I felt grateful for that and kind of sad for her thanking of her. Yeah, yeah, thanks for bringing this in this this spontaneous bringing up of of gratitude and appreciation for a gift that you've had, which is your mental capacity, which you've taken in many ways for granted and recalling someone who didn't have this gift and of course with compassion for them out and how challenging many ways life can be and of course, not to also undermine the strength and the grace that many of us with challenges, all of us have different kinds of challenges and mental challenges, including not to completely undermine that for people who have that us included any challenge we have and holding that with compassion and turning to gratitude for what is here. So thank you. Thanks for bringing that in, Bill. Any other reflections that spontaneously came up for you? I realize they've turned off the chat already, so if somebody wanted to type in chat, they could. Okay, I don't see any other hands. So, oh yes, one more hand, Jerry, please. So I spare me if I said this before, but I read an article this week and it really helped me think about rather than think about how much I have to do every day, I have to do this, I have to do that, it transformed it by saying I get to get up and help people each day. I get to go for a run. I get to see the snowfall as it did today in Toronto. So that's a framing of that way, helped me recognize gratitude in so many different ways. Enough for me. Nice. I get to. I get to. Wow, what an amazing, wise shift in perspective instead of I have to, I have to, I get to. What a great invitation. Yeah, like always to explore that. Yeah, let's bring that into the practice. Thank you, Jerry, for planting that seed, bringing that in. Thank you. Claire, this will be our last reflection before we get into it. So please, Claire. Sorry. I've been a little meeting problem here. Okay. All sorts of sound problems. But anyway, I've just been wanting to share since we've been on this topic for a while, that one thing I started doing about six or seven years ago now, I have two friends who are interested in the issue of gratitude also. So we circulate an email every day of three things from the day before that we're grateful for. And it goes among the three of us. And it allows us to stay in touch. Also, one gal is a Switzerland, for example. So I wouldn't pick up the phone and call her all the time. But I know exactly what she's doing and what the good things are that are happening for her. And it's been a wonderful, it really changed a lot of my ways. When I first started, I thought I was grateful, but I realized after day two, I couldn't think of anything. I really had to focus on the good things that were happening in my life. I didn't do that normally. I always saw what was wrong. That's what was right. So I just wanted to share that with others because it's been so helpful to me. Thank you, Claire. Thanks so much for bringing that in. And I also appreciate you really giving the nuance of how after a while it feels like I'm out of things. OK, and now I need to pay attention. So actually, mind really instead of saying, well, this is a stupid, boring practice. I'm done. It's like, oh, wow. And then your curiosity, actually, your interest, you stayed with it, which is like any other practice after we scratch the surface, then it gets juicy. It gets really juicy. And that's what I'm hearing you say and how transformative it is to actually turn to the good. Lovely. So you know what? Let's let's actually bring that into that seat into our small group practice later today when we get into groups. Maybe there would be groups of three or two or whatever forming from this and this to share the gratitude. That would be fun. Thanks, Claire. And I've done that before, by the way, with someone. It's it's it's it's it's such a great practice. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. So thank you for that. Well, I think we are warmed up now for practicing appreciation. And maybe I won't say more about it. It's I think the topic is very well framed. Maybe I'll just say one more thing. And that is one thing that can also happen with this practice, which is entering into another dimension of gratitude and also generosity. And as we talked on Wednesday, generosity and gratitude really are a pair. They go together. And and these two generosity and gratitude. What if we entered into a dimension of holding whatever gifts we have given, we have been given. Whatever challenges we have been given. Oh, what is she talking about? Whatever gifts, whatever challenges we've been given. And we hold them with a stance with an open, spacious stance of generosity. Generosity is an open hand that doesn't hold tightly. It's all with an open hand that receives and releases, receives and releases. Gifts are received. The released challenges are received. They're released. This hand open hand of generosity with the sense of gratitude. Can we be grateful also or appreciate maybe the word appreciation is more appropriate. Can we be? Can we appreciate also what is challenging? What pushes us? What what stretches us? What stretches us? And we hold it with appreciation with an open hand and receives and releases. Doesn't hold on. So with those reflections, seeds from the Sangha and reflections shared, let's begin. Let's begin our formal practice. So let's land. Let's land in our bodies. Let's land in our seat. As always arriving, arriving. Arriving in this body. Let this breath. Inviting, inviting all the muscles to soften, to relax, to let go. Our hands, arms, shoulders, neck, our jaw, our face, our forehead, the chest, the back, upper back, lower back. The abdomen from the inside releasing, releasing into our sit bones, our bottom, releasing into the chair, to the cushion. Our legs, upper legs and lower legs. And releasing, the whole body releasing. And receiving, the lower abdomen receiving the breath, joyfully, appreciatively. We get to do this, we get to sit. What the gift we get, I get. I get to sit in this moment of practice here with the support. I get to take this moment to rest, receive. Thank you. Thank you. Receiving the in breath and the out breath. Thank you. And if thoughts arise, as they will inevitably do, letting them be received with an open breath, as if with a smile, thank you thoughts, thank you. Please come back later. No need for any ruffles. Thoughts will come, they will go, let them be received and released. It's part of this training. It's part of this cultivation of the heart and mind. Thoughts are not a problem, they give you an opportunity to practice, to practice generosity, release appreciation. Thank you for coming thought. Please come later. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I get to do this. I get to practice. Don't miss this moment. I get to do this. What a gift. What a gift to be able to do this with Sangha, with support. What a gift to have met the Dharma. What a gift this moment is, even if there are challenges in this moment in the body and the heart and the mind. Can we open up to this moment, to this moment, mystery of this moment being a gift? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome to stay with receiving the breath in the body, opening up with appreciation to whatever is being presented in this moment. With a stance of open hand generosity in receiving, receiving spaciously and then releasing spaciously. A sense of appreciation in coming and going, appreciating and non-attached appreciation, not a clingy appreciation, an open-hearted appreciation. Thank you. And if you wish, you're welcome to open up, to perhaps reflect bringing on a couple of things that perhaps you've had an attitude of, oh, I have to do this. What if you turn and shift that into, I get to do this, I got to do this. With this open-hearted stance of non-contracted appreciation, I get to do this. Wow. I got to do this. Thank you. Inviting your heart, your mind to open up, to be low scratching the surface. When you shift this perspective, I get to do this. Things you never imagined will open up if you stay with it, if you continue to stay with this stance, with this attitude. I get to serve in this way. I get to serve myself or others in this way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any difficult, challenging aspects of your life that open you up to grace, to beauty, to service in the ways that if they weren't there, it wouldn't be possible? I get to do this because of this. I get to do this. I get to grow. I get to be more. I get to be wiser, more compassionate. I get to do this. See if that's available. If not, don't push it. Don't push it. It's an attitude of inspiration, not expectation. Hold it all lightly. I get to do this. Hold it lightly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I get to do this. I get to do this. Instead of I have to do this, I should do this. I must do this. I have so much heaviness, obligation. I get to do this as uplift, aspiration, inspiration. Instead of the heavy weight of expectation. I get to do this. Breathing in, breathing out. The goodness, the goodness of this gift, whatever it might be. Thank you. Even if it's a gift of darkness, I get to explore it. I get to explore this gift of darkness, which I know and trust. It opens up, opens up. This gift of dukkha, suffering, it opens up to compassion, to wisdom. I get to do this. It's completely shifting and turning, changing the frame. Exploring, expressing my full humanity. I get to do this. May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, appreciate all the gifts, all the gifts of grace, however they come. May all beings everywhere wake up and be free. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. So we have some time for reflections, for questions, comments. What did you discover? The invitation is in sharing your insights, your discoveries, as a gift for the benefit of other practitioners. Friend, please. I just want to thank Jerry for bringing that up, turning the have to into get to. It's so applicable to almost everything in my life, everything that I usually use the construction, I must, I have to. I have to do some parathetical, damn it, I now will. And it's, there's so little that's really onerous. And so much that's, that's a, that's an opportunity if not a pleasure. I was just, I was thinking of many years ago right around the season, I had had some surgery and, and I couldn't walk for, you know, for a little while and then when I could walk. It was every step was I get to walk, I get to walk down to the store I get to walk around the block on my crutches. And because it made such a deep impression I've kept some of that so some days you know two decades later I'll still walk down the street and think, I get to walk off the light. So, thank you. Thank you, Fred. Well said. Lovely. And yes with appreciation to Jerry for bringing his practice in so that we could all benefit from it and spend this time really sitting with it. Lovely. Any other reflections, insights that came up for you. Like to share. Greg I'm not sure if you're trying to raise your hand that's the, the clap, but if you're trying to raise your hand you're welcome to unmute yourself. And if not, yeah I guess I hit the wrong little icon. I was really taken by when you said I get to experience, Dooka paradoxical nature of that assessment that this is an opportunity to grow to learn how to cope to learn how to flow to learn how to turn loose of it is see the unsubstantiality of it, etc etc etc but it's so counterintuitive and it's against the traditional conditioning constraints and challenges I have and remolding my mind to think that way so it's great stuff and I love paradox and I love uncertainty and I love the mist and this is a great opportunity to influence all of those things or to experience all of those things. So thank you for that. Yeah, thank you for, for bringing that in and how that impacted you this shift in perspective, really and this shift is, you know, awakening freedom, Nibana, whatever you call it, it's really is about a shift in perspective. And we see and relate to things differently. And it's just this so many ways that is what awakening is. So, so thank you and then it can happen in so many ways it's not necessarily just waiting for that final moment but it can happen so many ways and it can happen shift and practice little chef shifts in perspective little by little by little by little. And tonight, you know, when many of you know that I have chronic illness and, and, you know, many symptoms and one thing that came up was, oh, I get to be sick, I get to experience pain I, I get to do this. I get to do this because that's when really I slow down, I really slow down, and my mind meets whatever challenge and difficulty pain, fatigue slowing down just I get to be sick, I get to do this, the sense of delight because I would probably not be sharing a Dharma or a Dharma teacher if it wasn't for the gift of this illness, I would continue to be a computer scientist, so. So I get to be sick, I get to do this, yay. So, with that, Marianne says I also appreciate this tonight very much I thought I get to be a mother, and the difficult times open my heart more than it ever would have done. Yeah, nice. Thank you, Mary. Yeah. And another reflection comes in. Thanks the gift of Dukkha which seems inescapable is a challenge for me. Yes, it can be and slowly slowly the shift of perspective can happen little little little in in small ways in small ways. So, not to expect that all the time. Jerry says I recently have had a cancer scare and missed this bullet gratefully, and this has helped me help others. Wow, thank you Jerry thanks for sharing that. Yeah, that took deepening us, whether we miss it or not. It really deepens us to serve and support others. Yeah. So, let's say 649 yes this is the time to turn into small group practice so, so I have an invitation before you jump off tonight those of you might want to jump off please don't just hear this first. The invitation for tonight is to take to take a page out of the book that was. He was. Claire was bringing it up at beginning so so the invitation is, you know you can share as little or as much about your practice we wish. And then if you're up for doing this gratitude practice with another person or the two people for a week, just commit to it to walk for one week, not for the rest of your life, you commit to for one week to do it with people you might find yourself in the group, just maybe one other person or two other people, whoever is up for it. And you can can be in text it can be an email whatever you're comfortable with commit to do it and for what and it could be at the end of the day or the next day see what works for you figure it out the two or three of you, or maybe four I don't know what you'll see. And just commit for one week what a great practice for one week you get to hear other people's what they're grateful for and then at the end of the week whoever wants to renew the commitment. You would for another week and if not, then you'll drop it so so with that, I'm going to create the breakout rooms and let's see here is we have the rooms Yes, and I'm about to open them. Here we go. Take care of yourselves take care of each other. Here we go. Okay, the rooms are all closed, everyone is back. Oh, we have just about a minute for any reflections you like to share. You can raise your hand or type them as you wish. I want to share reflection from David on YouTube, who said that with thanks Jaron says I learned to do that years ago and day, all at once I lost a job in a beautiful apartment becoming jobless and homeless at once, ever since I say I get to do housework, etc. So thank you for sharing that way to change a turn as you say, falling into flight. So, any other last reflections, especially from your time with, especially if you haven't spoken already. Stephen I see your hand raised, either clapping or you're trying to raise your hand. I'm trying to raise my hand. Very grateful and I'm happy I get to rebuild. It seems like, you know, not too many people get get the opportunity to start the concept I guess you can see have like a rebirth of the mind and just be able to just just learn from a very, very respectful perspective, and I'm very grateful to have this mindfulness and very grateful to have the Sangha and to just be part of a community that that develops a very, very beautiful minded person and unique to each individual so I'm thankful for that. Thank you, Stephen. Thank you so much for your words of gratitude for this practice for the Sangha for all the cultivation and opportunities. Beautiful and that's a lovely note to end our week of appreciation and gratitude on perfect note. So thank you all. Thank you for your practice. Thank you for your cultivation. Thank you for showing up for each other yourselves and the world, all those whose lives you touch me all beings be well may all beings be free. Thank you.
