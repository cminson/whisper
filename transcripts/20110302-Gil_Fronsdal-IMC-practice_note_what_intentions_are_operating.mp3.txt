Operating?

One of the axioms of Buddhist psychology is that for 
most people most of the time , the mind – our thoughts, 
the attention  and inclination of the mind, and wh at the 
mind  is doing  – is based on intention , on wanting 
something. Sometimes it’s wanting , and sometimes it’s 
not wanting it, pushing it away or trying to ignore it. But 
there’s almost always an intention, something that the 
mind is trying to do , or wanting.  
 
One of the interesting things to do in mindfulness 
practice is to start becoming sensitive to and aware of 
what is it your mind wants all the time. If you’re doing 
walking meditation , for example, what you want to do is 
to be present for your feet as you walk. Do you really 
want to do the practice of walking meditation , or does 
your mind have other ideas?  
 
If there’s a sound around you, what intentions or desires 
get triggered or activated by the sound around you? 
And then what does the mind want or not want, and how involved are you in the wanting and not wanting  of the 
mind?  
 
I don’t want to suggest that wanting something or not 
wanting something is wrong. There are  plenty of things 
that are appropriate to want and not want. But it’s very 
important to be able to see how the mind operates on 
the intentions that it has. When  we can really clearly see 
it, we have more choice about what we follow. Do we 
fall into the old gro oves and  channels of particular 
desires and intentions? Or do we not go down those 
chutes and say, “Well, not now. I’ll do something else. 
I’ll go down the mind fulness -of-my-walking -as-I-walk 
chute. ”  
 
It might be interesting today for you in the next period to 
focus a little bit on what is it that the mind wants  and 
doesn’t wan t. What’s going on there? What are  the 
intentions that are operating – becaus e something is 
always operating?   
 
I hope you enjoy your morning. Thank you.
