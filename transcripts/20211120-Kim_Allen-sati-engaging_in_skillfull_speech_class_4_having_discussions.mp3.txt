 Okay, so good morning. Why don't we go ahead and get started. We'd like to begin, as we often do, with an opportunity for you to ask any questions, or maybe say anything about how your practice with why speech has been going. We've offered a few suggestions along the way of things to try out. Did you do that and what have you seen. So please feel very welcome. In general, I feel I do a pretty good job with mindful speech, but I blew it last night. I was at an interfaith gathering. And at one point, a person said to me, well, everybody believes the same thing. And I said no, they don't. And after the words were out of my mouth I thought, Oh, that was terribly unskillful. How did it land, did you notice any of the, well, she kind of stiffened a bit and didn't say much for a while so I think I kind of shut her down which really was not what I would prefer to have done. I just, and, you know, the first thing she said after that before she kind of shut down was, well, everybody believes in God and I said, not everybody here does believe in God, I don't. But, yeah, yeah. So I thought, you know, if I were to do that again, maybe saying something like, well, I think there are different beliefs here and let it go at that something that would be more mild and not because there was a kind of a critical tone I think. Certainly counter counteracts what she had said your statement was true. But perhaps at that moment, you know, not as timely, or maybe it wasn't adding to the I don't know what the context of the conversation was. So, it might have been possible to convey that same idea, because after all the statement that everyone believes the same thing is a little bit of a down statement also. So, but coming from a place where what you were intending to do was open things or broaden things or soften a statement like that. There may have been a way to bring in that kind of tone to what you were saying such that it could have been conveyed differently but on the other hand, we don't, we don't know if we're launching our words out. So we come back to, you know, where was it coming from. And then of course also how did it land and can there be some change in the flow from there. But staying connected to your own heart often serves I don't know if one of my other teachers has a comment but thank you for sharing that because I would guess every single one of us is there. You know, I appreciate your sharing to Charles and because this is a practice, you know community and an opportunity. I, I would reflect to on the way you presented this you said, I blew it. You know, and I think, I think, one of the challenges of practice is to take everything that comes up as an opportunity for, you know, an opportunity to, to cultivate our wisdom. And we're, we're very judgmental about our unskillful speech. And we tend to focus a lot of energy on, you know, when I blew it right and we all, we all blow it. Or we, I think many of us have that kind of that kind of response arises. But I think part of what we learned from engaging with the texts as we're doing in this class is just that in the text skillful speech and unskillful speech. They each of them provide a way to see into our practice a window on our practice. And the more that we can sort of encounter unskillful speech as it arises in us, you know, as it's what meets the world of interaction with other people without a lot of judgment around it and just going, Oh, oh, here's, here's this, you know, this response arising it comes from a place of maybe there's a sense of defensiveness or a sense of selfing that's happening or a sense of, I don't know what you know can be a whole bunch of different things but, you know, settling into it as a practice opportunity, which, you know, what you're doing is the point of the speech it's not always to get it right or never blow it. But to be attentive to what's happening when when we interact with the world through speech. I hope that adds something. And I throw in my two cents here. Having myself been in some other situations. And I'm not sure, or I don't know maybe even just stop there. So to kind of acknowledge what she's saying, but not necessarily agreeing, and to say, also, it's easy to believe that yeah, it's, it makes sense that a lot of people think that we all believe that we're not necessarily agreeing or something like this, I don't know, but maybe my responses aren't even the best responses, but just instead of countering what she said to support what she said but in such a way that is not necessarily agreeing with exactly what she said. So, that's my, maybe it's not a great attempt but an attempt to provide an alternative way forward. And I think that's what she was actually wrote. Yeah, yeah, to say something like that. Or if, if in fact, there's some sense of being some sense of the defensive and that's that comes up I love the response. Ouch. You know, if there's an ouch that happens to kind of go, go to what I know about what's happening here. Oh, like somebody said Kim suggested maybe there is a sense of being shut down like oh that excludes me. And sometimes just something like, ouch, whether it's to myself or spoken out loud and I have a choice there. You know that can be just useful to acknowledge, oh there's something going on here that where that is, you know where there's some pushing against that or some sense of, you know, just that's very honest, as well as true. Sometimes. Dan says she has a question, if it could be relatively short, that would be good and then we'll have to move on, but there will be more questions later. Okay, and I can wait till later if you prefer, that'd be fine. But I guess back to what Charles said, I had the opposite experience, my neighbor was like bragging on how his son had wished he had been at the Capitol on the insurrection, and I was just so appalled that all I could do is turn and walk away. And one of the reasons I'm taking this class is I'm not sure if that was the right action. So, and if you want to address that later, I'm totally fine with that. Well, it's, you know, it's, this is, this is coming back maybe to the overarching idea that we had from the suit M and 61 where we consider before and during and after actions whether a body speech or mind. If there may be harm to ourselves or to others, and knowing in your case, it may have called for a consider a check in at that moment. You know the turning away was a response I believe to pain that you felt internally. David said the ouch, and he pointed out he has a choice about saying that or not. And it feels to me like you maybe didn't have a choice in that moment. And so, just being gentle and being aware that mindfulness is a support for helping us to decide if turning away was the right thing or not, but to not worry so much about the details of that moment, but to cultivate strength of mindfulness through daily life practice through sitting on the cushion and then trust that as mindfulness gets stronger, there will be more and more of those occasions where we can ask that question before we act or speak. Does that help a little bit. Yeah. So, I really enjoying this exploration with this few questions, please naturally to whether or not about to share what I'm about to share is kind of a set of teachings that may be kind of four of us and attributed as a lesser known wife's speech teachings of family Suta. And I think they're lesser known maybe because they're not like this particular Suta that I will, I will be sharing from is on good to run the kayak three dot 67. And I'll share a few different aspects of the teachings from this particular Suta. And they don't completely map in a particular kind of a scheme in my own mind. So I'm going to try a little bit of a hand gesture to illustrate what this teachings are pointing towards in terms of why is this skillful communication and speech. And they all had to do with cultivating a sense of a discernment of when and how a discussion or a communication is a wholesome skillful situation and when it's not. And this cultivation of a discernment is quite important. I think both Charles question and Diane's question are pointing to this particular aspects can we cultivate growing sensitivity and wisdom for us to have a clarity in what the situation is, and from there, we respond to what need to to have will out of that. And so the first teaching, and that comes from this particular Suta is about discerning situation in terms of whether the people engage in the conversation in a full fully engaged way. And so, and I'm going to use this my two hands like a two sides of the communication person who asked the question of person answer the question or person who brings up the topic, the other person engaged within this. Now there is this way of communicating and not meeting each other. And then there is this way. They're meeting each other. And actually the two hands coming together, they're unifying their connecting, they're kind of exploring the topic together in some way, or the person is asking the question in very specific way the other person would answer it in a very specific way. And so they're not missing each other. Someone asked the question, they dodged the question, they kind of pick up a different topic to talk about. So then, not really meeting each other, and this is the situation we all know. If this is the way of communicating. This is probably not a very wholesome situation right now, but to do this. The sutra use the words, like, if a question needs to be answered in specific way, whether it's being answered in a definitive way, or being offered with a lot of detailed analysis, or being counter asked, you know, kind of for clarification, understanding. And if you said, you know, everyone believes the God. Well, I'm very curious, you know, what makes you, you know, talk about this and the same thing this way. And so there is that engagement there. And we all know, there are situations that come along when we know that maybe we didn't want to engage because either we're distracted or preoccupied with other things in our mind, or we feel embarrassed or we kind of just didn't want to engage in some way, and there are certain things. And I want to hide my secret ingredients of my recipes. I'm the only one who's getting all the praises of the Thanksgiving dinner party. And so there is this kind of things that can go on inside of ourselves. So there's a first teaching is asking us to check in. What's going on inside of us. Are we engaging in a way that is really meeting with each other. And in Chinese, there is a fun phrase that refers to this kind of teaching is like a matching horse mouth on the cow's head. And you know what they don't match. They don't look like anybody. And so, so we often say, Oh, you know, new new code between it's like, you know, the, the cows head doesn't match with the mouth of the horse. And so, as I explore kind of discern if this is the situation the dynamics that's happening. And the second teaching that's offered in this suit has to do with, I'm going to use this form of a hand gesture. Like how we hold the container of our conversation. So for example, if we are getting together in a breakout room, and there is a kind of assumption that's made that when we're getting into the group, we offer respect to each other and there is some assumptions made, keeping confidentiality, and in our particular order that we speak so it's not like I, you know, I want to talk and then I'm just going to jump in. And so, this way of holding the space of how we're speaking is not for us to discern if the situation that we're engaged in is a wholesome and skillful one or not. You know, and so the sutra used a keyword like, depending on different translations, like a standing firm or standing by the positions of being consistent consistent about once positions standing firm by agreed upon assumptions and kind of a group agreement or a stand firm to what one knows is true and stand firm by the processes or procedures and that the group agrees upon. And so there's a sense of a stand firm for me as a sense of integrity, dignity, and have some clarity in this in engaging a conversation. And I want to differentiate this from kind of a dogmatic holding. And so, the dogmatic holding of a once position would be kind of like, you know, I'm right and you're wrong, and I'm not going to change my position. And so there is that sense of maybe rigidity, not flexible, and the conversation they feel like it's stuck, you know, kind of like not going and not moving not flowing in some way. And so, this is the kind of holding that will not be useful when we're engaging in conversation if you find someone really strong holding in a particular point and not willing to engage in any other way. And then you're going to say, Oh, let's see if this is a situation that actually going to be beneficial or not, maybe if it's not, you know, we have a choice to maybe find other options, either disengage or find some other topics that we can find some form of unity in engaging in the in conversation. And the last two teachings that the Sutra talked about is how to discern the situation is a beneficial supportive one or not is by observing if there is this kind of a movement. For example, if someone is asking the question, and the person would get very defensive, we talked about this, like, you know, either they show anger aversion, intimidation, and they have bitterness with this, and the Sutra used a quite strong language for a set of fits it's like someone asked a question, the person who answers the question would put down the question or precious the person ridiculous the person and grasp, grasp at their little mistakes. And this is kind of like, you know, real aggressive thing that's going on. It's not, you know, we can see this is not really kind of meeting each other for sure. And, and so, and began to tune in for that kind of dynamic whether it's within us, or in the space where the communication is happening. And when we can begin to feel and sense this is going on. It gives us some clue in terms of the overall dynamic of the communication. So these are, you know, kind of, you know, this and meeting with each other, or whether we're holding the space in some way or whatever kind of, you know, really bumping our heads against each other. So there are some ways to discern help us to discern the situation and then offering that in that from that discernment, we can offer space for us to have skillful choices in those situations. So I want to end this piece by reading on the verses at the end of this suta that speaks about summarizing this teaching. So, the verses goes to something like this. Those who converse with hostility, too sure of themselves arrogant, ignoble attacking virtuous, they look for flaws in each other. They rejoice together when their opponents speaks poorly and make some mistake, becoming confused and defeated. But the noble ones don't discuss like this. If an astute person wants to hold a discussion connected with the teachings and its meaning, the kind of discussion that the noble ones hold. Then that wise one should start the discussion, knowing when the time is right, neither hostile nor arrogant, not over excited, contemptuous, contemptuous, or aggressive, or with a mindful of jealousy. They speak from what they rightly know, they agree with what was well spoken without criticizing what was poorly said. They did not persist in finding faults, nor seizing, nor seize on trivial mistakes, neither intimidating nor crushing the other. So, they speak with the slang implications. Good people consult for the sake of knowledge and the clarity. That's how the noble ones consult. This is a noble consultation, knowing this, an intelligent person would consult without arrogance. Thank you, Ying. Wow, you know, speech. This is not easy. It is not easy. I think this is a lifetime practice. I sometimes I'm still like, Oh, ouch, whoops, I didn't, I didn't do that so well. So I'll just share for me this is still an ongoing practice. I can get the truth part down and maybe the timing part down but maybe it's not coming from a place of openness. Maybe I feel a little bit defensive. Sometimes people are, you know, say things and I feel like, Oh, I have to, I don't know, stand up for what I believe it or something like I don't know so I appreciate very much. There's lots of things in this group does in addition to these lists that we've been talking about. And just as Ying was sharing this kind of these ways to hold discussions, but I think that this is a lifetime of practice. And what better way than to actually practice to do this. Right. So this happens in real life, but we're going to put you into a breakout group. We have a lot of instructions, make it maybe a little bit less contrived than some breakout rooms, but we want to provide a discussion topic, and which there might be some different opinions before even tell what the topic is I'll tell you that amongst the four of us, we have differing opinions. So, we don't want to say like, figure out the right answer that's exactly where we're not going. We're just saying something about okay here's a topic where the topic is. Okay, here's a topic where there's more than one way to show up or to have a point of view or something. And of course we don't know what your opinions are so you may end up with a group where you all think the same or everybody has a different idea or something like this. But here's what we want to point you that we titled this class, open mind, open heart, open mouth. And I'll just say for me, this has been the most helpful in my own practice with speech is can I as best as I can and I can't always do this, have an open heartedness. So, and I found the pen with this open heartedness, then verbal daggers, which maybe the other person doesn't think is a verbal dagger but I'm experiencing everybody believes in God and I'm kind of like, oh, you know, like, if there's a sense of openness and maybe this dagger just just goes on through right there space there, it doesn't get stuck doesn't hit anything fun way to think about it. So again before I tell you exactly the topic. Open heart, open mind, and just notice. I use somebody that's like just step back like no thank you I'm not going to introduce that like, oh yeah, I have to get in there and, you know, let people know my point of view of this and I know a lot about this or feel something so it's just an opportunity to just observe ourselves, how we are, when we're in conversations. I'll say this again, there's no right answer, and this is a lifetime of practice. This is not something that we're just gonna, you know, like okay got that thing down. Now I understand so. And maybe also is there a way that we can learn from each other. And as you know was pointed to other ways maybe we might miss one another. And maybe this is Diana's little point. Sometimes I purposely will miss somebody if I feel like they want to take us down a direction that doesn't feel healthy or wholesome or person want to go, then I'll kind of like redirect, and there's a maybe introduce a non sequitur or something like this. So, so, pause, listen, open heart, open mind, as best you can, as best you can. Okay, here's the topic. Thanksgiving's coming up. Tofurky or turkey. Should it be vegetarian or meat. Right, the Buddhists have a range of views on this. I'll just say, I don't know if it's helpful. But earliest suit does are not clear different translators are some words in there that nobody really knows how to translate what the Buddhist last meal was. And so you can find different, you could find support for any of these views in the earliest suit does I'll just sit down there. We'll just do this in popcorn style just will put you in this group and just talk about vegetarianism meeting eat tofurky or turkey. And maybe the last thing that I'll say before we send you into the script to have this conversation is, take time to touch in with yourself. I sometimes feel my feet on the ground is a great way to kind of like stop the momentum of conversations or if I find myself being defensive. Take a breath, pause, breathe, check in. And maybe have a little fun. Maybe have a little fun here too. But occasionally I'll put in the broadcast thing like this three minded pause, breathe, you know this kind of stuff, just as helpful you won't have that at Thanksgiving but maybe you will I don't know but. Okay, so if we're ready, we'll go ahead and go into that breakout rooms. Thank you. There they all come. Welcome back. Welcome back. So, we're changing our usual order of things, and we're going to do a short guided meditation now. So please settle in. And just find a comfortable spot. Somewhere where you can sit still, let us be 10 minutes or so. Maybe taking a long slow deep breath. And then on the exhale, softening the body. Letting the shoulders drop. Softening the eyes and the eye sockets. Feeling down into the belly area. Is there any tightness that you could just invite softening. Just broadening the attention to the whole body. Just sensing the overall picture of the energy in the body. Maybe they're feelings of heat or coolness. Maybe there's a sense of emotion. Maybe just some energy flowing or maybe there's like ping pong balls bouncing around the system. Just imagining that by being softly present with the body. That that energy could just slowly settle a bit. And then bringing attention specifically into the area of the head. Behind the eyes. And the head, just sensing if there's any tension or emotion. And then under your fellow says, let your brain relax. Maybe feeling down now into the contact with the seat. The legs or the feet against the floor. Sensing the groundedness, those spots. And inviting anything in the energy to move down. Just settle out. So sensing now the presence of the mindfulness. It was already there to examine the energy, but now really sensing there's mindfulness in the mind. This is the feeling of Sati. Noticing if there are any emotions present in your mind at this time. And then there might be something very noticeable or there might not really be anything so prominent and that's fine. And then an invitation to broaden the awareness even farther from the sense of the body or any emotions. Maybe if your awareness could be as large as the room that you're sitting in. Does that make sense that the mind could broaden. Like the way when we're zeroed in on detail like someone's eyes, then we can broaden out and see their whole face also. So we have our body and our immediate emotions and thoughts and then we just broaden out. Just holding this moment. And in this broad space it's fine now to bring in a gentle reflection of your experience in the breakout room. And at the present moment, just bringing in that memory some impressions from that time. And then talking about being hand gestures. Was there the gentle meeting like the palms in Anjali? Was there a folding of the topic like the way her hands were together raising up? Was there a sense of missing or a sense of tightening? Was the flavor of that the flow of that breakout room session for you? It's all fine. We're just holding that awareness. So this is a way to be mindful of how a discussion was bringing in these different elements and letting them be held. And softening in light of all of that. Communication has so many different elements. Maybe we sense that the way to manage them all is simply to hold with the open heart, open mind. Connection to the body. And if it feels relevant for you, this is entirely optional, you may wish to set an intention around speech. You could make it specific like in an upcoming conversation or at Thanksgiving or just in general an area that feels rich and juicy for you. Or you may just wish to keep resting for another moment. Thank you. Thank you, Kim. Okay. So now I'd like to hear from you. How was the breakout group? How was the guided meditation? You have some questions about Ying's teachings. And we'll send you a copy of the suta that Ying was referring to. Anything you'd like to share? Any learnings? Any aha moments? Any new ideas? Yes, David. David Weisskopf. Okay. So I have a little bit nervous. Okay. So I feel like, okay, you have your, here we go. I'm nervous about what I want to say anyway. But I felt like my group came together like this in a way that excluded certain views. So I left the group feeling very aroused. And when Kim's inviting me to release tension and stuff, I was like just, really trying to release tension. I was just sitting there with it all, you know, with all the burning. And then beneath that, I guess I felt a lot of grief and dukka hurt, you know, pain. And I feel like, well, can I take a minute just tell you a brief story about an experience at IMC without naming names? Do you think it would be helpful at this moment or is it just, or will it like move, making a point that you haven't made already or? I guess I'll just summarize it what I think happens. I think sometimes we unwittingly find ourselves moving into a position. And what maybe we build a sense of community around it. Maybe it expresses a need to belong, a little bit of dependency, even a need to please. But it excludes other factors. Yeah. And really, and really others. And so, yeah, that's all I'll say to make a brief. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, David. That's what humans do, right? They come together and just as you said, they want to belong. But it might also, and I'm offering this, I don't want to be defend all of IMC or certainly all human communities. But it might also be that with a sense of belonging that some people feel or a sense of cohesion, allow some safety. And that presence of safety, then allows people to have some ability to maybe open up with some differing views. So we might be creating the conditions in which later there can be some something different happen. So I appreciate this very much myself having experience that being in groups like, okay, I'm not sure that went the best it could have. But I didn't really recognize that until later I have a new idea. Later, like, oh, I see how that impacted me. Now I learned something important. I just this recognition that I'm not telling you anything you don't know, David, I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know that what happens in a conversation doesn't only stay in that conversation, right? It has all these ripple effects. And sometimes the ripple effects can be positive, even though we don't see them. So I'm just maybe being a little bit of a Pollyanna here, saying that there can be some benefits of this. And I don't do some would like my co teachers like to contribute to you. Maybe I'll share one experience that I have that kind of was a teaching moment for me was early on when I was in a Pure Land Buddhism Sangha. I went there, I could not quite gel with the teachings in terms of somehow you have to keep bowing chanting to somehow go to, you know, a Pure Land. You'll be okay. And I really I can't gel with that ideology or the way and the teaching. But what I found, though, was there was a such a warmth in the community and kindness in the community that are expressed in many different ways that I found really resonating and supportive of me. And so, I realized that there's a lot of value here in this is something, even though there are there are specific teachings that I may not agree to, and even feel maybe contrary to what my understandings are. And in our, in our community, there can be this way where there are certain beliefs or certain views, and that we may not connect. But are there other ways that we human being are connecting that allow us to begin to understand each other and support each other and hold each other. And so, I'm saying this in the way that kind of kind of maybe inviting us to also even in the midst of disagreement. And that we do connect, maybe having good meals together, maybe having a walk together. And so there are other ways that we may be able to connect. Thank you. Was there something more you'd like to say, David. So I mean I, you know, I, again, I had, I hate to say this, but I feel like we overvalue this need to connect. You know, I mean, this need to connect and maintain this congeniality is also leading to avoiding the fact that we can't maintain our styles of life and have this planet survive. And nobody wants to sit there and say, Oh, there's this huge disconnect as we get together. And, you know, celebrate our friendship in our lives, and our meals together and our vacations together and our this together and our that together. There's a huge disconnect with that. And our principles are non-harming. And even our having a future. And our kids have in a future. And our grandkids have in a future but oh I care so much about my kids and my grandkids and others. There's this huge disconnect that it's not being addressed. What's being addressed is this need for connection for mutual respect. For communion. And so I find that I just takes me right back I find myself aroused I find myself grieving I find myself hurt. And there you go. Yeah, sorry that's. Yeah. And I'm sure David you can also recognize that what you're saying of course right the way that you reuse the planet's resources and in the in the spirit of let's connect, but there's also some people who feel for whatever reason, feel so completely isolated and they can't even like think about the planet because they're they're in pain or something right so yeah David you're pointing to something really like there is no easy answer here right in terms of how can people feel like they have enough, so that they're not exploiting resources. And one way to feel that is to connect but you're pointing out that's not the only way and maybe just the way that we're doing that is going the direction we don't want to go. Yeah, yeah. I wish I knew the answers to these things. Thank you, David. And I'm going to suggest that we hold the two questions that have come up for a final Q amp a session at the end, Heidi, Jerry, and that we dip back into sort of an overview of the teachings. I think this is a place we don't typically do this in the classes were a little bit of a synthesis at the end may be useful in holding, you know, a diverse and dispersed set of teachings. This follows so well I think on David's question and points, just that these aren't teachings that provide us simple answers to various human dilemma that we that we experience, and that we share. I think if there's any big takeaway. One big takeaway from this investigation or exploration of why speech it's that all of our practice is available in our speech practice. All of it, the duka, the freedom that's available, the community in which we practice the communities within which we live, all of its, all of its here in the speech. The teachings about speech and engaging with unskillful and skillful speech that come to us in the discourses suggest, as we've I think tried to show a very highly nuanced very subtle approach to bringing our practice into this realm of of speaking of interaction of communication and community. And instead of commandments of various kinds, what what comes up again and again it is the importance of consistent, consistent devoted, pervasive, mindful attention to our body and mind and heart in the world. So, just to sort of point to some of the things we've talked about in the last three days, and earlier today, and sort of bringing them together a little bit, we began with this idea of the conditions of skillful speech, the conditions from which skillful speech arises, because we have some week we can influence the conditions. Right. We can observe the sorts of conditions that seem to be associated in our lives with unskillful speaking skillful speaking, we can do this, as we do with mindful attention anything without a lot of judging a lot of preference it helps us see clearly when we leave that to one side. And then we attend to those conditions. Among those conditions, although we didn't really look at it as a condition is listening. You know, the extent to which we become skillful listeners can be a condition for more skillful interaction with others through speech. We also talk about listening that engaging our own unskillful and skillful speech frequently encourages us or leads us to listening, listening more and listening better. And also when we talk about listening, we sort of talked about being mindful of the voices that we use in our own internal monologues and dialogues and maybe a committee meetings right that happen in the mind that we, that we notice the what's what's in those kind of expressions, even in very fundamental things, the voice with which we redirect our attention back to the breathing back to the here and now of our experience, when we've been momentarily distracted or caught up again in thought in emotional attendance in the sensations of the body. When we come back to the breath unhurried about judgment about hitting ourselves over the head that voice right that speech is important in our, in our practice. We drew this distinction between mode and content. Right. It was pointed out, I think by Diana, that. But certainly earlier in the class that we rarely are find ourselves able to convince other people of our view by talking at them, or talking past them or talking through them. I could put the hand gestures together right that you use, you know, those things aren't very useful in convincing people. But we do have a great deal of influence over both what we choose to talk about the content of our speech and how we speak about it, the mode of our speech. And I think we suggested that the mode is frequently more important than the content. So, choosing what we talk about with a recognition that certain topics lead us and snag us into unskillful practice and others seem to be more onward leading more supportive of practice. Absolutely the contents important, but the mode, the heart we bring to it the open heart, the open mind that we've kept sort of almost as a mantra, bringing into our teaching here. These things seem to be this mode of speech seems to be really significant and what we can cultivate in our in our speech. In addition to mode and content. We talked in the last class about context. And thanksgiving is a context of speech. Right, it opens up the possibility for different content, different modes of speech. It provides a wonderful opportunity for practice, but it's just a context, and it may be useful to think of it as, as that. And maybe we see the context as, you know, about different political views but maybe it's about connecting with people, warts and all right. It's family's family, people are people. We don't get perfect. At least this practice doesn't suggest that perfect is what we're, you know, should keep looking for some transcendent perfection in our, in our nearest and dearest. And perhaps, if we were different teachers, Yang, Diana, Kim and I would have called the class mode, content and context, you know, that sounds pretty good book title, you know, but we wanted to focus on speech and sort of, as we talked about it this fascinating place or like I'm gonna say place this fascinating coming together maybe of heart, mind and body, right, the heart and mind expressed through the body heart and mind in human relationships heart and mind in the world. Because this is where we practice, it's here that we practice. When we pay really careful attention and it came up in questions today David for example talking about the grief he feels. That's that's the heart and mind of the practice and that's a good location I think for generating skillful speech skillful conduct, instead of a kind of overlay like mode context con content, which is a little, maybe more analytical. So, in kind of bringing all this together the last thing I'd say was that I think we identify when we look at the texts as we've done in our study and practice mode bringing together this kind of engagement with the text and engagement with our practice, a mutually supportive mutually revelatory relationship between why speech and seen clearly why speech and insight, if you will, why speech and the wisdom that comes from seeing clearly. Deepening practice yields skillful speech skillful speech deepens practice. So sometimes, we can kind of see the two sides of this sometimes we notice that wiser more skillful speech arises as a, I suggested the other day as a beneficial side effect of deepening practice. We just become aware that oh yeah skillful speech is a little bit easier maybe comes comes a little easier sometimes not all the time. And sometimes we notice that like overt focus on our speech, paying attention to the conditions thinking about mode and content, noticing the context taking the context into account. Sometimes we notice that this is supportive of seeing clearly, and of deepening wisdom. So recognizing that there's this that there's this relationship between our attention to skillful speech, and maybe the bigger context of our practice, the seeing clearly of it reflects that speeches that provides us great opportunity, when we approach it as we see it treated in the text, right, and as we've considered it in the class that is, as an integral part of our practice rather than an add on or supplement or an ornament something that would be nice to cultivate when we get around to it, but really recognizing that in the speech practice we see all of our practice, and everything that's available in the practice we can engage with as we engage with our, our speech skillful and unskillful. Yang, should we open it back up to questions. Thank you, David for summarizing so much as we were saying, this speech is hard. It is hard for me. This is my English is my second language and so it's, you know, even language has a hardness to it for me to express what I really wanted to express. So maybe we'll open up and we had some hands racing, and we didn't get to you so Jerry, please. And Heidi had her hand up as well. Yes. Thank you. So much I want to say I don't know what it is though but my heart seems full. I came into this thinking made what I hope we're going to look at the intentions of why we speak, but we sort of got to that in a roundabout way. And then Thursday, I sort of come up with it. Maybe before you brought it up but speaking from the heart. And today, me the theme is listening from the heart. So, it makes me think, because I made very limited progress on speech, there's a resistance, there's a clinging to what doesn't work, because that's who I am and that's where my family raised me, and speeches competition and it's not communication and so I see it, which was a good sign, but I'm, I'm moved, probably because I can relate to what I think David was saying and at least if you listen from the heart. It's hard not to have the heart respond to his frustration is hurt his his annoyances anger. And, boy, I wish I was, you know, if I was brilliant enough to offer some wise counsel then I probably would be in the teacher's spot or even beyond that because those are pretty frustrating situations. So, one of the things that hasn't been stated but it's implied is how the filaments get into our speech pattern listening and talking. And at least I tried for myself towards myself and not very good is realizing some, instead of getting mad at myself is, can you get mad at a blind person for walking into walls. Can you get mad at a deaf person from not hearing you. I offer that. I can't do it, but I offer that today because it's a frustrating world we are capable of humans of destroying ourselves, why read. In this case hatred or fear, and then delusion, the delusion that won't happen, the delusion that it won't happen to me, the delusion that the rest of you are just fear mongers you know I mean it goes on and on. So the question that David brings up really is about the human condition that we are capable of self destruction. And what do we do about that. And somehow we need to figure out a way to find the commonality of our existence together we need to pull together. And with with the disparity. Thank you, Jerry. In the spirit of what you said and maybe I would just take a moment as a group together. Maybe just a moment. We know that the topic we brought into our breakout room was, there was no single answer, you know, we wish there was some have somehow. There's unifying thing and magically that all of us would agree and, and be happy ever after. And this isn't how human lives are and can we right here, knowing that even in this room with all the cultivation that we intended to do the wholesomeness that we intended to cultivate that we're holding lots of the different views, ideas, and lots of the different conditions that made us who we are right now, and how we might feel right now. Can we allow that to be in this room without judging, you know, so and so is wrong and so and so must be this way. No. This is how each of us are right now. We respect that. Each of us are valuable human beings in our own ways. So I appreciate Jerry for pointing that out, that we look into our own inner dynamics and make making this an opportunity for each of us to grow and mature in some way. So Heidi. Yeah, I want to say that this group needs to meet more often, we did it in the spring I think I joined, and I need it more often. I shared on Thursday that I'm in a very unskillfully I've shown up in a conversation and very simply for the last 20 years. And through this class, or today. I remember about all the opportunities that I've had to show up skillfully, but I've brought up, you know, the wrong question or whatever or didn't really listen. And the topic that we had. It reminded me of how not holding on to things too strongly and just kind of loosely is important. And a few years ago I've had really amazing opportunities to ask important questions to really important people, and I've never asked the right questions. And well, I think that. And then I just I just had this realization. I had the opportunity to sit with the close monks of the Dalai Lama, and I brought up. I was like, I'm really stressed, like I'm invited to potlucks, and I don't have enough money to bring food. What do I do, right. And, you know, people eat meat and stuff like that. He said, well, do you feel distressed by this. And I was like, yes, they said well show up and eat and bring what you can. And I thought that's reminded me of that again, that the pick not Han monks, just recently about the climate change. They said people talk talk talk. They fill their suitcases, they rushed to the other place, they buy a latte. They talk talk talk. They fill their suitcases with more paperwork, and they go to the other place, and then they go back home. But that was. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that you can go to the potluck with that food, but with plenty of joy. And that really counts. Yeah. So I know from my culture growing up. Food is very meaningful and healing. And oftentimes the one there are conflicts. We don't talk about them we eat together. So when you have a good meal together, there's a lot of softening in your heart and your body. So, this was sick of was sick. He was a facility. Sorry. I probably won't be able to pronounce your name right. Yeah. You're like me. Yeah. I was listening and speech, which is the best person for that because he speaks a lot, not stopping. So, the conversation was two hours. She was talking only about here. And I was very focused there to listen and answer. To be honest, I didn't feel the need to say anything about me. It was all right that she never asked about me. I was trying to take breathe and all this stuff that we had have said. But the thing is, because she was talking a lot without even breathe. I felt that I have to keep a notebook. Because I was forgetting three minutes ago what she said. Should I keep the note was really focused to remember. Well, it went very good. Very good. But I didn't know like, what should they interrupt, like, say now what they have to say, or way, because it's not going to stop. It didn't interrupt here at all. I can hardly remember what's been said in two minutes. But sometimes people just, I don't know the situation you're in. But sometimes people just need to be heard. It doesn't even doesn't matter what they are saying. Some people there are certain energy that needs to flow out of them. And they just need a witness and loving presence around to be heard. And I offer support group meetings for people to show up. So much of it was just there, offering presence and listen, because people are sharing things that no other people would be listening there. And there's no place to say what they have to say. And even there is nothing in response. They are hurt. Even if we don't remember anything that's being said, they are hurt. And that's what needs to happen. And I don't know if this is the situation you're in. And it could be that, you know, maybe taking those and part of this is to tune in to ourselves internally and externally, and over time may be able to discern, but it just needs to be heard. Or if there is a point where you might want to kind of asking if there is a need to stop or not. So we don't always know, but this is a growing cultivation. I think it's great that you made it a practice opportunity to really tune in to observe. Yeah, I wish there is a black and white answer here, probably not. Yeah, I think it was nice practice two hours. Thank you for sharing that. So we're coming to a close. Coming to the top of the hour. We have a couple of things we'd like to just do as we close by way of closing. One is to let you know that we'll be sending links out to students today and and other, any other materials. We sometimes are asked by people what how to support the class if people would want to practice Donna, and you can find your way to the city center link. I want to say though that this is a potluck. This is you've brought everything you need to bring for us. We will move to generosity to support the city center support these classes other classes, the donate link on the city center will will provide a way to practice that generosity. We certainly appreciate all that generosity that keeps all this happening. We're going to ask that in the link if you, when you go through you can, there's a place where you can put in wise speech and that'll help keep keep things straight for the for the people on the other side of the people receiving generosity. We want to tell you somebody said we should meet more frequently Yeah well, we've got a new another class coming up. This is a special thing we haven't done it before. We have a part class to consecutive weeks Tuesday Thursday and then a half day retreat, where we'll focus on mindfulness of the body, and the one of the principal suit is where that practices found module Minikaya 119. So anyway, we, we hope to see some of you there, we expect that will be really, really interesting and kind of in kind of an intense thing. It'll probably attract a smaller dedicated following because of its its length. And then finally, a minute after finishing, we'd like to offer the merit of our practice. And this is particularly sweet to do this for this class because we have an opportunity here to take our practice and share it in the world in a very direct way, not only with the holidays coming up, but because as we've tried to say in this class that bringing, bringing our mindful attention to speech is a way that we bring the open mind the open heart that grows with our practice to others in the world. This is a way where we hardly have to say, don't hold this tight to yourself this benefit this side, this beneficial side benefit of our practice, right, but share it with the next people you come into contact warts and all open up to the extent we can opening up the heart and mind is a way that we bring the merit directly into the world. Somebody said earlier just that the ripples from every conversation we have proceed outward, just as a pebble creates ripples in a pond. And that's a useful thing to keep in mind as we do this to keep spreading the benefit of our practice through speech and other means out into the world to the benefit eventually of all beings. So may all beings know open hearts open minds clarity of vision. May all beings be safe, secure. May all beings know contentment and know happiness may all beings be free. And thank you, given the nature of this classes, particularly with with great joy that I encourage people to unmute and say farewell till we meet again to up till our paths cross again. Take care everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. Yeah. Bye everyone. Hi, Boris and daughter. I'm assuming that was his daughter I don't actually know. Bye, all. Okay.
