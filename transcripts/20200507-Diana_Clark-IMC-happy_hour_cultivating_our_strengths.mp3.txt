The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, okay, so welcome. It's nice to see you all.
And, you know, we've been at sheltering in place for quite some time now.
And I heard somebody recently say, the more challenging the outer world is,
the more important it is to draw on and grow our inner strengths.
And I thought, oh, this is absolutely true. I mean, this is partly why we cultivate
our inner strengths is to help us through difficulties.
So some of these inner strengths that can be really helpful with us while we're
still here in this era of COVID-19, of course, is patience and care.
Maybe part of patience is to recognize that there will be another side of this
sheltering in place. There will be another side of this COVID-19.
We don't know what it's going to look like. It's impossible to know.
But there will be another side, just like there has been another side for all the
difficulties we've had in our lives. Maybe we're in the midst of, you know,
some, but we can reflect back that in our lives there have been hard times.
That's part of what it means to be human. And so with this hard times,
there's not, they haven't all stayed the same level of difficulty or the same
duration, and some of them have ended. So in the same way that those have
ended, this one will end too.
But this idea of having patience, I often, there's this two lines of a,
I think it's a song, actually, that I bring to mind that I find it really
helpful to think about patience. And it says, I've often worried,
is it so that lessons of patience get learned slow?
That is this recognition that the only way to cultivate patience or the only
way to learn patience is to be patient or to be put into situations that
require patience. So we're cultivating whether you wanted to or not or
trying to cultivate some patience here and develop that as one of our
inner strengths. But another way, of course, to cultivate inner strengths
is to cultivate warmheartedness, care, loving kindness. And that's part of
what we're going to talk about this evening. We all have this fundamental
power inside of us, inside of ourselves to open and strengthen the heart.
And then with this more open heart and this stronger heart that allows us to
maybe nod and smile at the people that we see walking down the sidewalk when
we're walking down the sidewalk, rather than having this sense of stiffness
and uneasiness. But instead, if there were in a mask or if we're wearing a
mask, maybe we don't exchange smiles. But we can somehow not make them feel
uncomfortable with our scurrying away as fast as possible. But keeping our
distance and acknowledging them and nodding and in whatever way feels
appropriate or safe or, I'm not saying you have to have a big conversation,
but to not like an ignore and turn away from other people who may be feeling
the same thing about you as you are feeling about them, of course.
So when we're cultivating loving kindness, who allows us to have this kind of
open heartedness and recognize that people want to be seen or acknowledged
the other day when I was out for a walk and somebody, I wanted to have eye
contact and nod or smile, but she just immediately turned away and we were
passing on another, which is perfectly fine. She's allowed to do that.
But I noticed a little feeling like, oh, well, we could, you know, that she
didn't even turn towards me and at least kind of acknowledge and say hi or
something. So we can do this. We can say hi to people as we need that, even
though there might be a little uneasiness that we have with this feeling
around other people due to the virus. But we can be attentive and warm heartedness
in some kind of way. And plus loving kindness practice, not only can it
help them cultivate this inner strength, but the actual practice itself can
help bring us out, bring us out of some repetitive ruminations we may be having.
It's easy when we're feeling some unease to feel stuck and to find ourselves
repeating again and again and again, going over a scenario or of the past
or of the future or something that we're struggling with.
I mean, there can be a sense of not getting anywhere and maybe hopelessness
with it. But with loving kindness practice is a way that disrupts those
patterns and instead brings some spaciousness, brings some ease.
So simple practices do work. We might be thinking that, you know, loving kindness
or whatever practice it might be. It has to be complicated. It has to be
really difficult. It has to be uncomfortable in order for it to be effective.
But simple practices can make a difference. Of course, one of the keys is
consistency. Just to do it regularly with some ease.
So so many of us are under pressure these days. And when we're under pressure
we tend to hunker down and put up walls. But instead, can we use our loving kindness
that we've been cultivating or that we have all of us have inside of us?
Can we use that to show up for others, maybe a little more patience,
a little more attention? And can we show up for ourselves with a little bit
more patience, a little bit more attention?
So to cultivate loving kindness, we can, I often like to start with a little
bit of mindfulness just to help us get grounded and settled.
And also a recognition that sometimes for some people loving kindness practice
isn't the right practice for them at that time. It's a practice that maybe
makes them feel overwhelmed in some kind of way.
So mindfulness practice is always an alternative. It can always available to you
if you ever feel like that's the right thing to be doing.
So to begin our practice,
just sit with that alert, a bright posture that also has comfort,
that also has ease.
Some people do loving kindness practice lying down.
Of course you're welcome to do that.
I'm just checking in with the body to send a global sense.
Are there any obvious places of discomfort, unease?
Would some adjustments help with that?
Then to do a body scan just to support a sense of well-being.
Bring your attention to the area around the eyes and around the mouth.
Yes, we often hold tension.
The shoulders.
Maybe check in with the chest and see if there can be just a small little
movement to open it up just a little bit, just a little bit.
And the belly, bring some ease to the belly.
Feel the pressure of the chair or the cushion or the floor against your body.
Feeling connected, supported, grounded.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice.
I'm sorry, to begin our mindfulness of breathing practice.
Rest your attention on the sensations of breathing.
Just with a light touch, maybe just like kissing the sensations
of the movement of the abdomen or movement of the chest.
Maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose.
Very simply, very gently, hanging out with the sensations of breathing.
If you find your mind wandering, it doesn't have to be a problem.
Just very simply, gently begin again.
And then to begin now, to begin the loving kindness practice.
Bring to mind a lovable being.
Someone for whom it's easy to feel love, to feel warm heartedness, to feel care.
Feel goodwill. This might be somebody you know.
It might be somebody you don't have a relationship with, a teacher, a leader.
It might be somebody that's inspired you.
And some people like to bring to mind lovable beings such as kittens or puppies, babies.
And then to cultivate loving kindness.
Can repeat these phrases while keeping this lovable being in mind.
Well, also every now and then, chucking in with the body
and see if there is any warm heartedness, some spaciousness or ease associated with having this lovable being in mind.
So you can repeat the phrases after me.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Just gently do an inquiry in the body and see if there is any feelings of warmth or spaciousness,
openness, well-being, even if it's just a tiny little corner of your experience.
And allow that to be as big as it would like.
Without making it get bigger, just allowing.
Can this be a support for your loving-kindness practice?
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
And then can we build on this loving-kindness that we're developing for the loveable being
and expand it, stretch it to include ourselves,
have loving-kindness for ourselves.
So in the same way can bring to mind either the felt sense of your experience right now
or an image of yourself as you are now or maybe when you were a child or a younger version of yourself.
Whichever seems easy and accessible, some people like to do when they were toddlers.
May I be safe.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
Again, an invitation to see if there's some physical sensations that might be of support.
There might not be, but if there is, if you can tap into them, really experience them.
Allow that to support us softening and opening.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be safe.
And then can we expand our loving kindness to include a neutral person.
Maybe somebody that we see sometimes walking past where we live, a neighbor that we've never spoken to,
that we don't dislike or like, we just simply are neutral, we don't know them.
Can we extend some warm-hearted feelings to them?
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Maybe it's helpful to bring to mind again the neutral person to refresh the image.
Can we extend our warm-heartedness to a neutral person?
Somebody that we're not for or against. Good to extend some care. Good will.
Thank you.
And then to end this meditation, feel your feet on the ground.
Feel the pressure of the chair or the cushion against your body.
And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
Yeah, so this recognition that external circumstances are challenging or difficult,
we can call upon, draw on and cultivate inner strengths.
So in this way, living kindness, we're purposefully cultivating,
but also, of course, we cultivate inner strengths anytime we work with difficulties.
So it can be nice to talk about this idea of how do we meet challenges
and what are some of our strengths that are getting cultivated. I mentioned patience and loving kindness, we just did loving kindness practice.
But what might be some other strengths that are getting cultivated during this time, the pandemic and shelter at place.
So I'll put you into some small groups and to talk about this idea about what's getting cultivated.
What are some of the positive qualities that are getting cultivated? Let's say that I'll qualify it in that way.
Or if you'd like, you can talk about your loving kindness practice. What was that experience like starting with the level being, going to self and then the neutral person?
How was it to work with the neutral person compared to the level being or the self?
So it's your choice. You can decide how you'd like to, what you'd like to talk about. And I'll give you guys 15 minutes.
And there'll be a three or four people per group, unless people decide to leave. Okay, so have fun.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, so welcome back.
So does anybody have some comments, would they like to share? What was that like? How was that? Do they have any questions or something that came up in the group maybe?
I popped into one of the groups I saw that Kennedy had asked for some help. But then when I popped in, I felt like, oh, I was eavesdropping and so I came back out.
Okay, that's okay. I was just clarifying our shares.
Okay.
Because I hadn't, you know, done it previously.
Okay.
Did it work out alright?
Yes, it did. Yeah. Thank you so much.
So who would like to say anything about what was that like? Did you find yourselves talking about difficulties that was being cultivated or talking about more about loving kindness?
Felipe, I see that you unmuted yourself.
Yeah, we talked about this idea of that everyone is feeling the same. I mean, there are many things that we have right now that many people in the whole world are feeling the same thing, loneliness or they miss a friend and they cannot see them.
I didn't say it, but I feel happy that I started with meditation last year. So it prepared me a lot for this time that I'm alone many times. So I can use that time for so many things.
I have a feeling of connectedness with a lot of people because it's like the whole world is vibrating like a guitar string in the same way because we are on the same boat.
Nice. Yes. It's recognition that I'm told numbers. I don't know how many people are having similar experiences.
Anybody else?
Not obligated to share, but it can be nice.
I'm finding I'm thinking the shopkeepers and the gas station attendants or anyone I'm exchanging with, probably for many reasons, but I'm just like, wow, thank you so much.
Thank you for handing back to me. Thank you for opening the door or even just standing here to be a guard. It's like, hi, thank you.
It feels great. It feels really great. I'm engaging with those. Well, I do engage with people, but I'm engaging more though.
And they too are feeling it. So that feels really good.
And walking down the streets, there were people that don't look and generally people walking on the streets now are kind of high, you know, or are really acknowledging your presence.
And it feels one's presence. So that feels good too. Kind of like high fiving. So if you can't really see it, it's such an expressive area of the face, right?
You can't see it, but you kind of acknowledge it.
I'm happy to hear this, Chris. That's such a nice thing that our appreciation, right? We didn't used to call the shopkeepers and the grocery clerks and the gas station people heroes, right? But now we're recognizing how dependent we are.
Right. And they really putting themselves on the line, engaging with so many people through the day.
And are you done, Chris? Oh, yeah, yeah.
I saw an interesting thing the other day.
In my town, there's a lot of First Nations bands that live around and the shop in our town.
And there was a gathering of people, primarily men, and they had drums and they were gathering over by the bank and I kind of swindering like, oh, wonder what's going on and are people upset?
And then they moved to in front of the grocery store. We have like one grocery store.
And I said, that's so pretty guys doing. And they had one of the members had carved these beautiful hearts that had, it's a Talukwiat band, which had the symbol for the Talukwats on that.
And they were, they did a drum circle and they sang, Thank You, Thank You, Glanko Glanko.
And then they called out the manager of the grocery store and gave him one of them for Thank You for taking care of us, went into the pharmacy and brought out the pharmacist and gave her another plaque and thanked her.
And then there was a nurse that was standing there and they gave her a plaque and it's just so wonderful that all this appreciation.
And then this carver had gone to the trouble of making these beautiful carvings to say Thank You for taking care of us all.
It was definitely, again, it was quite lovely watching.
Wow, that's a fantastic story. Thank you so much for sharing that.
That's very uplifting. I love it. I love it.
That's pretty cool.
Okay, on that note, I think that all unmute us and we can kind of all say goodbye at once.
So I'm just going to unmute us all just to heads up. Some people like to turn down their volume, but there aren't too many of us. We're not going to be too loud. So we're all unmuted now. So thank you all.
Thank you. Thank you for the session.
Yes, yes, my pleasure. My pleasure.
Nice.
Thank you.
Okay, so I wish you all a wonderful evening and may you be safe and happy and healthy and may you have ease.
Thank you.
