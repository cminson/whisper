The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Yeah, as I said, it's really great to be here with you all and practice this happy hour tonight.
I was planning on doing a practice of receiving love and kindness or meta and then also sending it after you've practiced the receiving part.
But first I'll give some reflections on meta or loving kindness that come to mind.
And the meta is not something that we right away have to be good at. It's okay if it's not working or if it's messy or we don't really feel much.
And that is because it's a practice.
Someone's bonus.
So meta is a practice. It's something we can get better at in a sense. It's like a process.
And sometimes we just don't feel it and sometimes you can even feel disengaged or emotions can come up or judgments or attachments.
And that's all very normal in a meta practice.
And sometimes conditions are just such that we just don't feel it and we just can't generate any meta.
Same for the other, other Brahma-Viharas.
And at other times we might find ourselves like exuding abundantly lots of meta to all corners of the universe.
And I found out that it's not like fully in our control.
We don't have to take it personally the way the meta is flowing or the other Brahma-Viharas.
Either way, like if it's feeling abundant or dry, it's just causes and conditions that are here right now to create this specific experience in this moment.
So I think that's very important to realize when we do this practice.
Since we might all sometimes have the tendency to think like, oh, this, this was a good meta practice. I'm nailing it.
Or this was lousy. I'm not a good meta practitioner.
And sometimes we even build our self-worth on those judgments of our practice.
Well, in reality, it has not so much to do with our self, with the I, me, mine.
It has more to do with just causes and conditions coming together.
And sometimes we might have a lot of emotion and the meta just not flowing because there's a lot of other stuff going on.
So things are not always in our control and life just happens.
So if it's out of our control, like, what can we do then? Can we do anything?
And I really like what Sharon Salzberg is saying. She's this great meta person.
She's from Insight Meditation Society, one of the founders.
In her book on loving kindness, she describes, doing meta, we plant the seeds of love, knowing that nature will take its course.
And in time, those seeds will bear fruit. Some seeds will come to fruition quickly, some slowly, but our work is simply to plant the seeds.
And quote, we can plant those seeds of loving kindness and maybe within some decades, if we practice this practice of meta,
we might end up with a big strong meta forest or beautiful trees.
So it's not something that usually happens overnight. It takes time and also repeated practice.
And those of you who might come regularly to happy hours, maybe already for months or years, you might just notice that your forest starts to grow.
And that there first may be small plants arising and then they turn into small trees and eventually into big trees.
A meta becomes something more available for you.
And this is not always a linear thing that happens. It usually goes up and down.
We feel like how this forest is really growing great. And then at some point it might seem like a desert again.
So even if you sometimes can exude this loving kindness, then there still can be days that you don't feel it or it doesn't seem to work so well.
In that sense, the simile doesn't go all the way.
There are some limitations to this simile.
But nonetheless, this image of planting seeds can be very helpful in times when the practice gets a bit dry.
We can remember ourselves like, oh, we're planting seeds every sentence, every phrase or every little bit of intention that I have is planting a new seed.
And Sharon Salzberg continues in her book.
Every time we form the intention in the mind for our own happiness or for the happiness of other, we are doing our work.
Beyond that, we can just trust the laws of nature to continually support the flowering of our love.
End of the quote.
So even if we don't really feel the meta in that moment, that we are using the phrases, for example,
planting a seed for maybe a future moment with my flower and at the future moment.
So our genuine intention is doing all the hard work in the background. We don't have to do that much. That's the good news.
Before we start the meditation, I want to lastly quote Pablo Neruda, who was also mentioned in Sharon Salzberg's book.
He says, perhaps the earth can teach us as when everything seems dead and later proves to be alive.
With that, let's settle into the meditation.
You can start with finding a posture that is comfortable.
It's always a good idea for the Brahma Vihara practice to be comfortable.
Because if your body hurts or is uncomfortable in any way, it might be a bit harder to generate meta or to feel meta.
Meta can even be practiced like laying down or just crouching on the couch. That's more comfortable for you.
Whenever you're ready, you can close your eyes if that feels right to you.
And we'll start with some relaxation.
You can feel your body and the posture that's in.
Maybe it's sitting, maybe it's laying down.
Don't really become aware of the body.
You can breathe in a little bit deeper than normal and breathe out a little bit deeper.
And on the outbreath, you can have the intention to let go. Let go of any tension.
With your feel breath, you can let go of the deeper breathing and return to your normal breathing.
We'll do a little body scan to see if there's any tension in the body.
Start with the head.
Maybe there is some tension in the forehead or the jaw.
Just by directing your attention to this area, it might release already.
Just gently, kindly focus on those areas.
Shoulders.
Arms and hands.
We'll just let this gentle attention do the work.
Slowly in the lower back.
We're not looking for anything particular, just a gentle attention for that area.
Selfic area.
Lower legs and feet.
Then you can become aware of your whole body again.
Maybe there's a little bit of a difference than before the body scan.
Maybe not, it's also fine.
And if there's any tension left in an area, you can invite that area, maybe your shoulders or your forehead, maybe another area.
Maybe this area relax a little bit more.
As far as possible.
You can even invite your mind to relax.
You can just say, make a mind to relax.
Maybe that's available to you and maybe not.
Either way is okay.
If you feel ready, you can connect with your heart center in the middle of your chest.
Just by placing your attention there.
You can also place a hand on your chest that helps you connect to that area.
What is it like right now in your heart area?
Maybe it feels tense or closed off, confused.
Maybe it's open, warm, radiant.
Or maybe you don't really feel much there.
It's not about that it needs to be a certain way, it's about just acknowledging what's there right now.
Maybe you can acknowledge it with kindness.
Kind attitude towards what's there right now in your heart.
And we're gonna receive metta from a benefactor.
A benefactor can be someone who you trust.
Maybe someone who has helped you, who guided you on your path.
Maybe a coach or teacher, a dear aunt or uncle, maybe even a pet.
You can also visualize people who will be able to visualize their own benefactor and their mental eye in front of them.
Maybe even multiple benefactors.
If you have trouble visualizing, you can also feel their presence or use their name.
That is also fine.
If one or more benefactors are in your presence right now, then you can imagine that it's benefactor or benefactors sent you well wishes.
And the first wish they have for you is may you be safe.
The benefactor repeats this phrase a few times for you, may you be safe.
May their hearts to yours.
May you be safe.
See if you can really receive their sincere well wishing for you.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
May this kind wish really land.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
May you feel the goodness in their heart that this beautiful wish is coming from. May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be happy.
You're just bathing in the meta of this benefactor or benefactors.
You only have to allow it to receive it.
Let it go to every cell of your body.
May you live with ease.
May they take it in.
It's a gift for you.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Now we're going to turn around and send our meta to the benefactor or benefactors that are around you.
You can reconnect with your heart if needed.
And then send the well wishes to the benefactor. May you be safe.
Feel free to change the phrases with your own favorite phrases if needed or wanted.
I'll use the standard phrases.
From your heart outwards towards the benefactor. May you be safe.
Now that even if it's difficult to feel meta right now,
but you're still planting seeds, might bloom in a different time.
Maybe you do feel it and then you can already feel the effect of the seeds that you're planting.
Now the next phrase for the benefactor. May you be happy.
Thank you for watching.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
And this practice is not so much about the other person is going to get healthy or happy.
It's more about cultivating our own hearts.
Cultivating meta in our own hearts as a wholesome quality of heart-mind.
May you live with ease.
May you be happy.
May you live with ease.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
Now you can keep the benefactor or benefactors around you,
but will turn towards herself to send herself meta. And the benefactor can support us if needed.
So with that support, you can direct the phrases towards yourself.
Feel free to use other phrases, your own favorite phrases, I will use the standard ones.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May you be happy.
May I be healthy.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
May I live with ease.
And the Buddha has said and I'm paraphrasing, you are just as worthy of your love as anyone else.
In the last day we will send a meta phrase to the Sangha.
All the people here on Zoom, the people who couldn't make it tonight, they're normally also maybe present for happy hour.
Diana and Nikki and other villains.
People who are listening to audio dharma.
May all be happy.
May all of them be happy.
You can take a moment to appreciate yourself for practicing loving kindness tonight, whatever time zone you're in.
It's not always easy.
And you put in the effort, the time and the energy.
You can acknowledge that for yourself.
You can feel some gratitude for your own practice and your sincere wish to alleviate suffering.
You can share this benevolent energy, this goodness with all beings.
May the benevolent energies from our practice together be shared with all beings.
May all beings be happy and at ease.
...
...
...
We have some time for reflections, questions, comments.
If you'd like to share something about your practice, often it's helpful for others.
We share.
You can also put it in a chat if that's more comfortable for you.
If you'd like to share your Zoom hand.
...
Elaine says I liked the quote you gave from Sharon Salzberg.
I can get the quotes to Neil, maybe, and put them on the group.
I found myself dealing with impatience and aversion during this.
When we do any practice or just normal meditation,
maybe sometimes the conditions come together that we experience impatience and aversion or other feelings or emotions.
That's a little bit what I talked about in my intro.
It just causes and conditions coming together and we just have to work with what's there in the background if we just keep sending those metaphrases.
We'll be planting seeds anyways, even if there's aversion and impatience.
It can be useful to just spend some time with the aversion or the impatience.
Just observe it a little bit before you go back to the metapractice that can be helpful.
Especially when it's a bit overwhelming or when it's a little stronger.
It's perfectly fine to take a break and do some Vipassana meditation, for example.
Yeah, we could do some breakout groups or maybe seven minutes or so.
Let's see.
Maybe if I can set this up.
It doesn't seem to work right now.
It doesn't let me choose more than one breakout room so it's going to be a big group.
That is weird.
I guess we're not going to have breakout room.
Because it doesn't work for some reason.
I don't know if there's anything else that people would like to share.
I wanted to ask, I've been away from the Dharma practice for almost two months now.
I just had some family obligations to deal with and a lot of work.
My schedules were shifted so I had to do a swing shift.
I wasn't able to do any of the happy hours.
I just put it in the back burner saying that it's not making it a priority.
I noticed a drastic impact in my state of being in day-to-day life within a couple of months or so.
It's interesting how you said about planting the seeds and watering the seeds.
It would also be practicing it daily and reflecting on it and whatnot.
I just wanted to add that in there.
Thank you for adding that.
If we don't practice for a while, we can really feel that.
If we get back, we can feel the wholesome effects of practicing.
Thank you for sharing that.
I was glad that you included the Sangha, I think it was the first time I've been sitting here when a leader didn't formally include all of us.
It felt so right and natural and I thank you for it.
Yeah, great. Thanks for putting a few back.
See some hearts popping up for Fred.
Okay, in going to a benefactor, I began to sense not just the one benefactor,
but I've received the benefactions of many people in my life.
And it just began to open up for me and I remembered people that I have not thought of in a long time that were important and beneficial, helped me along in some ways.
And I just felt my awareness kind of expand in that way.
I thought that was very helpful. Thank you.
Yeah, beautiful. Thanks for sharing that.
There's a little story coming to mind that Sharon Salzberg writes about in her book, maybe some of you have read the book too.
She describes that she's on retreat, doing a month long, only Metta, the whole month, only Metta for herself.
And she didn't really notice any difference in how she was feeling towards herself at all and she was like, I'm just doing this for nothing.
It's just not working. And then she gets called home because of, I don't remember some family member getting ill or something and she needs to go home.
She needs to leave the retreat.
And then while she's packing, she drops this bottle on the bottom floor.
And the first thing she says to herself is, it's okay, sweetie, or something like that.
And she realized like, oh, the practice did help.
It did have an effect.
And that is kind of the planting seeds at some point we notice this, this epiphany like, oh wow, I'm a lot more friendly towards myself or maybe towards my partner or towards my, my child or my parent.
At some point we can suddenly realize that.
Okay, and to mine, if there's any other people who want to share something or a reflection.
I'm sorry, we didn't have breakout groups today. I know that's really nice part of this evening so we can connect to, to meet each other a little bit.
And I also will stop a little earlier, more early than normal.
Yeah, if there's anyone who feels inspired. Yeah, Richard.
Richard, yeah, go ahead.
Hi, no, I just want to say hello. Thank you.
Thank you for a good feel calm for the first time in a week. So you've done something good.
Okay, thank you.
That was it. You're just on to share.
That's all. Thank you. Thank you.
That's lovely.
Jerry or Gary, you're not sure how to pronounce your name.
Oh, you're still muted.
Anyway, it's Jerry. But thank you first of all, and I guess I do echo perhaps in a larger way.
This was mentioned earlier about the issue of benefactors and actually I hadn't thought of some benefactors, and I then started thinking in a more general way and I thought, my goodness, I had forgotten about them.
So I think that had been mentioned a bit earlier, but I think it's helpful actually to remind ourselves as Terrence mentioned about benefactors, because sometimes we don't realize how many there are.
And it was helpful tonight, because I was thinking of someone, I mean, medical politics in Canada, and there was someone that I had actually not thought about, oh my goodness, I'm here because of him and others.
So it is helpful to have a review as you mentioned tonight. So thank you.
Thank you for sharing that. And it can be very helpful indeed and realize how much impact some people have had on our lives, how much beneficial impact.
And continue to have on our lives.
Right. Yeah, so I'm going to you to have. Yeah, for sure.
Yeah.
The other thing I would say is to add to that, and perhaps hasn't been mentioned tonight, is it makes you feel less singular in the world.
When you recognize the number of people that are supporting you at times when one can feel quite alone, but recognize that there are many people out there actually supporting you.
You just have maybe forgotten about them.
So it's helpful that we do see existential sense of aloneness.
It brings connection back to our hearts.
Right. Thanks for adding that.
Well, then we're practically at our designated time for this happy hour.
Thank you all for being here and sharing and practicing. I really enjoyed this. And yeah, we delighted to be here with this beautiful sangha.
I'm wishing you all the best in the last days of the year and I'll be back on the New Year's Eve.
And maybe see some of you there.
