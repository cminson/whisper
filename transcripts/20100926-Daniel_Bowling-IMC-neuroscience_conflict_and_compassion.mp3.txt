The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I'm very enthusiastic about the talk.
I'm going to share with you this morning.
And I hope that at the end of this talk you will understand
why I am choosing to generate and bring
enthusiasm. This talk is about neuroscience,
conflict, and compassion.
Mary Oliver, one of my favorite poets
from House of Light, a poem entitled The Buddha's Last
Instructions.
Make of yourself a light, said the Buddha
before he died. I think of this every
morning as the east begins to tear off its many
clouds of darkness to send up the first signal.
A white fan, strength with pink
and violet, even green.
An old man, he lay down between two solid
trees and he might have said anything, knowing it
was his final hour. The light burns
upward. It thickens and settles over the fields, around
him the villagers gathered and stretch forward to listen.
Even before the sun itself hangs
detached in the blue air,
I am touched everywhere by its ocean
of yellow waves. No doubt he thought
of everything that had happened in his difficult life.
And then I feel the sun itself as it blazes
over the hills like a million flowers on fire.
Clearly I'm not needed, yet I feel
myself turning into something of inexplicable
value. Slowly beneath the branches
he raised his head. He looked into the faces
of that frightened crowd.
My mom,
who's a good southern Baptist,
my dad was a southern Baptist preacher. Several
grandfathers before were southern Baptist preachers, so you'll get
sort of a combination Buddhist southern Baptist
preacher talk this morning.
My mom is probably
one of two Democrats in the first Baptist church
of Charleston. And back in the
04 election, right before I was going
to sit the three month retreat at IMS
and she would say to me, you know, the Buddha's not God
and I'd say, that's true mother, I agree.
And 30 minutes or an hour later she'd say, you know, the Buddha's
not God. And I'd say, I agree mother, no doubt.
And we had that conversation in the midst of my
sharing with her why I was doing something like that and
she said to me, I'm going to tell you something
I've never told anybody. I was startled. Hmm, this
sounds interesting. And I said, never anyone
she said, nope, never anyone. What is it mother? She said,
I voted for John Kennedy.
Now some of you are old enough to know that people
like my daddy before the 1960 election were preaching
that if you voted for John Kennedy, you were electing the pope to run the
country. And she said, I went into that polling booth
and I closed that curtain and I voted for John Kennedy.
And I said, you never told daddy
no way. I never
told anybody until just now. And knowing
her heart and knowing her view of true
Christianity and the true teachings of Jesus about caring for the
poor, which seems to have been greatly perverted these
days in my view, I thought you
voted for him because you really liked what he stood for
and all of his policies and proposals.
She thought for a moment said, nope, I voted for him because he was
so cute.
Lately
as I watch what's happening in our country
I sometimes find myself
in despair. And every day
when I ride the bus home from the city
I talk to my mother for about 30 minutes
and she spends a little too much time watching
TV and she will often be in despair about what's
happening, the level of discourse, the incredible
acerbic personal attacks that are going on
the violence around the world
make of yourself a light
said the Buddha. And I think about that song
I learned in Sunday school, this little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine and I'm in that place of despair
where I don't feel much light.
I've forgotten
that this is the life Daniel was given
to live at this time.
So often I find myself
wanting to live a life that's different from the one I'm given to live.
That's a fantasy life, the one that I should
have lived, the one that has various aspects to it
that's probably similar in many ways to your fantasy life.
It's a big
hook and it's a fundamental
choice that we all have to pay attention to
and live the life we are given to live
or stay stuck somewhere in the past or fantasizing
about the future, the life that we should have
could have, would have, but for
that life. This summer
I had the great privilege, mainly because I married to
an extraordinary woman, she got invited to teach
at the International Summer School of Business Mediation
in Admont, Austria, a little town
village really in the Alps. And I got to go along
and teach as well as her spouse.
On the faculty with us was an extraordinary
neuroscientist from the University of
Frankfurt named Jared Hooter. He has
many books out, the only one published in English is this one
entitled The Compassionate Brain, How Empathy
Creates Intelligence.
Everything alive
everything alive including human
beings faces a huge dilemma.
We must stay open enough
to gather into us what we need to nourish
ourselves and take care of ourselves and yet closed
enough to prevent external
disturbances from penetrating
our inner world and threatening the stability
of our inner order. It's a constant
paradoxical way that we have to interact
with not only the environment but with each other.
Human beings, however, are
unique. We have a brain, according
to Dr. Hooter, that is not only designed
to protect the stability of our inner order
and our external interactions with the world
but it has the capacity
and listen very carefully to this.
To break down interconnected
neuronal circuits already established in the brain
repattern and restructure them
and with them the mental behavioral
patterns that they determine including
unshakable basic convictions
and emotional patterns. It is because of this
capacity that the human brain alone is
capable of erasing and overwriting
already existing programs as soon as
they begin to hamper the development of our mental and emotional
potentialities. We can wipe out our
hard drive and reprogram it and that's exactly
what the Buddha taught us how to do.
We have
extraordinary capabilities
and we're stuck, however, in an old Newtonian
worldview where the brain that we got
is the brain that we got. It's fixed, it's a machine
like our bodies, like the world and in
that Newtonian view I'm separate from you
and you're separate from me and we can learn about external
reality by breaking everything down into constituent parts
and analyzing those parts and in science we've gotten down to
smaller and smaller and smaller quarks of matter and sub quarks
and I don't even know what they're all called trying to understand us
and forgetting that in reality
science is learning, we live in a
quantum, inter-pentatrading, relational,
connected, irrevocably connected world
and reality. Our culture
hasn't caught up and most of us
unfortunately individually have not caught up in our
communications and the way we deal with conflict.
We are in a Newtonian reality
when I get mad at Dana, she's not
me and so
I don't speak to her as if she were me.
Of course the good thing about that
is being a mediator and a lawyer, if we were in a more quantum world
I'd probably be out of work.
In the
Samagama Sutta
the Buddha taught the six roots of disputes
one of the young novice monks
named Kunda, came to Ananda, the Buddha's constant companion
and his brother
he memorized all the Buddha's
teachings and based on Ananda's gifts to us
we have his teachings today and
this famous teacher had died and all of their
all of his disciples were
quarreling and brawling and in deep
disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, saying to
each other, your way is wrong, my way is right, I am
consistent, you are inconsistent, what should have been said first
you said last, what should have been last, said last you said first
what you had carefully thought up has been turned inside out, your
assertion has been shown up, you are refuted, go and learn
better or disentangle yourself as you can, none of us
of course have ever said anything like that to anyone else
I think it was just a couple of days ago that I did
now that I think about it and the Buddha taught
that there were these six roots of dispute, now this is
2,500 years ago you would think that we had maybe made a little progress
but if you don't recognize any of these please come up to me
afterwards and tell me your secret, number one
anger and resentment, number two
contempt and insolence
number three, enviousness and avariciousness
number four, deceitfulness
and fraudulence, number five
evil wishes and wrong view
we still all together
these are all familiar to us, good, good
number six, adhering to our own views
holding onto them tenaciously and relinquishing
them with difficulty
now that last one I'm going to mostly focus on
because that one is the one
that literally destroys our brain
holding, I'm sorry, adhering to our own views
holding onto them tenaciously and relinquishing
them with difficulty
in reality our brains are plastic
they have plasticity, they can develop
and in fact Dr. Hooter writes
nothing in the brain stays the way it is
if the brain does not continue to be used
in the same way, now let me read that again
nothing in the brain stays the way it is
if the brain does not continue to be used in the same way
adhering to our own views
holding onto them tenaciously and relinquishing them with difficulty
do you hear the connection
if I stick firmly
to what I call my reality and my rightness and my view
I'm creating
what were known in the Buddha's times as some scaras
grooves in my brain
used to go into those grooves
and I continue to see things that way
hear things that way
and believe that you are that way, whoever the you is in your life
I can't see you differently
I can't hear you differently or understand you differently
because my brain is literally stuck
like an old record those of us who are
old enough to remember LPs when there was a scratch
on it and it went over and over
and sometimes when I was stoned I really liked that
so
so
Dr. Hooter goes on to say
no aspect of the brain can keep on
developing and becoming increasingly complex
if it has no new tasks to accomplish and no new
challenges to meet so our brain stops developing
unless we give it new tasks
and new challenges sitting in front of the
TV playing computer games
continuing to isolate ourselves
continuing to do the same things every day
stuck in our ruts and patterns
that keeps our brain stuck in its ruts and patterns
and it literally begins to atrophy
which is exactly why the Buddha taught us
meditation and mindfulness to start to bring
our brains present and start to create new
patterns in the brain which has the
added advantage unknown at the Buddha's time of course that our brains
grew now you probably read a lot
those of you who've got a few gray hairs like I that
it's important to keep our brains active and you should do
crossword puzzles and Sudoku etc
Dr Hooter said when I
wasn't teaching and got to hear him when I was teaching I'd have about
a handful of people and I would say to them don't you want to let's all go here
Dr Hooter he said
that if you do a lot of crossword puzzles and Sudoku
that's great but when you get Alzheimer's or dementia you'll be able to
still do crossword puzzles and Sudoku
what then causes
our brains to develop
what causes our brains to be drawn to
creating new developmental pathways
new understandings, new views
new ways of seeing each other
new ways of seeing ourselves
are you ready
are you present right now is your mind off somewhere
enthusiasm
enthusiasm
enthusiasm
and what generates enthusiasm
exactly what the Buddha
taught 2,500 years ago
what generates enthusiasm
is two fundamental
aspects of life what we do
must give us meaning
it must be meaningful to us
we must be engaged in activities that arise
in us a connection with our hearts
an openness to challenge ourselves and bring
meaning into our lives
and we can of course as we know from our practice
we can generate and cause that to arise
in our minds by training our minds to
go in that direction
remember there's a big however
remember there are three jewels
the Dharma, the Buddha and the Sangha
the Sangha
that which gives us meaning
that which gives us enthusiasm
must be in relationship
must be interconnected
we our brains developed
because we unlike other creatures on the
planet our psycho we have a psycho
social brain
we are not the biggest, baddest, meanest
with the biggest claws the biggest teeth
of any animals we don't have the ability
to physically poison another we certainly poison each other pretty effectively
and so when we
began to evolve
we had to come together in groups
and we had to understand the strengths and abilities
of each other so that we could
figure out how to hunt together
how ultimately to farm together, how to protect each other
how to protect our young because of the long gestation
and why the long development
this was what is the most fascinating to me
the long development of our young is because
their brains are so plastic
they have greatly formed
habitual patterns of behavior like say a nightingale
the nightingale male sings outside
the nest every night of the nightingale baby
so that they get that particular nightingale song
if you put them near a rooster
their song will sound like a rooster
because it's patterned to mimic that way
our brains have much more ability to develop
so it needs a longer time and it needs to be
psychosocial it's in relationship
it's how we learn to talk we don't learn to talk by
mimicking mama
dada have meaning in relationship
so we learn that word
I'm holding my little 2 year old
granddaughter and we're looking out
at a bird and I say bird
this was before she was 2 obviously she can say that now
I say bird and we are connected
that connection has meaning to us both
she hears that sound and she learns bird
that's the way we learn unfortunately
that doesn't work so well with the TV blaring all the time
and with 4 people in a family
and all 4 of them on their own TV or their own computer
which is why we're getting an increase
of random violence and craziness and disconnection
of racial and political discourse
why? because people find meaning
connected meaning
in those kind of destructive behaviors
we must have meaning we must have relationship
and we're not skilled enough we haven't developed our brains enough
to understand the value
of having it in a peaceful way
so just as the Buddha taught us
neuroscience is now proving that whatever we use
our brains for that's how we'll develop
if we incline our minds towards the brahma vaharas
towards loving kindness, sympathetic joy, equanimity
compassion that's how our brains will develop
if we incline our minds towards
watching violent movies
and television shows and yelling and screaming and being caught in arguments
and adhering to our views with such firmness
that we cut ourselves off from people in our lives
that's the way our brains will develop
and here's the bad news
Dr. Hoontre writes
and because later on it becomes increasingly difficult
to get off of these well established highways
and boy am I learning that as I age
the decision a person makes concerning how
and for what purpose she uses her brain
is one that she should only make with a great deal of
affection and care
you have a choice beginning right now today to get this
that our brains are plastic
that they develop according to the way we use them
they are not fixed
and in fact Dr. Hoontre said in Austria
this hasn't even been written up it's so cutting edge
in neuroscience
we actually change our DNA
and there are receptors
in our genetic codes that turn on
or off depending upon how we use our brain
which is why it's such a struggle for doctors
to cure cancer for example
it's not just the gene you inherited
it's whether that gene gets turned on or off
and how we use our brain is what
turns them on or off
so the more you incline your mind
towards the negativity and the violence and the separateness that are in our
culture and in your hearts the more you incline your mind
to seeing people the way you've always seen them
and to hearing them the way you've always heard them the deeper those
grooves become and the harder it is to get out of them
that's why practice
is so crucial to us and that's why it's such
a gift
why should we take the trouble
to embark on this difficult path
it's an interesting
question why should we
try to empathize with others and increase our sensitivity
and be able to modulate our inner
and outer worlds as precisely and carefully as
we need in order to develop our brains
this way
this is Dr. Hoonters answer to that question
if you take a difficult path
you begin to use your brain in a significantly more complex
multifaceted and intense fashion
than someone who complacently remains until her last gasp
where she has either ended up accidentally or been dumped by the
motionful pull of circumstances
and hear this carefully because this absolutely
blew my mind and I hope it will blow yours
the type and intensity of brain use
determines how many connections are built
up among the billions of nerve cells in it
what patterns of neuronal
connectivity become stabilized and how complex a fashion
those neuronal connective patterns interconnect with others
thus in making a decision about how
and for what purposes you are going to use your brain
you're also making a decision about what kind of brain
you're going to end up with
our brain is that plastic
take on using our brain determine
the kind of brain we end up with which determines
the way we see the world which determines
whether we see the world as an interconnected relational
quantum
reality which determines whether we can generate
enthusiasm which brings meaning
connection which brings the ability to have joy
loving kindness compassion and empathy into the world
and that's what all of us in this
room who are pulled to and connected to
the very arduous and challenging
path of mindfulness practice
that's how we
that's the life that we are given to live to have
an impact on the craziness that's swirling all around
us we might not be in a position
of power to influence greatly
the direction of where the planet is going
but the more we fall into despair
which I certainly do from time to time
the more we fall into despair the fewer the opportunities
we have to generate
the kind of brain that will enable us
to generate in each of our connections
in each of our interactions the compassion and empathy
and connection and meaning that will inspire
that one person or those five people
what an extraordinary
opportunity we have every day
to inspire ourselves through our
practice and then give that gift and we
never know how many
people we have touched by just touching one
person or ten
and our choice is pretty depressing
because if we allow to the degree we allow
ourselves to stay stuck adhering to our views
holding tightly to our views holding on to
them that sixth root of dispute that the Buddha taught about
the more tightly we hold onto it the more we
kill off our brain the more it
shrinks and doesn't develop
and our brain has the capacity unlike what we've been taught
and this is a good news for all us gray haired folks
it doesn't stop developing unless we stay stuck
to the degree that we
challenge ourselves and take the arduous difficult path
of forcing ourselves if we need to into new patterns
of behavior and it can't be just walking down
the stairs backwards or doing crossword puzzles
remember it has to be activity that generates
that comes from enthusiasm based
on what gives us meaning with a shared
intention or attention
relational shared activities
that have meaning for us
that's what causes our brains
to grow
so we can't
develop by ourselves
and look at us all
here this morning I know you were coming to hear Gil
benefit of that but I'm really excited about it
because
here we are having the opportunity
of an incredible Sangha like this
activities that clearly have meaning
activities that are clearly shared activities
that clearly come from a shared intention and attention
are all available here
and this isn't the only place but they're certainly
available here
for these brain to grow our brains
in this way we need other people
and we need other people and we need to have
an emotional relationship with those people
because that's where the meaning comes from
we need to learn and challenge ourselves
to open our hearts to those other people
because love creates
connection and connection creates
shared intention and shared intention
is what's necessary to grow our brains
so the more we open our hearts
the more we find ourselves vulnerable
and open and connected to others
the more we share what is meaningful to us
the more enthusiastic and joyful
we are in sharing that
the better our brains are
in sharing that
Billy Collins is one of my other favorite poets
this is entitled Aimless Love
this morning as I walked along
the lake shore I fell in love with a wren
and later in the day with a mouse the cat had dropped under the
dining room table
and because of an autumn evening I fell for a seamstress
still at her machine in the tailor's window
and later for a bowl of broth
steam rising like smoke from a naval battle
this is the best kind of love I thought
without recompense without gifts or unkind words
without suspicion or silence on the telephone
the jazz cap and one hand on the wheel
no lust, no slam of the door, the love of the miniature
orange tree, the clean white shirt, the hot evening shower
the highway that cuts across Florida
no waiting, no huffiness or rancor, just a twinge
every now and then for the wren who had built her nest
on a low branch overhanging the water and for the dead mouse
in its light brown suit
but my heart is always propped up in a field on its tripod
ready for the next arrow
after I carried the mouse by the tail to a pile of leaves in the woods
I found myself standing at the bathroom sink
gazing down affectionately at the soap
so patient
and soluble so at home and its pale
green soap dish I could feel myself falling again
as I felt it's turning in my wet hands
and caught the scent of lavender and stone
that's it for a moment
so there's time
for a couple of minutes
and we'll be right back
and we'll be right back
and we'll be right back
and we'll be right back
and we'll be right back
so there's time for a couple of questions if someone has a question
or a comment, yes, over here
hi, good to see you
right over here, Linda
thank you
I am what you would call
a Buddhist psychotherapist
and
I have a question
a general question
relating to why so often
I find in those practicing Buddhism
that the assumption is
that disconnection
or disassociation may be because of
as you mentioned primal
system fear is interpreted
as the way the proper practice
so
it's certainly my experience also
it was my experience in my own practice
I think it's because
we initially believe that going inside
is the practice
and we initially believe and many of us certainly I was
because of the chaos of my life
and my own inability to interact and connect successfully
it was safer inside
of seeking refuge
and as I've developed
and as my practice has developed
I've found that the very purpose I've begun to understand
that what the Buddha taught about the Brahma vaharas
in particular and the Sangha
in general that's the direction
that the practice leads us
it's a developmental process I believe
and it's particularly important obviously
based on these neuroscience studies for us to see
that that developmental process of beginning to open our heart
and beginning to open ourselves to connection and to others
grows our brain
and we get as a we're taking baby steps in the beginning
and as we're ready those steps get stronger
and we get stronger and we start to look around and see
and that's why you're all here
thank you
I'm wondering
if there's some way
to have like a volunteer fair here
for older people who are working
so she's asking about
sort of a volunteer fair
where people who were working on different projects could present
their projects at some booths I assume
and there could be more connection and relationship about what everyone's doing
I'm sure that those who are in the leadership here will
listen to that sounds like a nice idea
and one that perhaps you would like to get involved in
helping to make happen
yes, yes, sounds great
you know the problem about bringing up a good idea
go for it
one more question
yes ma'am
yes, yes, she just asked the name of the author
it's Jared, we would pronounce it Gerald
Hooter, H-U-T-H-E-R
H-U-T-H-E-R
okay
the name of the Billy Collins poem is
Aimless Love
thank you all very much
it was quite a delight to be here
and I hope that
with your enthusiasm you will take it home with you and share it with others
