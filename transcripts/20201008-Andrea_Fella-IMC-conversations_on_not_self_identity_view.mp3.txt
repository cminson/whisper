So continuing this topic of not self. 
The last couple weeks began exploring the teaching of the five aggregates, which is kind of a way we could say to break down or to look at the different aspects of our human experience. 
The five aggregates could be thought of as the different processes that make up our experience, but also as the different experiences that we have, the different components of what the experience is. 
But just a reminder, the five aggregates are body or form, feeling, whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, perception, the recognizing aspect of experience, mental formations, the kind of the intending, the volitional aspect of experience. 
This includes emotions, it includes thoughts, it includes views, beliefs, pretty much anything that happens in the mind that has a kind of activity to it. 
So this includes mindfulness, this includes concentration, this includes equanimity and love and compassion, along with anger and frustration and irritation. 
So it's a big area of experience. 
And then consciousness or knowing just this really simple bear aspect of experience at a sense store. 
So our experience, any part of our experience, anything that we experience can be understood to be put together by these processes and also could be described as being the experience is the kind of the result of these processes. 
So for example, feeling tone, the feeling tone could be understood as a process that the process of mind the function of feeling that part of our system that does the work of feeling. 
And it also could be understood as the experience of pleasant the experience of unpleasant the experience of neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 
The exception aspect could be understood as that function of our mind that does the work of perceiving recognizing what's happening is this this kind of, you know, the process by which we recognize experience. 
It could be understood to be what is recognized. 
So when we recognize things objects in the room, for instance, when we recognize a wall or a book or a couch or a cushion. 
That's also perception. 
And the teachings describe both sides of it as being the, the, how to understand or explore, explore the aggregates. 
And we talked a little more about mental formations, that whole terrain of emotional activity of intention or volition. 
The, the, the volitional part of that is, and we talked about this last time. 
So for instance, when something like an emotion arises of some kind, perhaps anger, you can just use anger as an example. 
But anger arising will tend to, it has a, it has a kind of a shaping power to it, it shapes our experience. 
So anger will shape the experience of the body to, to perhaps have the sense of pressure and heat and type, tightness intention. 
It will shape the feeling tone to have probably an unpleasant quality. 
It will shape the perception to kind of orient to recognizing or, or, or interpreting experience to perceive it as though perhaps we're being attacked. 
It tends to shape more anger. 
And it tends to incline us to become aware of or to receive in consciousness. 
Things that kind of confirm that anger. 
So it kind of shapes the things that we become aware of as well. 
And so this is a very powerful place where selfing happens. 
The teaching of the five aggregates is often used to help us understand how a sense of self is created. 
And tonight we'll look, look at one of the ways that the teaching on the aggregates is used in that way. 
So the, the, we, we, the, the teachings described that we tend to identify or create a sense of self around these aggregates. 
We might tend to, and Biku Inaleo has a great way to express this. 
He says that the body, you know, in terms of each of these five aggregates of the body, the first one or form, the body tends to be, we identify that with being where I am. 
So the body is where I am, you know, that's kind of, we locate ourselves there in the body. 
Feeling the pleasant unpleasant neutral aspect, Biku Inaleo points to feelings are how I am. 
We, we have the kind of it's in that terrain of a little bit of, you know, so how am I feeling, am I feeling pleasant or unpleasant. 
So that, that that, again, with, but, but the, the identification is around that I am the one who is feeling these pleasant unpleasant experiences. 
Perception is what I am recognizing. 
So, you know, again, this is, this is, this feels a little bit more like we are just, you know, being impinged on in a way, and we get to perceive things, we perceive things. 
It's like there is a self that is the recipient of perceiving. 
That's kind of the way that we, we, we experience that at times. 
And then mental formations, he says this volitional aspect, volitional formations are why I am doing what I'm doing. 
This again, we, you know, when anger arises, we tend to act from that as a motivator. 
When love and compassion arises, we tend to act from that as a motivator. 
And so that's maybe another way to express what the mental formations are. 
They are the motivating function of the mind. 
They motivate us to do something. 
Some of the mental formations are subtle in that way, like mindfulness is a pretty subtle mental formation in that way. 
What mindfulness does is it's aware of experience, and it tends to encourage the mind to be more aware of experience. 
So it is, does kind of shape that it has that kind of motivation that as we become aware of experience, there's the motivation to continue being aware of experience, and then we forget, of course. 
And then he says that consciousness, we could say is the way I'm experiencing what I'm experiencing. 
Consciousness is the, the ground it consciousness is happening in every single moment and it we need consciousness to, to have a moment of experience. 
We identify with consciousness is like, oh yes, I am the one who knows. 
So the, these five we tend to create, or have a sense of self in relationship to these five categories of experience. 
These five that Biku and Alio points to are, are useful for us to just begin to taste or get a sense of how the mind does kind of congeal around each of these five aggregates. 
I find this teaching to be really useful as a shorthand for helping me recognize, oh yeah, but you know, I'm identifying with being the one who's feeling this. 
Or I'm identifying with being the one in the one who knows, or I'm identifying with being the angry one or whatever it is. 
So, you know, it just kind of helps to helps to see how the, the identification is happening around these, these processes. 
The Buddha used a teaching or, or with the five aggregates. 
He described the sense of self that arises connected with the five aggregates and also he described this connected with the six sense basis so there's two ways into this, but we're speaking of the aggregates at this point so with respect to the aggregates. 
He described a the phrase is identity view. 
Sakaya Diti is the Pali identity view sometimes translated as personality view. 
Essentially, it is that sense of self, but it is in this case it is understood that there's slightly different flavors of senses of self which we might get to a little bit later if we don't we'll get to it next time. 
The, the this, this flavor is a kind of a belief or a view. 
There's there's also perhaps the sense just the kind of very just the gut feeling of yeah, how can it not there not be a sense of, you know, how can there not be a me here. 
But, but there are some pretty clear times that like that the sense of self is being shaped as a perspective or a view, like, you know, in my own experience. 
I have a lot of history with aversive kinds of mind states, and negativity, self negativity, and those, those kinds of identifications, you know, oh yeah, I'm, I'm the one, you know, I'm, I'm miserable all the time I'm miserable. 
I mean, and that that that mind state of miserableness being identified with was kind of, you know, a belief of you that I am always miserable. 
So the way this played out I think I've described this recently but I'll just use it again here because it's, it's, it's a good example of this. 
I when I noticed that, you know, I wasn't so miserable. 
You know, I might what my mind might do with that is, oh yeah, well I'm happy now, but I know what I really am is miserable. 
That's a view. 
That's a belief that is kind of overlaid on experience. 
You know that, you know, here's my experience now I'm feeling pretty good but yeah I know what I really am is miserable. 
It's just an idea or a belief that is kind of really held to. 
And so the Buddha pointed to this level of selfing, this identity view, the belief of a, you know, this is who I am. 
It's just the feeling of the I am this, but the belief, this is who I am, the Buddha highlighted this as a particular useful exploration, it's kind of like the largest or the most outer levels of identification that happen. 
This identity view. 
He talked about different ways that this identity view comes up with respect to these aggregates. 
So this is a kind of a complex teaching and I'm going to try to simplify it a little bit. 
He basically says that there's four ways that we can identify with any of the five aggregates. 
There's four ways that we might identify with the body or form. 
I'll read this section of the suttas. 
This is in Majama 109, if you are interested in references, Majama 109 and this is paragraphs 10 and 11. 
How does the identity view come into being, the Buddha is asked, how does identity view come into being. 
There is the case where a run of the mill person who is untrained basically assumes form to be the self. 
He assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or the self, or the form as in the self, or the self as in form. 
So I'm going to start off with each of these five aggregates. 
I am this thing. 
I am X. 
I am this body. 
X is mine. 
The body is mine. 
With the body, some of these can be very, we can kind of grok or get what this means. 
We may not always feel like I am the body, but there are times when, if there's a particularly difficult or painful experience, we may have that sense. 
I am the body. 
It just feels like the body is the entirety of experience. 
So that's one. 
I am the body. 
The body is mine. 
That's a pretty familiar one to me. 
The body is mine. 
It belongs to me. 
I am inside the body. 
That one's also pretty familiar. 
I'm inside here. 
Yeah, that makes sense. 
Now the fourth one for me doesn't make so much sense, but maybe sometimes the body is inside of me. 
Maybe that one's not such a one that we would feel so much. 
The body is in me. 
Maybe, yeah, that's not one I particularly experienced, but I think there might be particular states of concentration or something where the sense of the eye, the sense of the consciousness becomes so large if you're identified with that kind of really big, vast experience. 
It might feel like this small form is in that experience. 
I can imagine something like that. 
It's not a very familiar experience to me, but I don't think we have to actually find or recognize every single one of these 20 ways. 
So some of the other aggregates, I think, do work for some of these other ones. 
So let's look at feeling, you know, the feeling tone, for instance. 
So I am the feeling. 
Maybe at times, you know, when a feeling is particularly strong, it's like, yeah, that's like the miserableness. 
Well, that's a mental formation for me. 
You know, that was that that miserable quality. 
That's a mental formation. 
And there was definitely this complete identification. 
I am the miserable one. 
And so that was a that was that I kind of identification. 
I can imagine that happening with with feeling tone as well. 
The feeling is mine. 
That one I recognize, you know, and likewise with with with the other ones as well, you know, perception is mine, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's my mind doing this. 
And the mental formations this anger is mine. 
Yep, that one, that one I recognize. 
And so that's the second one again, and then I am inside of of X. 
Now that one makes a lot of sense for body. 
But I am inside of feeling that one is less familiar to me. 
Maybe it's kind of resonates for some of you but I'm inside of feeling. 
I can the I am inside of a mental formation I'm inside of anger that that might resonate, you know, it's like when the when the anger just explodes it's like I feel like this tiny little thing that's just surrounded by by that anger. 
So that makes sense to me. 
So I am inside of feeling is a little less but the feeling is inside of me. 
Yes, that makes sense. 
Bodies inside of me doesn't make so much sense feelings inside of me. 
Yeah, perceptions inside of me. 
Yeah, that that I that I kind of have a sense of a kind of an identification, you know, at a very subtle level. 
Yeah, you know, it feels like it feels like well where else is it happening but inside of me. 
So these four, these four ways are kind of applied to the various, the various aggregates to begin to explore the, the ways that we have an identity. 
But what I would say is perhaps it what makes the most sense in terms of an exploration like this. 
It can be useful to do this as a reflective practice I wouldn't do this so much at first as a reflective practice it can become I think more natural as a just receiving and knowing experience over time. 
But initially with some with a teaching like that. 
I think what might be useful is if you see a particularly strong identification. 
You see a particularly clear sense of yep, that feels like me. 
You might explore. 
Does it feel like, you know, you're I you're completely equated with that. 
Does it feel like that thing is inside of you. 
Does it feel like you're inside of that thing. 
Or does it feel like it's yours. 
So those those four things, the equating of I am X. 
X is mine. 
I am in X, or X is in me. 
You might just have a sense with with particular strong identifications of whether what what flavor of this. 
This kind of identity view is happening. 
Recognition that it is a view it's important actually to recognize that it's a view there's an important piece about it. 
Being a view because as we explored last time. 
Views are our mental formations. 
And mental formation shape our experience. 
So the sense of self arising as a view. 
So that belief, I'm the miserable one. 
It shaped my experience believing I was a miserable person meant that I was a miserable person. 
So the this, this. 
This is an important understanding around that the teaching of not self I mean because it seems like, you know with the teaching of self the teaching of not self basically it's like well, there isn't a self really it's just a. 
A belief basically the Buddha describes this in this way that it's a belief it's it's an idea it's a view in the mind. 
It's not a thing. 
It's a like a like a view of. 
You know what I'm capable of or you know who somebody is or something it's like that that can come and go it's it's a it's it's. 
It's just something that's created by the mind is these views these beliefs. 
But that the not self nature of, of views and beliefs simply means that they're not stable solid lasting simply means that they are not a thing that can be like pointed to and said, yep there it is it's going to be there. 
Maybe, you know, I think sometimes it might feel like it's there for a little while and then falls apart, but any form of something feeling like it's there. 
That's a mistaken understanding of the, the sense of self that we attribute it is having some kind of a, a thereness to it. 
It's just a process. 
And yet it just being a process doesn't mean that it doesn't have an effect on us. 
Mental formations have a very strong effect on us as we talked about last time you know the, the shaping nature of something like anger or frustration, or love or compassion. 
Those things shape experience whether we identify with them or not. 
The, the sense of self, when we pick something up to say that's me, you know that then becomes that view, then becomes a mental formation that shapes experience. 
So it has an effect, you know, it's like it that the, the sense of self is not a nothing, because the belief in the sense of self has profound effects on our own experience, and on what happens in the world of the choices that we make. 
So it's worth respecting, it's worth respecting that sense of self and getting curious about it, and beginning to see if we can kind of unpack it and explore it a little bit. 
I think I'll stop there and see if there's any comments or questions or reflections, and pick up the last piece of what I was going to say next time. 
Oh, wait, wait, let me set you up to unmute yourselves. 
Okay, you should be able to unmute yourselves now. 
Okay, Ali. 
Thank you. 
So when you were talking the sense of, I was noticing that I have a self critic, which is like the mental formation that arises in me, but in most of the time it's unconscious and it's just so huge that I cannot see it. 
And it kind of like runs my life and, you know, tells me what I need to do or what not to do what not. 
But the awareness, most of the time, it's not big enough to contain that. 
But at times, if you mean that it doesn't recognize it, that it's happening. 
Right, exactly. 
You kind of, you'd see it after the fact or something. 
Sometimes when I'm lucky, I'll see it after the fact is that it's that again. 
And once I see it, it kind of like eases up. 
And so I can see it's not a solid thing in there that operates. 
It's a self view. 
But it's mostly unconscious. 
I mean, it's when it comes to this. 
Yeah, I can see it, but mostly it's like operating on the under the radar and it's like huge and it's like 90% of the time and I mean lucky if it's 10% I can see it. 
I can see it softening up. 
You know, some sometimes the strongest identities that we have are the hardest to see in a way, because they're so conditioned. 
And there's and that assumption it is, it is a view as you've seen when you see it and you can see that it's a view. 
But, you know, it's just so deeply conditioned that, you know, that that's that's part of the power of those senses of self, you know, that they just shape our, they shape our choices, they shape our actions, they shape our decisions, they shape what we say, especially when we're not mindful. 
And so, you know, this is why the teaching of mindfulness is so important. 
And yet you've seen it you've seen a little crack there. 
You know, you've seen a little crack you know a little bit of what that experience of that judgment is, you know that experience of that you know, you know, you've seen a little bit of a larger that's kind of in there. 
So you, you, you know, a little bit of that and so that that awareness does begin to develop over time. 
You know, when you're caught in it there's not a lot you can do about it. 
You know, something you could do is reflect back on your day, you know, have a practice at a particular time if there's a particular identity that you're interested in exploring so for myself anger was an identity I was interested in exploring it was the very first practice that I used. 
And just kind of like I set myself a kind of intention. 
I'm going to see if I can know when I'm angry. 
You know, I sometimes would notice sometimes I wouldn't. 
But that intention did help the mind to be able to see that pattern. 
And then you could at the end of a day kind of reflect back. 
So, did that pattern did that judge or come up today let me just think through and not with judging yourself about it but just kind of as a, like, okay, maybe this will help me to be able to see the judge or if I can recognize retrospectively when it came up. 
And so you could just like if it's a pattern you're particularly interested in exploring. 
So at the end of the day, did the judge or come up today. 
Oh yeah, it came up there when I was in the grocery store and I looked at that person and thought that thing. 
Yep, there it was. 
I didn't notice it at the time. 
And to just see if there cannot be judging around that, but but to just let it be something that might support you to. 
See something in retrospect like that. 
You know it's like oh yeah when I was in the grocery store. 
And I just saw what that person was doing I was, I was judging them, and I didn't notice it in retrospect as we can notice that so this is a reflective practice. 
Then it might help us to notice when that kind of pattern might come up in the future, closer to the experience you know more in in real time. 
So those are a few things you can you can explore with those really deep, you know those deep patterns there's we have a lot of them. 
But the sense of unconsciousness that is not any of those aggregates that they meant, I'm sure it's in the mental formation that's like that that goes in judgment is a mental formation. 
Yeah, it goes in there and it just like it's under the radar with 90% of the time for most. 
Yeah, and and it does tend to shape like you see. 
This is how you can tell a mental formation it tends to, to shape how you do things you what you do how you respond how you react how you feel all of those. 
It shapes all of the other aggregates, both internally and externally to the others. 
You project it outwards, you project it outwards to the others as this having the same thing. 
Yep. 
Okay. 
Thank you.
