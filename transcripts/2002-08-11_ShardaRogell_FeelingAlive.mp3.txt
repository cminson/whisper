 This is the first time I've been here. Of course it's a relatively new center, so maybe there are a few teachers who haven't been here yet. How long has the center actually been here now? First of January. First of January. It's amazing. It's just amazing to be here. When I drove up, Gil said there would be the sign. He said, you can't miss it. It's just, you'll say, Insight Meditation Center. And just to drive up and to see that big sign, Insight Meditation Center here in Redwood City, in this big building, it's just so exciting. I'm sure that you all are very, very pleased, particularly those of you who have been part of the Sangha for a long time. I actually came here to speak to the Sangha a number of years ago, maybe six or seven years ago. It was quite a large group of people then. So I have a sense that there's a lot of momentum here in the Sangha to really carry a center like this. It's just so wonderful just to see these centers sprouting up like flowers, you know, all around different parts of the world, really. I was a little tickled because across the street it says there's a building called the Freedom Center. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. Maybe this could have also been called the Freedom Center. You have two Freedom Centers, one over there and one over here, because surely that is what this is. It's a center for freedom, a center for discovering what it means to be free and how to live a conscious and liberated life in this human existence. So I really appreciated that. I'll have to mention that to Gil when I see. Maybe that coincidence has already been noted. How to be free. I came across this quote. I hope I can see it without my glasses. I can't actually, even though it has big letters. By Joseph Campbell. Perhaps you're familiar with Joseph Campbell, one of the great thinkers of our times. I just came across this the other day and he said, people say we are looking for meaning in life. I do not think that is what we are looking for at all. I think what we are really looking for is an experience of being alive. An experience of being alive. I was just really taken when I read that because it's so simple in a way. Just the experience of being alive. Why would he say that? Because clearly we are alive. We are breathing, eating, talking, moving, functioning in our life. But why would he make that so important? All we really want is the experience of being alive. I think that is a really useful question for us to reflect on. I want to weave in that a bit this morning. Because it kind of implies, at least to me, that maybe I am not as alive as I could be. Or maybe we aren't as alive as we could be. There is something there, something that is being pointed to. I was just with a friend the last couple of days who is in the AA program. She has been sober now for over 16 years. But we were talking together about her past. And she said for 14 years, she is only just turning 50. And she said for 14 years, those 14 years are almost a complete flog. She just really doesn't remember anything. She doesn't really know what she was doing. It's just a fog, those 14 years of her life before she got sober. I think that is one level. It is an extreme level. But it is not such an uncommon or unusual level in our world, in our society. That is certainly one level of not being alive. Being that unconscious where we are so disconnected and out of touch with ourselves that we just keep feeding ourselves, doing different behaviors that are going to continue that unconsciousness in our life. And I think we all do that in certain ways, but I think that is really an extreme example. But how do we do this? How do we behave? How are we within ourselves that we are dampening down this aliveness in ourselves? I just taught a loving kindness retreat at Spirit Rock. I just recently moved back here. I was living out of the area for about 15 years. I was living out of the country. I was living in England and traveling quite a lot. And I just moved back here in January actually, just when the center is also beginning. This is where I lived before in the late 70s, 80s. I really feel like this is my home. This is my spiritual home connected with Spirit Rock. And a couple weeks ago I was teaching a loving kindness retreat, the loving kindness retreat that was held there with Sylvia Bornstein and Sally Clough. What a wonderful seven-day loving kindness retreat. And for those of you who may not know, loving kindness is a whole different practice than the Pasanar Insight Meditation, where we actually take phrases, the loving kindness phrases, and repeat them to ourselves as the practice through the day. It's a concentration practice. It's a tranquility practice, a calming practice, in a way of cultivating qualities of heartfulness, qualities of the heart. And it was wonderful. It's wonderful for me to be able to teach these loving kindness retreats and really immerse myself in that practice and to be in a field of a group of people, over a hundred people, who are expressing these wishes for happiness, for well-being, for connection, for harmony, for ending of suffering, both to themselves and to other people all through the day for eight days. And just being in this beautiful, really, it does happen there. We just developed this very beautiful force field of love together. And yet, what I want to mention is that sometimes I have concerns about these kinds of practices, all the spiritual practices, because particularly with Metta loving kindness, which is what I was experiencing a bit on this week retreat, is that it projects, it holds such a beautiful vision, a beautiful aspiration of what's possible for us as human beings. You know, the Metta practice points to the possibility of really touching into boundless experiences of love within ourselves, within a community, within a group of people. But what can happen so easily is that aspiration or that vision becomes so grand or so exalted and maybe even so distant that we may then turn back and look at ourselves and say, oh my God, you know, I have so much work to do. I mean, I don't even know why I could even consider doing loving kindness practice. I mean, look at my mind, look at myself. I'm just a mess, you know, however it is, you know. And I mean, I try to do loving kindness practice and all I do is I just feel angry and I feel hostile and I get spaced out. And why should I even try, you know, or, you know, and it doesn't have to be necessarily with the loving kindness practice. We could do this with our Vipassana practice, with our insight practice, with any spiritual practice or any aspiration that we have. You know, the vision can seem so far away when we look back on ourselves. It can seem almost like there's this great gap or almost an abyss between where I am or who I am and what seems possible on this path. Whether it's, as I said, the loving kindness or whether it's the visions, the expressions of freedom, of enlightenment, of liberation. We look at our experience saying, no way, not me, not in this lifetime, it's not possible. Because we can see that we fall into these very difficult mind states again and again and again. We all do, I do. And depending on how we're holding that, depending on how we're viewing that, it can really be a setup for ourselves to continue to reinforce those negative, destructive, unkind, unloving patterns back to ourselves if we're not seeing those patterns very clearly and holding them with a great deal of love and kindness. We can use those mind states, those experiences that we see in ourselves as way to just judge ourselves and question ourselves and doubt ourselves, criticize ourselves. And then without the understanding, without wisdom, we don't see what we're reinforcing within our own minds. That gap between our present reality and that aspiration for our deepest truth, our deepest wish that we have for ourselves and for all people, all human beings. That gap just can seem so big that we feel like we fall into the hole, the abyss again and again and again. And it can seem so hard sometimes to find our way out of there. So the practices, the practice, the practice, the insight practice, the loving kindness practice, all these practices that we do, they really keep pointing to show us the way to bridge that gap. To find a way that we don't keep falling into what seems like a big hole where we can almost sometimes feel like we're drowning again. We don't feel alive at all. But what bridges that gap so that we don't feel that pain of that dropping in, of that sinking in, is the love, is the kindness, is the generous attitude that we give to ourselves in the moment of seeing our own mind. Just in one moment of seeing something that is hard, that is difficult, that we don't like about ourselves, that we wish wasn't there, we wish we had overcome it, we wish we were done with it. Just the moment of seeing it, being able to bring a moment of kindness, of gentleness. And then in that moment when we do that, when we bring that, then we are reinforcing those patterns of love, those patterns of kindness, the patterns of wisdom, the patterns of openness to ourselves. That becomes the bridge, that's how we can hold our present reality and the aspiration that we have for ourselves on the spiritual path. It's the only way. It's the only way. And then we have to, through the mindfulness, through the insight, we pay attention to the ways that we are undermining ourselves. The ways that we are making ourselves less than and smaller than. And in that moment, that moment that we bring that expression of love, that movement of kindness towards ourselves, we already are awakening. We already are allowing for the contracted energy within ourselves to open and to allow the energy within our beings, within our minds, within our hearts, within our bodies to start moving again. It just comes from that one moment of recognition of bringing that kindness, that heartfulness to ourselves. The longer that I am involved on this path, it's been about 22 years now. This to me, I often see how the teachings just become more and more distilled. In the beginning, they seem so huge and so vast, and how do I make sense of all of this? But for me, it's like it becomes so simple these days. It's really, for me, and I think it does take different forms, different manifestations, different times of our path, of our practice. But for me, it's just that simplicity of noticing the ways that I am undermining my experience. The way, some ways that I am saying that the way I am right now is not okay. And then through that idea, which is just a view, it's just a fixed view or some idea that I'm carrying from some influence from the past, when I see that, when I see that idea that I'm holding and just letting go for one moment, I have to see it and then let go, and then bring that moment of softness, of kindness, of being gentleness to myself. I can just see that shift moment to moment from the contraction to the softening to the opening, and the contraction to the softening. And it doesn't matter what it is. It could be anger, it could be fear, it could be sadness, whatever it is. It doesn't necessarily mean through that movement of the love or the kindness that that fear or the anger or whatever the difficulty is that I'm experiencing in a moment is going to go away. It just means that I'm not contracting more on top of it. I'm not putting more and more layers of negativity, more and more layers of judgment, more and more layers of a confused identity around myself, and just letting myself be. This is so much about letting ourselves be, just being, being. When Joseph Campbell said what was so important to us, he didn't say being a particular kind of person, or having particular kinds of experiences, but simply being alive. Being alive. And being alive means we are going to experience a whole range of feelings, a whole range of mind states, a whole range of physical experiences in our body. And how do we open to all of that and let it be just as it is? Letting it be just as it is means let ourselves be just as we are. I see how often that's where so much of the confusion arises for us, particularly as we start to walk a spiritual path, what we call a spiritual path. We can so easily take up what is then a spiritual identity, you know, how we are supposed to manifest now that we are spiritual beings. You know, we are on this path and we are supposed to act a certain way or show up a certain way, do certain things, you know, and really want, I see sometimes for myself, particularly as I have been doing this a long time, we want people to notice that I have been doing this a long time. You know, like I was just in, I was in Florida a few months ago with visiting my mother and my niece who is 25 just had a baby and she came down from Ohio, which is where I am actually from, with her baby and I went over to join them so I could spend some time with this new baby and my niece who I don't see very much, her husband and my mother. They are really, you know, wonderful, actually quite a good situation. Sometimes it isn't always for people when they go visit their families, but for me it is. And Irene, we spent eight days together in this rather small condominium with this eight month old baby and for those of you who know what that's like, you know, the baby dictates the whole schedule. And I wasn't practicing, you know, I wasn't sitting in the mornings, I wasn't doing yoga, I wasn't listening to Dharma talks, I wasn't reading Dharma books, I wasn't hanging out with my sangha, with my like minded community. I was with these three or four people who knew nothing about Dharma, knew nothing about my spiritual life. My mother has no idea what I've been involved with over these 25 years. Even if she says, what do I tell people that you do? Every time I see her, you know, what do you do? You know, this is like 25 years. And sometimes I would try to, you know, tell her a little bit, maybe guide her a little bit to help her feel her breath or to understand what it is. You know, just can't get it at all, doesn't really understand. So for these eight days, you know, not having any real contact, we'd say direct contact with the activities that one is involved with generally in a spiritual life. And it's always a very interesting situation for me because when I, it was wonderful, we had a really, really good time. And then I came home and I noticed these little thoughts starting to creep up in my mind, it's like, how am I different than they are? You know, she's never practiced meditation, you know, has this really done anything good for me? You know, how did they notice that I'm really this spiritual being, you know, I wonder what I wonder how I was different than them, you know, and it's like interesting kind of thoughts starting to go around, you know, hoping that in some way, this practice, this, you know, this all the hard, hard work I've been involved with over these years has really made a difference in some way. But when I'm in these kinds of situations, where is it? You know, what is it? What is it? What's that quality? What's the fruit, we might say, of the practice? And I think this is where in some ways the, there has to be a very deep faith, a very deep trust in the effort that we're making as we go about through our day. You know, that something is happening. Some things occurring. We may not always be able to know or may not always be able to evaluate. And I don't think we can actually. I think more importantly, and I see this in myself, is I have to pay attention to the ways that I want to be seen a particular way. It doesn't even matter at some level how I show up. I have to have faith in my effort, in my intention, in the way that I'm living my life. And then to pay attention to the way that I want to configure around some spiritual identity so that people are going to notice. You know, almost like wearing a little badge. You know, I've been meditating. You know, I do yoga. You know, or whatever it is, you know, I, you know, I'm a member of the Insight Meditation Center, or whatever it is, you know. Is there a way that we want to prove either to ourselves or to other people who I am, who we are? Because even that movement of mind right there already is setting up a gap. Already sets up a gap between who I am and who I think I should be, or who I would be if I was like that, I would be much better off. I don't know if you hear any sense. Even that, that movement and that one thought already moves us away from ourself. It already starts a movement of disconnection. It already starts a movement of separation, some split within ourselves. And as soon as I let it go, I go, okay, this is who I am. This is who I am. And then come back right into the whole feeling experience of that, just as it is, the whole feeling experience of that. However it's manifesting in boredom, dullness, irritation, sadness, self-pity, irritation, anger, fear, shyness, whatever it is, just that. I come back into the fullness of being. And the more that I can connect with that, the more that I really feel that, you know, the teachings are about feeling the feeling in the feeling as the feeling, not through an idea about it, through a mental projection of it, feeling in the body, in the feeling. The more that I can be fully in that experience, I have come into aliveness. It's not aliveness out of some kind of idea about how it is to be alive. I see so often, you know, because I'm really paying attention to how my ideas keep projecting an image or an identity of who I think I should be or how I think I should be in the world at any particular time or situation, relationship, and then how that takes me off. Takes me away. I'm back into the idea. I'm into the idea. Is being in a mental projection or a mental idea, is that being alive? I'm talking about an idea about ourselves. Sometimes, of course, we have to have ideas about, you know, our plans or our future or how what we're going to do or goals for ourselves, visions for ourselves, just as we do with spiritual aspirations. Of course, the teachings are beautiful. The teachings hold a beautiful, precious model of what's possible for us as enlightened beings. But it's such a paradox because to be truly liberated, to be truly enlightened, is not living out of some mental idea about ourselves, about who we should be. It's coming fully into the beingness of who we are right now. Without that movement away, without that leaning out of this moment into a future idea, holding those future aspirations or thoughts or ideas about what's possible for us as individual human beings and human beings in a collective community, a global community, but then to learn to skillfully understand how we hold those without moving out of this moment, without moving out of this present moment, aliveness here and now. So the future idea is only seen as a future idea. It's seen for what it is, but it doesn't pull us out of where we are. So again and again we rest. It's a resting, a resting. I get this so much now. It's like the breath. The breath is so valuable. The breath is so beautiful because as I breathe in, it brings me back into myself. I breathe in and I can come back into my body, into my experience, into my feelings. Breathe out, breathe in and then breathe out and let go. Let my body relax. Relax the contraction, relax the tightness, relax the tightness in my mind, the way my mind is getting more judgmental or critical. Relax my mind. So breathing in, feeling, experiencing, breathing out, relaxing. Moment to moment to moment. So as we begin, when we begin, I don't know where your practice is at. I'm sure there are some people who are fairly new at it. There are some people who are very, very experienced in here. But what we're, the breath, the whole point of the breath is it brings us back into connection with ourselves wherever we are in our practice. It brings us back into connection. So when I'm sitting and I start to think and I'm starting to generate thoughts of future, then they start to feel anxious. I start to feel anxious. Anxiety starts to build. I start thinking more about something I have to do. More anxiety starts to build. A signal. Let go. Come back into the breath. Breathe, feel the anxiety that's building. Let go of those thoughts that are bringing anxiety. Breathe out, relax the contraction. Are the thoughts useful? Are these thoughts helping? Or am I just creating more anxiety for myself out of some future rising thoughts that are based on some kind of past experience that's finished, that's gone, that's not even happening now? Resting back in. Resting back in. Coming back into just this simple beingness however it is. And it means not having to get rid of any kind of experience that's happening. I love that about this practice. It means I don't have to be any other way than the way I am. And that affirmation, the affirmation of that again and again and again just be who you are as you are. Resting back into that again and again and again. That is, that's where the teachings are pointing. That's liberation. Liberation. Being liberated from our views. Being liberated from our ideas. Being liberated from our false, the false, the misunderstanding. Our false beliefs and ideas about who I am, who you are, who we are together. And as I allow more and more sense of beingness within myself, of course I'm allowing that for others as well. I'm watching the same kind of patterning of the ways I judge or criticize myself, doubt, undermine myself. And the way that that gets projected right out to another person. Well she shouldn't be dressed like that. She shouldn't be saying things like that. He shouldn't be acting like that. And the whole set of standards that gets created for how others should be in this world. The whole, the seed, the whole seed bed for conflict, separation and war, destruction in this world that we live in. Right there. Right there, those seeds. One seed of aggression towards myself or towards another. Gives rise to the whole conflict that we live, that we're living in within this world. This practice is so important in that respect. I thought that, it's so interesting, I thought that judgment was something that I was finished with. I thought, oh yeah, I really got my handle on judgment. You know, after 10 years or 12 years of practice, I really see now how judgments arise in my mind and I can catch them. I don't believe in them. I don't identify them and I'm not a judgmental person. Done with that one. You know, I just want to say that any time you think that you're finished with something, be careful. I can remember years of that eagerness, oh yeah, now I'm finished with that one. I don't get angry anymore or I don't judge anymore or I don't, whatever it is. I'm sure you could think of a hundred things. And then a year later, or it doesn't even be a year, six months later, there it is again. Right back into having difficulties with, oh yeah, another one. I don't have any enemies in this world. I've finished all my difficult relationships. I know how to have beneficial and healthy relationships now with people. Who knows? When the next one's going to arise. And so for me in my practice, there's a whole another layer of judgment that's arising that I just didn't know was there. And it's very much, it's forming very much around a spiritual identity. You know, ways that I have created a certain identity for myself that I didn't even know I was doing. And then subtle ways, subtle standards that I have created that then I judge myself against or compare myself against or say, oh yeah, you're not doing that right or you should be doing this or that, you know, just that a standard of behavior that's so easily get set up. And because our, our self, myself is so familiar to myself, there's so much that I don't see because it's just familiar. I just, you know, I just take myself for granted. Do you take yourself for granted? You know, so there's just so much that doesn't even get seen. Until we really start to put that light of awareness on every moment of our thoughts, of our feelings, our bodies, our speech, our actions. What are we doing? How are we manifesting? How are we showing up? There is so much delusion. There's so much delusion is the, is means there's so much hidden from our consciousness. There's so much we're not able to see. Even at very high stages of, of, of, of development, of liberation, of having many, many liberating insights. There's so much that goes, it's under the layer of consciousness. And so for myself, I feel even more sense of urgency as I see, you know, as the light of awareness gets stronger, as it gets brighter, as I see so much more and I go, oh my gosh, I didn't know I was still doing that. I didn't know I was living in so much confusion and so much dysfunction in maybe in a particular relationship or whatever. It's like, oh my gosh. And then that helps me wake up. I can't go to sleep. I can't just kind of rest on my laurels on what I've already done. There's a lot that has to be done here to really come to a place of knowing my full potential as a human being in this life, a free and alive and conscious human being to know what's really possible for me. To live with the really, with a real awakened heart. One of my favorite quotations, I've been doing some work with in the Diamond Heart and the Ridwan program. Maybe some of you are familiar with A. H. Almas, the man who's been, he's in this area and doing wonderful work over the last 25 years integrating the Western psychological traditions with the Eastern philosophical traditions. One of my other favorite quotes, Hamid says, realization is to be without anxiety about non perfection. We could take that home with us. Realization is to be without anxiety about non perfection. It's realizing that right now I am already the best I can be. Right now I am the best I can be. And to celebrate that, celebrate that, I am the best I can be. And it may not be perfect according to what we know is possible as human beings, but there is no anxiety about that non perfection. Isn't that, I just, that, that, that the sense of that, because suffering, when we talk about the end of suffering, it's the end of anxiety, really. It's the end of inner distress. It's the end of anxiety. So if what we're, what we're looking at is how to come to the end of anxiety. That it really does point to that allowance, that radical, radical allowance of who I am right now and therefore allowing others to be who they are right now. What a beautiful and wonderful gift we can give to ourselves and give to others around us. And in these teachings, even though they are so simple and we hear them again and again, they are radical. They're radical. And we know that all we have to do is look at this world. And now we don't have to go very far to look at the world, the global world, the global situation. And we can see and feel and know in our heart how radical these teachings are to be able to really live in this way. Where we're looking vigilantly at our own minds, the ways that we are causing havoc within our own mind and our own heart. And the possibility, the potential for real freedom and liberation from that inner confusion. So just as we'll end, it's almost a quarter till and I was told that it's probably a good idea to end about a quarter to 11. Gil said a number of times, he said, you can talk longer, but probably people will start walking out. I think he said that to me three times to make sure that I would get it. So don't take it personally. So maybe just for one minute, let's just sit together and take in that allowance of letting yourself be. Coming fully into beingness. Coming fully into beingness and perhaps feeling. Can you feel the aliveness of your being? Being fully awake, fully connected to whatever is present. And sinking into this beingness. Without leaning forward into the next moment. Without sinking back, leaning back to how it was or how it's been. Just this. Feeling the perfection in the non-perfection. So that the ideas of perfection and non-perfection drop away. No more duality. Just this. May you all be happy and well and I do hope that I can come and visit again sometime. It's very lovely to spend the morning with you. Have a great day and for those of you going on the hike, have a great hike. Thank you.
