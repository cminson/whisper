So good morning.
Happy to be here with you and one of the characteristics of meditation
is feeling or experience or a sense of safety.
In fact, there's a word that has double meaning in Pali.
It means both safety and peace.
And so to find our peace or calm because it's the safe place to be.
It isn't that not being calm means that our mind is activated in such a way that we are agitating ourselves.
And when we're agitated, we're not safe for ourselves.
And the way that the incessant chatter in the mind, preoccupation in the mind is agitating,
to that degree we're not creating a safe environment for our minds and our hearts to sit here.
So I know this is difficult, not an easy thing, but to become calm, to become.
But perhaps appreciating the value of being calm, the safety that's in calm, in peace, in being settled, in relaxing deeply.
So to begin by assuming a careful meditation posture, a caring meditation posture.
And lowering your gaze so the eyes can relax.
Then closing your eyelids so your eyelids can relax.
And then with the exhale, just as you are, relaxing the body.
There is part of the art of relaxing the body. Sometimes there's a way in which relaxing parts of the body allow the body to straighten out.
It's straighter.
And then gently, as if you have all the time in the world, gently and comfortably, take a few deep breaths, three quarters full.
Breathing in deeply and having a long exhale.
A long exhale in which you relax your body.
And letting the breathing return to normal. And scanning through your body.
Maybe on the inhale, scanning your body for places of holding and tension. And on the exhale, softening that area.
Okay.
Okay.
And then sitting here quietly, relaxing the mind, relaxing the thinking muscle.
Letting your thinking become a little slower, quieter.
So there's more room to experience breathing.
Okay.
And then looking within to find a place, maybe in your body, maybe in your mind, maybe in your heart, where there is calmness, where things are somewhat peaceful.
And it might be a relative calmness, where things are calmer within compared to the rest of you.
And breathe with that calmness.
Or let your awareness, no breathing through that calmness.
Noticing how when there's some calmness, there's also stillness, a soft stillness.
And when there's agitation, there's movement.
And for these minutes of the meditation, trust the calm place within.
Trust that because for now, this is the safe place. There's safety in the calmness within.
Safety in the stillness within.
Okay.
And when you wonder off in thought, and you notice your thinking, allow your thinking mind to land back into the calmness, calmness, calmly breathing in and breathing out.
Okay.

Where is the place within? Were you safe from yourself?
Safe from the agitation of fear and desire and ill will.
Is there a place of calmness, peace within that can guide you?
God, you're breathing to an inner safety and well-being.
