 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Allowing yourself to connect with just how you are in this moment, just beginning with where you are, letting yourself just be into a tune to the body, the mind, and exploring a kind of a receptive and allowing attitude for awareness. Just to be curious, curious with what's happening. As you connect with how you are, just beginning by just kind of taking inventory after a day, how has the day landed, where is this mind and body right now? First of all, by starting, taking that in. And then it can be helpful, having seen how you are, to incline towards open to the possibility of relaxation. You can do this in a conscious way by just kind of connecting with areas of the body where you may notice tension. The inventory of how you are might have pointed some of that out. And seeing if there can be a softening, a conscious release or relaxation in areas where you may be holding tension. The body that's often in the face, across the forehead, the neck and shoulders, maybe there can be a softening in the face, neck and shoulders. Chest and upper back also sometimes, holding tension, so maybe there can be a softening there. Across the abdomen, the stomach, maybe that can soften. Hips, legs, feet, maybe the arms and hands too can soften. This physical relaxation, relaxing the body, is a very supportive condition that allows, supports the mind to be able to relax. So sometimes we can start with just consciously relaxing the body and often when I do this, it's like I didn't, I didn't really, I mean I knew there maybe was some tension but as I relax it's, it's like oh there's tension being released that I wasn't aware was there. Some of the deeper tensions can be released as we incline towards relaxation. And that can support our mind to also settle in, relax. Mental tension often expressed with thoughts, worries, concerns about the past or the future or even about the present. So can that mental tension maybe soften? We often have the sense of our mind being in our head and so sometimes a sense of, Gil sometimes suggests maybe the brain can relax, kind of as an analogy for relaxing the mind. Sometimes there can be a sense of relaxation in the middle of the head that can take us or point to a relaxation of mind. Sometimes it depends on what's happening. Sometimes this relaxation can be just a little scan at the beginning of a period of practice and then we turn our attention to awareness being aware of what's here. But sometimes depending on if there's a lot of tension in the body and mind, sometimes I find just that practice can be immensely helpful. I've spent whole sittings at times just remembering relaxation and that relaxation supports kind of natural awareness to be available because as the body and mind relax, awareness very naturally is available. And so at times you're welcome to just continue with relaxation if you find that supportive. And you're also welcome to let go of that kind of conscious checking into relaxation and again see what's here. What sensations are happening easily available to be known often body sensations are pretty obvious. Sometimes checking in and it's not so much in the way I'm guiding this evening it's not so much about looking at but more being with receiving what's obvious. Often body sensations are pretty obvious so relax and maybe the attention is drawn to particular area of the body. Maybe it shifts from one area of the body to another. Maybe it's drawn to sound another field of bodily experience. There can be a shifting, not of our doing, but a very natural shifting process of one sensation and then another sensation. The relaxation of mind can support just receiving these shifting sensations. Sometimes the shifting experience will also take in emotions or moods or thoughts that come by. That's fine. A form of receptive awareness practice that can just allow the landscape of experience to change. No needing to hold on to anyone sensation or experience. Just aware. Minds do this quite naturally but we forget sometimes how to do it and think we need to be in charge of directing the attention. So exploring perhaps just relaxing and seeing what's the next thing. Letting experience show up. Come to us. Sometimes Gil uses that language but experience come to you. You don't have to go looking for it. Our bodies and minds do a really good job of meeting experience without our being in the middle of it. So resting, receiving sensations of body, of mind, hearing. And the mind will wander. That will happen. At some point, there will be the recognition that mindfulness has returned. That moment of mindfulness returning, a beautiful, effortless moment of awareness. First thing to explore there is just knowing, recognizing, oh, awareness is back. Receiving again. No need to pick up something. That awareness that returns is already aware of something. So just knowing aware again. And let what is obvious come to you. Sometimes after the mind has wandered in thought, it can also be useful to recognize or acknowledge. It depends on how long the mind has been wandering and what it wandered to. But pretty frequently when the mind wanders, it wanders into something that it's kind of engaged with. And that engagement, that very engagement, may tend to alter our inner landscape. And so a useful kind of question upon returning, if we've seen that there's been some thinking, is, okay, the awareness is back. And what is here now, given the condition that the mind was thinking a few moments ago? It's kind of like taking in what has been the effect of the mind having been wandering on this present moment's experience. It's really entering into this experience now as the mind comes back from wandering. And then just explore opening to that, explore opening to what's here. Relax and receive experience. At times, for some of us at various times, it can be helpful if the mind is wandering out a lot, is not very stable in mindfulness. It can be helpful to pick an object, the breath, particular body sensation, something fairly simple to connect with, sound perhaps. And let the attention rest there for a little while, remembering what it's like to be mindful. And then you don't have to hold too tightly to that. As you're with that experience, very naturally, other experience may become known. So maybe you're with the breath for a few moments, a few breaths. And then there's hearing and body sensation. And there can be a kind of expanding from the breath to include other experience. You don't necessarily need to let go of the breath, but you also don't have to reject other experience. There's the breath and hearing and breath and a thought and breath and body sensation. And exploring, receiving. Even if you're choosing to be with the breath, perhaps you can receive the breath. Let the breath come to you, rather than diving in and trying to pull it apart and see lots of detail. What's obvious about the breath? What's obvious about the sound or a body sensation? Let what's obvious be revealed rather than having an agenda to see something in a particular way. Relax. Beware and receiving each moment.
