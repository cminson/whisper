 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Connecting with your experience in a simple way, perhaps at the beginning, can be useful to start in a really simple way, rather than trying to focus on something closely, just taking in that you are sitting, or whatever posture you're in. Arriving with yourself here in this space, in this time. To me, it kind of can feel like a gathering of awareness with the experience in the body, but also in the context, sitting with this group in your, wherever you are, in your home or another place, and receiving how you are in this experience, just the experience of how you are, not thinking about it. What is the body like in this moment? Again, in a kind of a more broad way. Is there tension or ease in the body? And how about the mind? Is the mind here, connected, or a little bit scattered, jumping around, a little bit sleepy, perhaps? However you are, it's possible to be aware that you are the way you are. Oh, right now I'm sleepy, right now I'm scattered, right now I'm at ease or relaxed. The experience or the practice of mindfulness can be a simple receptivity of how you are in this moment, the experience of how you are in this moment. And receiving how it changes from moment to moment. Not landing and trying to hold on to anything in particular, but exploring the possibility of connecting with, maybe we could think of a stream of experience, streams of different body sensations happening, the sound changing moment to moment, the sound of my voice coming and going, emotions, states of mind perhaps coming in and staying for a while, fading, thoughts flitting through. Sometimes we can explore mindfulness as a settling back and simply being available to know what's happening, this stream of human experience, even sitting in stillness. There's a lot of dynamic experience. Perhaps you can touch in with the body. There are the more sort of stable experiences of the stillness of the body, the contact points of pressure, hardness, softness. And then there's the breath, which continually flows. Perhaps the sense of that flowing experience of breathing in and breathing out within a container of stillness. And then perhaps to with the breath or around the breath, there may be a sense of something like energy in the body, a pulsing or vibration also quite dynamic. Available to receive this experience of the moment. The attention may be drawn to other experience, also a way that we can notice how experience changes attention for a while with one thing and then a change of attention to something else. Maybe with the breath for a few moments and then with hearing or a thought or emotion, a mood. As long as you are aware of this shift of attention, knowing that now the attention is observing or connecting with this. It doesn't matter that the attention is shifted. What matters is that we are aware of what is here, not lost in thought, but aware. Thank you. Connected to this stream of experience. When Buddha offered an image for how to be with experience. He said that in crossing the river, the flood of experience, he crossed it by neither tearing nor hurrying. This is a beautiful image for how to meet experience moment to moment. Meeting, being with, connecting, not hurrying past experience, but also not stuck, not staying, not tearing with anything in particular. Allowing the awareness to continually receive. Change moment.
