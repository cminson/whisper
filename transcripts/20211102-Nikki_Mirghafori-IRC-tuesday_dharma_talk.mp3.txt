 Greetings everyone. It's Tuesday. For some that can be just a statement. It's Tuesday. You can also feel like, oh it's only Tuesday. We're like, oh my goodness, it's already Tuesday. The mind can make so much from something that's maybe just is. It's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. So hello, it's Tuesday. So besides telling you the date and perhaps in a way with a light-hearted way bringing awareness to the attitudes of the mind. Before I begin, I would like to introduce a very special being whom we've been actually sitting with this entire retreat. But I'd like to introduce her. We've been sitting with her actually. She's sitting on the altar at IRC. Zoomed out, can't quite see but she's been keeping our company. We've been keeping her company and I also, if you notice, I've changed my virtual background so that now she's sitting behind me also. So I'd like to introduce Patacara who has been residing in the main hall at IRC. And just to say a few words, some of you might have heard the story of Patacara. Online we had a ceremony last year sometime welcoming her, this beautiful statue of Patacara into IMC and then into IRC where she is now residing. So Patacara was one of the foremost disciples of the Buddha and she was awakened. She was a human being. She's another beautiful, inspiring, aspiring aspect about her and she had a very difficult story which I won't tell you the entire story but having born into wealth, she lost her spouse, both of her children and her entire family in one day and went crazy. The story goes that the grief was so, the suffering, the grief was so intense that she lost her mind due to grief and went to the Buddha and the Buddha shared teachings with her and the story goes that the Buddha taught about impermanence and she understood it. And I have to guess perhaps that the Buddha also talked about dukkha, suffering and she definitely understood that and then she woke up and became a nun as she is here in the nun robes and became one of the foremost disciples of the Buddha. So we're happy to have her being, her likeness, sit with her day and night as we sit. There she is. I don't know if my image is a spotlight or if the IRC meditation hall in fact, let's see if I can still spotlight the meditation hall if it isn't. There, there is Bhattacharya. You can see her, there is the statue sitting up there. So, now let's see if I can remove the spotlight. There, oh there, thank you. So, so the story of Bhattacharya and introducing her today seems quite appropriate in so many ways. One is that often the second day of the retreat we think of it as the swamps or the days that there is enough mindfulness, enough awareness and perhaps enough dukkha from before coming on retreat and everything that they kind of meet each other. Just the level of awareness and the dukkha is like, oh dukkha feels a little heavy perhaps or the hindrances as we call it. The hindrances might feel kind of heavy on the second day. And also as we have laid out and you've seen the themes of the retreat, the three dimensions, the three by three matrix that you have seen. So, yesterday Gil spoke about stability which later on the retreat we'll talk about the insight supports the insight of impermanence Anicca and today and as well as the quality, the hard quality of care that he spoke about. And today corresponding to the second of the three insights, the second insight being this insight into what's called dukkha translated as suffering or stress, unsatisfactoriness. There's so many different nuances of it that we encounter in our lives. Corresponding to that second insight which we will get to in the second part of the retreat, second half of the retreat, corresponding to that insight cultivating the quality of actually sukha. Dukkha, sukha. Sukha is this can be translated as bliss, as well-being. So there's a sense of yes whatever dukkha is, they're challenging on stressful qualities. Sukha is their sense of goodness, sense of contentment, sense of well-being that can support us to meet, to meet and to have an insight into dukkha, stress, unsatisfactoriness. So today's talk, that's by way of introducing the topic for today, or this talk which is well-being, cultivating well-being. Also the hard quality that I'd like to bring in today is compassion. So well-being and compassion in this part to support us later as we lean more into and allow, open up to, oh it's okay. Seeing, making space for unsatisfactoriness. It's just like this, it's just like this. So and to say that all of these themes are connected in so many ways, often when I speak or study or experience the dharma to me it feels like it's a cloth and as you take a thread of the cloth and pull on the thread and explore one thread, it feels like the whole cloth of the dharma is one thread. So as I talk about well-being and various aspects of it, you know, faith, confidence comes in, you know, it's part of what tomorrow's theme is. Stability of course is a part of a sense of well-being so all of these are connected, they're all connected and you can enter, you can take any part of the thread and pull and so today the part of the thread that we'll be pulling or entering into this exploration is well-being and compassion. So, so with that I'd like to say a few words about this concept of well-being. It can be defined in so many ways, it can be defined in so many ways and as I was considering the talk today I actually found a paper in my Google Drive from some time ago which was a paper on comparing the Western and Eastern concepts of happiness and well-being and from the different traditions. So I was inspired to bring a couple of those ideas which I think are interesting. So in this tradition, the Buddhist tradition, Eastern tradition, the idea of well-being, happiness, it's not based on hedonic contentment, it's not based on consumption. In fact, as many of us already know experientially, hedonic consumption doesn't lead to lasting happiness, doesn't lead to lasting well-being, temporary well-being. And in fact one can experience the concept that psychologists call hedonic treadmill, that the baseline what was enough before, close the car, whatever, whatever seems satisfactory, then it loses its luster, it's not enough, you're on the treadmill then now you need more. There seems to be more to bring that sense of happiness or contentment based on things. Whereas the concept here of the sense of well-being is one that's fed from sense of contentment within, the sense of ahh as if there is a spring, there is a spring that is inside us, there is a well-spring, there's a well-spring of contentment, there's a well-spring of happiness, there's a well-spring of ease that's inside us, that is independent of what is outside. So there is a sense of well-being inside which is independent of what is happening outside. And in some ways this sense of well-being both supports awakening, liberation, and there's an outcome of awakening, liberation. I mean not to think about oh yeah this doesn't relate to me until I'm completely awakened, no thinking of awakening or freedom, all freedom as an iterative, as an iterative we have a little more freedom, a little more well-being, well-being that's independent of external conditions, well-being that's independent of external conditions, then we have more freedom, we have more freedom, we have more well-being that's independent of external conditions. A virtuous cycle, we are all familiar with vicious cycles, we've been in vicious cycles of the mind, anyone not experienced vicious cycles of the mind? And this is a virtuous cycle of the mind, a virtuous cycle of mind and heart and body, a virtuous cycle. More well-being, more freedom, and all the other qualities too, virtuous cycles. And the sense of well-being when actually cultivated and as the first step of the cultivation I'd like to invite you to consider that yes it is possible for me, it is possible for me. She is not talking about something that's just reserved for special people after decades of practice, this is possible for me. Not just that it's possible for me but actually I'd like to invite you to consider times in your life when this has been true. There have been moments in life that I'm willing to bet every single one of us human beings, every single one of us. Every single one of us has experienced well-being, it's just a sense of goodness, well-being. Maybe you wake up in the morning like oh yeah there's a sense of well-being even though things haven't changed since yesterday and maybe yesterday you're worried about this and that and the other but there's a wellspring, it's like yeah there's a gladness, there's a contentment, there's a sense of well-being inside that's independent of external circumstances, there's a well-being inside. And I'd like to talk of course more about how to to feed that, how to bring that out more so that it's not just a happy accident that has happened here and there but actually really cultivate it, cultivate it, not just cultivate it but also see it as an important part of the path, as a crucial part of this path. So sometimes perhaps when we practice whether you're new to this Buddhist path or you've been practicing for a long time, sometimes especially from the outside of the senses oh it's all about dukkha, it's all about suffering and it's about concentration and working hard so that I stabilize my awareness on my breath, my body okay I've got it, I've got it, I've got it okay it's gone oh my goodness bad meditator, bad meditator okay let me try again all right bring it back, bring it back, I've got it, I've got it in breath, out breath, in breath, oh lunch, bad meditator, like gosh it seems like hard work sometimes. Now what if, what if you really believed and you really saw that as a part of the path of practice cultivating contentment, cultivating joy, cultivating well-being, gladness, these are important, these are paramount, really paramount to awakening, they're not just luxuries, they're not just like yeah it would be nice to have that but actually this is how the path of freedom unfolds and as you've been listening to Gil and myself, you know we've been talking about relax your body, relax, receive right, relax, receive oh and as Gil was talking about this morning oh notice the the delight, the the joy, the the goodness oh yes and your day and your practice yes we've been we've been inviting you, we've been inviting you because this is what what's important and it's really important part of practice and I have to say as a beginner practitioner decades ago myself it took me a while to really hear this and get the sense of how important cultivating a sense of well-being is in the practice. So next I'd like to share a couple of suttas briefly that really lay out that these these beautiful qualities are part of liberation, they're not accidental really, liberation the road goes through these beautiful qualities these beautiful qualities of well-being and then I want to say a little more about their cultivation before turning to compassion that's what's coming up in terms of a bit of an agenda orienting so there are the teachings on the liberative dependent arising Upanisa sutta, liberative depending dependent arising and there's also another sutta called Kamitiya sutta what purpose and both of these suttas and I trust it shows in some other suttas this structure that I'm about to lay out for you so the structure that shows up in these suttas it starts from so in the Upanisa sutta it starts from dukkha opening to dukkha suffering unsatisfactoriness can lead to sadha, sadha confidence a sense of trust in the practice and then that leads to leads to parmujha which is could be translated as delight and so let's think about how to lay this out so the similarity so maybe this is the way I'll say it okay let me take a step back for a moment so these two suttas they they're a set of chains through chains of this leads to this this leads to this this leads to this so both of these suttas have this you know a one leads to you know a leads to b b leads to c etc etc okay and what they end up in the destination what of both of these suttas when you know this leads to that this leads to this this leads to this they lead to the to awakening the last stop of all the chains that these two suttas discuss leads to awakening okay one of them starts with with suffering with with with contemplating opening up to the truth of unsatisfactoriness and leading to trust leading to parmujha delight leading to joy leading to passadi tranquility leading to sukha pleasure leading to samadhi concentration leading to knowledge and vision of things as they are leading to disenchantment dispassion leading to the vision knowledge and vision of things as they are and liberation so that that's kind of the chain the the other sutta starts with starting from sila wholesome virtuous behavior what is the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior it leads to non-regret which is also taught as the bliss of blamelessness because when you when all of us behave in a way that we don't regret later we we uphold our sila we don't kill and harm and steal and or use unwise speech there is no regret so wholesome virtuous behavior and and this isn't the kirma tiyasutta wholesome virtuous behavior leads to non-regret this bliss of blamelessness and that non-regret then in the sutta leads to parmujha to delight parmujha leads to piti to joy rapture piti rapture joy leads to tranquility passadi in pali tranquility leads to sukka pleasure or bliss another translation bliss leads to samadhi or concentration concentration leads to insight etc etc it's the same chain that i just talked about so what i wanted to point out is you notice that the path is going through these beautiful qualities it's not going through hard work furrowed brow it's not going through criticize yourself really whip yourself into shape you bad yogi right it doesn't go through any of those it's going through the path is going through parmujha delight it's going through joy piti going through tranquility passadi pleasure or bliss sukka going through and then leading through concentration samadhi and then the insights unfold so that's the really that's the point i want to make and bringing in multiple suttas here i realize might have been a little confusing for those who are not familiar with this structure here but the point here let me just step back for a moment the point really here is to invite you to really hear how important how important cultivating well-being these qualities of well-being turning your heart your mind to goodness to joy to gladness how important these are on the path that's the point i'm trying to make and if what i just said in the past few minutes saw all these changes like well i didn't i didn't get to write it all down it doesn't matter just it's cultivating these qualities supports our heart supports our minds to be able to hold to be able to open up to insights because when the heart when the mind are fed from the spring of well-being inside then there is capacity for stability for insight it's like imagine when you're young or even now when you're fascinated by something think of something that you love to study or do a hobby that you're just fascinated by maybe it's gardening maybe you know whatever it is you can do it for hours there's a sense of well-being there's a sense of delight there's a sense of yes engagement energy there's a sense of well-being right and now think of if when you force yourself to sit down and do your taxes it's a different heart quality there's sense of forcing i must do this it's good for me i must do this it's good for me so my hope is that you're convinced at least a little bit that there is you know it's not just soft it's not just these soft qualities that oh yeah it's yeah it's yeah it's good to cultivate well-being yeah yeah yeah but i'm really after awakening that's what i'm really after you know well-being is for you know lesser mortals i'm after awakening yes and well-being is going to support you towards awakening liberation freedom in this very life to the level that there can be well-being even if there is no well-being externally so maybe i'll share a personal anecdote um now having in many of you i've shared in in um in dharma talks before that no i i work with a chronic illness and i worked with it for many years and um um it's been my biggest teacher in ways that it's taught me so much that well-being does not need to depend on external what's happening externally it doesn't even need to depend on what's happening in my body and often it's happened a friend say how are you i say well there is well-being even though there is no well-being and my friends tend to get that that yeah there is a well-being i'm well even though i'm not well you know there's pain and inflammation and just like and yet it can hold the well-being the mind can be at peace can be at rest with what is going on and of course to say that there could be times that yes the the balance the stability of the mind could be overpowered by so much that's happening and that balance might go away and then it's okay begin again begin again i begin again it's not that yeah i'm a failure as a yogi i'm a failure as a teacher my balance is gone it happens it's okay it's a part of this practice begin again begin again every moment a new beginning every moment in the beginning can there be well-being in this moment even if there is no well-being in my body there is pain in my heart there is pain um things are not going well externally but can there still be a sense of well-being can there still be a sense of well-being and this and the more we experience these moments when there is well-being even if there is no well-being internally or externally the more we we have confidence the more it grows the more it grows um there's more i can say about this but i think it might be time for me to to to bring in the hard quality that i really want to talk about today which is compassion which relates to well-being which relates to well-being so let's bring compassion in as a way to support well-being how can compassion support well-being how can well-being support compassion so first and foremost what is compassion what is compassion the word in Pali associated with the translation of the word compassion is Karuna Karuna and it is um in the Brahma viharas in the practices in the four practices of the heart heaven your bones which are meta first one being meta loving kindness Karuna compassion is the second one the third one is mudita vicarious joy happiness for happiness of others the fourth one equanimity so meta loving kindness which we'll talk about i guess throughout the retreat but also tomorrow and compassion they're closely related closely related but they're not the same and compassion is also not the same as empathy so let me bring these terms in and now what is the difference so we can think of compassion as the love child of metta loving kindness and suffering that's one poetic way to put it okay what do i mean by that so basically when metta kindness good will friendliness may you be well may i be well just a sense of care sense of love sense of goodwill let's let's keep it very simple sense of goodwill meets suffering meet someone and that someone could be myself it could be someone externally when goodwill meets suffering it gets expressed as compassion so kindness goodwill that holds suffering equals compassion or in other words those who like formulas meta plus dukkha equals karuna loving kindness plus suffering equals compassion so in other words compassion is meeting pain with kindness meeting pain with kindness i'm giving so many different ways of approaching this definition because different minds work differently so so empathy alone is not compassion empathy alone is to feel with in some ways if we use the model of neurobiological hypotheses of say mirror neurons when you feel someone someone else's pain and there's studies where when you see someone else for example you see an image of a say hand being poked with a needle ouch you feel pain there are areas in your brain this pain centers in your brain in your body that light up so that's empathy when you feel somebody else's pain ouch ouch oh ouch okay now if you bring care to that oh oh you're hurting may you feel may you be free from this pain then that is compassion so feeling the pain alone is not compassion it's just empathy so many times when people say oh gosh i can't do compassion it's just too painful they're actually talking about empathic distress because they're falling into empathetic distress like they're feeling somebody else's pain so much that they're hurting and it's just like oh my goodness this is like wow i can't be in this whereas compassion actually feels good compassion is soothing healing is there's a sense of well-being when we practice compassion because that sense of care love is holding the pain whether it's our pain or somebody else's pain so again using the neurobiological model for a moment and by no means do i want to reduce the totality of our being our our compassionate way of being in the world to just the life you know how our brains light up not for a moment do i want to do that to reduce it and yet i'm using this this examples as a way to to highlight or or get a point across that may be otherwise i find it more difficult to get across so forgive me as i'll bring the or or bear with me as i bring the neurobiological example in so the story i heard from tanya singer at some point who's a well-known a researcher is she was studying um mattie recard a well-known monk um and mattie recard uh was study what areas of his brain would light up so at first tanya asks matthew to just do empathy just you know he was shown photos of suffering um images of suffering uh in the fMRI machine so he's doing he's just like empathizing empathizing empathizing so yes particular area of the brain lights up which has to do with pain with so when you see somebody else's pain again it's the empathetic areas of pain that light up so you literally and figuratively figuratively feeling somebody else's pain so then um they bring him they bring mattie recard out of the fMRI and say okay we're done and says no can you please put me back so that i can do the full compassion meditation i feel terrible i'm in pain so okay they they put him back in the fMRI machine now he does the full uh compassion meditation but again with these images but now not just empathizing with the pain but also bringing care bringing care bringing metta to it um and and of course two different areas of the brain light up one is the previous one the areas associated with this area is associated with uh with warmth with filial with filiality with nurturing with you know the feelings that we have when we give care to someone or we receive care uh from loved ones which feel good you know when you're with someone you love doesn't it feel lovely so those areas light okay so all right after a period they bring him out okay there's a sense of goodness gladness happiness well-being that he has and not just for him but i use this example because it really highlights what compassion actually is especially as we go through a retreat for ourselves so much to come might come up so much difficulty how do we hold it do we hold it by falling into it by just oh poor me this is painful or do we also bring in care oh sweetheart ouch this is hard this is hard sweetie this is hard so in terms of practical instructions or practical invitations for how to work with it after now having all these theoretical presentations the practical invitation is this recognize pain number one recognize when you are in pain recognize and instead of self-flagellating bad yogi bad you're terrible or oh that that whatever that grief oh you should be over it by now or whatever all these very very painful narratives that we have about our own pain first of all recognize that i am hurting right now i am hurting right now and i can't tell you again with my own chronic illness especially the first years how many times i didn't even recognize i was hurting it would be like gosh you have so much work to do and you're just tired you fatigue like get up like answer the email it's like oh sweetheart gosh you are sick you need to stay in bed i couldn't even recognize that at first that i was pushing myself because my mind was so used to like okay come on let's let's get with it it's like oh sweetheart you're hurting right now you're not well it's okay sweetie it's okay it's all right woof so that first step of recognizing i am hurting right now oh sweetheart sweetheart this is hard this is hard and it could just be saying this the phrase oh sweetheart this is hard or whatever your version of that is or just saying ouch ouch this hurts this hurts that can be an expression of compassion simply that simply that oh sweetheart oh sweetie this is hard it's okay it's okay i'm here for you it's okay yes and it's okay to hurt it is okay you're not pushing the pain away you're holding acknowledging the suffering and making space for it making space for it with metta with care holding it with care and if it needs time if it's physical pain emotional pain if it needs to be here if it's grief it needs to be here give it space trust the wisdom trust what it needs to show you as it opens up as it opens up and trust that there is a sense of well-being in compassion actually compassion meditation or compassion bringing compassion feels good is a source of good is a source of well-being so all the brahma viharas metta is a source of well-being compassion is a source of well-being that's why they're called heavenly abodes it's like there's if you feel like you're in heavenly abodes right it feels good there's a place of well-being so please know that there are so many chambers in your heart and mind so many chambers there are palaces of well-being in your heart and mind every single one of us has a palace of well-being and we can choose to hang out in the dungeons of self-flagellation etc or we can make our way make our way into the mansion of well-being through care through stability through brahma viharas through noticing joy goodness gladness wherever it shows up in our heart in our mind in our practice with gratitude and also this as i brought in earlier bliss of blamelessness when nothing else comes to mind think ah today i haven't killed i haven't taken what has not been offered you know go through the five um the precepts yes yes and see the goodness with it really see the goodness with it see the goodness that is here see your own goodness as a springboard for well-being there are so many paths to the temple of well-being internal well-being explore them explore them be creative be creative there's so many ways internal well-being ah may you all be well may we all be well may we meet whatever challenges show up with care with compassion for ourselves and others thank you for your kind attention
