Dharmette: Contentment and 
Discontent  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

This morning I want to talk  about contentment  and also 
about discontent .  
 
There wa s a famous Zen teacher in San Francisco 
named Suzuki Roshi , who once defined Buddhism with 
three words:  “Not always so.”  I think i t’s a great 
expression: “It’s not always so.”  So whatever you think, 
that this is the way it is, it’s not always so. You can find 
some freedom in that. You don’t latch on, or hold on,  or 
resist in some dramatic way that  this is it. Not always 
so. 
 
Many times , people easily  fall into the idea  that this is 
how it is. If we talk a bout ideals  like contentment, we 
think,  “Oh, this is how it is.”  You’re supposed to be 
content. But w ith many things in life, there can be 
situations where two different qualities co -exist in us. It’s 
not a matter of only being content;  maybe it’s a healthy 
balance between being content and discontent. There 
can be a reas where we’re content and areas where we 
can be  discontent  in a healthy way .  
There’s a  great line in the poetry of T. S. Eliot  where he 
says, “ Teach us to care and not to care.”  I think  it’s a 
beautiful thing to know how to care about t hings, but 
also how not to care – not how to be dismissive , 
indifferent, or callous , but rather how not to  care enough 
to take things  too personally.  
 
If you’re a parent and you’re caring for your newborn 
baby, there’s a lot of care going o n, but you don’t care 
too much that you’re walk ing around afterwards with 
spit-up all over your shirt. Before , you cared a lot about 
wearing your best clothes . In public you wanted to look  
presentable , but when you’re tired, what you look like 
and what peopl e think about you jus t doesn’t really 
matter any more. What matters is that you’re caring for 
your baby. So caring and not caring  can co -exist.  
 
If you’re with a friend, you can care for your friend , and 
at the same time , you can not care whether the frien d 
thinks you’re the be st thing since chocolate chip  
cookies. You don’t have to take everything so 
personally. Perhaps t here’s a healthy way in whi ch we 
don’t care about our self -image. It’s not about us  – it’s 
about caring for our friend.  
 
There can be a m utual interplay of making a lot of effort 
in practice , and at the same time not making effort. For 
example, it’s possible to be very diligent  to stay  relaxed , because the forces inside us sometimes do not feel 
relaxed . They  can be quite powerful , and pull us into 
distraction, preoccupation, fear, anxiety, desires , and all 
kinds of things. So sometimes we have to be extremely 
vigilant to stay relaxed. It may sound  like a paradox to 
be vigilantly relaxed , but sometimes that’s required . It 
keeps you stay ing relaxed , but at the same time there’s 
a lot of effort that goes into that – until at some point 
when  the relaxed, peaceful state  kicks in , and then we 
can just stay there in a nice way.  
 
It’s the same thing with contentment and discontent. 
There are healthy forms of contentment that you are 
encouraged to cultivate when you do Buddhist practice , 
and there are healthy forms of discontent to cultivate.  
There are unhealthy forms of contentment and 
unhealthy forms of discontent  – so there has to be so me 
wisdom. It’s not just like, “ Oh Buddhi sm says you have 
to be content,”  and that’s the end of the story. You may 
have to go  into the subject more deeply and differentiate 
between what is healthy and unhealthy , and not set tle 
on it just be ing one way. There may be  different things 
go on.  
 
Certain ly, it’s easy to be discontent  in a way that keeps 
us restless, distracted, looking  into the future , and 
wanting other  things. If you are discontent  with your car , 
then you can spend your whole meditation period 
thinking how you are going to get that bigger, better, faster, shinier car. Or you can be upset: “ I can’t g et that 
bigger, bett er car,” and feel so discontented with the car 
you have, if you have a car. If you don’t have a car , then 
you’re discontent  that you don’t have a car. It can keep 
you restless, caught up, agitated. And perhaps, if the 
car you have is one that works  for your life, okay, then 
be content with the car you have , or the transportation 
you have  if it works for your life, and not care so much 
about your status. Perhaps you have a dingy, old, beat -
up car and you think, “ Wow , if I drive in certain 
neighbo rhoods , peop le will judge me  as being not part 
of the club.”  Well who cares if you’re part of that club? 
But if you feel discontented and  you want this bigger, 
better car, and your ego, self -image , status, or sense of 
power in the world  is really tied to it , and you s ee there’s 
clinging and attachment, then it’s  very healthy to be 
discontent  with that attachment.  
 
To hear a Buddhist teaching and then think, “ Oh I’ll be 
content. I’m just content  about being filled with greed!”  
[laughs] “This is fine.”  But to be discontent with our 
greed  or our hate is quite appropriate. “ I’m not content 
with b eing this way.”  If anger is a frequent visitor , you 
don’t have to be content with living a life that’s often 
angry.  
 
So explore  how to be content. Often in Buddhi sm we 
focus on be ing content with what we have i f what we 
have is enough for our well being. The great model is Buddhist monastics . It may  not be so obvious to us  with 
our lifestyle s, but in ancient India, the way that the 
Buddha designed monastic life was not a life of 
depravation , but rather a life where basic human needs 
were cared for , but not hing more. There’s supposed to 
be enough housing, clothing , medicine, and food to live 
a relatively comfortable life , but n ot one that’s 
overindulgent , nor one that  deprive s your  of those 
things. What’s needed for a healthy amount of clothes in 
a variety of different weather  conditions turns out to just 
look like an orange curtain  that you wrap around you  
[laughs]!  That’s enough. That’s adequate. You don’t go 
to your high school prom wearing that  orange curtain, 
but it’s adequate for a simple life . That’s the model.  
 
What is it you actually need to be content? It’s 
interesting to look at and  analyz e your own lifestyle and 
income , and see how much of the work that  you do and  
the income you make is motivated by the pursuit of 
pleasure.  
Most people would say, “ No, it’s not the pursuit of 
pleasure,”  but if you look at the rent or the mortgage you 
pay for your home , perhaps y ou chose a house that is 
bigger than what you actually need . But it’s enjoyable to 
have a house that has a backyard , or an extra room, or 
a nice view . And so the desire to have  that view, or yard, 
or whatever, has to do with wanting more pleasure. 
There’s nothing wrong with that , but it could be 
motivated by a certain discontent.   
What happens if you are content with something much 
more simple ? Then perhaps you wouldn’t have to wo rk 
so hard . Maybe i t’s okay to live a simpler, more relaxed 
life, and have  more  time for practice, for friends, or for 
service to your community.  
 
There’s a great story of Mullah Nasrudin, the Sufi wise 
man, who lived eating beans. Every  day he ate beans. 
Just b eans, beans, beans. His neighbo r came to him 
and said, “ You know, I feel so sorry for you eating beans 
all the time. Look at me: I have money;  I eat good, rich 
food; I always have a variety  of food s and drinks. It’s 
really great. Let me tell y ou how you  do it. We have this 
wonderful k ing in our city , and if you just go over and 
flatter him, be at his beck and call , then he’ll shower you 
with money , and you can buy all this good f ood and 
have a great  life.”  And Mullah Nasrudin said, “ No, I see 
it differently. If I can be content with beans , then I do not 
have to go to th e trouble to flatter the King.”  
 
To be content with little, with just enough to get by, frees 
us from a lot of things that we may not need and all ows 
us to pursue other things. H ow to be content with having 
an urban meditation center  where  sometimes  it’s quite 
noisy outside ? There are people who feel, “ Oh, a 
meditation center  should be in a very quiet  
neighborhood .” That ’s certainly one attitude you can 
have. But for your meditation practice here, sometimes it’s better to be content with what we have , and to 
practice with what we have.  
 
We can  look into how can we be more contented, more 
peaceful with what we have , and h ow can we be 
discontented with those  forces of the mind that keep us 
agitated, restless, contracted, or resistant. We can 
explore h ow to be disco ntent  with those , and try to 
overcome them, and find out how to be more peaceful. 
And we can explore the  wonder ful interplay  between the 
practice of contentment  and the practice of discontent, 
and how each of those  can benefit us. H opefully , 
Buddhist practice inv olves a healthy mixture of both  that 
helps us to discover greater peace , and greater capacity 
for compassion and  care for the world.   
 
I hope you are content with that talk , and if not , we’ll 
have to deal with it  [laughs].
