 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. And welcome to our Tuesday morning set. Please find a comfortable, upright, alert, and relaxed posture. Take a moment just to check in. Check in with your surroundings. The basics of your body, your posture. Maybe noticing any sounds or sensations that are kind of unique to where you are in this moment. I don't know if you guys can hear it, but right now it's raining outside in Redwood City. So there's a sense of moisture against the skin. Soft, subtle sounds. Perhaps where you are it's dry or cool. Warm, neutral. Just landing. Landing in this moment. Feeling the support beneath your body, beneath your feet, your butt, your back. And also feeling the support of the posture. Spine, bones. Allowing yourself to relax into, relax into that stance or posture. Relax into the inner posture of awareness, kindness at this moment. Noticing sensations of the body internally as well. Allowing the heart, the mind, to attune within. Tuning to awareness itself, if that's easy for you. General sense of what's unfolding here, now. And if it's helpful, relaxing into a primary object, breathing, hearing, body. Allowing the awareness to be in relationship. Settling. Settling into this moment now. Resting, resting in awareness. The flow of comings and goings. In breath, out breath, sound, silent. Trusting the equilibrium of awareness. Whatever is present. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Secchronize. YouCE us. Your memory. Monday time. and you can help filter the freshly wind. Helping in the question, where? What? No allowing, allowing the heart line to respond in this moment. No words necessary. No words necessary.
