Okay, great.
Welcome, welcome to Happy Hour everyone. Warm, warm, welcome.
The day after Thanksgiving holiday, traditionally in the United States.
Also today is Indigenous Peoples' Day, so yay.
So the theme for this week has been practicing with gratitude in so many different ways that we've worked with gratitude.
I invited us through a couple of different ways on Mondays and on Monday and Wednesday and Tuesday.
Diana had some other invitations on yesterday.
It was lovely that Dawn was able to support the community with other invitations, different ways to really consider gratitude and the interaction between gratitude and generosity, etc.
So we're going to continue this theme because we cannot have enough of the gratitude practice as we've been sharing this week, how valuable this practice really is in the arsenal of not just our happiness, which is wonderful and great,
but really in the arsenal of our awakening, waking up, serving for the purpose of ourselves and to support others, to have a heart that feels full, that feels abundant, that doesn't have a sense of scarcity.
So tonight I wanted to touch into the interaction of abundance and gratitude, or sense of abundance actually, and gratitude, the practice of gratitude, as a way of seeing, not necessarily as what we do, but as a way of being, as a way of seeing.
So I want to draw the parallel between same metta when we cultivate loving kindness, we can cultivate it with phrases, may you be well, may you be happy, there's a sense of doing, which is a wonderful practice, it's a great practice.
And there's another way to do it, and both are fantastic, and sometimes one is available more than the other, and the other way of practicing metta could be a way of relating, a way of seeing, a way of awareness, consciousness, being imbued with a sense of loving kindness,
and consciousness with a sense of love, that whenever is touched is touched with just a sense of warmth, kindness, goodwill, so it's a way of seeing, it's a way of being, not so much doing, and again both practices are fantastic, they both feed into each other,
both support each other. And there's a slightly different way of relating to them. And in the same
way with gratitude, there can be a practice of gratitude when we are giving thanks, when we are
writing in our gratitude journal what we are grateful for, which is a wonderful, wonderful
practice, when we actually thank people in our lives, whom we care about, which is again a
wonderful practice, the people who've been whom either we care about or even we've taken for
granted. So thanking people, thanking objects. So it's a way of acting in the world. And there
can be a way of seeing, just seeing everything, seeing everything that arises with an eye of
abundance and appreciation. And seeing things, for example, seeing people with sense of abundance,
with the sense of appreciation. And again, both ways of practicing are fantastic and they feed
into each other. And I do want to name them as slightly different ways, complementary ways.
So I want to say a couple of more things before we start. And this is about the relationship
between abundance and gratitude from Jack Hornfield, his book, The Path with Heart, which is a
fantastic book, both as a primer to this path of practice and also if you've been practice for a
long time. It's a lovely book to go back to. And there's a chapter about abundance and gratitude.
And I'd like to share a couple of paragraphs and maybe when we're doing the meditation,
I'll read a few more words. But yeah, so he writes and I'll let this wash over you. Actually,
I wonder, well, actually, let's do it the other way around. Why not? Let's get started on our
meditation so that we do the grounding with our breath, with our body. As we always tell the
soil and then when we open up to the practice of gratitude, then I'll read a few excerpts
from these paragraphs and then we can really let that wash over us. Yeah, let's do it that way.
Why not? Why not? So I'd like to invite you to get into your meditation posture in this moment.
Ah, if you need to shift and move, you need to set up. Straighter, if you need to lie down,
see what your body needs. Ah, unsettling, arriving, landing,
letting awareness,
sense, feel the contact points of the feet, of the legs,
with the floor, the cushion, awareness, receiving,
being, kindly aware of the contact points of the hands, aware of the sense,
sensations of breathing, expanding and contracting,
and the abdomen, and letting any tension that's held in the lower back
drop into the cushion.
Any tightness holding in the groin area,
pelvic floor, ah, let that drop also.
Ah, letting the shoulders, the arms, the hands, rest, drop,
face, letting the face relax, let the forehead soften, ah, the eyes resting in the socket.
Ah, the jaw relaxing,
the whole body
dropping, internally, dropping its weight, internally,
and just letting the breath be received
in the abdomen.
Nowhere to go, nothing to do in this moment, but to just
let the breath be received, taking refuge, entirely as if in the bubble.
Of safety in silence, for a few minutes.
And if thoughts arise in this moment,
let them be like helium balloons, multicolored, let go of the ripen,
of the thread holding the thoughts, let them float away, ah,
coming back to the breath, being received in the abdomen, a moment of refuge.
As you're sitting and receiving the breath in the abdomen, one breath at a time, feeling the body,
feeling embodied, feeling the breath, aware, awake, allow what I will read
to wash over you, not so much to think about, but to let it be dropped into your body,
resonating as if a pebble dropped into a still lake,
resonating, reverberating in your being, not just in your head, thinking about it,
let it be dropped, let it wash over you.
You don't have to make sense of all the words for it to impact you, trust.
So, reading from Jack Hornfield's abundance and gratitude,
he writes,
the Indian sage, Nisargadatta,
one of my teachers challenged his students, saying,
the problem with you is not that you have desires, but that you desire so little.
Why not desire at all?
Why not want complete fulfillment, joy, and freedom?
Nisargadatta did not mean boundless greed.
He spoke from the state of consciousness that knows it is not separate from the world.
We already contain that we most deeply desire, life, love, inner freedom,
and connection to all.
I'll read it again.
We already contain that which we most deeply desire,
life, love, inner freedom, and connection to all.
The more we can realize this,
the more we can undertake all things with a sense of abundance.
Our inner abundance radiates a sense of worth, value, and ease of having something to give to
the world and enjoying doing so.
Without abundance,
we can be in the midst of riches and feel like a hungry ghost.
The state of abundance is connected with a deep sense of gratitude.
When we open to abundance,
we can enjoy the fog lifting from the morning's melting snow
and the steam rising from the hot bowl of tomato soup on our lunch table.
The abundant heart is already whole.
We have all been touched, we have all touched this at some time.
The abundant heart embraces our world, holding all its joy and fear, gain and loss,
nobility and selfishness, enveloped in the field of compassion and love.
So, what if what we desire, what we want, what we feel missing or lacking?
What if we already are whole, connected to love to all beings,
unfathomably, complete and beautiful more than we can possibly imagine?
What if this gift of being alive, gift of consciousness,
this gift of agency as a human being has so many more dimensions and so much richer than
anything that we can possibly imagine?
What if we feel completely loved, whole, complete, healed,
that we have everything we need, truly in our humanity?
What if we don't need it from the outside or from anyone or anything?
What if it's already here, the sense of
completeness, sense of true nature or put in nature as it's called, just radiating already here.
We're going around like a beggar, asking others,
needing for it to be filled whereas it's already here, we have the treasure, the treasure is already here.
What if for a moment we actually decided to just give this thought
or this perception, this perspective, a chance, just taking this perspective on,
just taking it on for size?
You can take it off right after this session, but for right now in this moment,
oh it happens.
If you take on the perspective, the perception
that you are whole, more than enough,
everything you need, the abundance, there is a treasure chest in your heart.
Feeling complete, abundant,
just for a moment, taking on this perception,
yes, yes you can, yes you can.
Just playing with it playfully,
just trying it on for size,
not needing anything from another,
but a sense of abundance, both for yourself and to give to the world.
So much goodness, such richness already here.
And breathing, breathing with this treasure chest.
Having your body filled with a sense of fullness, abundance, it's already here.
It's already here, just needs to be uncovered, discovered, it's already here.
Having your body filled, your lungs filled, your abdomen,
with your breath, this fullness of this goodness, it's already here.
Just touching into it for just a moment is enough.
It's possible to rest in it, that's great too.
Maybe imagining this goodness, this fullness, this richness,
like a light, a bright light in your chest, in your heart center, it's already here,
shining brightly.
Usually it's not seen, distracted by wanting, needing, but realizing, wow, it's already here.
It's bright, it's beautiful, it's abundant, it's fulfilling, healing.
So bright that not only does it fill your own heart and body, but it can shine outside,
shared with others this richness, this goodness,
a gift to anyone it shines upon.
From a perspective of recognizing your own inner abundance,
and for a second,
allowing this perception as it opens up to the world,
as it opens up to the people in your life, people who are dear to you or people who have supported
you in any way, friends, benefactors, with a sense of abundance and not needing anything
from them, but just shining your goodness.
See if there can be a perspective seeing of appreciation for them.
Gratitude for them with a full heart.
Appreciation for whatever might be arising in this moment,
even if it's thoughts,
self-judgment thoughts of, oh, you can't do this, you're failing, this is not working.
Can there be a sense of abundance, appreciation even for these thoughts?
As teachers on your path,
as they teach you self-care, self-compassion as you work with them,
appreciating even this.
Can there be a sense of a way of seeing, a way of relating?
Whatever arises in your mind's eye, thoughts, people, things with a heart that's full
and has had even the slightest glimpse, slightest glimpse of its own
true nature of beauty, grace, unfathomability, dimensionality.
From this perspective, whatever is seen, can it be seen as a teacher?
Can it be seen with eyes of appreciation,
with eyes of generosity?
Can it be this too, this too?
And for the last moments of this practice,
letting this perception, this way of seeing with generosity,
with appreciation, gratitude, they're all intertwined.
To see whatever might be coming up at the end of this practice,
appreciating yourself for having shown up, this being that is you.
And again, even if self-judgmental thoughts are coming up,
seeing them with generosity, with kindness, with appreciation.
Thank you all for your practice.
So with this practice of gratitude and the interaction with abundance
and generosity, there are times just to say that the opposite can come up,
trying to see your goodness, your true nature, your inner beauty,
and maybe you touch into it for a second or maybe not, and then the sense of the opposite comes up,
that there's nothing here, I have nothing, or I don't have.
Everybody else has the inner Buddha, inner beauty and the true nature, but I was left out.
So if these come up, it's okay, turning towards them with compassion.
It's okay, it's just like the practice of metta and compassion that the opposite can come up.
These practices can be purification practices, trying to practice gratitude or abundance.
So the opposite comes up, it's okay, it's okay, it comes up, it's normal, it's natural,
don't judge yourself, it's okay.
Turn towards it with compassion, maybe with humor, or you all have lots of different skills,
just recognize it's okay, and maybe you can even thank it in that moment, this contraction.
Oh, thank you, because you're going to be my way of opening up into awakening,
because really what's hard for us on this path are the doorways through which we open up to awakening.
So gratitude also for what's difficult, because that's how we open up, that's how we
how we become nibbana is to we wake up, it's through these challenges,
it's how we build wisdom and compassion, it's through these difficulties.
So maybe having gratitude for them if they come up.
So with that I'd like to invite you, if anyone would like to share any reflections or questions
what came up for you, you can type them in chat, or you can raise your blue hand
by going to participants, clicking on participants, window opens, and it says raise hand,
if you want to raise your hand that's how you can do it, but if you raise your physical hand
I may not see you, because I see only a very few people given the privacy issue. Jerry, please.
So first of all my apologies for being late, but I had much to get here and I had a difficult day
with some sadness for my assistants, I decided after 18 years to leave and we've been close.
So anyhow that was sad, but I think what struck me was when you said after being late you said,
well it's just gratitude for being able to show up here and then it sort of switched.
And I thought oh okay, and to try to just sit in that moment and of course after about 10 minutes
I was like oh this is different, so that's how it's just the moment of saying gratitude to be here,
like I thought how many things have to go up together for any of us to be here, there's so many
things, electricity, a whole bunch of stuff. So thank you Jerry, thank you so much for sharing
that, but I also appreciate what you shared, which really highlights the theme that I was
trying to invite people to kind of work with is a perception, because in one moment your perception,
your way of seeing went from oh this is challenging, this is really hard to, oh gratitude for being
here and that perception just shifted all the other perceptions that came later, so it just,
often it can just be one perception and can turn things around. So thank you so much for sharing
that Jerry. Gary says with infinite gratitude, thanks for such a beautiful meditation. Thank
you Gary, thank you for showing up, thanks for being here. Eric says, wonderful meditation,
thank you, I connected the idea of wholeness with the heart and mind's resiliency and the
ability to heal, oh beautiful, lovely, thank you Eric, thanks for sharing that, connecting the
idea of wholeness with the heart and mind's resiliency and the ability to heal, beautiful,
love it. Okay, I see Violet's hand, Violet please. Hi Nikki. Hi. I was wondering when you're sort of
looking for your Buddha nature, like how do you know you've found it, like how do you know you're
there? Yeah, yeah, so it's, so not so much of looking for it and finding, trusting that it's
already there, trusting that it's already there, so trusting that this being that is you is
so much more amazing and gifted and has the capacity for fully loving and being loved and
he just, it has so much more capacity than you, Violet, understand in the limited conscience,
so just allowing for that, it's like, oh yeah, it's already here, so that's, and if it's only
a millisecond of trusting that, that trusting that you don't quite understand, maybe that's it,
so it's not a way of seeing it, trusting that you can't quite fully see it. Does that make
sense of turning it on its head? Is that, yeah, so it's not that you've seen it, it's not that we
can't see it, but trusting that it's so beautiful and unfathomable that we can't quite get it and
there's so much more I can say about this, but does that give you an opening? Yeah, okay, great.
Okay, Kevin, I see your hand is up please.
Okay, hopefully I can keep myself together through this, but I initially had a hard time
feeling whole, especially with the word whole because for a long time I felt very broken
and, and so I was kind of struggling with it for a little bit until you said the word playfulness
and that, that evoked images of like childhood and so thought about myself as a child and I,
you know, I think I was pretty whole back then and I realized that a lot of the things that we
are and have as a child, I still have even through the things I've been through and then
I started opening up and yeah, then, then yeah, I felt so much gratitude towards myself for still
having that through all thought I've been through and it was, it was really powerful
to connect to myself again. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you so much for your sharing.
Thank you. Beautiful. I'm, I'm, I'm deeply, deeply touched. Thank you for your courage
to speak up and share the beauty of your wholeness and the playfulness with, with the whole Sangha
I feel in the faces of Sangha that they're touched and really appreciating you and holding you with
Mehta. So thank you so much for sharing. Beautiful. And I love how in, in your practice with creativity
because these are invitations. These are so many invitations that I give for people, for,
for folks to find their own way and I love how your heart found its own way to when you were,
you were a child and the playfulness and, and then it turned to a sense of gratitude for yourself
after all that you've been through. It's just beautiful. So thank you Kevin for sharing that.
So this has been so rich everyone. Oh, time is flying by. Okay, time for groups, dear ones,
time for groups. So my invitation for practicing with, with this with a sense with
sharing as, as we get into small groups, just sitting maybe with, without words, just sitting
with feeling the Buddha nature of these other beings that are sitting with you, just holding
each other with a sense of abundance. You're looking at, at little Buddhas. They're looking at
little Buddha. So maybe start with some silence. And for those who are on the phone, also just
feel held and being held. Maybe start with there and then maybe words will come up that you like
to share. So tonight might be, we'll be a little shorter, but let's start with just being held,
holding and being held, each other's Buddha nature. It's, it's here. It's already here. You
don't have to see it. Trust that it's so amazing and bright that we can't quite see it with our
human consciousness, but trust it's there. Trust. It is, it is here already. I have no doubt.
So here we go. I'm going to create the breakout rooms. Oh, it's giving me trouble again,
the usual. Let's see here. Okay, that's better. Okay. So, all right, creating the rooms,
numbers always shift at the very end. Okay, here we go. And more second. Okay. All right. They are
open now. Okay, the rooms are closed. Everyone is back. Welcome back, everyone. Sorry, it was
a little shorter tonight because we had so many wonderful reflections earlier. But if anybody
would like to share one last reflection about what it was like to be in the room, a room tonight
or practice again, you can raise your hand or type it in chat. Take one last reflection before we
end. Yes, please. Michael on the phone. I had huge mood data and just huge joy hearing the
reflections of my other two Dharma friends and such wisdom and wonderful positive reinforcement.
And I just wanted to thank you for your sweet guidance this evening and for also
bringing in Dawn last night. She was a treat that we all enjoyed. So deep bowz and thank you again.
Great. Great. Lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. And thank you, everyone, for showing up.
And thank you also to for Dawn for coming and supporting and holding the space and teaching
and leading last night with with gratitude to everyone, all of you for showing up for being
this beautiful Sangha and practicing both for your own benefit and to benefit all beings everywhere.
Thank you all. Deep, deep gratitude for the Sangha. May you all be safe, happy, healthy,
and have lives that unfold with ease. May you be free and may all beings everywhere be the same.
Thanks, everyone. Thank you and see you on Monday. Oh, I'm going to ask you to unmute yourself if
you want to say bye bye. Bye. Take care, dear Sangha. Bye, Kevin. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thanks. Thank you all. Take care. Bye bye. Bye.
