 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here it goes. So, to begin, just do what it takes to arrive, you know, right in your present moment experience, wherever you're sitting, in your home or wherever you are. Noticing what's happening in your body. And seeing if you can just let it relax, whatever's going on. Noticing the contact points between your body and the chair and your clothing, wherever your hands are resting, in your lap or in the arms of a chair. Noticing the contact points just right here. And the breathing. Always what's happening right now, right here, in the present moment. And for most of us, it's a way of staying connected to our present moment experience, to be connected to breathing. And what's happening in the mind? Is there a residue of earlier activity that's still kind of rolling on, playing out in the mind? You can just let it be, let it settle. It's really quite simple, what we're doing. Just sitting, being present with our physical experience, being present with our mental experience. Not interfering. What's seeing it unwind? Watching it ease up as we keep being aware without interfering, without pushing at it, without getting involved. Is there energy in the body? Is there tension? Give space to it. It's okay to just be here and aware that we are just here, sitting, breathing, attending to our experience. Okay. We can be aware of the movements of the mind, aware of the sensations of the body. Just receiving them in awareness, with acceptance, with kindness. All very simply. All right. This is our life right now, at this moment. Just sitting and breathing. The body, the mind, receiving sensations, sounds, mental activity, just simply present and aware of what is arising. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
