 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Yes, it's good to stay with you. I think I'm very accustomed to a YouTube situation here. Thanks for having me. So, yesterday I introduced this theme about different Dharma pleasures and spoke specifically about the pleasure of having a path. And today, it's the pleasure of sourcing our motivation from love. So, when I was just out of college and I worked in this, I was not qualified for this, incidentally, but when they pay $9 an hour, you get me. So, I was working in a residential treatment center and for severely, severe psychiatric, adolescent boys with serious psychiatric stuff. That was acute enough that they couldn't be in homes. And so, it was residential treatment and it was six kids in the house and just an ordinary house in the middle of LA. And it was such intense and beautiful work. And as a counselor, my job was to run groups of one kind or another, do fun things together, play, cook for them, take care of them, and implement a behavioral modification program. Whereas, points for good behavior and the loss of privileges for bad behavior. And you could see how you could run the behavioral modification program on fear or love. And at least initially, and I remember working with a whole cast of characters, all of us counselors, fear, at least initially, could be more effective. That it was easier to change the behavior of the children if there was some measure of fear of the counselor. But in the end, yeah, I think love wins out. If our behavior, if their behavior is going to change in a sustainable way, it's going to be a function of love, conditioned by love, shaped by love. And my question for you is, what kind of behavioral modification program are you running on yourself? What kind of program are you running on yourself? Where do you source your motivation from? We have to source our motivation from somewhere. We want to change and grow. That line from Suzuki Roshi, you're perfect just as you are, and there's room for improvement, right? Yeah. There's much we want to do. We want to love more fully, to be less neurotic, to take good care of our body, to minimize the harm we do to others, to ourselves. There's a lot, yeah? And how do we actually motivate ourselves to grow and evolve, to make progress? And the Dharma pleasure that I'm speaking about is coming to source our motivation from love and care, rather than self-harshness or fear or the kind of egoic machinations of proving. Self-hatred has maybe many functions, some of which are actually soothing. But one of the functions is a kind of behavioral modification program we run on ourselves. And it's all stick, no carrot. And it's this kind of commitment to, okay, I'll punish myself, to motivate myself to achieve something that I think is worthy. And in that framework, we often get very preoccupied with the gold stars and with the kind of imagine how we'll feel when we actually get the gold star. But getting the gold star never feels like wanting it and never really. I don't know. It's almost this sense of like, well, I'll be a grown-up once I do that, once I grow in this way. But no one ever feels like a grown-up, as far as I can tell. And we repeat the habits of self-harshness in our practice. We can be harsh or even sometimes really kind of cruel as we come up against our limitations, yeah, when we know we need to let go, but we cannot. When we're trying to be tranquil, but we're agitated, yeah. When we're trying to be a quantumist, we're trying to be okay with something, but we're really not. Yeah, we come up against certain moments of limitation. And we are trying to kind of shape ourself through mechanisms of fear and harshness. And that system of motivation can fall away almost completely. Yeah. One meditator could touch me. She said, I realize my inner critic loves me. Yeah. They're just confused, something like this, yeah. When our limitations and our neurosis are no longer a kind of commentary on who we are, when we're at least a little bit free of these egoic pressures of proving, proving oneself, proving the object of self to someone, even if that audience is just us, when that starts to fall away, our neurosis becomes a source of curiosity and humor rather than shame. Yeah. Yeah, we know we still have to grow. We have habits that get us into trouble, da, da, da, da, da. But our neurosis becomes a source of curiosity and humor rather than shame. Yeah, one of the, I don't know, features of practice, one of the things I noticed is like it really has become such a delight to laugh at myself, you know, like to laugh deeply. And to laugh deeply, I'm not talking about like that little habit that's like really kind of innocent. No, I'm talking about like laughing deeply in the face of real problems, real neurosis. But in that laughter, that kind of laughter, it's like I can almost feel what might become self judgment or some shame inflected state or something just releases. Yeah. We do want to grow and mature, but the desperate urgency of ego is gone. That is not where we're sourcing our motivation from. And the poignancy of our condition, you know, the human condition is etched deeply into our being. And so that's there for us too. And we begin to source our motivation from love, from tenderness and care and sympathy, sympathy with ourselves, with the plight of suffering. And there's this sense of like, oh yeah, there's nothing, there's nothing left to prove to ourselves, to others. We're not growing and changing in order to prove something. And then all of our projects, you know, our whatever that is, our exercise schedule or meditation commitment or you fill in the blank, whatever comes from care. Comes from care and comes from this very sober appreciation about the strengths, weaknesses, yeah, and just feels so much less entangled. And when we feel less entangled, when we feel like nothing we discover about who we are is going to break our heart, and there's just a lot of, you know, of curiosity, kind of urgency of discovery and lightness. So, sourcing our motivation from love rather than fear. This is a Dharma pleasure, for sure. So offer that for your consideration. I mentioned that just have an optional Zoom session this evening, 7pm to 730 on Zoom. So the link is on that website there so just you can just go to MatthewBrentsover.org it's on the first page you'll see it. And it'll be a kind of opportunity to just to sit together for a few minutes and have some questions. And, yeah, so that's that's it. In 20, no, no, 12, 11 hours or so. Yeah, so you're, you're warmly invited, and I will. If I don't see you there. I will see you. See you tomorrow morning. Okay, thanks. Thanks so much. Thank you to being together more.
