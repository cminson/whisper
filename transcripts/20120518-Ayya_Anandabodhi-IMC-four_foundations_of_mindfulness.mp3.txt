The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So we're now in the month of Vesak, or Vesaka Puja.
And Vesak normally falls on the full moon of May.
But this year, I'm not sure I think it's because it's a leap year,
that it's the Sri Lankan Sangha celebrating Vesak on the, or already have celebrated Vesak,
on the full moon of May, on the 6th of May.
And the Thai Sangha are celebrating Vesak on the 4th of June.
So there's some discrepancy about when the Vesak moon falls this year.
So since we're neither Sri Lankan or Thai, I'm not sure what the Burmese, which moon the Burmese are following.
But I figure since we're, you know, not from a Buddhist country,
we can celebrate Vesak the whole month, from one moon to the next.
So I started our Vesak celebration on the full moon of May by going to Aranya Bodhi Hermitage in Jena,
where our preceptor lives.
And we took part in the first, in a very early morning, like it just as dawn was breaking,
we took part in an ordination of two women, full ordination of two women, two novices,
Samaneri Marajina and Samaneri Nibbida.
So they had the first half of their ordination in Jena.
And then we all got into cars and we drove off to Sacramento.
And we had the second part of the ordination in Sacramento with the Bhikkhu Sangha.
And three of those monks had driven up that morning, about 4.30 in the morning from LA to be there to support the ordination.
So it was very lovely.
So we had a big meal and then a Vesak celebration,
and then the second part of the ordination in the afternoon.
So Vesak is traditionally, the Buddha was said to have been born on the full moon, on the Vesak full moon.
So in the calendar that was used at the Buddha's time, they used a lunar calendar,
and this moon had a particular name.
So it more or less corresponds with what's the May moon in our calendar.
So on the Vesak, the full moon of Vesak, the Buddha was born under a saaltry,
as his mother was making her way back to her family,
which was the tradition in those days to give birth at your parents' home.
He was born under a saaltry on the full moon of Vesak,
and he was enlightened under what was actually called the peepal tree,
which we now call the bodhi tree, and the full moon of Vesak.
And he died.
He breathed his last under a grove of saaltries on the full moon of Vesak.
So Vesak is the day to recollect and remember the Buddha.
And we can very easily feel a little bit disconnected from the Buddha as a person,
particularly if we've not actually been to the pilgrimage places.
And often in the West we come across Buddhism as more of a technique-oriented practice,
where it can be a very rational, pragmatic teaching and practice, because it is.
And we can miss the spirit and the beauty of the fact that there was this human being alive
in the 2500 or so years ago in India,
who became, through his own efforts, fully enlightened,
and who walked around and taught the dharma for the welfare of the many folk, as they say,
for the long-lasting benefit of the many folk, of which we are part.
It's still filtering down to us. It's quite remarkable.
This is a human being.
This is a man who was born from his mother's womb, just as we were,
and who ate and cried and went to the toilet and experienced physical pain,
experienced gain and loss, love and loss.
And through his efforts, he realised full enlightenment.
And he taught for 40 years.
He walked around Indian Nepal teaching for 40 years until he was 80s.
And then when it was the right time, he lay down and breathed his last.
So we don't usually say that the Buddha died, even though the body died,
because, you know, we speak about the Buddha's Parinibbana.
So it's like the complete ending.
So it wasn't like it was like all, there was no more work to be done.
Everything was laid down at the end of his life.
There was no more attachment, no more things to do, no more wishes.
It was just the completion, the full completion of a life.
So I like to think, you know, it's lovely to think of the Buddha as a human being.
I think it's very important to just bring that to mind, just like us, human being.
You know, the Buddha was also just a human being.
So enlightenment on realisation is attainable to all of us.
If we keep putting our mind in the right place and keep bringing attention to our practice
and guiding our life in the right direction.
And, you know, maybe this life, maybe future life, who knows.
But it doesn't really matter.
What really matters is bringing attention to this, to what is going on now in this moment, in any given moment.
And, you know, so we've all been born and we're all going to die at some point when it's the right time.
And in between those two points, there's what we can do in our life, you know.
So there's such a huge array of possibilities that one can use that time for.
And so I like to, you know, particularly around this Wessec time, to really refresh the possibility that we can use this life for awakening, for fully awakening.
And, you know, most of us have those thoughts that say, well, you know, I can't do it because, dot, dot, dot.
And, you know, we probably won't be able to become a fully enlightened Buddha unless anyone's very, very highly attained already here.
That, you know, when we're chanting at the beginning of the evening, we chant the qualities of the sangha.
You know, that sangha, it's not the monastic sangha.
It's not saying, you know, the monastic sangha is worthy of gifts, worthy of offerings.
It's saying the sangha of those who have gained insight into the path.
So that's monks and nuns and lay women and lay men who have gained insight into the path.
This is the sangha who have practiced well, who have practiced directly, who have practiced with integrity,
who give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world.
And, you know, we so easily put it up on a pedestal and feel that we can't do that, you know,
because of our conditioning or our background or our mind-states, whatever it might be,
that we think are an obstacle to our practice.
But if you look at the Satipatana Sutra, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness,
the Buddha is pointing us back to our experience as it is in any given moment.
So, you know, one can approach this teaching in a very complex and detailed way,
or one can approach it in a simple and immediate way, which is my preference.
So, in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Buddha is encouraging us to see, to know the body as the body.
So, in that first part of the meditation, I was guiding you to bring awareness to the body as it is.
I don't know about you, but when I first started the practice that almost inevitably I would go to sleep,
it was almost impossible for me to keep attention on my body.
It was just, no, I don't want to be there.
And then gradually over the years, you know, recognizing here it is, you know,
the body and mind we're kind of in this for the lifetime together.
So, you know, might as well get to know each other a bit better.
You know, then over the years I've found that the body has become a very wonderful refuge and foundation.
Because it's always here, it's always here, and the mind can spin off, get involved in all kinds of things,
the emotions can get really agitated and excited, and then the mind gets lost in them spinning off.
But the body is just here. It's right here.
And, you know, you can feel all of the emotions in the body, but the body is holding that.
So, I've found that this good friend here is very helpful on the path.
And I can bring my attention back to this body, whatever's going on in a midst of turmoil,
in a very challenging situation where somebody's having a go at me and I'm feeling really agitated
and I want to retaliate, but I know that that isn't going to help.
And then I say, OK, body, what's going on in the body now?
Feeling agitated, feeling anxious.
And then there's the breath.
So, there's the breath, and I can breathe with that feeling.
And that gives it a little space.
I'm not so caught in the reactivity.
And then I see, well, what is this feeling?
It's unpleasant feeling.
This is a really unpleasant feeling, and I don't like it.
And I'd like to be able to do something that I can get away from this feeling.
But that trying to get away from is a step off the path.
So, the path is coming back to the feeling.
OK, unpleasant feeling.
It feels like this.
It's kind of hard to bear, but it's just like this, and it's fluctuating, it's changing.
It's not going to be like this forever.
And then the breath gives it a little bit more ease.
And then there's the ability to bear with it.
So, instead of just throwing something back, creating a whole scenario,
a big, maybe even a lifetimes problem,
I can stay with that feeling for, it might just be just a few minutes,
or it might be an hour or two, depending on how strong it is.
And eventually that feeling subsides.
And there's been an opportunity to, you know, the path has been right there.
I've stepped onto the path by turning my attention to that feeling.
If I'd have retaliated, I'd have stepped off the path.
I'd have set right into the cycle of samsara and added to it.
But by turning back here and being with the feeling,
which is the second foundation of mindfulness,
knowing it as it is, unpleasant feeling,
knowing it's nature using right understanding,
it's changing, it's not who and what I am.
So it's not to say to dissociate from it, saying,
this is not me, this is not mine.
But to be with it and to know this is a process that's going on,
it's got a cause, it's arising in this way,
and it will cease if I put my attention to it in the right way.
And then bringing attention to the mind states,
which is the third foundation of mindfulness.
So I find it very interesting with the body.
What attitude do we bring to this body?
And people are so often indifferent to the body
or even a bit condescending and a bit averse
looking down on it is this thing we tolerate.
And then the mind can be very exalted, wonderful,
but the body, you know,
or we may have had physical trauma,
and then the body's a fearful place to be.
We don't want to be there.
So we find all these ways of escaping.
And meditation can be that.
We can use meditation as a means of escape
from the body for some time.
Buddha is inviting us to come back,
to know the body as the body,
and to know the feelings as the feelings,
and to know the mind state as the mind state,
to know it as it is.
So it's an interesting investigation
to bring attention to your mind state at any given moment.
When you sit down to meditate,
to just check what mindset am I meeting this with?
Am I meeting this meditation with grasping?
Do I want to get something out of it?
Or am I meeting it with a version I want to check out
because I don't really want to be here?
I don't want to have to deal with the conditioned world.
I don't want to have to deal with this body, these feelings,
the aging process, the challenges of life.
So I just want to check out in my meditation
and not have to deal with any of it.
So it can be nice, a little holiday,
but it's not liberating.
It's stepping off the path.
So to bring attention to the way we meet our experience,
when we do this, we're stepping back on the path to awakening.
It's right here.
And it's not saying, you know, we have to wait
for a nice, wholesome, beautiful mind state before we do that.
It's knowing this mind state, whatever it might be,
however it is, as it is, knowing it as it is,
and again, bringing right understanding.
So we're not being with a mind state saying,
this is me, I am, oh, there's me again doing this, there I am again,
thinking in this way.
It's not taking, not grasping hold of it as me and mine,
but it's knowing the mind state,
knowing that it's not fully whom what I am,
although it conditions the way we manifest in the world,
but it's not whom what I am.
It's a mind state, it's a filter, it's a colouring on our experience.
It's not, it's obscuring us from seeing clearly.
But once we bring our attention back to that mind state,
however deluded it may be,
if we can pay attention to it, if we can know it for what it is,
then there's clarity.
So there can be clarity with desire,
there can be clarity with fear,
there can be clarity with anger,
clarity with confusion.
Interestingly enough, I've experimented with this quite a bit.
Clarity, there can be perfect clarity with confusion.
You know perfectly that this is confused mind state,
and you know how it is, how it affects the mind,
and you're limited by it and all of that,
and there's great clarity.
And you know that this is not whom what I am,
a passing cloud,
and you know the true nature of the mind is bright
and clear and open.
So it's learning to be the awareness that knows the experience.
And then there's the objects of mind.
So there's the five hindrances of sensual desire
and ill will or aversion,
restlessness and sloth or sleepiness, dullness and doubt.
So those five hindrances, it's very, very helpful to know them.
Just to notice which is present right now.
So when we know sensual desire is present,
we might not be able to completely stop following it,
but we know it for what it is, it's sensual desire.
We've followed it a million times before.
It hasn't led to ultimate satisfaction yet.
Likelihood is it won't, you know.
So we know what it is,
and then if we can't stop ourselves following it,
at least we know, okay, here I go again, you know.
And hopefully not toward something that's too harmful.
If we're following something that's really harmful,
then we should just stop it.
Just go and do something else.
But if it's something harmless enough, you know,
relatively harmless like eating a cream cake or whatever it might be,
then just to know the whole process of that,
the following sensual desire, it has its promise,
it has its moments of gratification, it ends.
We look for the next thing, and that's how it works.
So, you know, we can have that moment of gratification,
and it gives a little temporary relief,
but you know, it's just still, again, it's caught on that wheel,
it's on that hempster wheel,
of constantly searching for that pleasure
that's going to give us satisfaction.
And, you know, ill will.
Ill will is quite a strong term,
but I find that ill will, it manifests in many ways,
in very subtle ways sometimes.
So there's the obvious outward anger,
even maybe violent feelings,
and there's a stronger version.
Fear is also a type of ill will.
And depression is kind of rooted in ill will,
wanting to push something away,
not wanting to let things in.
You know, these all have kind of ill will as their basis.
Or, you know, just sort of having a grudge against something,
or a resistance.
So there's a point when I realized,
not long after I came to live in America,
I realized I don't drive,
but in terms of my life, I'm driving with the brakes on.
You know, here I'm in this life,
there's all these things going on,
and I got the brake on all the time.
There's this kind of resistance,
there's fear, resistance, not sure,
and then it's exhausting living like that.
At some point it's like,
well, what would happen if I just took my foot off the brake?
Just let life do what it's doing,
and meet it as best I can.
And it's like, oh, what a relief.
It's such a relief.
And maybe for a while it feels a bit fast,
and I don't feel I can quite keep up with it,
and then after a while I can't get used to it.
It's no problem.
And then increasingly just be able to open to this,
to life as it appears, as it comes.
So these are all aspects of ill-will,
that kind of resistance,
from that to depression, fear, anger, resentment,
these are all aspects of ill-will.
Just to get to know them.
So it's not to judge them and say,
oh, I shouldn't have that as a hindrance,
not supposed to have ill-will,
but to know it, to turn your attention to that experience.
So this is all within the framework
of the foundations of mindfulness.
So putting one's attention on that
is stepping back on the path.
And it can seem counter-intuitive
to be with strong resentment is the path.
And you feel like, no, it should be getting rid of resentment.
It should be free from resentment.
But it's just trusting that that process,
that of continuously bringing your attention to
what is happening here and now,
that in itself will lead you in the right direction.
We can't always root out.
We might know what we don't want to have,
and the intellect is clear,
it knows where it's going,
it knows what it wants to do,
it knows what it wants to get rid of.
And then there's the body and the karma,
the process, the condition that's here,
and that has its own pace.
You can't always keep up with the mind and the intention.
So to have the compassion, really,
and humility to slow down enough
to be with what's happening now,
rather than some idea of what we think it should be,
how we should be, or what should be happening now.
So I won't go into great detail with the other hindrances
of restlessness and dullness and doubt,
but with all of these,
it's again to bring your attention to them.
So bring your attention to the quality of restlessness.
It's an unpleasant feeling.
It's agitated, it's unsettled,
it's wanting to be somewhere else.
So bringing your attention as much as you can
to that experience of restlessness,
and you can use the breath again
to take some really deep, calming breaths
to help soothe that restlessness.
And sleepiness or dullness,
it's a tricky thing to deal with,
but again, it's kind of an unpleasant,
well, it can be pleasant,
it can be unpleasant or pleasant experience,
but for those of us who are interested
in the path of awakening,
it's an obvious hindrance.
It's obviously going in the wrong direction.
So not to be lulled by that kind of nice, soft...
Oh, having a really peaceful meditation.
You know, you wake up at the end and the bell rings.
Oh, that was nice, had a good meditation.
I feel much better.
Don't be lulled by that.
Try to know it when it happens.
I suffer from this one.
So try to know that when it's going on
and change your posture, maybe stand up,
take some deep breaths.
There's very significant...
If your light's on, you can open your eyes
and let it be taking the light.
So these are all ways that can help
with dullness, drowsiness.
And then there's doubt,
which keeps this like a dog chasing its tail.
It thinks it's getting somewhere.
It can go faster and faster,
but it's just never going anywhere.
It's going crazy.
So with doubt, you just have to stop.
Stop following the doubt
and come back to the body.
Or come back to the breath.
Whichever is most accessible.
And then the doubts carry on.
And then you just say,
I'm not paying attention to you right now.
I'm going to be with the breath.
Okay, breath.
So it's not that it necessarily goes away,
but we don't feed it with our attention.
So these are some of the dhammas
or the objects of mind that we can be aware of.
And we can also be aware of the wholesome objects of mind.
I don't know why I have a bit of a block
with the seven effects of enlightenment.
I can never quite remember them all.
But the qualities of investigation.
Investigation of dhammas.
Mindfulness.
I won't go through them,
because I don't know why all these years
I've never been able to keep them in my mind.
Knowing when the wholesome qualities are present also.
The concentration,
focus, collectiveness of mind.
So what I'm trying to point to is that
whatever is going on in our experience
at any given moment,
this is the path.
Paying attention to this,
whatever it may be,
is the path to awakening.
And it's not like waiting for something else
or till we're better.
Not that, it's this.
It's this.
Even this delusion that we have
is paying attention with clarity to this.
This is what brings us back onto the path.
Or being with our own generosity
and feeling the joy of generosity.
This is what brings us back to the path.
Noticing a judgment that comes in.
Oh, you shouldn't get into your own generosity.
That's selfish.
Then you notice that judgment.
Not adding to it with another judgment,
but just knowing it for what it is.
Oh, that's a judgment.
That's in the ill-will category.
And then just knowing that
and then feeling what that feels like.
Just that knowing is bringing us back to the path.
So, really, we have no excuses, actually.
Because here's this body and here's this mind.
Here are these mind objects.
Here are the feelings.
It's all here.
And it's just for us to remember
that this is our opportunity.
Right, right, this, this.
Right, as it is, is our opportunity.
We've been given this human birth,
which doesn't always feel so precious.
I've never been originally experienced it
as a wonderful thing, I have to say.
But over the years, with the practice,
I've come to greatly appreciate this human experience.
It's challenging.
It's painful, it's gratifying.
It can be blissful.
It's got an amazing range of experience
from the most awful to the most wonderful.
And I've experienced a pretty good range of all that.
And in between.
And in that is the door, the opening to freedom.
So in our suffering is the door.
If we turn around and face it,
that is the door to freedom.
In our joy, if we turn around and face it,
that is the door to our freedom.
And it's through being with it as it is,
not through holding onto it and identifying with it
and making it me and mine,
but through just meeting it in the moment.
That is the place of awakening.
And over time, as we continue this practice,
it's just a natural incentive towards the wholesome
and away from the unwholesome.
It's a natural process.
It's semi-conscious that that isn't a natural process.
Because we can fudge things.
We can cover things up.
We can make excuses.
We can eat something, drink something,
switch on something that we don't have to feel.
The effects of our thoughts and actions and speech.
But when we're actually using this experience
as a door to enlightenment or to awakening,
we feel the repercussions of our foolishness
and our unskillfulness,
and we don't want to keep following it.
We don't want to keep feeding it.
It's a huge incentive to find the way out,
to find the place of freedom.
And it might not just be our foolishness,
it could be old trauma patterns,
reactive patterns, but then get to know them.
They're conditioned.
They're not our true nature.
Get to know them, learn to be with them.
Give them proper attention.
And through that, they start to change.
We find more freedom in our lives.
So it's a very simple practice
and very easily overlooked.
And it's like the door is right here.
When we turn our attention back,
the door to the death list is right here.
So I'd like to end there,
and I'd like to open up for any questions,
because there might be gaps in what I've said,
places that don't make sense to you.
So my intention is to offer the signpost, really,
that you can find the way out of suffering.
So please feel free to ask any questions
in regard to what I've said in regard to your own practice,
or to share if you'd like to share.
And if it doesn't make any sense to you at all,
then please say so.
Yes.
Sister, would you say a little more
about when the body is so uncomfortable,
there's pain in the body, perhaps trauma?
Well, there are different things.
There's physical pain because of, you know,
maybe the different reasons.
It could be because of just the natural aging of the body.
It does get more painful.
It could be an injury,
or there could be an illness that's giving chronic pain.
So there are different kinds of physical pain.
And there's also like a kind of a phantom pain
that one can experience in the meditation,
that there's more like a tension pain.
So the mind starts to tense up,
and then the body starts to tense up,
because you're thinking,
I'll sit here for 45 minutes,
and then you start to feel all these pains
that you don't normally feel.
If you're sitting in front of your computer,
you wouldn't even notice your body at all.
But because you're sitting being attentive,
you feel all these pains.
And if when you get up, those pains are gone,
or within a minute or two, or a few seconds,
then don't worry about them.
They're just what the mind is throwing up,
as a distraction.
So then you could learn to investigate those pains
and be with them as they are.
And in the beginning of the meditation,
I was doing that guided body sweeping.
So what tends to happen is when we feel a pain in the body,
if it's a physical pain,
our mind latches hold of that.
And we don't know anything else
that's going on apart from that pain.
And then we start to make all kinds of stories
about what's going to happen,
and how terrible it all is.
So to learn to sweep the attention through the body.
So if you can't get it off that knee that's painful,
then just see if you can,
if you can't sweep through the body,
then just move your attention to the other knee,
unless that's also painful.
Or to your right elbow.
And then so it's like,
okay, that's really painful.
What's happening at the right elbow?
Nothing much.
So why can't the mind also be with that nothing much?
It's just as valid.
So training the mind to be with the body
in any place with the pleasure, pain,
neither pain nor pleasure.
Training the mind to be with all of it.
If you have a physical injury or a chronic,
then you have to be careful not to strain it.
If you have chronic pain,
I've never really had chronic pain,
but if you have chronic pain,
then it's really necessary to learn ways to be with that.
So to know it as a sensation,
to be able to put one's attention to,
say for example, the breath,
they can give some ease.
So you're not just latched onto the body.
And I mean, you'd be better off asking someone
who has really practiced with chronic pain,
to have a sense of let the mind encompass the body.
So you're not fighting it,
the mind isn't fighting the body,
trying to get away from it because it can't,
but it can in some states of meditation,
but to learn to embrace that whole experience.
And to know this is painful feeling,
it's unpleasant feeling.
And to allow that to be in consciousness.
If you practice the absorption,
which I am not a jhana practitioner myself,
but if you practice the jhana as the absorption,
then you can also experience,
even with the chronic pain,
you can experience mindsets that are completely free from pain,
because the mind is no longer aware of
or identified with the body for periods of time.
Then when you come out of that,
you're just back with the same situation again.
So it's like a temporary relief.
But the really, I would say, more useful,
on a long, more liberating practice,
is to be with that feeling and know it as painful feeling.
And see how it is actually constantly changing,
even with chronic pain.
It's constantly fluctuating.
So to be with the flux of it.
And then if there's like trauma,
there's the emotional trauma in the body.
So there might be,
something might happen,
and then you have very, very strong feeling arising in the body,
like in the belly or in the heart.
Then that's also in a similar way,
to turn to that and be with that,
and to breathe through that,
and to know, to see the strength of reaction,
and to not add to it,
not react or start living it out,
and not suppress it.
But to allow the mind to embrace that,
and know it, and feel it,
and watch it as it's going through its process,
and see it come to its end,
whenever that will be,
and then know how it is after.
So it's taking it through the whole process.
So just take segments of experience.
We don't notice something arising,
we don't notice it ceasing,
but we notice it when it's in its peak,
and then it's like, ah!
Or, wow, fantastic, whatever it is.
But we don't notice the process.
So when we bring attention to each moment,
as best as we can,
we see the process,
we see the beginning, the increase,
the climax, and then the decrease,
and then the end,
and then maybe the space after.
And then the next thing arises.
So you get to see that process,
and it kind of doesn't grip us in the same way.
Yes, Bill.
I think one of the reasons
I've never been drawn toward body scans
is that I have a hard time noticing
particular parts of the body.
So, for instance,
if someone asks me to notice
a particular spot on the back of my hand,
and if nothing is touching that part of my hand,
there's really no sensation there.
So if I say now,
be aware of your left shoulder.
Can you feel anything?
So, faintly, I'm not sure
that I really do notice anything.
Maybe I'm imagining,
but even so, it's very, very faint.
Maybe with practice you can develop
a bit more sensitivity.
So, can I just ask,
if I say be aware of the whole body sitting,
can it be aware of that?
It's hard to say what I'm noticing.
Close your eyes a moment.
How do you know that there's a body?
Do you know?
The place I really notice is where my rear is.
Because there's pressure.
Clothing is covering so much of my body
that it's really hard to...
there's no distinct feeling for anyone.
Is there any sense of warmth or coolness?
Yes, there's warmth.
Sometimes, for my limbs,
I imagine the blood coursing through my limbs,
and then a sense of heat or energy
seems noticeable.
So with my limbs, it's different.
If I do that a little bit...
That's good.
So there's four, though.
That's quite a lot already.
And then what about the breath?
Can you notice when you're breathing?
Can you notice that the body moves with the breath?
I mean, just naturally?
Yes.
So where do you feel that?
I mean, is it just up here?
In my throat.
Where the air moves.
Not so easily, but, you know,
the whole torso.
So now we've got us doing pretty good.
We've got four limbs in the torso.
Okay, that's great.
And what about your face?
When you did that part of the instruction,
for some reason I felt like I could notice my face,
but not the entire head.
Not the entire head.
The head is difficult.
It is difficult because there's so much thinking.
And often...
And then it's got this sort of...
It can be a bit formless, yeah.
So that's pretty good, isn't it?
Yeah, so most of it's there.
Passing my hands and you are...
Or if I ask myself to notice the left hand,
what I notice is where the hands are touching.
And so what I notice really is both hands.
It's very hard to distinguish one from the other.
So that's okay, you can just know that.
I get the sense that the instruction would be just a practice.
Well, you've already shown that there is much more awareness
than you originally thought.
So that's one thing.
And then when we don't pay attention,
just like anything, anything we ignore,
if we have a plant and then we ignore it,
it shrivels off and dies, it doesn't survive,
it doesn't flourish.
If we ignore children,
they go off, well, they do all kinds of things,
but they go away,
eventually they don't bother anymore,
they give up, you know.
And it's the same with our body.
So if we ignore it,
it's like it's kind of given up on the mind.
The body and mind are meant to be in a relationship.
And if we don't pay attention to the body,
because what we tend to do is put a lot of attention on the thoughts,
but not very much attention on the physical body.
And, you know, when we do that,
then we're ignoring the body.
And so we try and put our attention on the right elbow
and they can't feel anything at all,
because it's not used to having any attention.
And we're used to, you know,
our attention being grasped by something.
It's got to be interesting.
So like you can feel the buttocks,
because it's kind of, okay, it's maybe a little bit,
starting to get a bit squashed.
So there's something going on there.
But because there's nothing very interesting happening
on the right elbow, you can't feel it.
But what I discovered,
because I basically had a lot of difficulty
having awareness of the body
when I was the first several years,
actually, that I was practicing.
And then I decided to pick it up as a practice,
because I needed to.
And now what I find is it's very easy.
It's like almost, I just have to remind myself
to be aware of the body.
And here it is, right here.
Feeling, you know.
But you have to keep bringing attention
and knowing those three kinds of feelings.
So there's pleasant feeling, painful feeling,
and neither pleasant nor painful feeling.
So what I would suggest is when you go to
those places where you don't feel anything,
you say, neither pleasant or painful feeling.
And just call it that.
And then go to the next part,
neither painful nor pleasant feeling,
and then maybe pleasant feeling.
And it might be that much of your body
is neither painful nor pleasant.
And then as you keep doing that,
it's like, it's an acknowledgement of the body.
And then it gradually starts to come into
presence more.
And then increasingly there is either
pleasant nor unpleasant feeling.
And then there will be some that's neutral.
But increasingly it will fall into
one of those categories.
And you'll feel more alive, actually,
and more connected.
And then, I guess,
when you get to where you can notice
any part of your body,
or almost any part,
as soon as you put your attention to it,
since your body is in a way you,
that must be a great thing in a way.
Does it feel that way?
It feels...
Well, it's like the body and the mind are integrated.
It's not that the body is you,
but the body and mind are integrated.
And they affect each other.
And the path is about
being with this body and mind.
That's basically what it is.
It's coming back to this...
It's using this body and mind as a teacher.
So here it is.
We've got this amazing teacher,
and then we kind of check out.
So it's more like...
It's not always pleasant.
Sometimes it can be quite intense
and quite difficult, painful,
but sometimes it can be wonderful
and peaceful and pleasurable.
He has all of those.
But it's more that the important thing
is that there is presence.
That's what's important.
So as you practice,
what's...
the things that are arising in consciousness
don't matter so much.
It's the fact of being conscious that's important.
It's the fact that there is awareness
that really, really matters,
not that the awareness is with something pleasant
or painful or neither.
And that develops over time
with practice.
And that's the place of real freedom.
Because then the awareness itself is not...
It's not really making any deals
with life anymore.
It's with this.
And there's great freedom in that.
This is very helpful.
Okay, one more question.
No, it has to be recorded.
Oh, it's being recorded.
Okay, so it makes a lot of sense
what you're saying about
staying with your feeling
and allowing your feeling
to present itself
and then become more clear
of where it comes from.
And your mindset is more clear.
But what if your mindset
is...
you have a distorted mindset
about your body?
I think most of us do.
That's why I spoke about it, actually.
I think most of us do have a distorted mindset.
We have a...
We either perceive it
as being different to how it is.
Like some people feel
that they're very thin
when they're not very thin.
Or they feel that they're enormously fat
when they're not. You have those things.
I mean, when it's actually
like an eating disorder,
it's really difficult
because it's a very distorted perception.
But I know a woman
who...she was actually on the verge of death
through anorexia.
Oh, really?
Okay.
So she's been twice anorexia once
when she was in her teens.
And then again in her early 30s
or something like that.
And she was really very, very seriously ill.
So there's different categories.
And she was at the point of
near imminent death.
That's the category she was in.
And somehow
she decided
to live.
So she could have just gone with it
and died, you know.
But she decided she wanted to live
and she wanted to get on with her life.
And she had a practice.
And she did actually end up in hospital.
I mean, she needed to be in hospital.
And
for some time
there was no way that she could just be with the body.
All she could do
was to follow the program each
and, you know,
do the things that she had to do
and start to clear out
some of the causes, you know,
some of the stuff that had caused her
to go into that pattern in the first place.
And then over time
she kept, you know,
she had this kind of very clear
mindset that she wanted to get out of that pattern.
She knew it and she wanted to get out of it.
And she knew it was crazy.
She said it's like
a mental illness, you know.
Yeah, right.
And she kind of knew that.
And even though she had it, she knew it.
And so she just kept working with awareness
and eating
and doing all the things that she was told to do
to help get out of it.
And at times it was very, very difficult.
Very, very, very challenging.
And, you know, she'd feel all kinds of
very strong emotions would come out
is what protects
an anorexic person from feeling,
basically.
So all of those feelings would come out
and it'd be really, really difficult.
And yet she knew that they are feelings
and they are changing.
And however difficult it may be,
if I just stay with it, it'll be okay.
So she had that refuge.
And over time she, you know,
basically got completely
cured herself,
actually, of anorexia.
And now she's
amazing.
She eats in a very
healthy way
in terms of, I don't mean only healthy,
but in terms of she can enjoy eating.
She'll eat
with people. So she can enjoy eating.
She's strong.
She looks really kind of muscular
and healthy.
You'd never imagine that this is the same person
who almost died of anorexia.
And it took that strong intention
to really want to get out of it
because it's difficult.
And their understanding that
it's a feeling
and a thought that's happening
and a feeling and a thought can't actually
harm me.
That's also a very important part of it.
Because what we tend to do is we take
the feelings to be real and personal
and then we can't bear them. And so we do
something to get away.
And we take the thoughts to be real and personal.
We don't want to be with them so we do something
so it's having that courage really
to be willing to face
those
things, those feelings and thoughts
and allow them to change.
Knowing that they change.
Yeah.
And I think having a supportive
environment, loving people
and people who encourage
is really, really important too.
Yeah.
Wherever they may be.
It can be done.
So
we're a little bit over time and I'd like to
just let people know I don't have flyers
but so there are a few things
at the Vihara
or connected with the Vihara. So if you've got a pen
and paper you can write it down.
So
on the 27th of May
we're going to have a
daylong. I think that's a Sunday.
We have a daylong at Aloka Vihara
and all of this information
you can look on our website. So there are cards over there
and it'll give you all the information.
There's a daylong
it's a Wessec daylong
because it's the Wessec month.
So everyone's welcome. There's no registration
you can just come
and bring a dish to share.
So we have a shared meal.
And on the

Aya Santhita and I will be teaching
a retreat at Spirit Rock.
It's a Dana retreat
and there are still spaces if anyone wants
to attend that retreat.
So it's from the 5th until the 10th
sorry it's 5th until the 10th of June.
June 5th till 10th.
And also it's a long way in the future
but also to let you know that every year
we have a new year retreat.
It varies in length and this coming year
it's going to be a week long. Last year
it was two weeks.
We'll be holding it at the
Insight Meditation
Retreat Center.
We got this long letter from
Gil saying we don't have a cook
we don't have managers
and we're like well that's perfect for us.
We don't have beds.
We didn't mention the beds.
And that will be from the 26th
of December until the 1st of January
and that's also a Dana retreat.
Everyone's welcome.
There's not actually registration yet
but if you want to save the date
that's happening.
Okay.
So let's end the video.
