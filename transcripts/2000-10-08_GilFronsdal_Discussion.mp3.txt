 Well, I had in mind a talk which I'll probably give, but just before coming in to sit down, Steve mentioned to me about the very distressing situation in the Near East with the Palestinians and Israelis. And he asked me if we would do a loving kindness meditation for the situation. And for my various reasons, my own reasons perhaps, I didn't think I wanted to go out at any time during the sitting for that, but I was very moved. I mean, very moved by the whole situation reading about it, but also feeling Steve's concern as he brought it up. And so I'm sitting here kind of with, you know, with these two things. Can you hear okay? Is it working? Is that working anymore? If you can't hear very well, maybe I need to bring it closer. So it works better now. Should I repeat what I said? Yeah. So I have these two currents of concern going through me right now. One is the topic of the talk I was going to give, which maybe can be tied into the second concern, which is what Steve brought up. And I think for some people here in this room, the situation in Israel and Palestine is probably quite distressing. And Steve asked if we could do some loving kindness for the situation. And I just thought, just bringing it up. And if someone wants, if some of you want to talk about your feelings, maybe Steve has my feelings about it. It might be nice to hear about that little bit. And then maybe that could be tied into the talk. You want to say anything, Steve? Well, it was that an article reading this morning in the paper, we're talking about the hatred. Well, it's obviously the hatred Palestinians feel for Israelis. We're also talking about the hatred Israelis feel for Palestinians and not only people who are on the right in Israel, but now people on the left, a lot of deep resentments that have always been there for years and years. And something I was thought about is everybody's gone around for the last 10 years trying to build a peace plan until people come to terms with that. As this week, there's a lot of frightful with the people of Yugoslavia coming, they may be starting to come to terms with that until people get rid of their hatred and animosity for each other. They can never be real peace. That's why I spoke to Gail, not looking for solutions, but that each side come to terms with their hatred. And if they give up the hatred, then the peace will lastly flow after that. Please. Yes, there's certainly a bit of interest to me in that my wife is Israeli, and my son went back to Israel last week. And I find that my reaction to it is that I'm not Israeli, I promise me, I'll send you to Israel. But I find myself, it's very difficult not to react to these kind of situations. I try to be conservative, but you and there's so much propaganda, there's so much attempt to persuade people to think certain things. A lot of it seems to be quite destructive in terms of influencing our opinion on either side. And there's so much effort to make, it seems like to create additional attention. I think the talk will be aware of the fact that there is a lot of effort being made to persuade people to think one way or the other. A lot of the effort has not been the best interest to me. And that's the unfortunate thing. It seems like even when one tries to be helpful, but being supportive to one side or the other, it seems like it doesn't contribute very much. So my sense is that just as it's very difficult to have a conversation, so much effort is putting into the law of this kind of thing to explain to people trying to understand, and it's really complicated. I really would like to surmise this is very most of the people I've been learning to be able to communicate with them, to spend time with them, really. And it's interesting to hear their perspective because in many ways there's also an understanding on their part. There's also this fear, and there seems to be so much fear between the lives and all of this. Fear I won't say, and this makes it difficult to see it beyond the fear. And it seems to be really helpful to see the attention of fear at this point. Thank you. Yeah. Well, what I just wanted to mention here today is we're very many of the people that are trying to find out that tomorrow, tonight is a good evening, but now as long as the day of atonement, and during this period, we should write these, return them to our higher selves. And this is a time for each individual to think about healing. And one of the traditions in the museum is that the girl alone, the healing of the parent of the world at large. It seems to me incredibly funny that this concert is going to be out of place during this period. I have no advice for anyone, not just a mindfulness kind of around the world. Sometimes, sometimes, you know, the worst of all the day is atonement, as well as the day of atonement, which is a clever, meaningful work like which always reminds me of interbeing, which is the core in some ways of this problem. The number of overlaps within days of religious importance and family. Family of many interests is more than coincidental in my opinion. 3800 years ago, here at home, it's not only the father of Isaac, a Jew, but an additional Muslim, and this is in many ways the mother of all family views. And that in 1982, the man who, the Israeli general who walked into the holy site two weeks ago to get in this shirom slaughtered many Palestinians in the Shaquille Lebanese camp and chose to, two weeks ago, remind Palestinians that they're in dry way. But the only war was started 27 years ago on the most holy day by Arabs to remind shirom that he had, in fact, committed this atrocity on Resha Shonah 28 years ago, 18 years ago. Three weeks ago, probably the most prominent Palestinian in the Bay Area in terms of dialogue and peace died suddenly while meeting a great cathedral with a group of Jews and Palestinians trying to reach peace on a personal level who understood that governments can do so much in the face of people to people hatred. And he died on the podium as he was speaking. And the people to people contact was put to a real test. I was, with some trepidation, were honored this good man and good friend, went to his family's house and entered two rooms of people dressed in black. One of all the statue of the Palestinian man and one of all black, baled Palestinian women. And I felt like I and Jews stood out like a sore thumb and had wanted to run. But I did it. And after a bit of hustlements, I was actually incorporated into that group. People understood that I was trying to make a gesture of peace. And I was fed and I was shepherded with the rest of me. And although I knew the gentleman who was the only Jew there, in many ways for me, the best of a mindfulness practice is absolutely no different from the best of what other wise people have said through the ages. But to me, a daily practice, given my thickheadedness, is necessary because when I had one day of tone into the year, at the best within three weeks, write speeches down the drain and gossip is bad. 55 years, that's my fault on breakfast. Usually I don't get out of service without it. So it all ties together. And this is just one example of two sets of brothers and sisters going at it. But I have no doubt that if we delve into the hard tradition, we can find the same. In terms of dates and coincidences, tomorrow is not only a day of atonement, but also in America, the Columbus Day, which for some people, they prefer to be called genocide day. So this is a strong talk. It'd be nice maybe if other people have feelings hearing all this, if you would speak your reflections or your concerns or just your feelings, what it's like to hear this. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. I think it's a very good question. It's just getting help. It's just that we can set people on the path of just feeling themselves and maybe it'll be a similar feeling. When I was studying Zen many years ago, the Zen teacher I studied with said that he talked a little bit about the time of people protesting for nuclear disarmament and various things. He talked about non-violence and engaged Buddhism. He said that Gandhi's contribution to Buddhism, as he called it, was Buddhism emphasizes the importance of sitting, being mindful, sitting, composing oneself, settling oneself on oneself, facing oneself deeply, maybe healing the divisions that exist within ourselves. The symbolic way of talking about that is to talk about sitting. Buddhism emphasizes sitting. Gandhi's contribution to Buddhism was that he said that it matters where you choose to sit. If you choose to sit in the privacy of your own comfortable home, perhaps, that has a very different effect than if you choose to sit on the railroad tracks of going into someplace where they're building nuclear weapons, or if you sit on the border of the Gaza Strip in Israel or something, it matters where we put ourselves. There are many ways of putting ourselves, one is physically in places, but also is to give ourselves some time to listen and hear about some of the things going on in the world. Many people come to a Sunday morning program where there's going to be Dharma, and maybe what they want is they want to be inspired. They want to be able to leave and feel really inspired and uplifted by it. But if that's the only thing that happens in a Dharma setting, then we haven't learned much about the necessity of sitting ourselves in the midst of the world's suffering, and including that as part of what we are mindful of. If our mindfulness is only about our own well-being, then I don't think it's going to be very realistic. So I feel very welcoming that these kinds of issues get brought up today. Maybe we won't leave uplifted, but maybe we'll leave in different ways. It's said in Buddhism that compassion is one of the primary motivations for spiritual practice, and that compassion gives birth to two forms of motivation, and both of them are, it's very important to understand both of them. One is the motivation, the compassion and motivation to do something about that. They'd go out in the world and help, or help a neighbor in distress, or whatever. And the other is to, sometimes we can't do that. Sometimes it doesn't make sense to do that. Sometimes our individual acts as it's not going to help necessarily what goes on in Palestine, or what's going on in Chechnya, or what's going on in Indonesia, what's going on in the litany of countries where there's problems is huge. But rather we can see those things and feel those things and be affected by them, and then being affected by them, feel motivated to at least work on ourselves, to clarify ourselves, to make ourselves someone who doesn't hate, to make ourselves someone who's healed of their divisions within themselves. And these two sources of motivations I think are very important. When we can act, then it's very important to feel like you're following through. And when we can't act directly in a situation, then at least we feel like, we don't feel like it's hopeless, at least we feel that there's something we can, some direction we can put that energy, and that energy can go into our deepening, our practice, becoming more peaceful ourselves. So to sit, it matters where we sit. And so we sit in the world that has the kind of things we're talking about today. So what is it like for some of you to, perhaps some of you have been successful at not reading the papers or not paying attention to those things, and some of you, it's all too familiar. Some of you, it's happening in your own backyards. You know, it's, and probably all of us have some backyard where something is happening. I'm really impressed by how few people in the world are not in some way deeply affected by some either personal or cultural tragedy, either through themselves directly or through their relatives or their family or going back a few generations. And so we are such people. And one of the sources of suffering is to ignore our suffering. And sometimes it's very important as, you know, as Gandhi's contribution to Buddhism implies that it matters where we sit. It matters that we take time to sit in the midst of the suffering and recognize it and have a place for it, and not just simply turn away from it or use spirituality in a kind of narcissistic way to kind of help us feel better and self, you know, improve ourselves, feel comfortable ourselves, where the rest of the world goes untouched. So who wants to speak now? Please. I want you just to acknowledge the suffering and the and getting to know where any of us is, but frustration seems not to scare more of those countries, what's going on in that country. And there's the part of being aware of this kind of mental world and some frustration that you what can I do and then the part of, well, I can do my own work, you know, I can be peaceful and make sure that I can get rid of the future. So in a rare way, if I work on myself, that's maybe ignoring this. Right. Yeah, I don't have a formulaic answer to that. I think that's it's a matter of each person reflecting for themselves. In a sense, it's possible not to see them as being so separate from each other. Hopefully, if we're engaged in some kind of work in the world, we can also feel or just know that or bring our mindfulness practice to bear also and how we function or how we respond to react to that social action so that the very very personal purification is going on in the context of doing the work. But we have lots of examples of people who maybe weren't ready personally to do social work and they just go out and to create more harm out of their ignorance. And because their motivations are not maybe quite biased. So maybe that, you know, those people, it's better they look off and do some kind of personal work first and really clarify their motivations before they do the kind of more social work. So hopefully we have the wisdom, if we pay attention, to know what we need to do and where the balance is. But there's another way of looking at this in a sense, perhaps, is we respond to what comes our way. And today Steve came with this issue about Israel and Palestine. And I thought they had a lot of power for him. And it has a lot of power for me as I read the paper and what's going on there. And so I felt somehow that I didn't want to ignore it. I felt like this particular suffering showed up. And so the response was not to turn away from it, but give it some space, give it some time. And I felt it was very important to give it some time in this group. I felt a little bit awkward to do so because, you know, it's not exactly an uplifting Sunday morning. But I feel it's very real. And if something very real like this shows up in the midst of us, I think it's very important to take the time to be there for it and not to kind of ignore it. And for me, sitting here with that, I mean, it came my way. It came our way. It showed up in the middle of us here. And so for me, since this is what's happening, I don't see a difference between the social outreach kind of approach and the personal approach. It's all happening right here for me as we're sitting here talking about it. Yeah, we don't know what's going to happen. I mean, it's possible that because of the tremendous suffering in there in that part of the world, that sometimes only because of tremendous suffering and tension can some actually new solution arise. My dream is that for years now has been that they actually, I have this dream that it's the women of that part of the world are going to make a difference, not the men. And my dream has been that the Palestinian women and the Israeli women, the mothers of dead children, and that they all put on white clothes and make some large action. They march towards Jerusalem or something. And you have hundreds of thousands of women marching with their children saying, we've done this enough. There has to be a stop to it. The men have tried to work it out for 50 years now or 2000 years or whatever. And sooner or later, we have to declare that they failed. And let's do it ourselves now a different way. And it's maybe utopian kind of thinking, but sometimes when things get really bad, they can't turn. And sometimes things get really bad and then they get worse. We don't know. So I don't know what the lesson exactly here is, except that it's very important to always stay open to new possibilities. And but new possibilities is, they could also be worse and they could be better. And but, but some openness and open possibilities, some sense of unknown, not to be fixed. So I think it's very helpful because what you see is when people are polarized, they tend not to see the other person as someone who has open possibilities. They see the other, as someone who has, you know, only through their bias. And so you can't, you know, the other person is not capable then of changing. When I was in Israel some years ago, the, to be fair, I should say, I should say probably the story in both sides, but because I believe you can find in both sides, but I went, you know, I was visiting the Jewish parts of Israel and, and I went into Israeli tourist office to ask about visiting the Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank or in Gaza Strip. And because I went to see that part of Israel, that part of the world, and I didn't want to kind of just live in this more. It was, it was really kind of, it was kind of like being in Israel was a little bit surrealistic because I had variables, you know, everything was so, so, so comfortable and so sanitary, sanitized or something in terms of everything I've read, I've read for years and years, you know, with the difficulties in the newspapers, and to be there is like, that was happening on a different planet, going around some of the neighborhoods I was going in. So there, I'll go, I'll go to, so I asked to go visit some of these camps and Palestinians. So I, so I, I thought you'd go into a tourist agency, you know, and ask, you know, how does this get arranged? And maybe that was stupid, but anyway, the response from the woman behind the counter was, why would you want to go see those dogs? And to hear someone talk about the Palestinian as dogs, especially someone in a government agency who was a tourist agency, I mean, that just stunned me. So that's an example of someone, you know, you hold someone else in a fixed view, and if someone is dogs, then maybe you can't really expect any change. So maybe so, maybe not, you know, implies you have to be open to the other person as capable of changing. And if they're capable of changing, then they can be changed for the better, that we never know if it will. Yes, please. Beautiful. I hear all these stories this morning, and I'm really reminded how that formula of compassion is a moment in my life. It's a present felt experience, and I'm often aware too of how my perceptions or my tendency to give meaning to things sometimes blocks my capacity to feel compassion for what I witnessed. And so for me, it's struggling for that balance to understand both sides, and yet to know that right now, what's called for is compassion. Not second-guessing, not attributing meaning, but just compassion, because I know there's division, and I know that that means healing, and compassion is what's called for. There was someone I read some years ago who's approached the world peace. Maybe some of you know it better than I, the story. Maybe it was a movement of people who did this, but they go around to different trouble spots in the world, and they would go with a clipboard or something, or tape recorder, and they would say, they just show up and stop kind of so-called ordinary citizens on the streets and say, would you be willing to tell me about your suffering, or your distress, or your difficulties? And I mean, I'd like to, I'm an American or something, I just like to hear what it's like for you. And to have an American going to these countries, because America, you know, it's kind of like people look up to it in many ways, and there's a great power. And the theory, I guess, was that to simply go and listen, to go there and know that, to have them feel like someone really cared and was listening, that in itself was significant. And it wasn't a matter of simply going there and offering solutions, but just going there and willing to listen to what was going on. It's called, at least one of the components is called the compassionate listening project. It goes to the world inside of the thing, or the Buddhist, the phrase compassionate listening, it's like, that's the primary context. Yeah. I mean, you've always watched in politics. Please. And in a way, it created a sense of peace and worth each other. And even from the matter, that's what I come with at a tent. And there's always problems listening to from all around the country. Some politics has gotten involved. So even when your tent is bad, it keeps its soul keeping such a challenge to create different possibilities and characteristics. Please. I'm not sure, but this is a little bit of what we're talking about. It's okay just to get that I'm sure I'm over there. Is there a human interest story? Can you speak up, please? It's okay. I'd like to share a little bit of a human interest story. I know I mentioned that my wife is a girl. It's kind of titled, and I was a peace war law here in the end of 1971-72. In 1973, I went to Israel and went to the US. And I met this person, and it was calling. And we had fallen in love with him since 1973. And I was going to go back. I'd been on the state's sake from when I went. And I came back to the Midwest of Israel. My family requires me to go back to Israel. But the war broke out in 1973, the old war. And my girlfriend had to go into the military. So we wrote, and it was difficult for us because she couldn't get out of the military. And when I was something half-assed, she would have given me. But her parents wouldn't accept their relationship because I was my Jewish and she was an Israeli Jewish. And certainly the sense of nationalism is also much stronger at that time because of the war. So we wrote for months and months, and I figured out how we would get back together. Well, it gets to the point where we both had to accept that the fact that she was Israeli and I was an American and that she was Jewish and I was not, and that her parents were opposed to the situation. We kind of let go of our training. And so years passed by, and it was about 22, 22 years that I had gone about. And this was about four years ago. And I had been in a long marriage and it was one period of course. And afterwards I decided many years I had thought about writing chapter and seeing what was going on in her life and had never really forgotten about her. And that I really didn't see that there was a point in doing it up until then. So I sent a letter to the Kibbutz for very more than I had read about four years ago. And she didn't look there anymore. But someone who lived in the Kibbutz took the letter to her. And she was brought back and she had tried to find me over the years that we were apart and that she couldn't find me because she did find someone who knew my mother and found my mother that my mother wouldn't give any information back because I was married. So this is what I found out four years ago as I finally reached her. So she asked if she could come to see me. And so I said it would be okay. So she came to the States about four years ago to see me. And so now it's been 22 years since we last saw it today. I was in Israel. And it was very clear after we were together about two minutes that nothing had really changed for us in all the years that we were apart. So we worked out a way over the last couple of years so that she could end up here. What happened was she ended up moving here a couple of years ago with her children. And I moved out here last October and her and I were married about October. And now I live in Selah, Crandall, in Sunnyvale. And she's just a helpful black woman from her children and their father and them. So that's how I've been up here here. It's all connected to the fact that I live in Israel, almost to Israel. So it is interesting how things work out sometimes and how things come around sometimes things that work maybe want to be tend to get there. That's a lot of patience. In terms of the people in my ear, we were patients and that's something that I quite good now. But last night I was sitting with her. I don't know if you're the daughter of Grace Chaun. We were talking about a situation about this plan. And what's so complicated of course is that I even hear from her daughter the sense of compassion and the concern she has to the Palestinian people who's talking about the suffering that they're going through and how she wishes to be with them. So it's beyond my confidence in some ways to see that there's this concern from the same people that live there that still have to be in this situation of suffering. I'm not really sure why I told this story because I find it kind of relative to just the fact that things turn to work out sometimes. Well, I thank you all and I encourage you all to remember that sitting is very important, but where you sit is also very important, meaning that it means various things. But when the world comes your way, as it always does, don't turn away from it as we did today. Just sit and be willing to listen. If your mindfulness practice doesn't allow you to stay present and listen to what's actually going on, then you should probably do something different. So thank you for this morning and I wish you all well.
