So I invite you to start by finding a comfortable position as loving kindness for oneself really starts with offering ourselves a position that's supportive, that really expresses care that we have for our body. 
And for this particular practice, if sitting is painful, you can practice in any position that allows you to be physically supported while staying alert in a week. 
Let's start with a few deep breaths, inhaling through the nose, drawing the breath all the way down, letting the belly expand, then exhaling through your mouth, releasing the breath fully. 
Taking a few breaths this way, inhaling through the nose, exhaling through the mouth, and actually making a sound socially acceptable here for this practice. 
Ah, letting go of the cares of the day. 
Ah, deep intentional breaths. 
Ah, helping to bring you here, relaxing the body, softening, letting go. 
Now allowing the breath to return to its natural pace, whether it's deep or shallow, fast or slow, whatever it is, letting it be, letting it relax into its natural pace. 
Now bringing attention to your physical presence, to your body in this room. 
Starting with your forehead, feeling relaxation in your forehead, softening the forehead, softening the eyes, softening the jaw, the whole face, letting the tongue relax in your mouth. 
Letting your whole face soften, we often hold a lot of tension in our face. 
Feeling the relaxation in the lips, chin, ears, moving down to the neck, softly touching your shoulders and back with your attention. 
And if there is any tension, softening and letting go, especially if you sit at the computer, the neck and shoulders are places for tension. 
Just softening, bringing some care to these areas of the body. 
Feeling down your arms, softening, relaxing your hands, resting gently, moving the attention to your chest, to your belly, also another place that we often hold tension. 
Relaxing, softening, with each breath, softening, relaxing, brushing your back with a gentle attention. 
Moving down to your sitting area, softening, relaxing, especially on the exhale, softening your legs, relaxing your knee, lower legs, feet. 
Feeling the touch point, so wear your feet, touch the floor. 
Now bringing your attention to your whole body sitting here in this room, from the inside. 
What does it feel like to be in this body right now? Having a sense of curiosity about it. 
There are areas of coolness, heat, is there tingling anywhere in your body? Tickleness, hardness, around the touch points. 
Is there tightness anywhere? Just having curiosity. 
There might be one sensation that attracts your attention, there may be many. 
Now bringing your attention to the sensation of your breathing in your body. 
Wherever it's easiest for you to feel your breath, could be your abdomen, the rise and fall of the abdomen, could be your chest, expanding and contracting. 
Or maybe your nostrils, right over your lip, feeling the rush of air, the coolness as you breathe in, and the heat of the air rushing out as you breathe out. 
It will take you a few minutes of breathing meditation to settle the mind. 
And if you notice your mind wandering as part of this practice, notice where your mind has gone, and softly and gently escort it back to the sensation of your breath. 
And if you notice your mind wandering as part of this practice, notice where your mind has gone. 
And if you notice your mind wandering as part of this practice, notice where your mind has gone. 
And if you notice your mind wandering as part of this practice, notice where your mind has gone. 
Now bring to mind someone that you care about. 
It could be a relative, a dear friend, a child, or a pet, someone whom when you think about them, feelings of care naturally flow in your heart and your relationship is not very complicated. 
See this being this person in front of you. 
Imagine them in front of you in your mind's eye. 
Get a feel for them, a felt sense for what they're like. 
Perhaps seeing them happy, seeing them in action, doing what they do in their natural environment. 
Or perhaps tapping into a memory of an interaction that you had with them, something they did for you, a nice interaction that lit up your heart. 
And now bring attention to how you feel. 
Thoughts or feelings of gratitude or warmth that thinking about your loved one evokes. 
Tapping into that feeling, not creating it, not forcing it, just tapping into it and feeling it and helping it grow. 
If you're not feeling anything, that's fine too, it's normal. 
We're just cultivating the seeds of loving kindness here. 
So that feeling of warmth or kindness or good wishes, that is loving kindness. 
See if you can tap into that and direct good wishes towards your loved one. 
In your own mind, you can silently recite for this friend or loved one or this being, may you be happy, may you be healthy and strong, may you be safe, may your life unfold with ease or any sentences that work for you. 
Staying in touch with the feeling of kindness and goodwill for this person. 
Bringing awareness to the area around your physical heart and noticing how this area gently expands or fills when breathing in and out. 
For a few breaths, imagine you could directly inhale into the center of your chest, expanding the chest, lungs and heart. 
Imagine that you could directly exhale from the center of your chest. 
Next, create in your mind a compassionate image that represents qualities of care, love, kindness, wisdom, strength, acceptance, nurturing. 
Take a few moments and choose or create an image in your mind. 
Whatever is meaningful for you could be a tree, well-rooted, could be the ocean, or the sun, radiating heat, or it could be a loved one, someone who really cares about you, or a figure, maybe a teacher whom you really respect and regard highly, or could be an image from nature. 
Now see yourself in the presence of the source of care and love and imagine yourself, the recipient of this being, this person's care and love and good wishes. 
Imagine that this being is radiating care and in their presence you feel completely safe and completely taking care of yourself, you don't have to be anyone, you can just relax and they see you, they accept you just as you are, and they love you just as you are. 
You can completely relax and be yourself. 
Being in the presence of this unconditional love and care and feeling that directed towards you, see if that can light up your own care for yourself, just continuing that thread of care. 
Perhaps wishing yourself by reciting, may I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be safe from inner and outer harm, may I be peaceful, may I have ease in my heart and in my life, or whatever works for you, whatever wish you have for yourself right now, perhaps may I be free from stress and sorrow and anxiety, may I know joy in my heart, not to force it, not to push it, just gently tap into the feeling of care or perhaps if this is a stretch you may try, may I open to the possibility of holding myself with kindness, may I someday hold myself with care and love, may I hold whatever I'm feeling right now with gentleness, whatever it is. 
Thank you. 
Now ask yourself this question in this moment. 
What is most important? In this moment, what is most important? In this moment, what is most important? As you reflect on this question, perhaps rising up from a place deep within, there's a desire for true happiness, connection and meaning. 
And it may be enough to simply repeat the question in your own mind, even if answers don't come up. 
In this moment, what is most important? Acknowledge this aspiration for genuine happiness, for meaning, wholeness, inner peace, fulfillment and connection with others, as a fundamental aspect of your being. 
May I be happy, may I know peace and joy. 
Now bring to mind something you appreciate about yourself. 
Bring to mind something you've done by personal quality. 
Take a moment to really acknowledge this aspect of yourself. 
Bring to mind something you appreciate about your life. 
Perhaps something about your everyday life and opportunity, everyday pleasure perhaps you're grateful for. 
And now take a moment to feel gratitude in your heart for this aspect of your life. 
Let this feelings of gratitude and appreciation for yourself and for your life permeate your heart like a warm glow. 
We'll spend the remaining few minutes of this sitting in silence. 
Let yourself be touched by a feeling of friendship towards yourself. 
As you let your mind simply rest under rhythm of your breath, or if you choose continuing with the loving kindness phrases for yourself. 
Thank you.
