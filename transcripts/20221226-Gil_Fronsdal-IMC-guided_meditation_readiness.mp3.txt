The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, good morning. I had to turn off the speakers.
The speaker system had been left completely on, so then I hear the boomic speakers that are above me in the wall.
And it's nicer just to be here with all of you without that extra voice coming in.
So, to begin, when we sit down to meditate,
we can ask ourselves, are we ready to be in the present moment?
Are we ready to be receptive and present and engage nicely in the present moment?
In a way, it might be interesting or evocative to say that the present moment is always ready for you.
Are you ready for it? Is the mind ready?
And this mind that we have can be busy and caught up in thoughts and ideas and feelings and agendas, preferences, many things.
That might interfere with the capacity to be ready to be available.
And ready available for this moment to receive, receptive.
And sometimes it takes part of the meditation, a lot of the meditation period,
for the mind to finally be present enough where we can say it's available to the present.
It's ready for the present. It's ready to allow something to grow and develop.
And one of those things is a greater readiness, a greater receptivity, a greater availability
to really feel, sense, be here in what can be called our experience.
And that's a choice expression because it means what we're experiencing, not what we're thinking so much.
What we're experiencing is always here in the present.
We might have agendas about it and preferences, but those interfere with our ability to be ready, available, receptive here.
So to begin this process of readying the mind to assume a meditation posture,
a posture itself that if someone saw you, could see that this posture is available for the present, is here, attentive, is awake, alert.
If you are sitting back a lot in a chair, take a few, maybe just two minutes or so, just sit up as straight as you would
if you suddenly heard a car come up to your house that sounded like the car of an old, very good friend,
like, oh, what's that I hear? And you sit up to kind of like pay attention. What's this?
Just maybe for a couple of minutes they get a sense of a certain kind of alertness which is already available for here.
Gently closing your eyes,
being receptive to the experience of your body, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths,
relaxing the body as you exhale, long exhale, maybe slightly longer, long enough to get your attention, it's time to breathe in.
So the inhale is a little bit more conscious than automatic.
Letting your breathing return to normal.
And what would it be like now sitting here quietly to establish a readiness of mind, readiness of attention,
for whatever might happen during this meditation that you're available to be attentive,
a kind of readiness where nothing is a surprise, is just one more thing to, or this too, is the experience of the moment.
A readiness which is not assertive, but rather receptive, available,
maybe ready, available, even for what would be unexpected.
Relaxing the body where the more relaxed you are,
the more receptive, ready, available.
And then settling into the experience of breathing, settled and ready,
as if each breath is a new event, each breath as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
If this time now was the beginning of the meditation, would your readiness be different?
Your receptivity, availability to the present moment, has it changed over these minutes?
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it, available as the breath is.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it.
Relaxing the body as if it's unique and almost like the first breath,
ready for it.
And as we come to the end of this sitting,
is there something about how you are right now that feels more ready,
available in a relaxed way, in a receptive way?
Maybe it's in your body.
Maybe it's in your mind or your heart.
Some part of you is more settled at ease so that it's open and available
for whatever, here and now.
And then coming to the end of this sitting to invite into your mind,
your attention, your thoughts, other people who you might encounter today,
people you know, strangers on the street, stores,
people that you might somehow encounter on your screen and media.
Is there a way of being ready, receptive to others that helps you tap into
appreciation of others, goodwill of others for others?
A generosity of spirit, of attention for others.
May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe,
may all beings be peaceful, may all beings be free.
...
Thank you.
