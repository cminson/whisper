Here we go.
Great. So hello and welcome to Happy Hour, friends, wherever in the world you are joining from.
It's lovely to be with you, lovely to sit together.
So some of you might know that this week I'm subbing for Gail and for the 7 a.m.
And the theme for this week I'm exploring is compassion.
It is compassion, a theme that we've explored, of course, a lot in Happy Hour.
And I wanted to explore and invite us to practice with very subtle, very gentle, quiet compassion this evening with the breath, just very subtle, very...
Yeah, let it be in the background, in the foreground background in a way, suffusing our breath, suffusing this moment.
And we'll have a pretty quiet, that's my intention at least, we'll see what arise.
Guided meditation tonight to really settle into the space with silence, with kindness, with warmth, and holding whatever challenges there might be with compassion, with kindness.
So that's the plan and let's practice together.
So arriving, arriving in this moment in time.
In our bodies, on the cushion or the chair, relaxing, softening the body.
And however the body is in this moment inviting, the body to soften, to relax, not pushing away any discomfort, but softening around it, softening around it, softening into it.
And letting the breath be supportive in this softening.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you.
And letting awareness connect and greet each breath in the body.
The entirety of the breath, the entirety of the out breath really support us to land, especially if we're feeling restless or distracted.
Connecting with the entirety of the breath, not as assured, not as a grim duty, but with care, with kindness towards ourselves.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And we allow and we invite kindness to be breathed in with each breath.
Breathe in and breathe it out.
Breathing in kindness, breathing out kindness, breathing in kindness towards this body.
Breathing out kindness, goodwill, friendliness around this body.
Not so much as an effortful breathing in, but letting it be breathed.
Imagining that the air around you is infused with kindness, so there is no other way.
There is no other way than to breathe in goodwill, kindness, friendliness into this heart, into this body, into these lungs, nourishing ourselves with goodwill.
Letting goodwill find its way to every cell of this body.
It's already available.
It's nowhere to work.
It's already here.
It's also breathed out.
It's so natural, natural, as natural as the breath itself, as breathing itself, automatic.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Maybe you experiment with greetings, kindness that's being breathed in with a smile.
Or maybe a smile shows up because it's quite lovely to be breathing in kindness and goodwill into the body and feeling nourished by it.
There's a natural gladness that arises.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Realizing that the conditions are like this right now, whatever the conditions are in the body, in your mind, in your heart, that it is like this right now.
And if there are any challenges present right now in the physical space or emotional space, letting this kindness that you breathe in, that's being breathed in the goodwill, the friendliness, meet, meet, really hold great space around whatever challenge there might be.
Thank you.
When difficulty is met with kindness with goodwill, this is compassion.
Meeting difficulty, pain, physical pain, emotional challenges, pain with kindness with gentleness, goodwill, is compassion for ourselves.
So let kindness be breathed in again, goodwill, continue to be breathed in, breathed out, and meeting whatever is necessary in this moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And don't make breathing in and out kindness into a hyperventilation or too much work. Let it be natural. It's just in the air around you. It's very subtle, very subtle. You're sitting in it.
It's infusing your body, your heart, its kindness, holding, whatever might be challenging.
