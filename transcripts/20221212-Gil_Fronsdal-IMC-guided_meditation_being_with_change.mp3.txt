Hello, and this Monday, welcome.
Happy to be here with you and some of you participated in this Saturday morning, a Saturday day, day long.
So there's maybe perhaps more continuity in the practice between the Friday and the Monday that you carry with you.
And one of the things I said Saturday about this practice of mindfulness is there comes a point where it's kind of a paradigm shift.
We see things in a different way than we usually do.
And I want to emphasize that here, as we begin this meditation, that there's a natural tendency enough to focus on, if we're in the present moment,
particularly with the experience with what's happening, to be concerned with how things are.
And so that expression, how things are, focuses on the present moment existence of what's happening.
And if you ask, you know, how are you, there's a lot of things that might contribute to that answer.
But if you try to explain it, you know, really how you're feeling, sensing what your experience is here, you might say something definitively.
But the Buddha's, but that kind of focus on a kind of a static, things as they are, can be seen as a little bit static, unchanging.
The Buddha's way of saying this, and what he emphasized in terms of insight practice, was not how things are,
but how they come to be, how they become, how they arise.
And it's a difference between focusing on the static part of our reality to dynamic,
to focus on how things are arising, appearing in the moment, being present, right there at the edge of time, the edge of time keeps arising,
appearing is here, with particular experiences that arise, that they appear.
Certainly some things persist, but to be a little bit kind of like on the front of a boat, just watching the boat move through the water,
as opposed to being in the back of the boat, or being in a large ocean liner where you're not even looking at the water,
because you're maybe inside in some big room, but to be kind of right there with how things appear,
how as the water comes and meets the boat, as the boat meets the water.
So things as they come to be.
And we can begin this with this paradigm shift with our breathing.
You say, how is your breathing?
You might say, my breathing is tight, my breathing is loose, my breathing is fast, it is slow.
And those are all accurate, but how is the breathing arising?
How is the breathing coming to be moment by moment?
And now we're into the process, seeing the process nature of our experience,
not the static kind of stepping back and generalizing, oh, the breathing is this way, is that way,
as opposed to how is the breathing come to be?
And then now we're focusing on how it's coming into awareness, how it's coming into experience.
The beginning of the in-breath, the arising of the in-breath, the expanding of the torso perhaps,
the beginning of the exhale and what happens, the cascading sensations of exhaling.
As the sensations come into being, they're at the beginning of experience.
So hopefully that's clear enough.
So to assume a meditation posture,
that's stable, rooted, grounded,
so that you can sit at the bow of the boat
without being tossed around too much by the waves that keep coming.
And if your eyes are open, gently lower the gaze.
And then with a gentle, relaxed gaze,
if it's comfortable, you can close your eyes.
And then to receive the appearing of an inhale,
the whole process of breathing in, taking a long, slow inhale,
the coming to be of an inhale.
Maybe the...
And then at the top of the inhale, there's the coming to be, coming into beginning.
It's beingness, it's appearance.
The beginning of an exhale, long exhale, is not just a single thing.
It's the unfolding of a process of the body contracting, diaphragm lifting.
In a sense, breathing, the body breathing is not a thing,
but it's a dynamic process of change.
We're constantly, something new is appearing.
Something new is growing, fading.
Relaxing into the breathing, relaxing the whole body as much as you can.
A tense body is kind of stationary, static.
A relaxed body has room and space for change, for movement, for...
for breathing to be unencumbered.
A very relaxed body.
A very relaxed body.
A very relaxed body.
A very relaxed body.
Chances are that if the mind is preoccupied in thoughts,
it's concerned closer with how things are,
or kind of relating to thoughts as things, as concepts,
as opposed to the process of thinking, the coming into being of a thought.
Every moment, things are coming into being.
This is the place where the meditation becomes settled, focused, relaxed,
allowing things to come into being moment to moment, getting out of the way,
letting the physical mental experiences arise and pass
as if there is a lot of space for things to come into being
and that you're ready and available for the next and the next.
Like an open window is available for the wind that blows through it.

Sometimes what arises elicits a response within us, a reaction.
That is just another arising, another appearing, another thing that comes into being.
Stay there at the edge of things coming into being, allowing them to fade away from attention
so you can be there for the next arising.
Like a bow of a boat that meets the water and then lets the water just slide off the side.

Be at ease with the ever changing nature of experience.
To be available and ready and open.
To ride along with how things change.
As they are always changing in some way or other.
The goal is to let go of fixations on anything.
And without fixations, without dwelling on anything in particular.
There is more possibility for being with what is ever happening in a friendly way, in a kind way.
Generosity and care.
As things come to be, may we meet it with our care.
May this meditation teach us.
Encourage us, inspire us to meet everything with open care, kindness.
So that this meditation that we do can benefit the world.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
Thank you.
