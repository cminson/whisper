 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello everyone. So, the topic is seclusion. The Pali word, the ancient Buddhist word for this seclusion is Viveka. And I evoke it because the English word seclusion is not very inspiring for most English-speaking people. But it's a very important term, a concept or a state, this idea of seclusion. And it's one of the core places that's most often used in the teachings of the Buddha is seclusion is the gate or the doorway into samadhi, into being really settled and focused here. And the Buddha talks about the bliss of seclusion. And he associates with all kinds of wonderful states. He associates with peace. He associates it with contentment. He associates it with being disentangled from entanglements with everything. It's a very positive. And so in India, the word Viveka has a lot of positive associations. I think maybe kind of like in the United States, I think the word independence has a lot of... like that gets people's attention, you know? And Viveka, I think, and it's a very important word in Indian culture in general. But what's interesting is that Hinduism, the word has a different meaning than what it has in Buddhism. In Buddhism, seclusion kind of makes the most sense as an English translation, you know, it doesn't inspire us the way the original context that Viveka did. So it makes sense in Buddhist context, but in the Hindu context, it means something different. And there it's more often translated into English as wisdom or discernment or discrimination or something really grand. You know, it's a really kind of intelligent discernment or understanding of what's going on. And how did these two religions end up with two different meanings of the word? The word Viveka means to separate something out, to distinguish something, to separate out. And in the Buddhist context, it became we're separating two things out, something that's healthy and from something that's unhealthy, something that's helpful and something that's not helpful. In the Hindu context, the most famous phrase in kind of the Hindu kind of canon is, I think it's from the Upanishads, is Viveka is to distinguish the real from the unreal. So it's there, again, what it means there is to separate out, to be able to see the distinction between two things so they can be separate. Because once you can see the difference between what's real and unreal, then in this Hindu approach, you want to focus on what's real, not what's unreal. In the Buddhist, we kind of avoid kind of these kinds of philosophical or metaphysical statements about real and what's real and unreal. But in the Buddhist context, it's often we're focusing on functionality, what functions for a particular purpose that leads to something useful and helpful. And so it's more functional. So there it became, the word seclusion became distinguishing between what's healthy and not healthy, or helpful and not helpful. And so one distinction, one separation that's seen is the difference between meditating in Grand Central Station at peak commute hours, or meditating in a quiet room, or meditating out in nature under a tree where it's really peaceful and quiet. So to distinguish that there's useful places to go meditate, and places that are maybe a little too chaotic for really that to work. And so the Buddhists put an emphasis, one of the meanings of seclusion is to take yourself someplace apart from the busyness, the loudness, the chaos of life, where things are simpler and quieter. So you're not so distracted, you can really take time to get to know yourself. And so that's a first kind of, some list, the first meaning of seclusion. It means to go on retreat, to retreat into a place where it's good and quiet to sit. And some people do that in their own home. They have a quieter place to go and meditate because, you know, if you meditate right next to, I don't know, the kitchen, you know, it may be not the best place or something, especially if someone's cooking and have the radio on at the same time. So to distinguish that this distinction is a valid distinction, a functionally useful distinction. But the more important one, the one about how it's an entryway into deeper meditation, is that its important distinction is a distinction between what is wholesome and unwholesome, the mental estates, the mental thoughts, the mental activity we have that's healthy for us to have and unhealthy for us, that's helpful for us to have and unhealthy for us. Once we make that distinction, then we can no longer invest a lot of energy and time into the unhealthy ones. The mind still makes them, they bubble up, but we're no longer believing in them, we're no longer trusting them, we're no longer invested in them, which many people are. Some people are really invested in their anger or in their hurt or in their greed or in their jealousy or... All kinds of things that we believe in, not consciously, but kind of, if you look at your mind and see what it does, wow, it really believes in the value of fear. I'm just completely locked into my fear and writing it and being it. But there's another way, so to no longer believe in those unhelpful states, no longer invest a lot into them, no longer attack them and try to destroy them, which is more unwholesomeness. There's another way, and this ability to see and distinguish a better way, a way of mindfulness, a way of kindness, a way of allowing something so that we can let it dissolve by itself. There's a lot of healthy ways of being, and so once we have that distinction, we're able to see that for ourselves, which takes mindfulness, takes wisdom, and there's what's useful to be involved in and what's not useful to be involved in. Then we separate ourselves from the unwholesome, and we choose the wholesome. So that is one of the main meanings of this word, viveka, in Buddhism, which is translated as seclusion. In that we're secluding ourselves or separating ourselves from the unwholesome states of mind, and to do that in a healthy way, an appropriate way. And again, the word seclusion in English probably doesn't do justice to this healthy separation, because seclusion kind of has some feeling sometimes of marginalizing something or shutting down something or closing ourselves off somehow. So that's not what we mean, but it means there's a path, and we choose the path that's more healthy for us. So it's only by doing that, by somehow quieting the unhealthy agitation of the mind, the hindrances in particular, that they become quiet enough that we feel now we're separated from them enough. To call it secluded from them might be a little bit awkward, but they're no longer so strong, they're no longer grabbing me, I'm no longer in their grip, and so now I'm separated from them enough for me to start becoming more concentrated, to be more focused. And then the third meaning of seclusion is that, this word viveka, is that it's a synonym for awakening itself, it's a synonym for non-clinging, it's a synonym for a profound peace. And so the Buddha talks about the peace of seclusion, he talks about the bliss of seclusion, and he talks about seclusion as kind of this freedom from clinging. So here also, what's important here is there's a distinction being made, a discrimination that's being made, between clinging and not clinging, and one is more healthy than the other. And once we have enough experience of non-clinging, that it's palpable or knowable, or we see that this is wise and healthy, then the idea is that because we see that distinction, we have more choice, we have more discernment, we have more ability to decide what do you invest in, what do you give yourself to, and the idea that you don't give yourself to the clinging, you give yourself to the non-clinging, which at some point as practice develops is accessible, you have a sense of it, you have a feel for it, it's kind of, you know, it's there also. And so when we give ourselves to the non-clinging, then there's Viveka from the clinging. And so awakening is a kind of Viveka, a discrimination, a wisdom, a discernment, an intelligence, that allows us to be apart from something that's unhealthy. So the word Viveka means to separate apart. In the Buddhist context, we translate it as seclusion. In the Hindu context, it's translated as discrimination, discernment, intelligence, wisdom, realization even sometimes. And because in both contexts, it means we're separating something apart and choosing the healthy one. So you might want to consider seclusion or Viveka, the separation. And one of the associations I have with it, which, you know, was inspired by the rain today these days, is that seclusion is cozy. Seclusion is this kind of like coming in, gathering together, and being kind of intimate here. This is good to be here, just like in a big storm. You know, here indoors, it's dry and warm, and the storm is like, gets your attention. You know, you're not thinking about politics anymore, you're thinking about just like, wow, this is nature, this is life. And it feels so cozy, so intimate, so nice to be here in a safe, good way. So that kind of way, oh, this is good to be secluded. It's good to be gathered together, intimate, cozy, away from all those pesky hindrances that seem to be following me. Following me everywhere I go. This is good, this feels good to be here. This is good to finally have a quieting of my hindrance, my clinging. So good. Now let me appreciate that, let me be close to it, let me be intimate, let me be cozy. And so, maybe one day we'll translate, in the Buddhist context, Viveka as cozy. Go to a foot of a tree, go and be cozy at the foot of a tree in an empty room. Go and be cozy, and cozy enter into deep meditation. Go be cozy so you don't have to cling anymore. So, Viveka, it's a very important term, but it's difficult to understand, the light of it, the bliss of it. And I'll end with a little story of one of the first, biggest, most important Indian spiritual teachers who came to the United States to have a big impact on bringing Eastern Indian spirituality to America. Was Swami, who in 1893 came to the first parliament of world religions in Chicago. It was a big event, and he gave us a talk that really had standing ovation and made a big impact on a lot of people. But his name was Vivekananda, the joy of Viveka. So, may you have the joy of Viveka, joy of seclusion. Thank you.
