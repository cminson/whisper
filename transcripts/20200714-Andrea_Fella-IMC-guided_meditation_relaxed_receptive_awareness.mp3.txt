Allowing awareness to receive whatever is obvious whenever it is already happening. 
Having become aware of how you are, there may be some recognition of places or areas of the body or of holding in the body or the mind, little tension perhaps, and perhaps being aware of that can allow there to be a softening. 
If there is any tension perhaps becoming aware of it can support a relaxation. 
Relaxation is a condition that there is some conscious access to at times, and it is a condition that can support our capacity for awareness and support the availability to be able to receive experience. 
So it can be useful to having taken kind of account or taken stock of how you are and if you notice there is tension in your system to see if there can be relaxation if the body can relax. 
There can be some times a little bit of conscious relaxation of the muscles of the body, a little bit of softening of mental tension when it is possible. 
So let me take a few moments to just see if there can be a conscious relaxation of areas of the body. 
Thank you. 
And then sometimes it is also useful where it is a little bit of extra connection to relaxation sometimes if instead of trying to consciously relax, you invite relaxation or request or see is the body in mind or does the body in mind know a way to relax that we don't consciously know. 
There is a kind of intelligence in our system sometimes that we can access through this mode of requesting, not trying to accomplish it, but just kind of asking the body and mind, can you show me how to relax a little more? Maybe dropping in this request or exploration. 
May the body relax, just dropping that in and then settling back and seeing what happens. 
Often I find when I drop that in, there is a deeper place of relaxation that happens. 
Maybe even sometimes a releasing of tension that I wasn't even consciously aware of. 
May the body relax. 
May the mind relax, mental tension, the mental tension relax. 
As the body and mind relax, whatever place of experience you're having in this moment, attuning, letting go of this conscious exploration of relaxation and attuning to again, how are you in this moment? What is obvious? Just receiving experience that is already happening. 
Perhaps noticing is there been a change from earlier when we first checked in to how we are. 
Attuning to your experience. 
It's possible to simply settle back and receive what's obvious moment after moment. 
The tension or the experience may shift from various domains between various domains of experience. 
It might be taking in hearing for a little while and then shifting to body sensations. 
Maybe between body sensations or to an emotional state or a thought. 
As long as you are aware, this is what's happening now. 
This is where the attention is right now. 
This is a way of being present and establishing mindfulness. 
This mindfulness awareness that we are exploring, creating a continuity of establishing this thread of awareness through time. 
This is the moment after moment. 
Receiving aware of the next most obvious thing. 
This is cultivating this continuity or establishment of mindfulness. 
For some of you, it may be supportive. 
If the mind is a little more being pulled out into thoughts and losing mindfulness. 
Not that it's shifting from experience to experience. 
That we can still be mindful of. 
If you're getting lost in things, something arises and the mind starts thinking about it and you find yourself some minutes later. 
Oh, thinking. 
Then it can be useful to choose something. 
The breath perhaps or the experience of hearing. 
There's a place to support the mind, to land, stabilize so that the awareness can become more continuous. 
Perhaps just the breathing, breathing in and breathing out. 
Aware of that experience. 
Receiving that aspect of experience. 
Do you like to receive a breath? Just let it show you what's happening around the breath rather than having your agenda to figure out what it's like to be experiencing the breath. 
Let the breath show you. 
Relax and receive the breath. 
Relax and receive the breath. 
And if you are choosing to attend to some particular experience such as the breath to support the continuity or the stabilizing of mindfulness you may notice that the attention may also recognize that other things are happening. 
You don't have to create some kind of setting up of a dichotomy there trying to push away those experiences. 
You can contain or connect to that experience of breathing in this case and be aware that there's breathing and hearing that's happening at the same time. 
Maybe body sensation and the breath, hearing and the breath, emotions and the breath. 
And this receptive mode of awareness can allow a very wide lens and even as we stabilize with one experience. 
Thank you. 
Continuing your exploration of a relaxed, receptive awareness. 
Exploring the possibility that even if the mind wanders when the mindfulness returns rather than the mindfulness getting constricted or tight around that just the return of mindfulness. 
Emphasizing or reconnecting to relax and receive, what's here now? Not a lot we can do about that moments of the mind wandering. 
But here, now in this moment, relax and receive again the experience. 
Exploring the cultivation of moment to moment mindfulness as it's possible.
