The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So today I wanted to do a guided meditation that encourages an opening to our emotional tone of experience.
We'll just start with a regular kind of settling in and connecting with what's happening.
So arriving with yourself in this space that you're in,
kind of simply understanding the context of where you are and how you are in this moment.
For me, the connecting at the beginning of a meditation feels like a gathering,
a very gentle gathering of the attention, a collecting, allowing the attention to begin to arrive here
with this body and mind as it actually is.
How are you right now? Not the kind of thinking about that question, but a feeling into how are you?
And seeing if there can be a relaxation of body
that's opening to how you are and potentially checking in in areas where you may be holding tension,
seeing if there can be a softening or relaxation,
maybe especially relaxing the face, the neck and shoulders,
maybe relaxing the arms, hands, chest and upper back,
softening across the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back,
relaxing the hips, the legs, the feet,
and then perhaps too, exploring the possibility of relaxing inside the body,
maybe the inside of the throat can soften and relax,
maybe the area around the heart can soften and relax,
maybe the stomach and the intestines can soften, release.
This relaxation supports our very natural capacity to be mindful, to be aware.
Mindfulness is kind of a natural possibility when we're not caught in thoughts, worries or concerns.
So when we relax the body, relax our thinking mind, relax worries and concerns,
and quite naturally we can be aware of what's happening here in the present moment
in a simple way. How's the body right now?
That's obvious in the body.
Letting it come to you, you don't have to do a work to look for anything.
Our awareness does a receiving very simply and naturally,
and so relax and explore the possibility of just being curious.
Here right now, how is the body right now?
Receiving sensations perhaps of contact points,
where your hips, back, hands and feet are contacting.
Maybe a breath,
maybe a general broader sense of the body for some,
perhaps a kind of a sense of energy or vibration through the body.
Also an area or aspect of experience that is very naturally received is the experience of hearing.
You don't have to work to hear, it just happens when there isn't this being pulled out,
thinking about things, worried about things.
So noticing that hearing is happening, hearing the sound of my voice and perhaps silence
in between the words, silence is also an aspect of hearing.
Maybe sounds in your environment.
Maybe we can relax and allow the experience of body,
the experience of hearing to simply show themselves.
Receiving what is obvious in this moment.
Thank you.
Another aspect of experience that's available
to be received is the emotional field or tone of experience,
the quality of our mind, our heart.
I'd like to invite you to explore or open to how are you in the heart right now?
What is the quality of the heart?
Maybe a sense of a kind of an emotional tone of experience.
Or maybe more of a sense of quality of the mind.
Sometimes it can be obvious and sometimes it can be quite quiet and subtle.
This is not a looking for, this is more of an invitation
opening to how is the mind right now?
As if a friend were asking in a very deep way, how are you?
Not meaning how's your body, but how are you?
Seeing if you can feel into that.
How is your heart right now?
You may be able to touch into this through a connection with the body
because our emotions, our mental states are very related and affect our bodies.
So asking this question, how are you in the heart?
There may be some resonance in the body that you might notice.
Maybe some specific sensations in the throat or mouth or face.
Maybe in the area of the torso there may be physical sensations connected with
how you are, how you are feeling, how you are in the heart.
Thoughts might also arise.
It's okay if a thought arises, just kind of notice.
Maybe there's some information there too about how you are curious about
the tone of the thought or maybe some of the words in the thought
that might reveal or express something, a frustration or confusion
or a wanting or a boredom.
Just settling back, not looking for thoughts, not looking for anything
in the, in particular, but sitting for a moment with this question.
How are you in the heart?
How are you feeling?
What is your mood or state?
How are you right now?
I'm seeing what it means for mindfulness to receive that
as if mindfulness were a dear friend really asking that question
and able to intuit how you are without your needing to say words.
Receiving, how are you right now?
Not needing to find anything in particular, being really available
for yourself here.
What shows up with this question?
How are you feeling?
How is your heart right now?
An aspect of this experience of how you are right now,
how you're feeling, how's your heart,
can be a touching in to a very broad experience.
Perhaps a sense of diffuse, even vagueness,
not a clarity of a specific sensation, but more of a misty
or perhaps smoky quality.
Much as our eyes when we have them open and we're seeing
in a night sky, a clear dark moonless night sky,
we might see the Milky Way, the breadth, the expanse of the Milky Way.
Perhaps we can touch into a breadth and expanse of this feeling of how we are.
You might not be stable, it might be shifting, changing,
opening to that possibility of meeting, a shifting, changing,
maybe vague and diffuse experience connected with how you are.
You don't have to name it or know what it is.
Mindfulness can feel it, mindfulness can be with it.
It's like if we get out of the way, mindfulness can do this exploration.
So perhaps a curiosity, a receptiveness and an allowing in this exploration of how you are in this moment.
If the experience connecting with how you are is strong or sticky, it's catching you up,
first just notice that, wow, it's really sticky, maybe some resistance.
You may be able to open to that too.
And it also can be fine if what you're opening to is too powerful really to stay with it.
And let yourself, let go of that exploration and connect with something simple, direct in the present moment,
like just the sensations of your hands or feet on the floor or wherever they're touching.
The whole body, the sense of the contact, the weight of the body perhaps,
or perhaps the experience of hearing, which can be a useful tool for if there's an overwhelm in emotion,
kind of bowing to that, saying thank you, I see you and right now you can be there,
but I'm going to turn my attention to what's happening in hearing.
And for some of you, this exploration of how you are may be very interesting and available for this moment.
Exploring that possibility.
