 Good evening, everyone. I'd like to encourage people to sit closer together. I don't think that we're particularly more people today than usual, but somehow we're not as efficiently situated. So there are people sitting out in the hallway today. And also the chairs are kind of empty over here. So I don't know if you need to do it now anymore, but maybe remember the next times you kind of come forward and sit a little bit tighter up together and try to fill, if it's possible, try to fill the seats up here before filling the seats in the back so people will come late. It's easier for them to find a place to sit. And also when we're kind of this full, maybe I was thinking that maybe it works as a very gentle reminder or suggestion of people that come on time so you find a place. And I don't know what's happening, but it felt more restless here today than it has in a long time. So I don't know whether it's the time of year or the weather or us or all of it. So I don't know how receptive you were for that perceptive exercise. But I would like to hear from some of you. Does anyone have anything you want to say? Was that interesting to do or did that change anything for you? Yes? I could remember being outside and being relaxed. I mean, I know much of that. All the times I remember being outside I'd seem to be sort of agitated in some way. So I thought I'd be kind of sitting inside and having to be doing lots of exercise and coming home and drinking coffee. Great. So what happened then when you let go of that memory and I just sat then in that kind of mode. How was that? It seemed so different from before. Good. So a good homework for you is to go out in nature this next week with your coffee. Yes? When you mention relaxing the eyes, the whole body of the eyes. There's a lot that gets held in the eyes so much. Yes? I liked how you reminded us not to make anything special of it. Yes? Oh. I was getting restless toward the end of the sitting, but once you started waiting for the guided meditation, all of a sudden everything became like I was much more aware and everything was just much more interesting in the end of time. Nice. And what was it like for some of you to open your eyes? Could you stay a little bit in that receptive mode? Elaine says no way. Is this a little bit too loud, the speaker, today? Is it just right? Okay. Yes? So why not? Well, I just a little bit and looked up for it was just the color of the light coming in. It was just a shot. And then, so I shut the door again and I get back to the relaxation. It was feeling pretty phony. And then, those were the more, so all these people I thought, oh, there's no way that the jacket stays the same. Well, that is just what put us in there. Someone else? Yes? To me it was amazing when we were sitting in a room together and occasionally I'll hear the person next to me breathing, but I had no idea how many people there are here. And, yes, it's really powerful to be sitting in a group. And then when I open my eyes, it's powerful to be able to be able to be able to. Yeah, I'm often surprised, too. Sometimes I sit down and close my eyes before many people are here. And I don't hear a lot of people coming in and then at some point I open my eyes to look at the watch or something. And I'm kind of taken back by where they all come from. I'd like to point out that, some of you I'm sure have heard this from you many times, that some of the insight or wisdom that's possible through mindfulness meditation or meditation at all occurs not in meditation, not kind of the process of getting yourself settled in meditative mode, but rather it's coming out of meditation or leaving a longer retreat or retreat. Because in some sense what happens when you meditate, perhaps, is that we kind of relax some of the normal ways in which we construct ourselves and construct our reality, which takes a lot of work and effort to construct it, all our fears and anxieties and whatever, and all our stories. And then if you pay very careful attention to what it's like when you come out of meditation or you leave a retreat, you might start noticing how you start reconstructing your normal way of being, your normal way of seeing the world around you. And for many people the tendency is the bell rings at the end of the sitting and that's it, it's vacation time. You've done your duty for the day and so you can just rush off to the next thing. But it's very interesting to take some time to come out of your meditation slowly. And it's very interesting to do this thing with the eyes, because the eyes are so packed full of maybe psychological significance for you. And there's so much holding in the eyes that can happen that if you, things are complicated very quickly when we have sight, only stories. If you take and open your eyes and see if you can be in the same receptive open mode with receiving sights as maybe you were with receiving sensations of the breath, breathing or sensations of the body or sounds coming. If you can kind of try to keep that with your eyes, then you're much more likely to begin catching or seeing when we start grabbing hold or constructing some kind of new reality or sense of self for ourselves or concerns about preoccupations or whatever it might be. Because so much happens around seeing. And then the other place to do it is around speaking. So if you come out of meditation or come out of retreat, notice what happens around the first speech act afterwards. That gets even more complicated than what happens when we start seeing. And you can start noticing many of the kind of motivations and concerns of preoccupations that goes into speaking. And I did that for a long time. Each morning I would try to catch and be mindful for each time that I spoke. Each time. The first time I spoke after the meditation. And some days I would notice in the afternoon that I had been speaking all day. But some days I was able to catch it at first speech act and it was very powerful. And for me I learned a lot about how I function in the world, how I project on the world or participate in the world. By noticing the difference between the way that I sit in meditation or the way I sit under an oak tree and just kind of look out across the hillsides, you're grimacing. The sound is so ugly. Let me turn it down a little bit maybe. The human voice is such a nice thing, it seems pretty spoiled. Well thank you. But I think that people need to hear... What? That's better? I think it goes too loud. It reverberates somehow. There are some places in the room that are better for the sound than other places. Those speakers have a volume thing that we can turn it down. Rob's looking at it now. Isn't it reasonable that the hearing and the character age? Well, it's okay. We'll figure out some way to make it work for everybody. My voice tends to be so low and sometimes it gets lower and lower. So people don't feel like they're hearing impaired. They feel maybe like I'm speaking impaired or something. I think acoustic dynamics are one of the most fascinating things about public speech. I should learn some. I know that the first time I told you I know that it worked really well when you started. And I noticed that it was really cool. And I've worked for him a lot, and he slowly came on. But the frustration level over the months raised until this happened. So I don't know, we can experiment with not having it again sometimes and going back and forth. But I was asked many times to speak louder, and it was really hard for me. And when I was actually succeeding in speaking louder, I didn't like speaking. And I think I should have felt comfortable when I was speaking, shouldn't I? So we got the speakers. So let's see, is this better now? And people in the back are still here, right? All we need is just a little bit with people in the back. And I think the ideal thing would be just the back kind of two rows got the amplification and the rest of the people didn't. And one possibility is maybe only keeping one of the speakers on. I don't know, no? Okay. So the mode of receptive awareness that sometimes we can experience in meditation is a very interesting mode of being, way of being, which then you can use that as a contrast in your daily life to when you're not in that particular mode. And now it's acting up a little bit. And I learned again a lot about it. One of the things I learned was, after a while, what I started paying attention to was when I was talking with people, kind of one on one, which is relatively, for me, and for most people, a complicated event besides just what's being the content going back and forth. There's all the emotions and feelings and projections and concerns and worries and anxieties and anticipations. There's a number of things going on there when you speak with someone. And what I started doing when I spoke with people, I remember what it was like to sit in meditation where I felt very centered and grounded without all those kind of preoccupations. I felt very much at ease. Or you can maybe, when you're sitting at the beach looking at the ocean, you're not concerned about all your story and how you are and who they are and all these things. And I started contrasting that when I spoke with people with that state earlier, and using that as a contrast, I was able then to see much more clearly all the stuff that, not all, but many of the stuff that felt extra that went into the conversation from my part. And I could see that extra stuff, and some of it then I could see was optional, and I could drop it, or some of it I could drop, and I could be there in a much more receptive way with that person. And sometimes it became kind of a practice, in its own right, like a meditation practice in its own right, listening to people, talking to people. It's a lot easier listening than talking to me, but listening to people in that kind of mode. But if I can get into it properly, kind of just allowing the whole situation to be there, with no real distinction inside and outside, no real distinction about whether the person is there or not in some kind of way, I'm just present and aware. Then I find that often some kind of response arises within me to speak back to that person. That seems often quite appropriate, but sometimes I can't even say that I'm the one who's speaking almost. Of course I am. But it's just kind of coming out of the situation, rather than me kind of concerned and worrying about what to say next and all these things. So this state of receptive awareness is very relaxed, it's a very nice thing to have. But it's also nice to use that, even in memory of that, as a way of highlighting or understanding the rest of our life, what goes on and how we participate in it. The receptive awareness that is the capacity of all of us is always accessible, I think. It's always kind of part of who we are. And what's interesting is that we have such a strong tendency to dichotomize our world between many kind of dualities or dichotomies. But one of them is between the idea of what's perceived and the perceiver. And what there is, is there's this awareness that's going on. And the awareness kind of registers and is aware of what's going on. But because we have a very strong sense of self, or idea that there has to be a self, we often attach that sense of awareness and that perception with the notion that there's a perceiver, that there's someone who's aware. And from that, then, follows a whole bunch of other stuff. It's like the cornerstone of a huge edifice which gets built on top of that cornerstone. And one of the first cornerstones is the idea that there's a perceiver who's perceiving what's going on. And most of us will think, well, it's pretty common sense that there's a perceiver perceiving what's going on. But what there is, in the kind of raw experience, there's simply perception of what's happening. But we very quickly then divide into subject and object, a subjective perceiver, experiencer, and the objective experience. There's also the distinction between a doer and the action. You know, that I'm the doer and I'm doing something. So I'm speaking, and they're speaking, and I'm the speaker rather than just they're speaking happening. I'm going to add this other piece that I am speaking. And when I'm in this very receptive mode, which happens occasionally, and I can speak from that, it seems extra to have the kind of self-reflective analysis that I am speaking. That kind of self-reflective analysis doesn't really come out of that way of speaking. It's just speaking is happening. And so we have to categorize or divide our experience between someone experiencing and the experience itself. And as soon as you have a perceiver, then you have kind of a self. And as soon as you have a self, then that idea or notion or concept of self is like, I don't know, like a magnet perhaps, for all kinds of culturally conditioned ideas of what a self should be like. The idea is just a raw experience of perceiving. Even if you add the perceiver to the perceiving. If you kind of pay careful attention to what that actual perception is, that perceiver is, it's a very kind of simple, almost translucent, transparent experience. However, as soon as we have this notion of self, we send in to add all these ideas of what a self is supposed to be like in our culture. You're supposed to be, I mean, you can fill it in for yourself. Yeah, fill in the blanks. But I wanted to tell you about a professor in Berkeley, in the psychology department there, who I didn't read his study, but I read about it. And as I understand it, he studied elderly people. And he wanted to study how their personality traits or qualities or whatever, their traits, changed over time. And he took two groups of elderly people, elderly people who were sick a lot, or relatively sick or ill, and elderly people who were relatively healthy. And I think what he did was he asked them to measure for themselves how their personality traits were changing over time. And so they all had reports different. And the people who were sick reported many more personality changes over time than the people who were relatively healthy. However, both of them reported personality changes over time. And both groups reported that personality changed for the worse over time. So that's kind of interesting. But then you ask them, then you find out what qualities, what personality qualities are they measuring themselves by, their personality. And so the things that were important for them was activity, doing, power, dominance, acquisition, competence, and achieving. So if their sense of personality, if those things are important qualities, then as you get older, watch out. You might not be as quite as happy. So I don't know what else was going on in this study, but I think we all internalize from our society ideas of what it means to be a successful person or a worthy person. And there's a lot of focus in America on achieving and doing things. The idea of being eternally young, of course, is kind of well known. And so people, when they get older, look back at them, kind of compare themselves when they're 30 or 40 or 20, and kind of say, well, you know, I can't play tennis as many times of the week, and therefore I'm not as worthy or not as good or whatever. And my teacher in Burma, Upandita, he was very fond of saying, well, he said this because it was really, for our health, it was very difficult to be in Burma. And we were all getting sick all the time. Now, very sick. And so people would come and complain about this and that to him, and there was nothing much he can do except, you know, I mean, the monastery did the best it could. They got the best doctors in Burma to come and see us, literally. The whole country kind of took care of our health. But there wasn't a lack of effort on people's part, but still, you know, a lot of the sicknesses were kind of imaginary. I mean, you know, it's really hot and sweaty and muggy, you know, and you're sitting there and all this hot and heat and everything sitting there for hour and hour, hour after hour, for day after day after day. And then, you know, a single kind of varicose vein, kind of little teeny one pops up on your leg. Freak out time. You know, oh my God, you know, I must be killing myself here. So people go to teach him, complain, you know, about how terrible it was, you know, little varicose vein popping. Anyway, he was very, what he was fond of saying was, as you get older, the body begins to kind of fall apart. But if you practice, your mind, you say it this beautiful, kind of inspired way, you say, your mind would only get sharper. And for him, what had value or purpose for him was kind of an alertness or sharpness of mind, which in his experience, and he was quite an old man, was getting sharper and sharper as he got older. And even though his body was definitely falling apart, I think he had diabetes and various things, difficulties. And I think it's interesting, I think it's very important actually to reflect a little bit about what senses of self we have acquired from a culture around us, which teach us and tell us that we're successful, good, and we're successful. And we're not just a very good, worthy people. And how reasonable are these judgments, and how sustainable are these judgments as we continue through life? You know, some people, you know, there's many stories to be said around this idea. And what occurs to me now is the story of people who retire, and soon after they retire, they die. Some people retire and they get well. But it all depends, you know, it depends a lot on... So, but some people who die sometimes have to retire. The idea I've heard is that their whole sense of worth, and sense of being, and sense of motivation for life was tied into working. And it's very difficult for some people to stop working and still maintain a sense of worthiness in themselves, because their sense of worth was tied into success and achievement and production at work. So then we have a sense of self. And that sense of self then, it kind of has a magnet for these ideas of what's worthy, what's good, what sense of self requires from the world around it, from itself, and all these things. And it's very interesting to study how certain emotions arise indirectly from the notion or idea of self that we've created for ourselves. So, for example, if we get... sometimes if we get angry, our sense of self is being threatened. And sometimes what's being threatened is completely silly, as some of us, all of us probably know sometimes. We look back now. And if we were like a teenager, for example, or you know, you look back in time, it's a lot less threatening to look at yourself. But... and then guilt. Guilt sometimes arises when our notion of self is bad or is wrong. Well, I said anger, a sense of being... the fear is when the self is threatened, and anger sometimes when the self is hurt. Ambition, when we want to enhance this idea we have of the self. We want to have that better three-peat suit. Ambitious, we want to make more money so we can get a three-peat suit, or so we can drive that Lexus or whatever. Boredom sometimes arises also in relationship to the idea we have of what it means to have a self, to support or enhance the sense of self. And if things in the environment support that sense of self, we're kind of galvanized and excited, you know, praise someone and suddenly you have their attention. Or if our sense of self is threatened, criticize someone and you'll have their attention too. But if the situation is kind of basically boring in relationship... the situation doesn't support or threaten this idea of self, then sometimes the reaction for some people is boredom. And they're bored with the people they're with, they're bored with the situation or whatever. So the sense of self often becomes the... so the nucleus of all this in a sense is the idea that we're a perceiver, that there is an agent here for our doing and for our seeing and everything. And then we add to this idea of an agent various ideas of what this agent is supposed to be like. And a lot of that is adapted from our culture. And one of the really fascinating things to do is to study the anthropology of personality, the anthropology of basic human behavior, anthropology of emotions, because they're so culturally conditioned. And things that we take so much for granted are just our particular cultural way of doing it. And you can read books on a culturally conditioned nature of our sexuality. And our sexuality, and we think that's kind of basic, kind of raw, kind of impulsive kind of stuff, right? And it's one of the most culturally packed, charged things going on, is our sexuality in our relationship to others. It's not this simple kind of basic biological thing. And I think it's really the anthropologists, more than anyone else perhaps, maybe psychologists, who begin taking apart the cultural conditioning and we're seeing it. And we don't see that we're living in the ocean of culturally conditioned ideas that we take it for granted. So the story that occurs to me that I like to tell around this is... I think it was either anthropologists or psychologists noticed that during or after World War II, there were all these American G.I.s stationed in England. And the G.I.s would say, these English women, they're so promiscuous, they're so aggressive sexually. And then the English women would say, these American soldiers, they're so promiscuous, they're so sexually aggressive. So this seems very strange to the people who are studying this, that they both had these kind of complaining about each other being that way. So they studied how courtship happened in England and in America. And they found out that there were 12 steps to courtship or something, or 15 steps, in both cultures. But in American culture, kissing was like step number three. And going to bed and having intercourse was like step number 12 or 15, or the very end, the top of it, you know, the last thing you did before you got married. Or whatever. In 1940. Or maybe afterwards, yeah, I don't know. But the important thing is kissing happened very early, and there were all these steps between kissing and going to bed, together. But in England, kissing happened like step number 11 or 13 or 14. It was very late in the courtship process. And it happened so late, it happened actually just before a couple would go to bed together. So an American GI would kiss an English date, and the English one would be confused. Or the English one would interpret that and say, oh my God, if I'm serious by this guy, I better get serious now. Or leave. So then they get serious, thinking that's what it was called for. And these American men, we get confused then, because it was way ahead of schedule. So here's an example of how cultures have different ways of understanding similar situations and they're conditioned. And sometimes we take it for granted that kissing should happen in step number three or whatever. Some of us, I guess. This is another psychologist from UC Berkeley. This woman, Eleanor Rauch, studies Buddhist psychology and psychology department there. And she writes this. Some years ago, I was questioned by a visiting Tibetan monk about how psychology was studied in the West. Carefully, I tried to delineate our fields of psychology. Cognition with its sub-areas such as attention and memory, personality psychology, developmental and so forth. He looked puzzled. I attempted to explain what we meant by empirical method. He seemed even more puzzled. I talked about operational definitions and described some psychological experiments. Suddenly his look of intensely interested bewilderment turned to one of aha. So you are saying that in America people teach and write about psychology who have no meditation practice? Yes, of course. But then, how can they know anything? And then giving me a piercing look. Do you think that's ethical? So we have this ability to be aware. And it's really kind of a wonderful capacity of our mind. I mean, our mind is really a fantastic thing. The brain, the mind, consciousness, awareness. And I'm in awe at the powers and its abilities to reflect and to think and to be creative. It's just really amazing. But because of all its power and creativity, it can use that sometimes to get us into big time trouble. And we creatively construct this huge sense of self and then we'll defend it at all costs. But what is the mind? What is awareness and what is consciousness? And it's kind of like the ocean we swim in, our awareness. It's like the ocean we swim in and we don't even see the ocean we swim in. We tend to be so caught up in the content of what we see, content of our awareness. The stories, the ideas, the external situations, our emotions, our feelings, the things that we can perceive. But the actual act of perception itself, the act of awareness, which is always there, is like the other half of the equation. It often goes unstudied and unaware to many of us. And one of the things we can do in meditation is to kind of relax a little bit and rest or find the receptive mode of being, receptive awareness. There has to be there for us to experience anything. So we have what's called in Buddhism, not just in Buddhism I guess, but in probably almost all meditative traditions, the idea of witnessing consciousness, of witnessing our experience. And I use the word witnessing carefully so as not to add the idea of being a witness. But people often have the experience when they do mindfulness meditation after a while, of developing a stronger sense of being a witness, or being a witness, or of witnessing their experience. And I think that's often quite appropriate. As a normal part, witnessing, being aware of what's going on is a normal part of human consciousness. And so we start witnessing and becoming aware of what's going on. And for many people when they start being aware, being a witness carefully to what's happening in their life, especially their inner life, as many of you I think know comes as a great shock and a surprise. And for some people, I've had people come to me and say something like the equivalent of, oh my God, I'm such an egomaniac. And they start noticing that all their thoughts and ideas seem to center on themselves, and how they're relating to everything and how everything relates to them, and their fears and their ideas and their judgments and their categories of people they put in. Everything seems to be so self-centered, and it can be such a shock. Well, if it's not self-centered, then people notice what's sometimes called the monkey mind. Or in India, sometimes called the elephant, just kind of running berserk all over the forest. And this, you know, this, you know, what we start noticing, this monkey mind, is we start noticing when this huge edifice of ideas and reality construction we've created, we start noticing how it all works, and how complicated it is, and sometimes how out of control it might be. And what happens to a lot of people is they live their life in these quite abstract worlds of ideas of who they are and who other people are and what the relationship is with people. And they have very little contact with the reality directly. And what witnessing or what mindfulness is trying to help us do is to help us have a direct experience with what's happening, a kind of direct, undistracted experience of what's happening, and not to be lost in the abstractions. Because when we're lost in abstractions, we're separated from our direct experience, and when we're separated from our direct experience, we're separated from others and we're separated from ourselves also, and it can be very lonely. And a lot of people come and talk to me about the isolation and loneliness they feel, and just feel. And often, when people talk about being lonely, or not having a lot of friends, or being very lonely, or isolated from others, it doesn't take very long to ask some questions, to find out that they're also separated or alienated from themselves. And these things are often quite closely related. Because if you live in a world of abstractions, then you're not really living in your own experience, and then you're separated from yourself, and you're separated from others. So we begin developing this witness, developing this mindfulness of what's happening right now, what's going on. And I think this sense of being a witnessing is the foundation of much Buddhist practice. But at some point, the idea of the sense of a witness and a witnesser can dissolve, or dissolves. And we awaken them to kind of a non-dualistic awareness, where people often have the feeling that there's no distinction anymore, a sharp distinction between inside and outside. There's simply just awareness and experiences happening within awareness. There's no perceiver, no aware, nothing. It isn't that we're witnessing reality at this point, but rather that we are reality, we've become reality. And so we often make this very sharp distinction or boundary between us experiencing reality and reality out there. And actually it's a dance, it's inseparable from each other. And I think many spiritual practices, traditions, have tricks, or practices, or whatever, skillful means, to help us dissolve a sharp distinction between experience and a perceiver, between a perception and a perceiver. So we can kind of rest in the kind of receptive awareness that I was suggesting at the beginning of today, this evening. But for many people, because the monkey mind is so strong, for many people what they first need to develop is their attention itself. They need to develop a stronger level of attention, perhaps a stronger witnessing mode. Part of mindfulness is in training one's attention, so it's not constantly being pulled away, constantly being lost in the edifice that the monkey has created. And once the attention is developed strong enough, it doesn't have to be developed that strong. I'd like to say that the amount of concentration you need for Buddhist spiritual life, for meditative life, is the amount of concentration you need to take the written exam and the DMV. So we all, you know, that's it, it doesn't take much. But you know, we're there, we're really motivated. And so we're really engaged, right? But, no, you weren't, well some people aren't. I used to love taking exams in school because I would get so concentrated. I used to, anyway. I think that's going to be enough. I'd like to read it. I'll just read two things. And I don't know how well they follow from any of this, but I don't know if anything follows from anything tonight. This is a friend of mine wrote this poem. Her name is Wendy Lewis. And her poem says, It is like this. There is this bird, and you catch it in your hands. You feel its softness, warmth, its heart rapidly beating. But if you keep holding it, it's no longer a bird. So you open your hands, catch it, and let it go again and again. But if you keep holding it, it's no longer a bird. So you open your hands and let it go. And I think that's a lot of what we learn to do in practice, is not so much abandon the world of abstractions or ideas or even the world of self. But rather we learn to hold ourselves and hold our life kind of softly, the way soft, kind of gentle way you'd hold maybe a baby bird that had fallen from its nest and you picked it up to put it back. Or you hold a bird. But you don't want to hold it so tight that you kill it. But you can't keep holding it. If you keep holding it, it's not a bird. It can't be a bird. And if you keep holding yourself with some tight constriction of what it means to be a self, you're not a self. It's kind of a wonderful paradox. So when Jesus or someone said you have to die in order to live, I don't know if that follows at all. I don't know where that came from. Sometimes when you just kind of talk, you know, from... See, sometimes it just comes wonderful, it's just really appropriate. And sometimes you don't know where it comes from. So take that as a warning. But at least I'm relaxed. Oh, I wanted to say that for a while I used to have trouble in writing, distinguishing my writing between the word release and realize. Because I kind of spelled almost the same, you kind of move some vowels around. And release and realize. And we talk about realization, making real, and to release. And I think maybe they're closely related. Realization involves a kind of release. We train our attention and then we release it. Han Shan, the great and crazy, wonderful Chinese poet of a thousand years ago said, we're just like bugs in a bowl. All day going around, never leaving their bowl. I say, that's right. Every day climbing up the steep side, sliding back, over and over again. Around and around, up and back down. Sit in the bottom of the bowl, head in your hands, cry, moan, feel sorry for yourself. Or look around, see your fellow bugs, walk around, say, hey, how are you doing? Say, nice bowl. But first you have to find the bowl. And one bowl is our awareness. So enjoy your awareness. And people have been searching for the mind and consciousness for thousands of years. And no one seems to ever have figured out what it is. Though you get lots, you read lots of books to tell you what it is. But all the different books disagree. Anyway, but it's worth checking it out, finding out for yourself. So thank you all. Good night. Are there some new newsletters for this coming few months with our next upcoming events for those of you who want? I kind of forgot. I'm sorry. I shouldn't forget. I got kind of... We have a quick check with you.
