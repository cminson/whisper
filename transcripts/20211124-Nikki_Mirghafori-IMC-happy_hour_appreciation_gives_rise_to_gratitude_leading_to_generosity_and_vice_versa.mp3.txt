 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hi, hi. Welcome to Happy Hour. So, this week we're dedicating our practice to the beautiful practice of gratitude, given that in the US it's Thanksgiving tomorrow, Thanksgiving holiday, again a holiday with complicated history, and I appreciate that many of us have been the hellos before it got recorded, they acknowledge the lands being unseated, and a part of this reflection. In this holiday, I'll share an anecdote actually. So, when I came to the US when I was 16 years old, I came from Iran, and not knowing the history at first of what this holiday was, but just hearing that, oh, this new country of mine had this holiday called Thanksgiving. It's a day people give thanks. Wow, what a cool thing to have a holiday for, to have a day that you just give thanks. So, I like to bring that beginner's mind, that naive perspective, and just share that because there's a goodness. How can you let us co-opt it in this way? And yes, it is a day, it is a week. It's a great opportunity every day, every moment to give thanks, to give thanks for so much that we have, so much that we take for granted. And there are so many studies that link gratitude, appreciation. I like actually the word appreciation because sometimes gratitude feels heavy. As I think Ben was bringing up on Monday, there's a sense that for some folks, this feeling that you should be grateful. Well, you have so much good things going on in your life, you should be grateful. Ouch. And that sense of should, of finger-wagging, that either the society seems to do inadvertently or we tend to do for ourselves or others, like you should be grateful. It's actually, can suppress, can suppress the sense of gratitude. Whereas, a sense of appreciation, just appreciating what's good, turning our mind to it and relishing, relishing, really taking a moment to take delight and appreciation and letting gratitude, if it wants to come up on its own, to come up without any shoulding, without any forcing of ourselves. That's very, very important. And if at any point during the practice, you don't feel grateful, that's fine, drop it. Go back to relishing, go back to being with the breath. Just keep it simple. There's no should in this practice. And to continue that train of thought, there are many, many studies that connect authentic appreciation, authentic gratitude to gladness, to happiness and to generosity. And that's another thing that I've been contemplating lately, which is beautiful. Also, studies connecting gladness, happiness to generosity, that when we give, actually, there's a study that if we spend, participants were given some money to either spend on themselves or spend it on someone else and people felt happier when they were generous, when they spend it on someone else, which is pretty cool. And there are other studies that show that you can train yourself to derive more joy, more delight out of generosity, so that when you're actually generous, you feel happier. It just gives you more of a helper's high, more of a hit, let's say. And the way you can train yourself to do that is, guess what? Practicing appreciation, practicing gratitude for what you have actually makes you enjoy generosity more, which I think is a really interesting exercise. So the study, so again, don't take any of these on faith, try them on for yourself. See if this is true in the laboratory of your own mind, your human being, you have a laboratory, call your mind hard body, try it out for yourself. So with that, oh, I want to say one more thing, you know, and Monday we practiced, and the guided meditation was about gratitude for things we take for granted. And I just wanted to share a practice report with you and wondered if you had the same, can share them later, because I noticed, oh, my mind will turn into gratitude more this week for things that I take for granted. And it was lovely. I just enjoyed it so much. So thank you all for being part of this Sangha, this opportunity for us to practice together. So with that, let us turn our hearts, our minds, incline a little more, invite ourselves to appreciate, to appreciate and maybe invite just shyly, if the gratitude is shy, just invite it like a little kitty, you don't want to come out. That's fine. But just be very gentle with this practice, similar to all our other practices. So with that, I'd like to invite us to land, to land in our bodies, to arrive, to begin by arriving, arriving in this moment in this body. Just relaxing the body without any expectations, softening your sit bones, your lower back, your lower back, your lower back, your lower back, your lower back. Releasing your forehead, your muscles in the forehead, releasing your jaw, releasing your eyes. Let them rest. Let them rest. Let them rest in the socket, the muscles behind the face. Let them soften and relax. Let them rest. Relaxing the shoulders, the neck. Relaxing the shoulders, the hands. Let them be heavy. The feet. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Letting the heart, the proverbial heart center, place of the emotions, let it rest, rest. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Letting the breath move through the body. Letting the breath move through the body. Letting the breath move through the body. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Letting the body move through the body. Let the body be relaxed and soft. Just receiving, appreciating the butterfly moving up and down, sitting on the belly. Each breath, the butterfly of awareness. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Appreciating thoughts that arise and then releasing them with appreciation. Relaxing, resting with the butterfly of the awareness of the abdomen. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relax the belly, resting calm and collecting the mind, appreciating, in a way appreciating, the simplicity of this moment. Simplicity of a moment of refuge to sit and just practice, just be. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Maybe, maybe, becomes brighter in your heart. Maybe, maybe, becomes more relish. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Keep the butterfly of awareness in mind. Don't lose it. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders.

Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. Relaxing the shoulders. This being who is you, the gratitude that they continue to show up, they continue to show up. As best as they are able to. Letting go, letting go of any judgment. Just grateful for this, you're showing up in this moment. You've shown up, that's enough, that's enough. Perhaps having an image of people in your path, having gratitude for you as you've had gratitude for them. Having gratitude for you, for this being who is unique, only the way you can be with your particularities. If they bow to you, they give you a hug. They say thank you, as you say thank you to them. Offering, offering your goodness to yourself, to all beings everywhere. May we wake up to our own and everyone's unfathomable goodness. May we awaken with grace. Thank you for your practice, the gift of your practice. If you are willing, if you are moved, if you wish, if you'd like to share some gift from your practice today with the Sangha, what came up for you? What have you noticed? What was it like, discoveries, challenges, anything is okay, Joe? Just that I really like the option of using appreciation in place of gratitude, because gratitude is a lot of work. Compassion is kind of a simpler level. It's like Gil's use of Anacompa, care is an umbrella term that includes compassion, because care is really easy to grasp. Anyway, I like appreciation, please. But yes, gratitude can feel so heavy sometimes, so much work for us. Appreciation is just, oh yeah, it feels nice, really. I appreciate this. Well, guess what? I'm grateful for it too. But yes, yeah, that's great. Thank you for that, Joe. Are there reflections? Are there thoughts? Yeah, Dave says I'm most grateful for this emphasis on gratitude because I've been through an Arjus job search that had me focusing on how much I don't have. And didn't, I think there's more to that chat coming. But yes, thank you. And I think that is so important, yes, turning the mind to what is good, what is here, and focusing, especially, gosh, yeah, job search can be so challenging looking, looking, searching about the definition is, is an act of wanting in the world. Mima, I see your hand, please. I am had never seen the correlation between the generosity of someone when you were speaking about that and how the gratitude is kind of like it goes together when there's an interaction. And I remembered my son, my grandson is now going to be 18 but when he was about seven years old he came to me and he said to me, Grandma, I have $300 and I don't have anybody to share it with. He said I asked my mama and my steppapa if I could buy them something, and they don't need anything. And he asked me, is there anything you need. And his favorite store was Barnes and Noble. And so I told him you know I saw a little speaker. I really really liked it. But I couldn't get it that day. And Grandma, please let me buy it for you. And I remembered with this meditation I remembered that experience how it was a give and take because he was being generous but I was so appreciative even now of the experience with him. And so I'll never forget the day he came over a couple of weeks later with a little bag, and he was elated. Grandma I bought your speaker, and he and I still have it. I will not get rid of it because that experience that I remember him doing it was from the sweetness of his heart. He wanted to share. And I could not I don't I could have bought it myself but I didn't want to deprive him of that. Yes. That's lovely. That's beautiful me mine. And, and as you highlighted in the story there's so much giving and receiving and. And when we actually give another person, the opportunity to give it is so it's that is such a gift that is such a gift right to let them be kind. Oh, it's, it's, it's such a gift instead of going Oh no too much trouble dude for it's just no it's beautiful that you let yourself receive and it's still to this day it it brightens your heart and it brightens your mind. Oh, that is beautiful. Thank you for letting me share that. Thank you for sharing this me or this is so sweet. Yeah, it reminds me I'll share a little story to actually happened this past week I was actually. I was writing, there's some reflections and generosity, and, and a friend texted who lives about 10 minutes ago, saying that Oh I've made a batch of soup, can I drop some off for you. And I thought, Oh, it's trouble and then I thought, wait, I'm as part of my act of generosity, she wants to so yes please I would love to eat your soup so she came and brought it and I thought, I would love to eat your soup so she came and brought it and it was just, it was both lovely to receive and also the same thing that you were sharing with with your friend with with with your grandson. Yes, giving others the opportunity of saying Oh no to me you know don't too much trouble you know it's like we're blocking we're blocking general we're blocking kindness and that flow of gratitude and connection so yeah beautiful. Thank you for that Mima. I was a real tenderizer. There have been many gladdening of my heart this week, being back out in the world more and interacting with old customers. People I haven't seen in years, kindness from people. And these sessions. That is lovely. Thank you Deborah tenderizing tenderizing for me also. A lot of tender memories of people I've been grateful for in my life came up very tender. So, thank you all for your practice Abraham this will be the last comment before we go into practice. Small, small groups, please. Oh, you're still muted. Go straight into small groups that's fine. Oh, you sure. Okay. All right, so, so we'll come back to Abraham when we come out of the groups, you're on your own queue your own top so. So let's go into groups, if we would, and, and the invitation is to. Yeah. One, one invitation is maybe sharing if you wanted what something that you felt came up for you that you're grateful for from this practice or maybe something that was tender anything you like to share or not, and holding each other with gratitude, these wonderful human beings whom you're going to be in a, in a few minutes of connection with gratitude and generosity that's in that can you get we feel it in real time, this. Yeah, these human beings are alive somewhere in the world are practicing with me. So, so the rooms are created, I'm going to open them, and we'll come back and we'll have a few minutes for reflections on the other end. So here we go. Take care of yourselves and each other. We have a few minutes for reflections, and let's go to Abraham Abraham or still up for it. Whatever you wanted to share before is it relevant, if so, I appreciate it. What people were sharing about how the giver wants to give and for you not to receive what they want to give this is, is not a skillful thing to do, or can not be skillful. I was a teacher, many years ago when I was in the midst of a career change, and I didn't have a lot of money and the first year I applied for a bursary so I could attend a retreat and it was wonderful. And the next year. He said why haven't you applied for the bursary and I said, I can't do that every year somebody else needs the opportunity and he said, you know, somebody has offered the money for a student to go why would you want to take away their karma, the ability for them to earn good karma by not accepting it, and I realized when he said that he had put the money in the bursary fund and wanted me to be on retreat, but I thought that was a really interesting take you know like, why wouldn't you allow people to express their goodness. That's interesting. Beautiful. Thank you Abraham I love that I love that twist. Yes, exactly. Why not let them express your goodness, their block their wholesome karma from ripening. Yeah, it's lovely. Appreciate that reflection. Yeah. Yeah, the reflections we have a moment else that came up for you from this practice. So rich. Eileen, please. Okay. Okay. What came up for me was that I really appreciate the imagery of the butterfly of awareness, because I've always tried hard to be mindful. And what I understood today was that gentleness works and trying hard like that doesn't work. So that was all. Appreciate that very much. Beautiful. Thank you, I like that that is right on the butterfly right. That's, that's perfect. Exactly. I'm so glad you brought that up. It's an image that, for me, it really works this this sense you know butterfly of awareness is flying just sitting on your belly. Oh yeah, getting up and down with every breath just so gentle awareness is just a light touch and just the joy the light and so thank you for bringing that back in and highlighting and I'm so delightful that that that you're finding that supportive and instead of the bearing down which yeah, which is hard work and doesn't help anyway so yay, lovely so. So thank you all. Thank you for the gift of your practice for being here. Thank you for offering yourself to this practice to each other. What what a gift to practice together. Thank you. I am so appreciative and grateful for the Sangha. May all of you may all of us may all beings be happy me all beings be free. Thank you. Now I stopped the recording.
