 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning everyone and welcome to IMCE. Especially those of you who, maybe this is one of the first times you've come together with maybe even so many people in a room like this. But maybe particularly to come to meditate and be in community this way. So welcome. So welcome to everyone who's here on YouTube watching. And I want to reassure you that even though there are people here and I'm looking at them a little bit and paying attention to them a little bit, a little more natural to do that when you have a room of people, I haven't forgotten about you all on YouTube. And I have my laptop open here so that I'm a little bit trying to track the chats and certainly appreciate the greetings that come in. So many years ago I read when one of the great American saints died, Mr. Rogers, I read an article about him and said that he was invited to the Emmys, yes that's where they're right, when they get awards for TV shows. A little bit, not, so Emmys. And so it's a big gala event in Los Angeles I think. And all these big celebrities show up. And he asked, so he got up to give his little speech. And he said, you know, everybody here probably is here because someone cared for you, believed in you at some point in your life. Let's take a minute to be silent and remember the people who believed in us and cared for us, supported us, that's kind of partly responsible for us being here. And the article said that the TV producers panicked because what do you do with a minute of silence on TV? And so they just used the time to scan the audience and people were crying. And just that simple question. And to be cared for. So I bring it up here this morning because it's possible to care for oneself and meditate as a seminar of self-care. And rather than saying self-compassion or self-love, which is certainly wonderful and important, care is kind of a little more basic and maybe a little more accessible for us. We can care for ourselves. And it's possible to care for someone we don't like, if we're the neighbor down the street who we've always had difficulty with because they represent everything that's challenging for your life. You fight them on the sidewalk with a broken leg, you know, and suddenly all your care, you care then and you take care of things and maybe you get into the hospital or something, but then you come back and you care for their cat because the person's not there. Someone has to care for the cat. It isn't exactly compassion, it's just, you know, you've maybe taken their mail or different things. And there's a basic care that goes into just caring for people. So maybe as we sit today, maybe we can sit with, if you're inclined, or if it's easy enough, to sit with care for yourself. What would that look like? What would it look like to take a posture and be with your breathing? And no matter what arises for you as you meditate, even if this little exercise evokes the opposite or some challenge, even then, what would it be like to sit quietly, peacefully, caring in a way that's not complicated, but in a way that perhaps is settling and quieting and intimate and kind of supports a kind of cozy way of being here. So with that, we'll sit quietly for these next 30 minutes and then go from there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to take a few moments to consider what care we have for others in the world around us, our communities, friends, family, and maybe consider how this path of meditation that releases us from our attachments, our preoccupations, is a way that allows our care to flow more freely. And may it be that this meditation today leads to a greater caring care, kindness, loving concern for the world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings everywhere be free. Amen.
