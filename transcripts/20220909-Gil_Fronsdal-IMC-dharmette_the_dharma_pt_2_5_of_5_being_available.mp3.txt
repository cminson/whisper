Hello, and I'll start with the announcement. 
So, on Sunday, I began teaching a three-week retreat at our retreat center, the Insight Retreat Center. 
And so, I won't be here for these 7 am sittings. 
The last week that I'm away, Matthew Brensilver will come and speak and teach for the 7 am But for the first two weeks, starting Monday, I will be teaching in a certain way because what we'll do is play a repeat of teachings that I did a year and a half ago or so. 
In December of 2020, I did a one-week on Love and Kindness, Metta, and one week on Compassion, Karuna. 
And it seems to me, in the flow of what we've been doing this summer and the year so far, it would be really great to have these practices and deems brought into our community, our 7 am community, YouTube community. 
And so, what we'll be doing is replaying those. 
And I believe the way it will appear is that it'll be like a regular broadcast and with the ability to do chat just before and communicate with each other. 
And if I'm wearing a sweater and it's still hot here, then know that it's because it was originally done in December. 
So, I'm hoping that's nice. 
So, those are the announcements and I hope that you continue to appreciate how valuable it is to come together in this YouTube community every morning. 
And I think it's very significant and I thank you all for it. 
So, the last of the characters of the Dhamma is that it's to be personally known by the wise, or personally experienced by the wise, depending how the word is understood. 
But personally means directly, immediately here. 
And I think it's very, hopefully encouraging and inspiring that this Dhamma that we're doing is pointed to something very deeply personal. 
That the answer is found in us. 
The book to read is in our own hearts, is here, that the teachings that are to be really followed are the ones that you find here personally, not necessarily by someone like me talking about it. 
These five characteristics of the Dhamma that it's visible here, it's now, it's inviting us to see, it's onward leading and to be known by the wise. 
This is, in the ancient text, this is the exclamation, the inspired utterance of people who have really tasted the full potential of the practice for the first time, or have really experienced the full potential, really never tasted this sense of how mindfulness, how awareness can lead to kind of freedom in the midst of our life. 
We can experience that personal freedom here and now. 
And there's no more, there's confidence, there's no more doubt that this is what it is. 
So this whole expression, you know, the characteristics of the Dhamma are in fact something to be experienced by the wise, to be known by oneself, to discover for oneself, not to be taken as articles of faith or creed, but they're pointing to an experience, something that's personal known. 
But in order to do that, we have to be available for this experience of the present moment. 
We have to be available to experience, to know something personally. 
And this ability to be available, to be receptive, to be open to, to have the clarity for experiencing what's happening here, now, is not easy to come by. 
It's something that, you know, for whatever reason, this mind of ours, mind of ours, so easily erases ahead, so easily is caught in cycles of rumination. 
It's leaning forward into the next moment, into the next moment. 
As soon as one thing is finished, we're already on to the next thing because of the momentum of that mind. 
And so the idea is to stop and be present. 
Many years ago, I had this analogy for myself that when I was young, growing up in Europe, there was much more handshaking than there is now, I think. 
But I remember that sometimes when there was someone like a politician or someone who was somehow an important person and was going around and shaking everyone's hands, there were a few times I experienced someone who would, as soon as their hand was in my hand to be shook, I already felt the hand immediately went limp because you could see their body, their face, everything was already looking for the next person to shake hands with. 
And it was very unsatisfying because there wasn't this little bit of firmness, a little bit like, here I am, or connecting, I'm present for you. 
And so the mind is like that sometimes, that we're all ready for the next thing, ready for the next thing. 
And the kind of way we both grasp at something tightly and we don't grasp. 
We're grasping, but we don't really know. 
In the Buddhist teachings, what we grasp at is the concepts, the ideas, the fantasies, the dreams, the delusions, the imaginations of things. 
We don't really grab anything solid. 
And so the very grabbing of things is keeps us going and we're not available, not present, not here for the experience. 
So to make oneself vessel for experiencing something deeply personal, to experience our life ourselves in some deeper way, that allows us to tap into what is really present here, visible here, that concepts, ideas, and stories are not exactly something worth seeing or not really seeing reality, really, they obscure it. 
But if you see how we get caught in thoughts, see how we get caught in attachments and clingings and aversions, that's where we begin seeing the Dharma. 
Look at that. 
Then with that seeing, it's possible to see and find the alternative. 
But if we're so involved in greed, hate, and delusion that we can't even see it, then there's no way but to stop and be available to even see that which is not flattering in ourselves. 
Oh, look at that. 
And rather than being discouraged by what is not flattering about ourselves in our minds and our hearts and our dispositions, in the Dharma, that's a source of encouragement, inspiration, not being inspired by what's not flattering, but be inspired, oh, now that I know it, this is a stepping stone to freedom. 
I needed to know this. 
Of course, I needed to know this and see this. 
Now, where's the freedom? And part of the freedom is found in that seeing, that recognition. 
It's part of that freedom is found in not succumbing or collapsing or being upset by what is not flattering, the faults we have, the difficulties we have inside. 
See, oh, that's what it is. 
And then we start seeing, getting a taste of the simultaneous freedom, the simultaneous way in which we're looking, come and look, come and see. 
The way that we see then, way forward, we're guided into that clarity, guided into that more freedom, that more letting go. 
And then the more we experience that non-clinging, the more we experience that attention that's free and not clinging, not grasping, then the more we can just really be present in a full way for experience. 
We can have that handshake with reality. 
We're really there with it, and the mind is not already going off to something else. 
And so, to be available. 
And then to final comment about this, for the Buddha, when he was talking about this, what it means, this visible, it's here, it's come and look at it, it's onward leading, and be experienced by the wise. 
He once, and one in explanation of all that, he just kind of little bit changes, seemingly changes the subject. 
And he talks about not being involved in the conceits of feeling that you're better than others, worse than others, or equal to others. 
We're not involved in the game, in the ranking, in the status of self. 
And so, this freedom from comparing ourselves to others, that's part of this freedom that he's talking about is available here and now. 
And what a gift to give to others, the gift of not comparing, not making ourselves worse, or better than others, or even the complications of making ourselves equal. 
We don't play that comparison game, and that the gift to others is that they're allowed to be who they are. 
And we can be present for them in a full way. 
We can shake their hands or the equivalent, and really be there and present, and give them some kind of gift of freedom. 
So, to be personally experienced by the wise, may it be, may you be a wise person, may you be available to experience this life in a deep way, and may that availability translate to a greater respect, reverence, care, love for others as well. 
And if you would like to have homework for these time that I'm away, or at least for the weekend, make yourself available for reality. 
Don't go ahead, log into it, make yourself available, kind of to let it come to you, let reality find you, rather than you rushing into it. 
So, thank you very much, and I look forward to being back. 
And I guess I think it's probably the third of October, or so, first Monday in October. 
And I hope you enjoy compassion, loving-kindness, and Matthew Brensilver.
