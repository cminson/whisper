The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org. Begin here. So,
welcome, welcome everybody. It's really nice to see you all. It's very sweet, it's
very heartwarming. And the way that some of us, I know from having seen you at
IMC, and some of you, I'm just meeting here online, and it's what a delight it
is, honestly. So, I just want to touch a little bit on how troubling things are.
I'm not going to talk a lot about the specifics, but I could use this word
troubling, which, you know, covers so much, so much of what's happening in
society, in our lives. Maybe there's personal specific things for us, maybe
there's bigger things. But it's just natural, or I hope it's natural at least,
that when these things are troubling, that there's an impulse, there's an inquiry,
what can I do? How can I help? What's something that is helpful or supportive?
And there's lots of different answers to that. There isn't one way. But first of
all, I kind of want to honor that impulse of this feeling, like, okay, I'd like to
help. I'd like to be part of the solution. I want to be of support to others, to
myself. And one way that we can do this is to listen deeply. Listen deeply. So we
can unpack this in a number of different ways, including listening
deeply to others. That is so that we can really hear what others are saying,
rather than what we think that they're saying, or expecting them to say, or
maybe we're not even paying attention. But to deeply listen so that we can hear
what they are saying, and so that we can understand, or maybe understand, or have a
better understanding, or more likely to understand what's underneath the words,
like what's fueling the words, what's the mind state, what's the emotional state,
what is needed, what is being asked for, even if it's not being explicit in the
words. There are some people who talk about communication as, you know, it's
individuals expressing a need. They need something. They may not even know what it
is that they need, but they're expressing, communicating something. So one part of
listening deeply is a way in which we can listen to more than just the words,
but everything else, of course, body language, and eye contact, the way they
hold themselves, but also the context of where is this person, and the time of day,
is it right after a meal, before a meal, when they're tired, when they're
inebriated, when they just finished coming out of a stressful situation, or
something like this. So to listen deeply is to, and maybe it's a little bit deeper,
as well as a little bit more broad, is to also put it into the context. And then part
of reason is to listen deeply, is so that we might understand better. We might
have a fuller picture. We might have a greater appreciation of what is being
said, maybe something that's beyond just the simple words or the simple gestures,
but also so that others feel heard, and that others feel seen. I think all of us
have this experience that it's powerful when we feel like somebody is really
listening to us. Maybe it might even be a little bit uncomfortable if we're not
used to it, if somebody really listening to us. But when you feel like somebody is
kind of put down their own agenda, and is listening to us, it might, as I said,
might feel a little bit uncomfortable, but it also might allow something to
relax. This recognition like, oh, okay, now I don't have to be exaggerated in my
what I'm saying, perhaps, and if somebody is listening, then I can maybe talk in
more nuanced ways, or in a softer way, or maybe, maybe not too. Maybe it just is
helpful for them to feel like they're seen and heard, and maybe they don't
change the way they communicate. But listening deeply also includes listening
to ourselves. Listening to ourselves deeply from a receptive place, or in a
caring place. Like, to hear what is, for us, what is underneath some of the
stories we tell ourselves, some of the stories we hear ourselves saying about
others. What are listening deeply is to have an inquiry into what are some of
the underlying beliefs that are fueling and supporting the words that we say to
ourselves, or the words that we say about others. Because if we don't have a deep
listening, it's so easy to just kind of slip into this automatic response of
every time we hear anybody say something to kind of have this response of, yeah,
yeah, but how does this affect me? I'm not so much concerned about the other
person, but it's more like, okay, well, how does this affect me? Like, what's, okay,
yeah, you know, I hear, I kind of hear you're saying, but what I'm really
listening for is how this is going to impact me, or what I have to do, or
listening for you to confirm some ideas I have about myself. Or maybe we have in
our minds, well, what can I say next so that I can really make my point and get
things my way, and maybe not really listening deeply. Those could be some
automatic responses, or maybe there's a tendency to interrupt, thinking that we
have already jumped to conclusions. We already know what that person's going to
say. We think we know, and we're a little bit dismissive and feeling impatient, so
that we interrupt them, and we don't allow them to, maybe they're finding their
way. So maybe what they're saying at the beginning is something both of you
already know, but they're using that as a way to kind of get warmed up. Maybe
they're a little bit more of an introvert and need a little time to find
their words. Or maybe we don't listen deeply because we're just so self-
concerned that's what everybody else is saying is of no interest. And to be sure
there are times in our lives when we are self-concerned, when we are in deep and
suffering, is we're not able necessarily to listen deeply to others. Maybe we are,
but maybe we're not. So can we recognize that this is something that we wish for
ourselves, a skill we like to develop and cultivate, a capacity, but also
recognize that sometimes if we're in deep suffering, physical pain, emotional
pain, it is difficult for us to listen deeply. So can we create a life in which
we can listen to others and can listen to ourselves so that when we are in
emotional pain, physical pain, we can take care of ourselves? Part of taking care
of ourselves is to really have a sense of what's needed instead of what we think
is needed, but to listen and to see what's really needed. So some of these
characteristics of deep listening is it's, is this generosity of spirit,
of empathy, of feeling that, okay, I understand what you're saying. I can see
what you're feeling, even if it's not exactly right, it's in that direction and
it's supportive. And it's trusting that what others are saying, regardless of how
well they're saying it or poorly they're saying it and how well we are saying it
or poorly we're saying, that trusting, it comes from something true in their
experience. And maybe some of the work for us is to tap into what is that true
from their experience. So all this about deep listening and this comes from a
receptive and caring stance, a receptive and caring perspective. Of course can be
supported by loving-kindness meditation. To find some warmth or warm-heartedness
or be able to connect to that stance or that perspective or that experience is a
great way to support us in deep listening. And deep listening and loving-kindness
is a beautiful way, beautiful way to help with all these things that are
troubling, that are difficult. They may not be the only thing, but it's a
beautiful way in which to create a foundation from which there's some
wisdom might arise on what else we might do, have some warm-heartedness and some
deep listening. Okay, so with that as an introduction, I'd like to take and alert
a bright posture, a posture that has both some ease and some alertness. In some
ways the posture could be a great place to practice listening to ourselves. What
is what is the body? How does it feel right now? What does it need? Is this the
is there a way that we could adjust our posture slightly that feels more
supportive, more sustainable? And just feel into the posture. What is it like to have
this particular configuration? To have the body in this particular... I want to use
the word shape, but not towards fitness, but towards like this asana. If you know
that word, it's essentially posture. What does it feel like to sit here right now?
Can you sit and know that you're sitting?
As you feel the body, you might notice the body is breathing.
Maybe it's obvious, maybe it's a little bit subtle. Can we just rest our awareness
on the sensations of breathing?
Maybe it's the abdomen moving, the chest moving, or maybe the air going in and out
of the nose. Just resting our awareness on the sensations of breathing.
It might be that you're often finding yourself lost in thought.
Can you have that not be a problem? Of course you're lost in thought. You've been
thinking all day chances are. So just very simply, gently begin again with
awareness on the sensations of breathing.
What would it be like to listen deeply to the experience of breathing? That is to
attune ourselves with the experience of breathing without straining.
There's no need to push or strive in a relaxed, easy way. Maybe if you hear your
favorite song in a noisy restaurant, like, oh, are they playing that song? In a
nice, easy way. Not that you have to make everything else quiet. Maybe that wasn't a
good example. Maybe that's a little bit too much straining. More like feeling from
the inside. Then to begin our loving kindness practice.
Bring to mind a loveable being. A being in which your can't help but have a little bit
of a smile, whether it's an obvious smile or maybe the smile is only internal. It could
be somebody you have a relationship with that you know. It could be somebody that you
know of but don't have a relationship with. Or some people like to imagine kittens, puppies,
babies, little chicks, fluffy little chicks. You might feel into the body and see if there's
any sense of a warm heartedness or maybe even a small bit of delight. Like, oh, yes, I love
this being. Or maybe love isn't the right word. I have good will or deep friendliness.
A lot of care, warmth. Then to support our cultivating loving kindness while having this
loveable being in mind, we can repeat the phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy.
May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you be safe. May you be happy.
May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you be safe. May you be happy.
May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe. May you be happy.
May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
You're welcome to modify the phrases through the millennia, through the centuries, through
the years, through the translations. Of course, the words have changed a little bit. It's
not so much that the words are magical. It's how they support us in cultivating warm heartedness
so you might have other words that are more resonant. Of course, these words don't need
to be in English. There might be another language that's the language of your heart. But an
encouragement to keep them, the phrase, is simple.
You can also use the
sensations in the body as a support. There might be a little bit of warm heartedness
or tenderness that you feel in the chest or near the heart. There might be a little sense
of contentment or well-being. These sensations might be really subtle. They might be really
obvious. Or maybe it's not even quite clear what I'm talking about. It's all perfectly
fine. If there are feelings of ease, spaciousness, warm heartedness, you can allow those sensations
to get as big as they would like. To grow or stretch without making anything happen or
just allowing.
May you be safe. May you be happy.
May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
And then to build on this foundation of loving-kindness that we're cultivating, developing. You can
expand it to include ourselves, loving-kindness for ourselves. Sometimes we might think that
loving-kindness we extend to everybody else and forgetting ourselves. It's important
to include ourselves. So you can retune into the felt sense of the body sitting here. Or
maybe bring to mind an image of yourself. Some people like to choose an image of when
they were children, even toddlers. Some people like to choose a contemporary image. Which
ever one, whichever way. Can we bring some of the warm-heartedness that we were cultivating
developing towards the loveable being and just expand it to include ourselves.
May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy.
May I live with ease. May I be safe.
May I be happy. May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be happy. May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
Would it be like to have this experience of being with loving-kindness and to listen to
oneself. In a kind-hearted, warm-hearted way.
To listen with care.
To listen with care.
To listen with care.
To listen with care.
To listen with care.
To listen with care.
And to end this meditation. Feel your feet on the ground, the pressure of the chair, the
cushion against your body. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
Yeah, so this idea of creating an environment, which is filled with warm-heartedness, care,
warmth. It helps create the conditions in which we can hear ourselves better, we can hear others
better. Hear what's been said and what's not being said.
So now I'd like to create an opportunity for you all to practice deep listening in some
kind of way. That is to have you in groups of three or four. And you can talk about either
your ideas about deep listening or your experience with that meditation or maybe more generally
your experience with loving-kindness practice. And then not so much that this is a regular
conversation, but that one person might share and maybe part of speaking out loud is part
of listening to what's inside of yourself. While others are listening and witnessing
what's being shared. So not so much giving advice to one another or things like that,
but as to kind of consider this as an extension of this practice and an exploration to this
idea of deep listening and the practice of deep listening.
So I'm going to put you into some breakout rooms and we'll have, okay so people are leaving
so I keep on changing the rooms here so that doesn't end up with nobody in their rooms
here. It should be about three of you per room now. Maybe four, so three or four in a room.
And we'll take about 12 minutes. How's that? An opportunity to give this type of a practice
a little bit different than just a minute. Okay, great. Have fun.
So we have a few minutes here. I'd love to hear something. Drake, are you raising your
hand or are you, nope, nope, nope. Could be shaking the side, no. So is there, somebody
would like to make a comment or share? What was that like to practice deep listening or
talk about deep listening? It was really quiet and we didn't, there's
lots of silence, it was great. We had some good deep listeners.
Thank you, Ek. Yeah, this idea that maybe listening allows there to be space and allows
there to be quiet. Thank you. Anybody else have something they'd like to say?
When we finished sharing the first round, it was so nice. People wanted to know where
everybody was from. And there was this huge, you know, virtual embrace, basically. That's
how I experienced it. Nice. Yeah, I saw that, Elizabeth, you have
that you're from Vancouver. And Kim, who was on here, she's from British Columbia too,
what I was thinking, like, oh, I wonder if they will end up in the same room and connect
you know, in this way. Zoom just does this randomly who gets in which room. So it can
be nice to see people from the same area. It's nice to meet people from other areas too.
Anybody else have a comment? Yes, Susan, I feel happier.
Yeah. With a bow, with a bow. Yeah, I'm happy to hear that.
This is recalling this happy hour, right? But maybe I'll say this, I'm very pleased and
delighted to hear this. But also I want to say that sometimes when we do this practice,
everything except happiness arises. And that's part of how this works, that we're just putting
the conditions into place. But it's not uncommon for somehow the mind to start thinking about
to all the things or all the times that there haven't been happiness, safety, health or ease.
And that's okay. Somehow this practice is to help us kind of have the capacity to hold
that experience as well. So, okay, so it's seven o'clock. So maybe I will unmute us all.
And we can say goodbye, just kind of like have an opportunity to hear everybody's voices
together. So goodbye and good night.
Bye, thank you. Bye, have a good night.
It feels warm, Diana, thank you. It feels warm.
Oh, good, good. Thank you, Abraham. We need this.
Yes, yes, we do. We really do. Thank you, everybody.
Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, Diana.
Yes, my pleasure. And I really needed this today. Thank you.
And with a deep bow, right, to everybody for showing up, showing up. And we do this practice
for ourselves and for each other, right? It wouldn't be quite the same if you were the
only person that showed up. And right, there's something about all of us doing this together.
Yeah. Okay. Bye.
Bye.
I wish you all a beautiful evening. Bye, thank you.
Bye.
Bye-bye. Yeah, bye. Bye-bye.
