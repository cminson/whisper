 Good morning everyone. The topic this morning is beauty and it occurs to me it's a beautiful day to talk about beauty. I'm going to start with a reading. This is from Diane Marie Child. I quote her a lot so you've probably heard that. Form is the language of the universe singing its praises. It's rejoicing is seen everywhere. In the sun through a web of hair. In the flower and its petals. In the subtle folds of a garment. In the human body. I watch the fog swim over the fir trees in the morning. The fog brings a lushness to the forest. It dripped from the moss clinging to the trees. It fell from the sky like a soft rain. When the sun burned through the fog. Its rays sparkled through the spider webs that hung on the bushes and fences. I watched the deer forage for food in the backyard. I spent hours walking along the beach enthralled by the gray winter ocean. A few inquisitive seals swam along the shoreline keeping pace with my movements. Flocks of gulls preened on the beach undisturbed by the solitary woman walking quietly by. There is beauty all around us. Can you find time this week to notice the universe singing its praises. This idea of the importance of beauty and bringing beauty into our spiritual lives was first made known to me several years ago by a Russian teacher with whom I was studying Raj Yoga. And I remember clearly the night she said to us, you must bring beauty into your lives. It's important on the spiritual path that you include beauty. And I remember feeling sort of affirmed and in a way a sense of relief because I knew I loved beautiful things. And I loved things like the ballet and symphony and good plays and wonderful art. And she listed some of those things and it was like, oh, it's okay. I wasn't being indulgent, you know, as my life was simplifying and I was clearly on a spiritual path. And I wasn't sure if it was a little indulgent to love going to the ballet. But I see now what she meant. I see the importance, value of having beauty. It's a theme that I've used a couple of times with the women at Elmwood. These are women that I assume probably haven't had much beauty in their lives. And I teach mindfulness. I try to give them something to pay attention to, you know, a sort of homework each week. And a couple of times I have used beauty. So one time I just suggested they look for the beauty around them, you know, oh yeah, right, in jail. But they did. And then another time I suggested they look for the beauty in each other and in themselves. I think it was easier to look for it in each other because they talk quite readily about that. And I was really pleased this Friday when a couple of women gave clear examples. One woman talked about her walk from the dorm to the laundry in the mornings at 7 a.m. And she noticed the air on her skin and how fresh it was in the sky and how fresh she felt as she took that walk to the laundry. She was alone and I thought that was really lovely. And she also mentioned a sunflower that grows in a particular spot in the garden. And somebody else was mentioning, oh yeah, the yellow flowers that are over here. Another woman talked about noticing a pigeon with a long piece of straw that he was carrying or she was carrying to the nest. And it really pleased me because, you know, I'm quite sure these are the kinds of things that these women have not paid attention to before in their lives. And they are beginning, they're beginning to see the beauty in each other and to see beauty where it is. I think beauty, like so many things in our practice, we can both cultivate and the awareness of the appreciation of beauty naturally arises. I think it comes as we look more deeply, see more clearly, see more deeply and develop an acceptance for all of life. When we do that, then we begin to see the beauty that is inherent in everything. And perhaps our ideas of beauty begin to change. Certainly mine have. I think of a time that I was writing with a friend and noticed a pond with algae growing all over it. And I said something about, oh look how beautiful that is. And her reaction was, yuck. One time several years ago, I watched a documentary on Rwanda, the Civil War in Rwanda. And of course, there was death and destruction everywhere. And at one point, it showed these dead bodies in a courtyard. And I had the reaction that this was beautiful. And I can't explain it to you. I can't tell you in words why I thought that was beautiful. It was an inner arising, it just arose. But the very next day, I saw Gangaji, who has been a teacher of mine. And in a small group, I mentioned this. And she said, yes. And I said, but I wouldn't tell anybody else. And I'm not sure I have except here. She said, of course not, because the chance for misunderstanding is so great. You know, you don't just go out and say, oh, what a beautiful scene, these dead bodies. But there was something of beauty in those bodies lying in the courtyard. At the same time, of course, there was the horror of death and the destruction and what had happened. Probably all of you have had the experience, as I have, of seeing someone whom you thought was not physically very attractive. And then getting to know that person, know them really well. And at some point, it dawns on you. Oh, yeah, I don't even I don't even see the physical characteristics anymore. This person is beautiful to me. And of course, the physical characteristics haven't changed. But when we get to know the person, the inner person, here, she is beautiful. That always amazes me when it happens. And I was thinking, you know, when we bow to each other, we're really bowing to that inner beauty, to that to the essence of each other, to that divine spark, Buddha nature, if you will, which, of course, is inherently beautiful in each one of us. So why why is it important to bring beauty into our lives, to put our attention on beauty? Several reasons. I think it's inspiring. I have found just over the last couple of days thinking about preparing for this talk, that that I have felt sort of like when you do metta loving kindness, you know, this light heartedness, this wonderful feeling, just remembering and thinking about all the beauty and all the different ways I see and appreciate beauty. It brings joy, brings calm, brings peace. And I think, for me, it also brings a change in how I see things. Wayne Dyer, who is on Channel nine was last night, says, when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. And that's my experience. And as I look deeply, as I look more closely at the true nature of everything, people, things, algae, dead trees, that reminds me there's a spot on the way down to Monterey that I see every Monday as I drive, I still drive to Monterey every Monday. And there's a section where there's dead dead trees, dead wood in water. It's almost like a petrified forest. And I found that my eyes are drawn to that every day. It's unconscious now. It's just I know where it is. And as I come around the corner, my eyes are looking for it. It has a distinct beauty. It's not what we would normally say, you know, look at a beautiful picture or a garden and say, oh, isn't that beautiful? But it has come to be really beautiful to me. Another reading. Beauty Way. The beauty way in Native American teachings is the way of balance, of living in harmonious relationship with all of life. The harmony and balance we seek is within us. We are born with this knowing. There are many reasons this harmony is lost to us through our racial, cultural and gender experiences. The times we live in seem particularly difficult for reestablishing this harmony. Yet we can take great comfort and joy in De'Ani's words. The quality of our laughter and joy, the knowledge of our voices, thoughts and actions, our weaving beauty around the land. Wherever our lives take us, harmony is there inside us, waiting for our discovery. Expression of this inner harmony creates balance and beauty in the world. Our knowledge, our thoughts and our actions count. We can make a difference. Awakening and bringing forth this natural harmony in the world is a responsibility that each of us shares. This is not a burden. Creation and transformation are delightful tasks in which we may all take part. I find that focusing on beauty inclines the mind. I like that term, inclines the mind towards the beauty. It helps to get away from the judging and the comparing mind. I've had such a strong comparing and judging mind and it's been really useful to, as I say, really look deeply and closely and begin to appreciate the differences, the unique beauty in each one of us and in everything. Another example I saw when I was walking over at Elmwood on Friday, tumbleweeds. We don't see tumbleweeds too much in this area but there were a couple. And tumbleweeds many years ago became very special to me. I went to high school in the southwest in New Mexico and at prom time we didn't go to big hotels like kids do now. We decorated the gym where there are many tumbleweeds in New Mexico and so one of the things we did was collect tumbleweeds and spray them, some silver and some gold, and they decorated the gym on prom night. When we walked in it was like a fairyland so even though that was 40 some years ago I never see a tumbleweed that I don't think of that. Tumbleweeds aren't brown to me, they're silver or gold. Driving up to Yosemite, you know, a few years ago there was a really large forest fire and again the first instinct can be, oh how ugly, all these burned dead trees. But then on second looking I can see the beauty. You know they're all different shapes, they've gone all different ways. You can see spots where the fire mist where there's still some green or some brown. I think the burned forest has its own unique beauty and of course when we remember that it takes a forest fire to, what is it, spark the the redwood, what are they called, whatever, anyway, to grow new redwood trees then we can appreciate the value of the fire and what it leaves. Zen practice puts a lot of emphasis on beauty although I don't know that they necessarily speak of it as beauty but everything is done with so much attention and so much care. Everything in a zen dough is beautiful. It's very simple, very simple but very beautiful. Spirit rock I think is the same way. Spirit rock to me is so beautiful in its simplicity. It's that elegant simplicity. So by inviting and appreciating beauty we begin to see beauty everywhere. We see things not through our judgmental eyes, not through our comparing mind but through the eye or the mind of equanimity which sees everything as it is. Beauty and grace are performed whether or not we will or sense them. The least we can try to do is to be there. This is from Annie Dillard in the commentary. Annie Dillard in her daily walks to Tinker Creek showed us how to truly see. She took the time to look whether it was at a spider, a bird, a flower or a tadpole. She stopped and she looked. Beauty is happening all around us. Can you take a moment this very day to stop, breathe deeply and look? Even if you live in the city, look at a tree or some flowers in a window box that you pass every day on your way to work. Take a minute to observe them. Do it every day for a week. Notice what feelings or thoughts arise in you as you practice deep looking. Is there a time when no thought arises? Can you see simply the color and the shape? When the mental conception quickly arises, can you notice it and come back to the color and the shape? So we see that it becomes a process. We look for beauty. We put our attention on beauty. We look deeply. We look more clearly at everything around us. We accept what we see. We accept life as it is and everything becomes beautiful. When we change the way we look at things, the things we look at change. So I'd like to invite some of your thoughts on beauty, your experiences, how beauty has manifested perhaps, changed in your lives, what you've seen when you look deeply, when you see things clearly and see them as they are. You know, it's something that I find really hard to put words to, really hard to explain. I suspect it had to do with the acceptance of things as they are. Death is not separate from life. Death and life are part of being. The bodies themselves are beautiful as all bodies are. When we don't overlay that picture with thoughts and ideas about this war is terrible and how awful that people are killing each other and you know the whole story of how it came about, etc., etc. Just the bare experience, just the raw picture of these bodies was beautiful. Does that help? Yeah, I guess what I'm recommending when you say that is as I would look at from the man who had pushed the eye, I would probably have all the time separated, whereas looking at the bed by the inside, you would possibly see some regularity. That separation is much easier. Yes, right, right. I think that's what it was. I think it was just a moment of that bare attention, you know, that bare scene. They were just bodies and as just bodies, they were beautiful. It certainly wasn't something I thought, you know. I didn't think, oh, this is beautiful. It just arose from inside. Yeah, and for that moment, I think, there wasn't the story of how it happened or what was going on or who was right or wrong or any of that. It was just the bare experience. I mean, it startled me as well, you know. Yes. You reminded me of a saying that stuck with me for years and I'm not sure of the sequence but that in the title was without the garbage, there was no rose. That garbage, right. But there's the beginning of the whole and I'm trying to take that to a distance of what you're saying about the bodies as well, you know, are people who thought that stick with the rose that they want to be sitting for the end of the cycle. That's right. That's right. Yes, I heard that from Thich Nhat Hanh many years ago too and forever changes your view of garbage, doesn't it? And the rose. That's right. You had your... Like John over there, I was also a free fighter and really a terrible... Are you making the statement that physical beauty is morally youthful in the sense that you should extract away the larger picture and context from physicality and focus only on its physical reaction to the new piece? That's a big one. I'm not saying should to anything. I think beauty is morally neutral, yes. I'm suggesting actually that we look deeply, that we go beyond the surface appearance of things. You know, we're so conditioned in our society, in any society really, any society has ideas about what is beautiful and what is not beautiful. And the saying is really true that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. You know, we can see that clearly with each other when somebody likes a particular painting and somebody else thinks it's awful or somebody thinks this person is really beautiful and somebody else thinks not at all. Obviously, each of us has a little different sense of what is beautiful and what is not, although there's some cultural agreement. But I think what our practice asks us to do and what Thich Nhat Hanh says so clearly when he talks about the rose becoming garbage and the garbage becoming the rose is to look more deeply, to look beyond the superficial, to look beyond our conditioning and see people, things, events, everything at their core, to see them as they are, to see the without all the story, without all the overlay, just the bare noticey, just the simplicity of anything or anyone as it is. Does that make sense? It's sort of a paradox in a way, I realized this as I was thinking about it, that I'm talking about beauty and suggesting we bring beauty in our lives and ultimately what I'm saying is there's no difference. So we focus on beauty, this happens a lot in our practice too, we put our attention on beauty and ultimately it fades because beauty becomes everything, everything is inherently beautiful, everything has its own beauty and beauty then loses its meaning, it's not a value, it's not a description and for me that's the beauty of it. When everything becomes beautiful to me that is joy and that is freedom, when my judging, comparing mind can stop and just see differences, just see diversity, just see uniqueness, wow that is so much more pleasant, so much more joyful than critiquing every single thing and of course the mind still does it. I can see the conditioning in myself, I go out for a walk in a residential neighborhood, anywhere really and my eye is drawn to a perfect landscape a garden that is perfect because that's my conditioning but when I really look I realize that the overgrown, the mature garden is really in many ways preferable to me, I really enjoy it and appreciate it in some ways more because I know and I've experienced where I live, the perfectly manicured garden has cut off you know a lot of blossoms before they were ready to be cut off, has sheared off bushes or whatever so they're perfectly straight, it's totally unnatural, you know it has probably pulled up plants that were dying or turning brown long before their life was really over and planted new plants in its place and it's not natural, it's not you know just arising but my conditioning is so strong that my eye automatically goes for what I would term the perfection, you know it's not perfection at all but that's how I've been conditioned and the freedom from that, you know the freedom not to always judge things and assume that some kind of straightness is perfection, it's very pleasurable to me. Anybody else? Where I live it's very beautiful and people don't drive much faster than about 60 miles an hour and I recently had the opportunity to drive through Illinois and Missouri driving a van 75 miles an hour, trucks on all sides of me and I was really blessed by supplies going around big cities, St. Louis, Kansas City, I didn't even hear around the airport but to see all of the new structures of free weights and the curves of them and the way the light shines on this and what seems to be perfect engineering and how beautiful the light will shine on the gray curves that went you know for miles just to get around something coming from somewhere where it's beautiful, usually when I get in a car and start driving I start feeling compression all around me, a density in the air and it was really, well I was glad that I didn't have a lot of diversion and then as soon as I turned this one curve on one of the highways all of a sudden there was just gorgeous bridges the way they were all formed and I had this sense of confidence, that's a beautiful example, candle comes from Hawaii where it is beautiful but that's a wonderful example because it would be so easy certainly for me to see all the concrete and have the aversion think how ugly oh yeah and to have it reframed to have you put it like that is very nice, yes? That's right when we have love and acceptance there is only beauty isn't there but that can be challenging because our conditioning is so strong to judge, to criticize, to compare, to evaluate. Yes? I was growing up, I grew up in the Detroit area, when I was young I didn't know people told me the jokes about it and I thought when they take us to the Fort Worth industrial complex which is five square miles we won't go into the talks at least in a minute but it looks impressive and I thought it was really beautiful at the time in my innocent child's mind but as I grew up in the northbound things that I was like news about it got a bit ugly and stayed that way and only recently I really worked on it and I haven't really seen it because I didn't know that after I guess it was redesigned and now supposedly birds and that's how it's beautiful and that's what it's sort of a question and maybe there's a certain beauty to it or maybe you know you had it on that I don't know I appreciate it but this kind of shows how you start with that innocence and then all the ideas coming out so that's a process too isn't it where in your innocence it's beautiful and then you realize what it's all about and it becomes not so beautiful and then the next step again is to go back to the beauty but this time not with innocence with understanding but seeing clearly seeing it as it is anybody else yes oh um form is the universe singing its praises Diane Marie Child the book is called open mind it's a book of daily readings yes the specific quote is form is the language of the universe singing its praises its rejoicing is seen everywhere in the sun through a web of hair in the flower and its petals in the subtle folds of a garment in the human body form is the universe singing its praises form is the manifestation of the universe yes she was laying some field of psychology and I experienced this first one by the cinema conference where they showed a video of two teams of people played basketball dribbling we were asked to count the number of dribbles by one of the teams and then everyone was asked how many dribbles of course that wasn't quite a bit of all they said well now we were told just to look at the people that build black t-shirts so that's the attention of the directly so they played the video again and they said now don't just look at the people with black t-shirts look at everything going on stand your words and we can use the same video they rebounded the play when they played at this time someone dressed in a gorilla suit danced through the middle of the basketball dribbles and went like this and then went off no one in the room hundreds of people saw the person in the gorilla suit and they've done many different experiments like this of the other sorts where things were changed and no one saw it because they were asked to focus on a certain thing and this came to mind for me as you speak because the point is that we are aware of what we focus on but we pay attention to that awareness and seeing as a conscious choice so seeing beauty sometimes we can miss it when it's right there unless we are seeing clearly it's a conscious choice yes yes I like that seeing clearly as a conscious choice and somehow what you say reminds me of you know how in the cracks in cement or macadam little weeds or or little things will grow and again my conditioning you know have everything just so my first reaction is to pull it out and of course I used to and now I noticed that is still my first reaction I don't do it anymore the second reaction is oh wow you know look at the tenacity of life look at how life pokes up even here even in in this crack yes okay anybody else yes one of the parts of my practice that's been difficult is taking the care of my cat the cats are naturally carnivores so I gave them chicken wings and the heart of the birds yesterday when I was eating my breakfast time the chicken came over watching my cat chew on these bones certainly I just saw this flash of all of this white teeth white strong teeth and this bone that she was chewing and I just have never seen her quite that way seen it quite happily for that moment it was quite startling and sometimes I see little numbers of bones left over you connect more than you did about the time when we did some things and there's lots of these little sounds like you're having a piece of like a party and there's something about happiness in here yes yes I just had a few of them differentiate art process or class and I'm interested in how they at the end they look what they did but there's this initial disconnect of I know shame comes up with people with the making more making as if the order is outside as if the art is outside, not as a me. Definitely, you can speak to it a little bit, it gets generalized in beauty. And if some population doesn't show up, I'm much more eager, then we'll go right in. Take that risk. But it's curious to me that I can't do it, it's separate from me. And it takes a while to get to the place of, oh, this is in me all along. I can make this almost like a spider spinning it's about. It just came from me. Yes. And I think that perception of being active versus passive is somehow related to this. Yeah, I think there are so many pieces to that. One thing that comes to mind is, so often as children, as very young children, we got told this was pretty or this was not pretty. Somehow our work was evaluated. And for many people, many of us stopped drawing at a very, very young age, believing that we couldn't, because there was that external evaluation of what was produced. And there wasn't a sense that it came from inside, or that if it did, there was any value in that. It was only what was on the paper. Or you were supposed to draw a specific thing, we're all going to draw a bird now, we're all going to draw a tree now. And then it was evaluated in comparison to the tree that we were shown, not what came from within. And so I think very early on we learned to judge things like art by a certain standard that has nothing to do with what it might be expressing or how it came out. And that's probably true in many, many ways for a lot of us. I know it's really only in the last few years that I have learned and continue to learn to live from the inside out. And I can look back now and see how much of my life was taking ideas from the outside and imposing them on my life and trying to make my life that way. I was never encouraged to see what came from inside to live the life that wanted to be lived through this body. And I have to say it's been a real challenge and at times excruciating to learn to change that, to learn to live from the inside and let go of all that external putting on to me what I should be. Yeah, thanks. This conversation you had about what I've seen as well and now it's sort of a classic drawing book, a drawing on the right side of the brain that talks a bit about what are the hang-ups people have is that when you're trying to draw a person's face, we all think we already know what it is to draw the whole lives of the person. But that's not really what we're seeing. And it tries to help you get less from what you think a person looks like to what you're actually really seeing in their moments. I mean you can actually really let go of what you should be and what you've told your stories of the person that's a stick figure with the belongs of the legs, it's hard to really see what you believe there when you're talking about the color of the form and just to find that everybody has the ability to really be kind of in a mindful way because they're really experiencing what they're really... ...imposing, yes. Okay, let me close with this reading from the prophet on beauty. Where shall you seek beauty? And how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide? And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech? The aggrieved and the injured say, beauty is kind and gentle. Like a young mother half shy of her own glory, she walks among us. And the passionate say, nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread. Like the tempest, she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us. The tired and the weary say, beauty is of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit. Her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow. The restless say, we have heard her shouting among the mountains. And with her cries came the sound of hooves and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions. At night the watchmen of the city say, beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east. And at noon tide the toilers and the wayfarers say, we have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset. In winter say the snow bound, she shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills. And in the summer heat the reapers say, we have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves. And we saw a drift of snow in her hair. All these things have you said of beauty. Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied. And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy. It is not a mouth thirsty nor an empty hand stretched forth, but rather a heart inflamed and a soul enchanted. It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear, but rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears. It is not the sap within the furrowed bark nor a wing attached to a claw, but rather a garden forever in bloom and a flock of angels forever in flight. People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face. But you are life and you are the veil. Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity and you are the mirror. So may our appreciation and cultivation of beauty be for the benefit of all beings everywhere. May all beings walk in beauty.
