 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Oh, okay. So, hello and welcome everyone to this rendition of Happy Hour. So, today's Happy Hour, I'd like to invite us to consider bringing a perspective of and the practice of joy, to bring more joy into our lives. Joy is a very important practice. It's not a luxury. It's not, oh, it's reserved for some. And also if I'm a serious Buddhist practitioner, oh no, I would be really serious. I wouldn't have so much joy. Quite the opposite actually. Joy, happiness, bliss are parts of the path as the Buddha has taught this path leading to nibbana, to liberation, to freedom. The steps along the way actually you require, the happy heart, happiness, bliss, joy are part of the path when the heart is happy, when the mind is joyous, letting go, letting go becomes easier, concentration, settling of the mind becomes easier. So, it's actually good for our practice and also it's good for our humanity. Joy, gladness is good for us and for others too, as we show up in the world, as we serve others and practice is not supposed to be this grim duty. And there is a line that I heard actually recently in a documentary that I saw I wanted to share with you and the documentary was excellent, by the way. So, Haile recommended the name of the documentary is Jazz Fest and New Orleans Story. I don't know if any of you have seen it yet, but I saw it on the plane when I was coming back. So, whether or not you're interested in jazz, it was a really wonderful documentary about New Orleans and also the challenges that New Orleans has had with Hurricane Katrina and also the joy of music and musicians creating. And there was this line that really caught my attention. One of the musicians was saying that, and I forget home so I can't give him credit, life is to be enjoyed, not endured. And that really landed for me, especially the word endured because I think sometimes maybe our perspective becomes one of enduring like, okay, all right, suffering, or I'm going to endure this somewhere, I'm going to be really loyal to my suffering, I'm going to endure this life. And yet we forget about joy. We forget about enjoying. How can we bring more joy? And it's not just about hedonic pleasures so that we distract ourselves into oblivion, just enjoying, enjoying and not looking at sorrow and suffering, but the balance is needed. The balance is needed, not just trying to endure, but also bringing joy, gladness. And that's what we do at happy hour. We do try to see, feel into the suffering, of course, it's there, but we bring care, we bring love, we bring gladness, we bring joy, we do that. So this is a practice we do already, but this is another way to really look at it from this perspective of this quote, not to be just endured, not to just be endured, but to have joy, to cultivate joy. So with that as the frame, as the frame for this practice, let's meditate together. Let's meditate. So I'd like to invite you to arrive, to settle in your seat, arrive in your body. Ah, to settle here, here, whatever has happened, all the busyness has come before to let it go. Just arrive here in this moment. Here, here. If the mind is flighting, just with the simple words here, very kind. Well here sweetheart, here, just here, just here, with this body, with these sensations, with this breath, just here darling, here. If you can rest, please rest. Please rest. Just rest. Taking a few minutes, just rest. There's no doing to be done. Let the heart be quiet and peace at rest. The body just being breathed. The comfort, the comfort of taking refuge in this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Letting go, letting go, letting go of thoughts, if they come, saying thank you, thank you not now. As if the breath is a pleasant, loving lullaby, just calming your heart, calming the body in this moment. Oh dear body, dear heart, rest, rest. Rest sweetheart, relax, it's okay, it's okay. It can all wait really. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And when you find mind is wandering, thinking, ah, smile and relax the body some more, let go some more, lean into this moment with ease. As if you're stretching, you're stretching your arms, your limbs, like ah, yawning, ah, landing, arriving, stretching into this moment more fully. Here, here, here darling, telling yourself just here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Into water. Let this drop of color imbue this perspective, imbue your heart. This meditation is not to be endured, it is to be enjoyed. See what shifts in your heart, in your body, your mind with this. This meditation is not to be endured, it's to be enjoyed, ah, to be enjoyed. Not to think how it can be enjoyed, don't think, just drop it in. Your mind, your body knows what to do, just trust, just drop it in and rest and trust. Your heart will find its way, let yourself be surprised. No thinking or planning, just be breathed. Thank you. Thank you. The breath moving through your abdomen, just your limbs. A sense of solitude, delicious. With the breath just here, knowing, simply knowing this simple yet sublime. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoyed having time to yourself precious time silent to be breathed the support of Sangha to the community caring caring for yourself all aspects of care let yourself enjoy the goodness in all of this this simple moment can this breath this breath be enjoyed this in breath this out breath not just endured let your mind find the way don't struggle your mind knows how to do this relax you you you you you you you you you you can the sensations of breathing in the body whatever sensations are arising even if some are unpleasant can they still be enjoyed to have a body to sense to feel to be alive not just endured having a body can it be enjoyed this process of sitting sensing glistening touching even if you're tired or hungry can all this be enjoyed not just endured shift in perspective shift in perspective can this moment of your life right here simply sitting being breathed meditation in the heart and the heart of the heart is the only way to open to the sense of enjoyment of this moment not just enduring this moment trying to get through it to get to the next but if we let go of that way of being way of seeing just enjoyed what is even if there are challenges a crowd of sorrows can we open up to them hello life hi this moment what is mortgage board not to endure but to enjoy what is the malt This impermanent, impermanent life, impermanent moments, not to just endure them. They pass too quickly, all end too soon, but to enjoy the fleetingness, not in spite of, but because of its fleeting nature. And if there's a challenge arising in your sphere of experience right now, whether it's pleasant sensations of the body, fatigue, anxiousness even, whatever is happening right now, can we have a really spacious perspective, not just endure it, but can we expand our perspective? Ah, expand our heart, breathe around it, let the fact that this is at all, whatever it is here, can it be appreciated, even enjoyed, that anything exists at all? And if it has unpleasant feeling, true. And maybe a sense that can arise when the mind settles could be that there is just enjoyment. There's just delight. There isn't a me and mine. I want this, I don't want that. It's just enjoyment, delight, gladness, knowing itself, being known, not owned, not claimed without ownership. Mmm. Can you enjoy that? Yes, yes. Wholesomeness, planted, watered, yay. Enjoying your own goodness. A therapy delight. Yes, I am here. I am here. I am here. And sharing this goodness with all beings everywhere. May my goodness, my cultivation, and taking delights really recognizing this goodness, may it be cause and condition, serve as a cause and condition. For goodness in the world, for all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy, may all beings be free, including myself. Thank you, friends. Thank you for your practice. So we have a few minutes for reflections, questions, comments, anything that might have arisen. And please raise your Zoom hand, because if you raise your physical hand, I will not see you. And you can also type in chat if you type to everyone, I'll read your name. If you just type to me, I won't read your name, but just your reflection. So it'll be private. And I see Claire. Yes, Claire. Thank you. This gives me a chance to tell one of my all time favorite stories my whole life. I was listening to the radio many years ago, and they were interviewing an actress who was like Doris Day, somebody who always played really happy parts. And they were asking her about her life. And it went on from one awful story to a worse one. It just was her life was miserable. And so the the interviewer finally interrupted the interview and he said, you know, I've got to ask you with the life you've had, how could you possibly play the parts you do? And she paused and she said, well, you know, at one point I realized that I had a choice and I chose joy. That's stuck with me my whole life. And I go with it. Beautiful. Yes, exactly. We have a choice. Happiness is a choice you make. Beautiful. Thank you, Claire. That's lovely. Yeah. Such such wisdom, right? Can arise in so many places, so many ways and it lands. Yeah. You have a choice. We have she had a choice and we have a choice every single one of us. Thank you, Claire. So may we choose joy? May we choose joy, not a perspective of I have to endure another moment, another day, even if it's challenging as it is. It's human life. We all have our challenges. Welcome to being human. Thanks, Claire. So any other reflections? Questions, comments? Richard says gratitude works for me. Yay. Any other reflections? Was there? I wonder, here's a specific question. As I was inviting you to to really try a perspective of, especially if there was enduring, like there's a sense of enduring, like if you shifted towards towards enjoying, enjoying versus enduring. Did anyone play with that? Did it open up something for you in the practice that it wouldn't have? Was there a moment in your practice like, okay, another meditation practice. Oh, breath in and out. Like, oh, can I enjoy this? Any of you have a shift that opens something up for you? Would love to hear. Or any other. Opening. Again, for the benefit of everyone to share that. Closal, please. Just thought of some things that I have to do that. I'm not particularly excited about. Maybe I can approach it from a different perspective. Great. Great. Awesome. Yeah. Thank you for that. Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. I was also reflecting on that myself. There's like a few things I need to do that I need to do. I have to like, what if I really enjoy doing it? I'm not going to do it. So Susan, I see your hand, please. Yeah, it was a great reminder about the joy thing. I. Definitely got raised and then my life as a consultant. Really reinforced. Work before play kind of thing, you know, like, you know, and is the to do list ever done. Right. So this is great. You know, it's like, oh yeah. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. Two days ago, I learned that a dear friend of mine had just had a massive stroke and I was pretty upset yesterday. And then today I started getting where. Okay. You know, we're accepting it. And then, you know, it's like, okay, I think it's still okay to enjoy that I'm alive and not having a stroke. You know, It's helped as you said, how precious and fleeting and fragile it is. Exactly. Beautiful. Beautiful. He said, thank you for bringing that reflection in Susan. It's a lie for you. Yeah. We're here. It's, it's to be enjoyed to be grateful for not to focus on all the challenges. And yeah, I'm alive. I, I don't have XYZ of stroke being one of them. And, and also when you pointed out chuckling, like, yeah, this, this always worked before play, you know, always have a to do list. The to do list is never going to end. We're all going to die with an unfinished. Well, I'm going to die with an unfinished to do list. I know that. So we're never done. So that's sweet. Thank you, Susan. Thanks for those reflections. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. Avi has a reflection here. I'll read it. It's a long one. See related to enduring. It engaged my identity clinking, so to speak. I'm in joy and a small internal tension toward fear of the idea of just enduring. And then the moment of awareness around my fear of unhappiness. I'm also grateful for finding silver linings, much like the actress story that Claire mentioned with pain or suffering, finding the space there to learn, I guess. So thank you so very much. I get curious about equanimity around abundant joy, finding the balance and even background joy of neutral neutrality. Question mark. I think I'm a little unclear about the question at the end. Abby, if you want to raise your hand and clarify the question at the end, I see you have a curiosity about equanimity of the bandage. Well, maybe I'll say something if I don't address it. So, you know, equanimity, you know, which was the sense of equipoise and evenness of mind in the faith, which is not falling into nor nor pushing away. So with joy, you can absolutely enjoy joy, enjoy and have delight. As long as you don't attach to it, like, I want more of this. I want this to be there. So my life like, oh, this is great. Yum, yum, yum. It's like kissing. It's like this poem. We're getting the name of the poet. They'll come to me. It's like kissing the joy as it flies. You just kiss it as it flies. And there is the equanimity. It's like, oh, yeah, you kiss it as it flies instead of like trying to catch a butterfly and pin it and kill it. It's like, no, let the joy be. So that's the way equanimity can be coexistant with abundant joy. Yeah. Great. Thank you for that. Yeah. Yeah. I see it. I see your comment here. Sometimes I could cry or I could laugh. I see this as a comment. I'm not quite sure how to reflect on that. So I'll let that sit as it is. So many reflections on on YouTube here. Pick a couple, not a moment, but I'm coming out of the practice time in the mode of enjoying, not enduring. Yay. Great, Marty. And thank you, Seth. You listened to my conversation with Sam Harris and inspired by my life story. Story made be of service made serve you. Thank you. Marty also says die with a completed bucket list, but incomplete to do list. Sounds a okay to me. Oh, that's fun. So, so, so, okay. Here once a time has come for us to, to practice, to practice sharing our joy, sharing our kindness in small groups. So we've done it now in silence and in our meditation. And now we get the chance to enter the sandbox and practice relationally. So, so I'll create the breakout rooms. And as always, the invitation is be kind to yourself, be kind to others. You're invited to just offer a nugget, maybe just the word, you know, just a, not a word, just a sentence. What, what was this practice like for you? And you can also offer silence and say pass and hold kind space for yourself and others. The next person will say something. And then the third person, and they will come back to you. So please don't take the entire time, the long monologue, just say one short nugget and, and give time, make space for others as an act of kindness, as an act of generosity and care for everyone. And may not be appropriate to give your whole life story in the monologue, just a little nugget, just as an act of kindness to yourself and to others. So, and let's speak in reverse alphabetical order. And, and again, just speaking from your own experience, not managing on the group, just showing up with, with humility and kindness. So I'm opening the rooms, take care of yourself, take care of each other and be kind and enjoy, enjoy each other. Enjoy. Here we go. Closed everybody's back and it is seven o'clock. So, okay, well, we have wonderful reflections before. I'll see one quick question, follow up from Abby. So I'll just respond to it. And basically it's what she's following up on is about choosing moments of neutrality instead of joy or enduring. I would investigate whether there is a, whether actually there is a masquerading of choosing neutrality is actually pushing something away, whether it's pushing joy away or pushing. So that I'm hearing some masquerading there. So I invite you to explore that because ah, opening up to it is very different than choosing neutrality. There's some pushing away there. So watch out for that. All right, dear ones. Thank you so much for your practice, for your cultivation, supporting each other, supporting yourselves. And I see gratitude for your group there. And at least in the chat, I see that may all beings be well, may all beings be happy and free, including ourselves. Here we go. Thank you all. Take care. I'm teaching. Oh, I should, I should have mentioned this earlier. I forgot. Maybe I'll ask Neil. If Neil, you're still here to send email to the group to, um, uh, I'm teaching a concentration retreat at Spirit Rock on land for the next 10 days. So there are still spaces available. If you happen, if you want to do a retreat last minute, come there is space. Usually this, this one is a by lottery only, but there's some last minute cancellations. And there's also another program that's starting in a couple of weeks and that's mindful leadership training. It's a five month training program. So, so, um, so I'll be away for the next 10 days and actually next two weeks, teach you these two programs. And I look forward to seeing you when I get back and we'll send more information to the happy hour, Google groups. All right. Thank you all. Take good care.
