 Greetings, Greetings, Sangha. Wherever you are in this moment, on this planet Earth, good wishes to you. So we continue today, our fifth day in the series of exploring supportive conditions for Samadhi, for concentration, for calming, settling, unifying the mind-heart. And just to briefly remind us what we have worked with and all these conditions together are really support each other. It's not just one versus another, all of them together. The fabric, it's as if Samadhi's a fabric and it's made of all these threads, all these threads. Relinquishing what is not helpful. And on the other side of the coin, noticing there is joy in the present moment. This moment is enough, there is beauty, wonder, awe, and this, the simplicity of this moment. And then there is relaxing the body, relaxed body, so that we can support a relaxed mind. And that is only possible that becomes wise effort if on the other hand we have atapi, gentle persistence coming back over and over again. As well as what we discussed, vitaka and vichara, initial application, sustained application, connecting with the breath, surfing the breath, surfer enjoying, surfing the entirety of the breath. Today, we could have gone on more and more and yet today what we will add here is our attitude, our intention, our interest. Because the way we approach this practice makes a difference. Is the mind tight? Is the mind curious and interested to learn no matter what? Does the mind have zest? Does the mind have a wanting? I want the mind to settle. Does it want a state? Does it want an experience? So what is the attitude? Is the heart giving itself? Is it dedicating as if it's honoring, as if it's putting itself on the altar, as if it's a sacred act, this practice, ah, these dimensions of beauty and sacredness in the practice? Or do we have a work orientation? We bring the mind that we have in daily life, the achievement, the achievement orientation. Do we bring that? What is the attitude? What is the container? So becoming tuned to that again without judgment. If you notice, oh yeah, I really want to state, I really want to get concentrated and have absorption and, and, uh, upachara samadhi, the axis concentration, and John was okay. Yeah, there it is. Oh, sweetheart. Yeah, I know that brings, that brings tightness, that brings pain. It, practice becomes a source of suffering. So just know, just notice. So, so with that, let's, let's settle. Let's settle and begin. Ah, settling into our bodies. Landing, turning or gaze inward to the simplicity, delicious simplicity of taking refuge in this moment, taking refuge, in this body, in this breath, in the goodness, in the goodness of our intention, of wanting to wake up, wanting to cultivate goodness, kindness, peace, offering ourselves, offering ourselves wholeheartedly, trusting the goodness of our intention, connecting to something above and beyond ourselves, trusting, trusting this expansiveness, spaciousness of this goodness that we are a part of, whether or not we see it, we have access to it, trusting, trusting it and relaxing into it, trusting the stream that will carry us, letting the body relax, soften, as if you're floating, floating in a gentle, gently loving stream of goodness. If your body is tight, it's harder. Imagine yourself floating on top of the water with ease, stream of the Dharma, the goodness you're a part of. Turning away from what is not helpful, recognizing the joy, the delight of coming back, connecting with the breath, staying on the breath as if you were surfing, this beautiful wave of breath, this gift of the breath, for as long as possible before dropping off and connecting, catching the next wave, with interest, with reverence, not with expectation or tightness, but with grace, with Let the body be soft and relaxed. Letting go of any tension with each breath. calling to anything settling. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you checking in now and then is the body relaxed ah is the mind relinquishing turning away from what's not helpful in this moment recognizing the simplicity the joyful delicious simplicity of what's already here connecting with the breath and the lower abdomen if the mind is busy today the lower abdomen is most settling and serving the breath as many breaths as available enjoying surfing the joy of surfing the breath you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you what is the attitude of the mind that's meditating you you you you you you you and as we end the sit having appreciation, acknowledgement, gratitude for having been able to show up as much as well as it's been available letting our hearts bright in the goodness trusting there is goodness letting go of any judgment of oh distracted sleepy dot dot dot it's okay you showed up you showed up to the temple as well as you could walking, bouncing, crawling you showed up that's all that matters appreciating, appreciating yourself and sharing this goodness this goodness as a gift as a gift of generosity with yourself and all beings everywhere may our practice or cultivation of peace and goodness support the weakening of all beings everywhere including ourselves may all beings be happy may all beings be free for your practice
