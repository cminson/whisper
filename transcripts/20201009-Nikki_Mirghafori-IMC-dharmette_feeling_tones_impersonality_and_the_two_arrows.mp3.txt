Thank you for your practice, everyone. 
So, feeling tone, Vedana, valence, also translated and used in psychology, or hedonic tone. 
So, what we can notice is that not only is there this perhaps noticing the pleasant, unpleasant and neutral associated with an object, which, to say, it can take some time to get used to, to really notice. 
It's almost like in Asian languages, in Chinese, there are tonal languages such that it's not just the vowel, a, e, o, that in, for example, English are significant, they transfer, they give information, but also there is a tone, is it going up or down, a, a. 
The tone associated with the vowel has information, and for, for example, westerners. 
It's really hard when they're learning, say, Chinese and Asian language to, to notice the tone at first. 
We can be tone deaf. 
We can be tone deaf, not noticing. 
We can hear the vowels, but not notice the tones. 
It takes some paying attention to. 
Similarly, with noticing Vedana, feeling tone, pleasant and unpleasant or neutral, which is associated with an object. 
We can notice the object, oh, there's a sound, there's a sensation, there's a pain, but we may not notice the tone of it at first. 
So, if this week has been challenging, like, where is that tone? Please, please, hang in there. 
Don't lose heart. 
It's a practice. 
Your ear, your proverbial ear will become more attuned to noticing feeling tone, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, associated with objects, or how the mind perceives the object, because it's not inherent in the object. 
It'll start to pop up, and when you see it once clearly, usually in meditation, clearly seeing with some level of Samadhi, then it starts to pop up in other places. 
You start to see it also in your daily life. 
So, I'd like to encourage you to please hang in here with this practice. 
It can be a little nuanced, but really worthwhile. 
So, exploring impersonality today, that it's impersonal, it's not self, it's anatta. 
It just arises this way of perceiving, given our moods, given our views, given how we're feeling, our physical health, we associate, given our history, the mind associates particular Vedana with different experiences. 
And of course, there's some biological sense, as I mentioned a couple of meetings ago, for the painful ones associated, which usually have the pain in the body that has unpleasant Vedana. 
But other Vedanas, the mind can label them pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, and it's not inherent in the object. 
It just depends on how they get labeled. 
And to see that, to see that, oh yeah, who feels, who is it the one who is feeling this tone? There's a sense of it's being felt. 
Oh, unpleasant is just being felt. 
Pleasant is just being felt, or neutral, is just being felt. 
One can see there is no ownership. 
It can actually be one's opening, a way of opening into this profound teaching of not self, anatta, through Vedana, through seeing it just being felt. 
Unpleasant is just unpleasant, and seeing it kind of sitting there, it's in space without ownership, can be profoundly transformative in how we see ourselves and how we take this being to be. 
So a couple of things I wanted to share with you in some Yutta Agama discourse 29. 
These Vedanas, feeling tones, are likened to winds, and it's beautiful passage, I'll read it. 
It is just as fierce winds that can suddenly arise in the sky, coming from the four directions, winds that are dusty, or winds that are not dusty, world-pervading winds or world-destroying winds, weak winds or strong winds, even whirlwinds. 
Feelings, that's Vedana, Vedana in the body, are just like those winds, various types of feelings arise, one after the other, pleasant feelings, painful feelings, neutral feelings. 
So just like winds that arise and pass, strong winds, weak winds, world-destroying winds. 
So this metaphor isn't just a metaphor, it's an instruction. 
So there are various ways to practice within personality of Vedana. 
Today we chose who feels, who feels, which is actually a teaching from the commentaries. 
And it's not often taught, because it's in the commentaries, but who feels to explore, who is the one who is feeling Vedana, experiencing the pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. 
And this, seeing them as winds, that's another way. 
So had we had another week, we would explore all these different things. 
So I invite you, if you're curious, if you're interested in this topic, try this other teaching, this other metaphor. 
Another metaphor that's used in some Yutta Agama of the simile is of the guest house. 
And it goes as just as different kinds of people stay in the guest house. 
They come, they go, they come, they go. 
This body too is just like a guest house, pleasant and unpleasant and neutral feelings, just visit and leave. 
And by the way, that reference I gave 29, I just realized in my notes, that's not the number. 
I don't have the number of what were the discourses in some Yutta Agama. 
Oh, that was my paragraph number. 
So, so noticing, noticing these feelings, the feeling tones arising and passing, there can be a sense of freedom in the midst. 
They just arise and pass. 
We don't necessarily have to act upon them. 
We don't have to be slave to them. 
And this profound teaching, this profound teaching also shows up in a teaching that you might have heard about, about the two arrows, the two arrows, which is the Salata Sutta, the arrow. 
And many of us have heard that, that often when life hurts us with one arrow, we add a second arrow of lamentation and sorrow and why me and why this. 
And really this teaching in the Salata Sutta is based on Vedana, feeling tone. 
So the first paragraph, and it's a beautiful Sutta. 
Let me read some paragraphs for you. 
Practitioners, an ordinary person experiences pleasant Vedana, Sukha Vedana, unpleasant Vedana, dukkha Vedana, and neutral Vedana, adukha asukha Vedana, neither pleasant nor unpleasant Vedana. 
A well-instructed disciple also experiences pleasant, unpleasant and neutral Vedana. 
So what difference, what distinction, what distinguishing factor is there between the well-instructed disciple and the ordinary person? Interesting way of teaching the Buddha, like what is the distinction? And the Buddha continues, when touched with unpleasant or painful Vedana, the ordinary person then also experiences sorrow, grief, lamentation, beats their chest and becomes distraught. 
So they feel two pains, a physical and a mental pain. 
Just as if a person was shot with an arrow and right afterward they were shot with another one, so that they would feel the pain of two arrows. 
In the same way, when touched with painful or unpleasant Vedana, the ordinary person sorrows, grieves, laments, beats their chest and becomes distraught. 
So they feel two pains, physical and mental. 
As they are touched, I'm going to continue to read because I think the Sutta is beautiful, it's so instructive. 
As they are touched by painful Vedana, they become resistant. 
Interesting, they become resistant, here's a keyword. 
Then in they who so resist unpleasant Vedana, an underlying tendency of resistance against unpleasant Vedana comes to underlie their mind. 
Wow, profound, right? When you resist, an underlying tendency to resist the unpleasant comes to underlie their mind. 
Touched by unpleasant Vedana, they yearn for sensual pleasure. 
Why is that? Because the ordinary person does not know any escape from unpleasant Vedana, aside from sensual pleasure. 
Then in those who seek sensual pleasure, an underlying tendency to lust for pleasant Vedana comes to underlie their mind. 
They do not know as it actually is present, the arising and ending of these Vedana, nor the gratification, the danger and the escape connected with these Vedana. 
In they who lack the knowledge and underlying tendency to ignorance as to the neutral Vedana comes to underlie their mind. 
I think this is quite profound how the tendency, the resistance, the pushing away of the Vedana arises and then the tendency to always run away from painful Vedana towards sensual pleasure as it's translated, raga as lust. 
But it's not just lust, it's any sensual pleasure. 
In comparison, the well-trained disciple who's also been touched by Vedana, they do not resist it, the Buddha says. 
In them, no underlying tendency for resistance arises. 
Under the impact of painful unpleasant Vedana, they do not proceed to seek sensual happiness and why? As the well-taught noble disciple, they know an escape from painful Vedana other than seeking sensual pleasure. 
So what is the escape here? The escape isn't the pushing away, but it is the practice of the third and fourth noble truth. 
Seeing, knowing is what we've been practicing this week, getting to know Vedana for what it is and getting to see its impersonality, given that it just arises and passes. 
So that is the escape, it's impersonal, it just arises and it's there. 
It doesn't necessarily have to be acted upon when it's clearly, clearly seen. 
So in that way, the well-trained disciple only feels one arrow, which is the arrow of the Vedana, not two arrows. 
So that is the difference, the Buddha says, is the distinction between the well-instructed disciple and an ordinary person. 
So, dear ones, I hope that our practice together this week, practicing with Vedana, feeling-tone, has been supportive for you, for your practice, for your life.
