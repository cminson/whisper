 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. So, hello. Hello and welcome everyone to Happy Hour. I'm very happy to see you. Very happy to see you. So, for the theme for today, or practice together, I'd like to invite us to consider as we practice metta, compassion, the hard qualities tonight as we bring them in, the invitation is to pay attention, maybe drop in the question as to where is the rub? Where is the rub? Where is the rub in my experience? Where is the rub? And dropping in this question with gentle curiosity, with care, with love, as if you're asking a little child who's fallen on the, say, on the playground and they're hurting. And you say, sweetie, where are you hurting? Where is the rub? Where are you hurting? Where should I put, where should I plan to kiss? And usually with little kids planning to kiss where they say, it hurts here on my knee. You plan to kiss. It's like, oh, it's okay. So with that kind of a gentleness with ourselves, that sense of curiosity, gentleness, sweetie, where is the rub? Sweetie, where is the rub? Where does it hurt? And the rub might be very subtle. For many of us, subtle, it might be, oh, I'm tired. I'm overwhelmed with all the emails I need to answer. Oh, sweetie, yes, yes. You're pushing yourself. This is, so this is challenging. So instead of, come on, get it together. Let's get going. There's a sense of tenderness, kindness, holding where the rub is. So the invitation here is to turn our attention to start to really tune into where does it hurt? Where is the rub? Where is the rub? Because often we don't see where the rub is or where we, or we see it and we add more insult to injury or we push ourselves through or disregard it or, or maybe the self pity comes up, oh, poor me, this is terrible. So none, none of that is really helpful and needed. Again, with the same attitude we would have towards someone we care about, a little child that we care about at the same time. When that happens, when, when say a child has fallen on the playground, we don't fall into grief with them, fall into pain. There's a sense of stability that we have. There's a sense of strength as an adult that we show, sweetie, it's okay. You're hurting. Let me kiss where it's hurting. Let me kiss where it's hurting. And the child is both comforted and also suddenly they get the message that, oh, it's okay. The sky isn't falling. It's okay. There's a sense of stability that this adult has. So can we do that for ourselves? Can we have the sense of parenting? And in many cases, re-parenting for ourselves. And again, no need to go and fish for all the sadness and sorrow, the deepest, most challenging things. Just being present with what emerges in this moment from say today. And it could be very subtle. It could be very light. It could be, ah, my body's achy right now. That's where the rub is. So when my mind is achy or my heart is achy or I miss my friends, it could be very subtle or it could be grief or sorrow, whatever it is. So a light touch. I think that's what I'm also trying to bring in for this practice. A light touch, a light touch of holding as if you're placing a kiss, a light kiss on where it hurts for yourself. Okay. All right. So with that, I've spoken plenty. So let's begin. That is the frame. Let's begin. So as always, we begin by landing with the body. You can sit, you can lie down, see what your body needs in this moment. There are no shoots, no shoots whatsoever. That is the most caring, caring thing you can do. An expression of care. Relaxing, ah. Letting go of any tension or holding in the muscles, any contraction, the forehead, the jaw, the neck and shoulders. Let them land. Standing down their proverbial weight they've been carrying. Ah, inviting, inviting your heart. Heart center. Notice of emotions, inviting your heart to relax, to feel safe. It's okay. Whatever is happening in this moment, it's okay. It can be just as it is. Inviting, inviting your arms, the upper arms and lower arms and hands to let go of their weight. And continuing. Down the body with the chest, with the trunk, inviting the abdomen to soften. No need to hold, no need to hold it in. And no need to intentionally breathe. The breath knows how to breathe you. You've been breathing all these years without any effort, thank you very much. Don't let it happen, the breathing. Let it happen on its own. Getting out of the way and marveling at this body that knows how to breathe, that knows how to operate in these ways. The parasympathetic nervous system. Inviting, inviting the center of gravity to come down, down, down. Your lower abdomen, not in the head, not in the control tower. And receive the breath. Hello, dear breath, hi. Each breath, landing, arriving, letting go more deeply. Into the chair, into the cushion, letting your weight drop. All the tension, entire upper body releasing, releasing into your sit bones, releasing into the sit bones. And the legs, upper legs, releasing knees, releasing their weight. Lower legs and feet, releasing their weight. The feet grounded, touching the earth, you're sitting in a chair or find a cushion, your entire lower legs. Your sit bones. Ah, grounding, grounded like a well rooted tree. Here. The And just letting the breath be received in the abdomen. Not in the head, not thinking about the breath. As if the abdomen, the belly was an organ of perception, receiving. Only receiving the breath like a gift. The entirety of this gift of the in-breath. The entirety of this relaxing gift of the out-breath. Ahhh. You're seeing the breath another minute or two, settling, tilling the soil. Of calm abiding here, now. Ahhh. And if thoughts are arising, not a problem. This is what's here right now. Hello thoughts, hi friends. I greet you, I see you. I offer you up in this moment, please come back later. Smilingly, smilingly. Knowing how nourishing it is, just be with the breath of the body here. Thank you. And now, you are welcome to stay. Stay with the breath, stay with the body. With a sense of well-being, what may have arisen. Just sitting, receiving the breath. Supported by others, by friends, sangha members. Sangha sitting together. Together, in different places, different time zones. So you can continue to stay with the breath and the body if you wish. Or if you like, you can drop in the invitations that I will bring about in a minute. Stay and embody, feeling your feet, feeling the feet, feeling the sit bones, feeling the hands, feeling, feeling the breath in the abdomen. Wherever there is comfort in the body. Staying embodied, dropping in the invitation if you wish. Is there a rub? Is there a rub? Where is the rub? If any, your experience right now. Don't go fishing for it. If nothing comes up, that's okay. Maybe a sense of well-being, stability, which is lovely, lovely to continue to nourish. Sense of well-being. Sense of contentment. No need to go and fish for it. Metta, loving kindness, care. Could be simply caring for this being who is myself in this moment. By receiving the breath, relaxing the body. Being here, here for myself. The sweetest way to whisper to oneself, I love you, I'm here for you, it's okay. Simply this can be our Metta practice for tonight. Simply this being. And if, if you drop in the question, something comes up about, oh, where is the rub? Maybe somewhere in the body or in the heart space, in the emotional space. Just as, just as you may put a little kiss on a hurting knee of a little kid who's fallen in the playground, lovingly, caring, saying I'm here, I care, it's okay. Fully well-knowing, but the kiss is not intended to make it go away. Love, Metta, compassion are not hammers like a game of whack-a-mole to make pain disappear. No. They are blankets of care to support healing. Expressions of care, knowing that it might need some time, this pain, the body and the heart to move through. And it can be held with care, with a little kiss, letting it feel safe. See what is needed right now. Just breathing, or just being breathed and receiving with care. Thank you. If sorrow, sadness, various challenging emotions arise, can we make space for them? Let the body, the heart be relaxed, soft, making space with care for all these guests we're in, in this moment. Let the body, the heart be relaxed, with a sense of stability, groundedness, expansivedi You You You You If judgments are arising challenging thought patterns Can we include them? The space of care not believing them Not believing them Softening relaxing the body the heart Oh sweetheart. Oh dear. No need. No need For all these slings and arrows no need sweetie, okay Oh dear. No need for the body the heart Holding ourselves our heart our bodies with care Oh dear. No need for the body the heart Holding ourselves our bodies with care Blowing gentle kisses to where there may be a rub Now now there there You You You Friendliness Everything that's arising all thoughts all emotions all aches Sometimes smiling at them smiling with them Smiling with yourself The pleasant with the challenging Is a transformative tool can be give it a try Give it a try You You You You You If and when you find Awareness lost in thought can there be friendliness lack of judgment?

Thank you all for your practice Hmm So So many ways to practice metta Kindness, care, loving kindness towards ourselves And others with words, without words, with phrases, without phrases So many ways. And this was another way tonight With a sense of cultivating ease, cultivating stability, delight And then if there is a rub Again this example of placing a kiss On the knee of a little child who's fallen from the swing set for example It's okay sweetie, it's okay The same gentleness towards ourselves Again not using metta as a hammer to make pain and suffering go away Sometimes we use it that way Like okay, practicing compassion to make it go away Doesn't quite work that way But holding, supporting what needs to be here Supporting it to move through So I would love to hear from you You can raise your Zoom hand if you like Especially if you haven't shared for a while Well I haven't been here for a while now for a whole week And you can also share in chat if you wish Any questions, reflections, discoveries As a gift to the Sangha Yeah Appreciation coming on YouTube Yes and Aaron joining from Europe It's probably very early in the morning there Ah So the floor is open What did you discover, what happened?
