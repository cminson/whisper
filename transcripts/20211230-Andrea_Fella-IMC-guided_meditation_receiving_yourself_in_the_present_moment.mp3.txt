The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Now yourself to connect with however you are in this moment. Just to open to
however that is, not trying to change it, but just to acknowledge it, knowledge how
you are in this moment. Just receiving how the body is, whether it's comfortable or
uncomfortable, areas of tension, or areas of ease.
It's often helpful, but in the beginning to really just take stock of how you are
in this moment. How is the body? How is the mind? Is the mind scattered or
collected at ease or tense? Again, just acknowledging how you are. You sometimes
use the analogy of as if a friend were just checking in with you. How are you
right now? And that friend really able to hear you. That can feel quite lovely to
be met in that way. And that is what mindfulness can do with our experience.
Really meeting what's here. With an attitude or an openness of allowing what's
here to be here. Just to show up for ourselves. And it is interesting that in
showing up for ourselves, that very movement of the allowing, accepting
quality in the mind to just be how you are. That can create a container, create a
possibility for things to shift. Partly because sometimes we're resisting how
we are. And if that resistance to how we are can drop, quite a bit can be held.
There can be a quite a shift in the mind. And so exploring the possibility of just
opening to how you are. How is the body? If there's tension, just noticing tension.
There's ease, noticing ease. With a little bit of curiosity about what
happens as you open to allowing what's here. Sometimes they can take courage
to really allow and open to what's here. Can we meet our experience?
Sometimes we can simply settle back and receive what's happening.
Just being with ourselves curious about how we are and how it changes as we are
with ourselves. Sometimes that is enough. And sometimes if whatever is happening is
a little challenging to allow, it can be useful to choose some perhaps simpler
area of experience to attend to rather than trying to open to everything that's
here. Just using some simple area that feels easeful to connect with or at
least a little more easeful to connect with. That may be the breath, the
experience of breathing, or it may be some contact of the body against the
chair or cushion, or maybe the hands or feet touching the experience of hearing.
If for you it feels more easeful to just choose one experience and let the
attention land there, that's fine. Perhaps connecting with the breath or
hearing. And yet in doing that, allowing the attention to rest in that area, we
don't have to try to hold tightly to it. It can kind of feel like a tether to the
present moment. We can know the breath, perhaps, and also be aware that there's
other things happening around the breath. Other body sensations and the
breath, hearing and the breath, emotions and the breath, thoughts and the breath.
Perhaps you can just keep a simple connection to a simple experience and
allow other things to happen around that simple experience without trying to
push them away. Just opening to what's here in the moment. Perhaps focusing with
the breath, that other things can be in the background.
And if you lose touch with the present moment, if the mind wanders off into
thought, and we forget about the present moment, that will probably happen. At
some point though, you'll remember about the present moment again. Mindfulness
will return and there'll be the realization of that, often with the
recollection, oh, I've been lost. But what's happening now is that mindfulness
is back. And so what's here in this moment? Receiving yourself again, be
befriending yourself, interested in how you are in this moment. And if it's
useful, again, it may be useful to choose some particular area of experience to
settle the attention with. If that's useful for you, that's fine. And allow
that settling with that area of experience to happen in the middle of how
you are, not trying to change how you are in that connecting. Receiving
yourself in the present moment.
