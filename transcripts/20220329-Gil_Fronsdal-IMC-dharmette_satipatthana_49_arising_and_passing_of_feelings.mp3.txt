The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So this week we're doing the second exercises and exercise in the fourth
foundation for awareness. And the first, second, and third exercises, five total,
is the first three have to do with ways in which we select out of our
environment. Things to cling to, or react to, or get caught in. There's a vast sea
of sensations, perceptions, experiences, and any given moment. And the human being,
when we're born, slowly starts to make a process of selection to zero in and
take up what's important to emphasize or what's important to gather together and
construct into the different things that we experience. And we know that the
brain is a constructing apparatus, that it takes in sense data and it
reconstructs it into reality, into how we experience and know it. And mostly
there's a very good relationship between kind of a good enough relationship
with what we see and what the mind constructs so we can find our way in
the world. And, but it is a construction process and sometimes you can see it go
a little bit awry. You know, it happens probably a couple of times a year when I
go hiking on the trails and the mountains near here, that for a moment I
see a little stick or a little root of a tree that's half out of the ground
snaking along. And I think of the root or the stick, for a moment I think it's a
snake. And so my mind has kind of somehow constructed the snake out of it. Or
there's a particular tree that I go by where there's an early kind of side
growth on the trunk. And it looks like a cutest little dog, a dog head sticking
out. And I always see that dog and smile. And so it's no dog there, but my mind
somehow reconstructs it from the pieces. It looks like a dog. And so the mind
constructs and it's partly also a selection process. We select out of
our environment the things that we want to prioritize, things that are
important for us. As I like to say, many years ago I was looking for a futon
couch, futon bed couch. And so I started looking as I was driving around or
attentive to that. And back then, many years ago, I was surprised how many
futon shops there were. I had no idea. They just kept popping up. I was never
really paying attention to it, but now I was prioritizing that. It was on my mind
and I was noticing it. So we tend to notice the things that interest us. And I
go down the shopping store, you know, the supermarket aisles and a tremendous
amount of stuff that just a blur that I have no interest in. And I don't really
take in. I can't tell you later what I passed by. And I'm looking for things
that I particularly want. And so then, you know, when I know where I'm in the aisle
where it is, then I start looking and searching for it. And then, oh, there it
is. And so there's a selection process. So this is all very normal. But then the
selection process also then becomes places we cling to. And so for the areas
in which we cling to self or cling to our own experience or a sense of who we
are, the Buddha says that he emphasizes five areas that we prioritize or that
we preferentially pick up on or that we select or we project. We kind of, as a
part of the construction process, we give emphasis on this. And these are
the five heaps, the five groupings, the five divisions, the five ways in which we
group our experience into, you know, heaps of things. And then we might
prioritize these over others. And the Buddha sometimes called this a burden. He
also referred to it very explicitly as a construction, a constructing process of
the mind. The mind constructs the, to some degree, our experience of each of
these five domains, groupings. Then the first one is appearances. It's usually
translated into English as form and kind of the appearance of the body, the
physicality of the body, the way it appears to us. The second one, which is
today, is Vedana, the feeling tones of experience, whether they're pleasant,
unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant. And that was a whole
exercise, a big exercise near the beginning of this text. The second
foundation of mindfulness is on this as well. And then it was just to know
it, to know pleasant as pleasant, to know unpleasant as unpleasant. In the fifth
foundation, the instructions are to know the inconstancy of the experience, to
know that the pleasantness arise, that it's arising, it appears. If it
persists, it persists. But then as it passes away, the rising and passing of
these feeling tones. And as I said in the meditation, the analogy for this is a
peaceful lake, surface, and a gentle rain comes along and drops fall in the
lake and makes little ripples, little concentric waves that goes out, little
splashes. And those little splashes are there for a moment and then they're
gone. The after effect might be the ripples that could go out. And so these
sensations are like the splash. And then there might be a ripple through
us, the after effect of that. If the rain is falling hard, it might just
seem like it's a constant experience. But if we look very
carefully, we see that actually, in fact, it's still just a moment of splash. And
then another one, another one, just a lot of them are happening all around. So in
terms of the construction or selection process, some of us will prioritize
whether we're comfortable or uncomfortable. We navigate the world looking
for what's pleasant and what's unpleasant, avoiding the unpleasant, wanting the
pleasant. And that's kind of how we, you know, has give some priority to the
sensual world and sensuality and is comfort and being comforted by
experience. And so we don't care that much, maybe, how our appearances are, the
appearance of other people. We're just interested in whether it's physically
comfortable or pleasant. We don't care so much about, you know, our ideas, our
opinions, our stories of things. We just want to be comfortable and pleasant. And
of course, it's a matter of degree, but this is part of the grouping of our
experience that some people prioritize and select out of. And for the Buddha,
this is one of the areas of clinging. So these are the five groupings of clinging
and one of the groupings of clinging is clinging to the feeling tones of
experience. And the antidote to that is not to feel, is to avoid feeling, but
rather the antidote is to see that these sensations that were, that are the basis
for the construction, basis of the grouping and the clinging, they are
constantly arising and passing away, arising and passing away. It's not
necessarily easy to see that, but when we're now in the fourth foundation, so if
there's four foundations of mindfulness or a path, it implies that as we settle
down and get concentrated in focus and this mindfulness practice, at some point
we're settled enough that in the subtleness, we become the calm, we kind
of become the calm surface of the lake. It becomes obvious that these sensations
of pleasant and unpleasantness are appearing and disappearing. And then in
that seeing that, it's obvious that we are trying to hold on or cling to it. It's
fascinating to how clinging gets highlighted when things are coming and
going, appearing and disappearing. It's almost as if clinging is not quite
successful when things pass away. And in deep meditation, it's possible to feel
the mind go towards an object that I want that. And by the time the mind gets
there, in that fraction of a moment, the experience has gone away. There's a
pleasant experience of that's nice. I want that. By the time we get there with, you
know, it's gone because it arises and passes so quickly. And so in that
process, not only we begin to let go of clinging, but we're also beginning to
appreciate, hopefully, the mind's clarity to see that clearly, to see something
very simply in and of itself, to see pleasant, unpleasant, and neither unpleasant.
In such a simple way that it's not connected to stories, not connected to
the past and the future, not connected to the preferences we have, not
connected to our fears of where it's going, that there's a kind of clarity
and simplicity. It's just pleasant. It's just unpleasant. It's coming and going. It
appears and disappears. There's a rhythm to it. It pulses into
existence and pulses out. The awareness of it, the perception of it, the
perceiving of it is moving and shifting around a little bit. And one way or the
other, we begin loosening up the grip of clinging to it and selecting that out
of the wider field of experience that we have. And at some point that as we do
that, the attention becomes much more spacious, allowing, and more
choiceless or more available to whatever is happening without that
selection process operating. So it's great to learn not to cling so much. And this
is one of the ways that the Buddha is talking about. And the benefit of this
is that as we cling less, we can love more. As we cling less, we can have more
goodwill. Our hearts care for the world, can exist more. We care for ourselves
more. And that's kind of the reward or the benefit from learning how not to
cling. And for today, it's clinging to pleasant and unpleasant. So you might,
over these next 24 hours, see how much you prioritize or select out of your
environment and how important it is for you to kind of how you orient yourself
and how your choices you make, whether things are pleasant or
unpleasant. Is this a neutral thing, an interesting thing for you, or is this
particularly strong for you? And if you can see how important this
is, then can you also kind of see the ways in which pleasant and unpleasant come
and go through the day? And what shifts for you when you see it's coming and
going? And you realize, oh, this is the way it is for now, just for now. It'll pass.
So thank you. And I look forward to being here with you tomorrow.
