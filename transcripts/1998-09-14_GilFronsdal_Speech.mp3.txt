 Sex and right speech, or wrong speech. So I was inspired not so much to talk about sex, which I found myself curiously uninterested these days to give a Dharma talk on the subject. When I first started teaching, I actually gave a couple of teachings on sexuality in Buddhist practice. And I don't know why I'm not so interested anymore, maybe it's this mindful aging. So, but I thought I would talk a little bit about speech. And you know, ties in a little bit with the issues of Buddhist ethics. One of the things that happens as people practice mindfulness, and they become more attentive to their life, is that they become more aware of the number of choices we have. And actually, there's an infinite number of choices that we have moment by moment to be made. And as we become more conscious of the choices we have, the decisions we have to make, Buddhist ethics, the issue of Buddhist precepts ethics, the philosophical or the background for Buddhist ethics becomes important for helping to understand how to make decisions. Understanding how the mind works and the consequences of decisions and motivations on the mind help us in making decisions. And one of the ways to look at decision-making or ethics is whether a decision or whether an action we're going to take fosters separation or alienation from others or from ourselves. Or does our decisions and actions foster connectedness and understanding and with ourselves or with the people around us. And if we take that as the criteria, we kind of remove it. It doesn't necessarily have to be seen as moralistic then, you know, as a good or bad or right or wrong. But what is it that really fosters connectedness, intimacy or understanding? And what is it that fosters alienation and separation? And if we can see the difference between the two, then which do we choose? What do we prefer? And I believe that many of us, if we could actually see the choice between those two and really understood fully what the choice entailed, probably many of us would actually choose connectedness, understanding, intimacy over alienation and putting up walls or so forth. So speech is one of the powerful places where we can either create connectedness and understanding and many wonderful qualities of connectedness that come from it or speech can create separation or alienation very, very powerfully, almost more powerful than anything else. There's a Tibetan saying that I've heard, that Tibetan Buddha is saying that when you're sitting in meditation, you should watch your mind. But when you're going about your daily life, you should watch your mouth, watch your speech. And so what is about our speech? Now, Bill Clinton, you know, was known for being a great kind of, you know, kind of a great communication skills. He could really speak really well and clearly and was able to do all these kind of John F. Kennedy kind of choice phrasings. And he inspired many people when he spoke or he seemed to convey a lot of understanding and a lot of knowledge, a lot of authority that really helped him a lot in his office as president. And as the office of the presidency, I think for many people recognizes partly a symbolic office. And so we invested, much of the country invests it with symbolic authority that gets translated into real authority. And then he seemed to have used some of his ability to communicate very directly, to have seemingly to have lied quite directly. And I saw that speech back in January where he said, you know, I absolutely did not, no way Jose did I clearly did not do the thing. And, you know, it was a man who was speaking with great conviction. And I didn't know whether I could trust him, but I was impressed by the conviction. And, you know, this is, I thought it was really consequential if he wasn't being honest because of the way in which he was really standing by his word. Another little digression. It's interesting that the word for faith or confidence or trust in Chinese where they use pictograms for the language is the character for a person next to the character for to speak or words. So to stand by your words becomes faith or trust in Chinese. And this idea that, and we say that in English too sometimes, you know, stand by your words or, you know, one of the most important things you have back in the old America, back, you know, in the good old days, that one of the most important thing a person had was their good word and that people could believe them when they spoke. And people were proud and felt it was really important for the reputation or their position in society that people could really believe them. And the consequences of President Clinton's speech has been of his lying, seeming lying, whatever you want to call it. It's not exactly a lie. It's not exactly, you know, sex. Anyway, whatever it was, the consequence of that kind of speech, whether it's a lie or not, the consequence of that kind of speech has been alienation and sense of separation and pain, you know, across, probably you could argue across the globe. The consequences are global in scale. There's tremendous sense of pain and I suspect alienation, some degree of alienation, but certainly pain with the people he's close to, I suppose, his family. I don't know what his family is reacting, but the people he lied to in his cabinet and people around him and there's a whole slew of people that he was involved in or distantly involved in, Monica Lewinsky herself, where there's, I think, alienation is probably the kind of a nice kind of simple word to explain, the kind of distance and hurt and pain that comes from that kind of speech. And now the sense of alienation and sense of separation is being played out in politics also. And so now it's becoming, people are trying, saying publicly, they're trying not to make it political, but now this whole issue is now becoming taking a political direction and now there's alienation between those who are standing by the president, those who are not, and separation, and it just has more and more consequences the longer it takes. Very painful for many people. So regardless of whether it's right or wrong to lie in a moralistic sense, to be aware of the tremendous consequences of lying, I think, would discourage most people from lying, from wanting to lie. The risks that are taken in lying are so great that, I don't know if they're ever really worth it. Someone once said that you should tell the truth, because then you have less to remember. And we have an expression in English and then coming clean, isn't that coming clean about yourself kind of being honest and saying how things are. And we don't come clean, then there's increasing levels of deception or increasing attempts to try to lie, or increasing ways of trying to cover up and deceive. Lies lead to more lies. One of the more interesting things about lying that's set in the Buddhist tradition is that lying, it's something like this. If a person lies, then they're very likely to break the other precepts also. Or it's a little bit differently also, that the other precepts usually occur together with lying. So if you're not willing to lie, then you're probably much less likely willing to break the precepts, to abuse your sexuality, to steal, to harm or kill someone else, or various other things. And maybe it's because of this, that the Buddhist tradition honors the importance of truth, of saying the truth, so much that it's in the famous list of the Ten Perfections, which Yousil Ananda talked about, I think, here in July. Truth gets its own category. It's the only kind of more or less perceptual kind of... one of the precepts that kind of has its own paramee, its own perfection, the perfection of truth. The ability to really say clearly what the truth is, and to stand by the truth and not to lie, is considered not just to be a moral thing that's useful to do, but it's actually considered to be extremely powerful spiritual power or spiritual inspiration or spiritual support for a person engaged in spiritual life. And it's said in the Buddhist tradition that the Buddha, in his former lifetimes, practiced the perfection of truth for many, many lifetimes. And I don't know which of the paramees Yousil Ananda talked about when he was here. Did he talk about the paramee of truth? Does anybody remember? All of them? Okay, anyway. So the idea that you're actually... your cultivate-ability to be true is not something you do by default. It isn't something like you don't lie and that's it, you know, you get off clean then, or everything's okay because you're not lying. But actually to say the truth and cultivate the ability to speak the truth is actually developing a power or a potential we all have that serves a person very well in the kind of spiritual development that goes with the mindfulness practice, that goes with Buddhist practice, that is a foundation for liberation itself. It's impossible to make much progress, serious progress after a certain point doing mindfulness practice or doing Buddhist practice if a person continues to deceive others or deceive oneself. The sense of alienation or separation that happens with lying, I believe, is not just simply towards other people but it's also towards oneself. And I believe the more we lie and deceive others, we actually more become alienated from ourselves. That if we're really in touch with our essence, in a sense, the sense of peace or well-being or fundamental contentness which is in each of us, the more we're in touch with that sensitively, the less we'll feel capable of lying or breaking any of the precepts actually. And that to lie actually is to separate ourselves a little bit from that fundamental essence of wholeness that we have. And it creates a tremendous stress and strain on our psyche, our inner life, to do this tremendous strain. It's a strain and stress that people who are involved in deceit all the time are sometimes camouflaged from seeing because they don't see necessarily what's actually going on. But as the mindfulness practice makes us more sensitive, I think that the inner cost of deceit and what it does to ourselves becomes increasingly obvious. And for nothing else, it means you have to be very busy remembering your lies so that you keep them up, you don't let your guard down. But that's just a minor aspect of it. So certainly, so there are words which lie, words which are painful. The Buddha talked about four kinds of language that a practitioner should hopefully avoid. And the first one is lying. The second interestingly is harsh or malicious speech. Harsh speech and malicious speech. The third is speech which is backbiting, kind of gossiping, that creates separation between people because you tell bad things about people. And the fourth is, let me see, what did I say? So first is lying, malicious speech, which it might be true, but is painful, is harmful to people. You can use truth painfully. The third is gossiping, which may or may not be true, but its intention is to kind of create division. And the fourth is harsh speech, speech which might be true or whatever. And maybe something maliciously stated, but it's harsh. It's kind of you hear it, that it's not courteous. It's kind of, you wish you didn't hear that, it jars the mind or the heart in some way. And so to study our speech from these points of view, is our speech true? Is our speech malicious? Is our speech gossip or is it harsh? And what's very interesting to me in the Buddhist tradition is that the Buddhists say it's actually easiest to give up lying of those four. It's actually easier to stop lying than it is to give up malicious speech. And it's easier to give up malicious speech than it is to give up gossiping and harsh speech. So the harsh speech is the hardest to give up. And it's actually said someplace in Buddhagosha that harsh speech is only given up when a person becomes an arahat, when the person becomes fully enlightened. You can be partially enlightened and still have harsh speech. Whatever that is. And then there's the opposite of kind of wrong speech or divisive speech or speech which creates alienation. And there's good speech or kind speech or helpful speech, healing speech. And words can have a tremendously powerful effect on bringing out the good in other people. I've been the recipient of people who have been very generous in their speech towards me and how they've talked to me about me or spoken kindly to me or complimented me or whatever. And the result has been I felt increased confidence in myself or increased ease in myself or increased well-being or joy or happiness because of the way people spoke to me. And I certainly felt the opposite when people spoke negatively about me or judged me in some ways. It can affect my well-being, how people speak to me. And our speech in turn can affect other people quite dramatically. And it doesn't take much. Sometimes I've noticed myself that it might not occur to me to frame my speech in a way that expresses real kind words about something going on. And it's so easy to do that and so easy for me to maybe connect to it or think about it. But sometimes it doesn't occur to me. But like today it occurred to me. This is a maybe silly example. But my wife was putting up bookcases, bookshelves in the wall in our living room because otherwise if we don't have things way off the floor we won't have anything in the living room except for toys on the floor. So she was putting up these shelves and it was very nice that she was doing that. And when she was done she kind of came and got me to show me her handiwork. And I looked at it and first I just saw the shelves there. It was nice and nothing more occurred to me. It was nice. And then I noticed what kind of speech I was about to speak to her. And I said, oh, this is an opportunity. I'm not going to lie or kind of make it all sugary and all that. But here's an opportunity to show some appreciation for what she's done. Rather than just kind of nod and say it's a good job and move on. And without making a big deal out of it I was able to kind of just express great appreciation for what she'd done and for the work it took or the job she'd done or whatever in a way that it didn't take much. But in a way that I could feel made her feel a bit more joyful. It wasn't like I was trying to make her proud or anything. But it kind of uplifted her. It kind of made it kind of a joyful event to share that. There's a lot of things we can do in our life with speech around other people that can actually bring a lot of joy and happiness and all kinds of things to the people around us. And it's not, again, it's not sugary or false. But it's a very simple kind of kind words showing concern about someone. How are you? And really meaning it is a way of having kind speech. To express gratitude, to look for opportunities to express gratitude sincerely is an expression of kind speech. And it's good for the person and it's also very good for ourselves. To express appreciation can be very, very powerful. Kind speech, hopeful speech. These things are not, again, it's not so much in Buddhism that they're considered to be moralistic. But as our mindfulness makes us more sensitive to the opportunities that exist moment by moment, which are the forks? Which fork do we want to take? Do we want to take the fork of connectedness of understanding the other person or ourselves, of speaking from some deep essence within ourselves? Or do we want to take the fork of losing that opportunity of connectedness or even worse, or even worse, of creating actually divisions and alienation for ourselves and towards others? And the last thing, I guess, two last things I'll say. One is, I know that when I was in my early years of Buddhist practice, I wouldn't have been very interested in this kind of talk on right speech. I would have taken it as kind of moralistic and do's and don'ts kind of thing. But one of the things that, one kind of analogy I think is very, very useful to think about is, someone described to me recently, a very small decision today, very teeny, teeny decision today, that's like one degree, going in a different direction, but you simply one degree or half a degree. It doesn't make much difference today. But in 20 years, that one degree of difference has gone out and they've come hugely distant from each other. It's little decisions we make today, little changes of intentions today, build or detract from the kind of spiritual potential of liberation, of kindness, of compassion, of connectedness that we're all capable of. And people when they do mindfulness practice sometimes focus, sometimes too much I believe, on the present moment. That's what we keep saying after all, be in the present moment. But it's okay sometimes to reflect about that. We're also doing this not only for this benefits and liberation in the present moment, we're also doing this for the long term. We're also doing it for what's going to happen to us in 20 or 30 years. And very small degrees of difference. Now, in considerations and thinking and applications of these things, these principles can make a huge difference in the future. And with that, what I'd like to do is read, if you allow me, from Art Buchwald, the great sage of Washington DC. I was in New York the other day and rode with a friend in a taxi. When we got out, my friend said to the driver, thank you for the ride. You did a superb job of driving. The taxi driver was stunned for a second. Then he said, are you a wise guy or something? No, my dear man. And I'm not pulling, putting you on. I admire the way you keep cool and heavy traffic. Yeah. The driver said and drove off. What was all that? What was that all about? I asked. I am trying to bring love back to New York. He said, I believe it's the only thing that can save the city. How can one man save New York? It's not one person. I believe I have made the taxi driver's day. Suppose he has 20 fares. He's going to be nice to those 20 fares because someone was nice to him. Those faces in turn will be kinder to their employees or shopkeepers or waiters or even their own families. Eventually the goodwill will spread to at least a thousand people. Now that isn't bad, is it? But you're depending on that taxi driver to pass your goodwill to others. I'm not depending on it, my friend said. I'm aware that the system is in foolproof. So I might deal with 10 different people today. If out of 10, I can make three happy, then eventually I can indirectly influence the attitudes of 3000 more. It sounds good on paper, I admitted, but I am not sure it works in practice. Nothing is lost if it doesn't. It didn't take any of my time to tell that man he was doing a good job. He neither received a larger tip nor a smaller tip. If it fell on deaf ears, so what? Tomorrow there'll be another taxi driver whom I can try to make happy. You're some kind of nut. I said, that shows how cynical you have become. We were walking past the structure in the process of being built and past five workmen eating their lunch. My friend stopped. That's a magnificent job you men have done. It must be difficult and dangerous work. The five men eyed my friend suspiciously. When will it be finished? June, a man grunted. Ah, that is really impressive. You must all be very proud. We walked away. I said to him, I haven't seen anyone like you since the man of La Mancha. When those men digest my words, they will feel better for it. Somehow the city will benefit from their happiness. But you can't do this alone, I protested. You're just one person. The most important thing is not to get discouraged. Making people in the city become kind again is not an easy job. But if I can enlist other people in my campaign, hey, you just winked at that very plain looking woman. I said, yes, I know. He replied. And if she's a school teacher, her class will be in for a fantastic day. So maybe this half a degree difference not only will affect us greatly in 20 years, but maybe in a small way it can affect a thousand people today as it ripples out. Maybe. I remember someone, it's kind of a cliche now, but it was really impressive because it was a golden gate bridge with a toll of three dollars. The person had to be paid for the toll for me. And that affected me for hours afterwards. And I think the way I then interacted with people for the next hours was somehow informed by that generosity. Some total stranger would do that. So I don't think Art Buckwald is, I think he's onto something. So there's different kind of speech. And I think it's well worthwhile being very careful with how we speak. So any thoughts that you have? Yes. Yes. Bringing it back to Bill Clinton. It seems that of the core qualities of speech, you may have the hardest time with the one that's supposed to be the easiest to correct these lines. And he has made a brilliant career of people thinking he's not malignant and not harsh and not bad. So has he just sort of figured that out? He's a very smart man. He is. But you know, someone said recently, which, you know, well, maybe I won't repeat it. Practice what I teach. And yes. I was wondering at one point how we how to distinguish between lying in the general delusion that is part of our problem of pre-hatred and delusion. The delusion is a form of lying, really. I think that what we're lying has the most consequence is when it's intentional, an intentional deceit, whereas the illusion where we sometimes say mistruths, but we might think we're saying the truth, we're quite sincere in doing it. That has a very different consequence than when it's intentional. So that's one distinction to be made. So by the intention rather than results. Right. Buddhism tends to always want to look at, not always. Consequences are very important to take into account. But the first line of investigation often that's encouraged in Buddhist practice is to study your intention. And this is very interesting with speech because speech is always the expression of an inner intention. And the intention is some aspect of the heart or of the mind. So you see that speech then connects us back to some aspect of the mind or the heart or deeper aspects of who we are, our psyche. And then what parts of our psyche are speaking? What's going on in that psyche? What's the intention? Is the intention, and there's many intentions behind lying, there's the intention to deceive, but there's the intention to sometimes be alive because of ambition. Sometimes they lie because of fear or embarrassment. Sometimes they lie out of, what are some of the reasons people lie? There's many of them, but these intentions which are often not coming from the deepest place inside of us that we can know for ourselves. It's interesting that in Chinese again, I've been told or I read that the character that's used for the precept not to lie, the Chinese way of saying that is don't use ruthless speech. Don't use speech that doesn't have any roots. And the idea I suppose being that when you lie, it's not rooted in yourself. You're not rooted in the depth of who you really are. You're kind of speaking from your superficial self. But you want to ask more? Elaine? I wanted to mention how much I thought I was trying to be mindful of being kind in my own thoughts about myself. And that happened at your suggestion many years ago, such that I've been making such progress at it that it's getting closer and closer for me to be alright the way I am. And there's less of the motivation in coming to practice that I want to change me. And I think that's one of those things where it starts out teeny tiny at first, lots of no mindfulness, and it kind of gathers so that I'm, I can tell a little bit faster now than I'm being harsh to me about me. Beautiful. And I suspect that someone like you experiencing the same thing, where it's more okay to be yourself, would actually also find less reason to want to lie. Because I'm not speaking for you now, but I think when it's not okay to be oneself, when we're embarrassed about ourselves, or we don't feel good or adequate, or we don't want to make sure that people don't see who we really are, then there's all kinds of ways in which we lie about ourselves. We put out kind of the false image of who we are. But if we feel okay about being ourselves, then you know it's okay for other people to know who we are. Yes. Where does that attitude towards, you talked about not having harsh speech but not lying, but there is sometimes situations where you're asked a question where the answer is harsh. Like what? In talking to somebody about something where they don't really want to hear the answer you have, or you feel that they will be hurt by the answer you're going to get them. And I'm wondering there, there's a tendency to evade, at least I find myself evading, sort of saying something I think somebody doesn't want to hear. Oh, but that's not necessarily harsh, in a sense. The Buddhist harsh is kind of course language. You know, you tell someone, but you use half your words or square words as you say it to them. That's harsh. Yeah. But to speak the truth that is difficult for other people to hear, it often happens. And then there's some number of things we can evaluate. One is, what's the motivation for telling the person this piece of truth? Is it, are we doing it because we're concerned about the other person's welfare? Or can we do it in such a way that we're saying at least with some kind intent? And we know it's going to be hurtful. We know the other person is going to be hurt by hearing it, but they need to hear it and can at least kind of say it kindly. Another consideration is, is it really useful to say it? Because sometimes we can say something which is true, and in some sense maybe is an impainful to the other person to hear, but it's not going to do any good. And the Buddha actually suggested that if saying the truth in those kinds of circumstances is not going to do any good, don't bother, don't waste your energy. So you can do a number of things to consider. But yeah, sometimes we definitely have to say things to others that they don't necessarily want to hear. And sometimes you need to say it quite strong. Saying things very strongly also is not necessarily harshly. So sometimes I think sometimes some people need to hear something said very clearly, very succinctly, very directly, even with a strong voice to really get through to them. But I don't call that harsh either. Yes? Is it true? The Buddha said don't say anything unless what you have to say is it's true kind and necessary, and that it must meet all three. Yeah. True kind, I think maybe necessary is one of the translations. Useful is what I'm more familiar with. True kind, useful, and necessary seems a bit too exclusive, because when is it really necessary, and but useful? And actually there's actually four criteria. Is it true? Is it kind? Is it useful? And then is it conducive to social social concord? Does it bring people together rather than separate people, make division, divisiveness? Yeah. I think the last three, but I think that we're seeing a lot of harsh words, reading a lot of harsh words, and I think possibly worth that could not have been made public. So I feel that star and the committee are equally blamed. I'm certainly not defending the sentence. Do you agree? I don't want to sit here and agree where the blame should be. But one of the things that impressed me was when Clinton made his confession in mid-August, whatever it was, and kind of made his confession and did his pseudo apology. But you know, at some point he also, kind of the tone of the address changed, and so you heard it remember, and he started actually expressing a little more frustration and anger, and it was a little bit harsh then, what are some of the things he said about Kenneth Starr also at that point. Now, without passing judgment on that, the consequence of his tone changing in second half of his speech was actually quite consequential in the way that many people in America received that speech. And it was received a lot less favorably, because he switched to a harsher tone of language than the second half. So if Clinton had been softer, kinder, whatever, kept that tone, it would have been received more favorably. I'd like to tell a little story about how you never know the consequence of when you say something about what impact it will have. Some couple of years ago I was working just for a short period of time with a man in Texas, and I recently got an email from him, and during that conversation, and I don't even remember it, but during that conversation apparently I was quite open about the fact that I know there is a lesbian, and about how positively I feel about her, and the message from him said he thanked me for that because it had made it possible for him to accept his doorless choice of life partner and to love them both. And this was a very moving message to me, and it was not a consequential speech in terms of what took him to him that was just a matter of stating what is as it is. Something you just never know. You never know. Speaking the idea of a lot of the things that we've been talking about are thinking about the results or the consequences of our speech, which are very hard to judge. So it seems like a rather difficult thing to determine our speech. And yeah, of course, it's very hard. A lot of the discussion has to do about evaluating the consequences of your speech, but consequences are very hard to evaluate, and certainly that's true, but what's also true is that often there are also consequences in the present moment. I think that if someone is lying, there are consequences right then and there, if maybe not externally, internally. I think in order to lie, we have to be to some degree alienated from ourselves to do that. Last one. Your concept about half a degree having consequences 20 years later, I was able to trace my present behavior back to high school because of the very same concept through my process. I was questioning my being truthful. Now, and looking at that, I can see the pattern from high school 35 years ago, being under the pressure to look good, to get ready that there was a pattern started of being not necessarily telling the truth in order to look good or to get married. And then, again, I can see how pattern, like you said, widens and then further points and further further about. Yes. One last comment. I wanted to express my gratitude for your speech to people. I've touched me really deeply and I can feel it at best already. Thank you. You put it into practice. Didn't waste a moment there. Well, let me not waste a moment here to express my appreciation for all of you. Thank you. Thank you.
