 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. Greetings friends. Greetings from Northern California where I am, unceded, oloni land, where it's rainy and about to get light through the clouds. Greetings to you wherever in the world you are, dear Sangha. It's lovely to be with you in this moment in time. Lots of happiness of heart to see you on the chat, joining. Happy making. So we're going to continue our exploration today. We've been exploring the theme of life as improv. And today the theme we're going to explore is the theme of non-attachment to outcome. Non-attachment to outcome. A very Buddhist frame which also shows up in improv too. So as we explore it in our meditation, here is the invitation to consider. Often we think of non-attachment to outcome in our life as a teaching. But what if we actually bring it into the frame of our moment to moment experience, moment to moment training as we train ourselves in meditation. And sometimes it can be confusing for people when we talk about non-attachment to outcome when we're meditating. The question comes out, well do I just sit willy-nilly, let anything come up? No, not exactly. We have a particular perspective. We have a particular way, attitude, way, a bigger container. But in the small ways whatever arises, we have flexibility. We are not attached to, okay I want a deep state of concentration now and needs to happen. If it doesn't happen, if thoughts arise then we're destroyed and angry at ourselves, at circumstances. But there is flexibility of, oh okay this is what's arising right now. How can I skillfully work with this? What kind of a gift does this quote unquote distracting thought have in this moment to teach me something, to teach me, to train me, how to work with it? So non-attachment to outcome within a larger framework of our heart having an aspiration, having an aspiration, having an intention, but not attachment to moment to moment outcome, having flexibility within that. So the bigger container and the moment to moment. So with that, let's practice together, let's meditate together and I'll relate it. And then I'll look at this through the frame of improvising our life from that frame and relate and connect the two together, may it be of service. So let us arrive, let us arrive with the aspiration, with the intention of connecting. Connecting to ourselves, connecting to goodness, cultivating goodness, cultivating wise choices, wisdom, kindness in this moment, with the aspiration for service, for peace, for freedom, and for not suffering and not causing others suffering as much as possible. For ease, for gentleness and any personal aspirations you have in this moment in time for your life, please add them, bring them in. Let these intentions, aspirations imbue your heart, the space of our mind in this practice. Expectations not expectations, expectations can be tight. Within aspirations, there's a lot of room for gentleness and wisdom. Expectations are demanding and give rise to self-judgment. So let there be aspiration in every moment, connecting with the breath, with the body, giving whatever arises in this moment. Reconnecting with aspiration. Letting aspiration be nourishing, calming, enlivening. Let there be aspiration without a fixed attachment. In your heart, your mind be like water, flexible. Letting quake, Cl Belt. Letting finances meet in the near future. Finding other ways to be wise, sort of butting heads with challenges, but finding ways to be wise. Kind to yourself.
