Dharmette: What Am I Leaving Out?

One of the simplest definitions for mindfulness practice 
is paying attention to the present moment with a non -
reactive awareness, non-judgmental awareness. Pay 
attention and just notice what’s happening in the 
present moment. But this definition is a little too 
simplistic. Sometimes people focus only on what’s most 
compelling in the present moment , or focus only on their 
breath in th e present momen t. But it’s important  to be 
aware that the mind is a selection machine. The mind 
selects out of the environment what it wants to focus on, 
what it wants to pay attention to. This can be  really 
obvious. When I’m at home with my older son, he 
sometimes watches TV programs on the computer. 
When it’s time for dinner, I’ll call out his name [laughs]. I 
don’t know how much he’s absorbed in the TV show , or 
how much he’s choosing not to notice that I am calling 
out his name, but in that selection pro cess he’s focused 
on something else.     
 
The mind is always selecting out of the environment 
what it wants to focus on . Some people give priority to 
certain  things . So the fact that something is compelli ng 
in the moment has partly to do  with the choices  the mind is making . You might be sitting  in medita tion and 
your knee is hurting. The instruc tion is to pay attention 
to the  most predominant experience , so you bring your 
attention to the knee hurting,  innocently think ing, “ Well, 
that’s the stronge st experience in the moment .” But the 
reason  it’s predominant is because there’s fear around 
physical pain , or avers ion to pain . Pain has a lot of 
meaning, and so , at the first hint of pain , the mind will 
select that pain much more readily than it would se lect 
something pleasant or enjoyable .  
 
Someone else  may place  a lot of meanin g and value on 
something pleasant and enjoyable , and so their mind  
goes there and selects that out of the environment  more 
readily tha n the pain. Often a  selection process  is going 
on.        
 
In most human beings there seems to be a preference 
[laughs] for selecting suffering or a preference for 
selecting what is not working very well – not everyone, 
not all the time . An interesting question  for peop le who 
do mindfulness pract ice is to ask from time to time,  
“What am I leaving out? Wha t am I not noticing , given 
that t here’s always some selection process going on . I 
can’t be aware of everything that goes on in every 
moment . What important things have  I left out? ”  
 
Spend a little time periodically looking around , and 
asking , “What else is there here? If I don’t literally follow the instructions  about how I’m supposed to stay with the 
breath , or if I don’t just stay with the usual things I’m 
aware of, then what else i s going on here that maybe I 
haven’t noticed? ” 
 
Here is an example. I am really  focused  in meditation , 
spend ing a lot of time focusing on the  body , staying with 
the breath, experiencing  the breathing . After a while , if I 
feel I’ve been focusing  for a long time on the physical 
aspect of breathing , I’ll come ou t a little, step back out 
from that state , and ask myself if there  is some emotion 
or feeling tone or mental attitude  that I haven’t noticed 
because I’m so involved with the  breathing? I may find 
nothing particularly i nteresting, but  sometimes I’ll  notice 
that there is something  else that is useful to take into 
account.   
 
If I spend a lot of time focused  on my emotions , then 
after a while I might ask, “What’s going on in the body  
as I do thi s? What’s going on in the mind? ” 
 
I may spend a lot of time focusing on hearing sounds . I 
don’t know what that drilling was. Hearing  drilling , and 
just being focused  on the drilling , involved with just 
hearing the sound of the drilling , I am not noticing my  
aversion to the drilling . So, you step back and ask , 
“What else is going on  here?”  
 
The questi on of what else is going on is sometimes a useful question . You don’t  want to be neurotically 
pursuing all the things you can’t possibly know; but just 
from time to time ask i f there is anything else that you 
haven’t included.  What are you leaving out  of the 
experience? What is left out can be a little more  
evaluative. I mean that sometimes what is left  out is 
what is working well, what’s going well . Since some 
people have a very stron g tende ncy to choose what’s 
not working well, what the problems are . So sometimes  
it’s useful to come out of that and ask what is going well. 
What blessings are here? What wonderful is happening 
now?  Something wonderful is always happening. Can  
you look around and see what is benefi cial, what is 
good? What is the goodness here in this experience 
right now?  
 
It could be as simple as the fact that you’re  breathing 
relatively easily [laughs]. P eople have trouble breathing , 
and right now you’re  breathing relativel y easily. Y ou 
might be in a funk being here at IMC , dealing with yo ur 
life issues and problems , or kind of depressed  and 
upset . But you’re in a pretty safe environment . You can 
sit with a group twenty people or so . And you ca n sit 
with your eyes closed, not worried  about anybody  
asking you anything , or pouncing  on you , or stealing 
your wallet . These are all basically good people who like 
to meditate . It’s pretty wonderful to be with a group of 
people like th is. Can you p ull yourself out of your funk 
and see that  there is something good going on ?  
Then, if you spend all your time focused  on what’s 
great , occasionally it’s good to ask what else you are 
leaving out? M aybe it’s not all great . Maybe th ere is 
some suffering. Maybe you’re carrying some tension or  
stress , or maybe there are some challenges go ing on. 
Occasionally  you find people who overemphasize the 
positive , with blinders on.  
 
The goal  is eventually to be able to be balanced, to take 
it all in in an easy , uninhibited way , so that w e are 
informed by the full spectrum of what’s happening in the 
present moment , both what’s going well and what’s not 
going well , equal ly. In taking in the full spectrum, we can 
begin  to have some equanimity about it, some peace, 
some ability to hold it all.  
 
I’ll end this talk by encouraging you all to look around 
from time to time and see what else is going on that you 
haven’t noticed , that you haven’t paid enough attention 
to. Then, with a little particular emphasis , look around  
from time to time and see what is going well . See how 
that is for you .
