 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.Adiodarma.org. Good day everyone. Nice to be here, nice to be back at IMC. It was nice to be at IRC yesterday. I hope you enjoyed it. We're back at Satipatthana. This awareness practice of Satipatthana, foundations for awareness, for mindfulness, begins with a foundation in your posture. Then it goes into breathing. As we settle into the breathing, the instructions are breathing in, experiencing the whole body. Breathing out, experiencing the whole body. Last Friday I talked about doing it for the whole length of the inhale, whole length of the inhale. That's one interpretation of this. The whole body is the whole body through time of the experience of breathing. It's a real continuity through time, just staying with the breath. Another interpretation is that it actually involves experiencing the body as a whole. One way to do that is to, it's a little bit of having, using both central vision and peripheral vision at the same time. Whereas the central eye, you can have your central vision focused on something and have some sense of what's around it through the peripheral vision. So the same thing with attention to the breathing. There's a focus on the breathing and that's a central focus. Then the peripheral is just open and aware to the rest of the body. That's a very interesting dynamic to have both kinds of attention operating. It takes a little bit more engagement so that there's less space in the mind to wander off in thought. The variation that I like of that is that, especially it works well I think if you feel your breathing and your body in your torso, is find the place in your torso where the first sensations of breathing arise. Or maybe it's in a place where you're centered most if you're aware mostly of the breathing in the belly. It would be there, just there. And then from that place, feel the expansion that happens, the expansion of the torso. The rib cage expands, the belly expands perhaps, and the shoulders maybe lift slightly. Maybe the back rib cage is also expanded outwards. The space between the ribs opens up a little bit. So this expansion, but feel it almost like a wave of expansion that goes out through the whole torso, the whole body that you easily experience. And even you can imagine that it kind of spreads out beyond the body. And then in the exhale it all comes back. And there's this rhythm of expanding and contracting with the breath where somehow it feels like the breath kind of moving all the places in the body that the movement of breath touches. You're kind of opening to all of it in the inhale and then opening or kind of allowing yourself to ride the return at the exhale. And this kind of rhythm of going out and in broadly through the whole body, the whole body that you easily experience with each breath. And what's interesting to do, one of the very interesting things can happen this way. One of them is if you're feeling some strong emotions or moods, like you feel anxiety or fear or sadness or happiness and enthusiasm or something, prioritize that rhythm of expansion and contraction as if it goes through your mood, your emotional state, but untroubled by it. Don't get involved in your emotion. Don't try to fix it or try to judge it. Just like matter of fact, you're just kind of walking through the weather of the day and your weather's not bothering you and you just keep walking. You just kind of move through the sensations in your body, connected to how you're feeling the emotions. And you just kind of massage it, you walk through it without any concern about what it means or what you have to do or anything. Just kind of allowing it to be there, just moving that rhythm through it. Same thing with sometimes the certain levels of discomfort and pain. Same thing, just kind of feel it as the expansion comes and then feel it as you go through it with the returning of the exhale. So breathing in, expanding the tension to feel the whole breath body, the whole experience in the body, and then breathing and then on the return. Follow that through the body as well. So hopefully this is understandable. So taking a posture for meditation and gently closing your eyes. And to begin the rhythm, you could do it intentionally and largely by taking some deep inhales and conscious long exhales. And with bigger inhales, maybe it's easier to feel all the places in the body that move and expand as you breathe in. And you might even at the top of the inhale, hold your breath for just a fraction of a moment, just long enough that you can feel the pull, the draw, the desire to exhale. And then ride the exhale through your body. Feel the return, the contracting, the pulling in all the way back to the place where there's no more sensations of breathing out. Breathing in deeply, exhaling fully. And then letting the breathing return to normal. But continue with that rhythm. And now it's not as dramatic, but it's still as you breathe in. Feel, it's almost like you're riding the expansion, riding the movement of filling throughout the torso. Sometimes I think of it as being a bird that's soaring and it catches the updraft on the inhale. And then it glides through the air on the down, back to the ground on the exhale. And since we're still beginning here, on the exhale you might also, for next three or four exhales, relax whatever is being held or tight in your body. Whatever is easy to relax. Partly what you're experiencing is the impact, the influence that breathing has on the body. Allow yourself to be influenced by the breath. Allow yourself to expand as you breathe in and to feel the sensations of your body. Allow yourself to release on the exhale and to feel all the sensations of your body that come into play as you exhale. Allow yourself to relax. Where the focus is on that rhythm of movement through your body. Let that be the center so that you're not centered in your thinking, reacting, in preferences. Also you're not centered in your emotions, but you're not ignoring them either. If there's a mood or emotion, feel it in your body and let that rhythm stay with the rhythm. Let the rhythm move through the physical sensations of how you feel. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Let the waves wash up on the sandy shore over and over again without any concern with the sand or the weather or anything. Just keep washing up and down. See if you can ride the breathing, feeling your whole body as you breathe in, whole body as you breathe out in that rhythm of expansion and contraction, as if it's forever, untroubled by anything that it moves through, any way it feels. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. Allow yourself to relax. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, if you're feeling the inhale as an expansion through the body, imagine that your care continues as you expand out. Across the land, out across the world. As if your heart can be open and expansive and touch all the places, all the suffering in this world. And as you exhale, you return deeply inside yourself to touch the place where you care, where your compassion, your love resides, your tenderness. Imagine that rhythm of breathing in and breathing out, expanding as you breathe in, expanding outwards to the whole world. Look as the inhale coming back, the sensations return, touching your place of care, friendliness, kindness, back and forth. And may this meditation we've done together serve for our ability to care for this world, to care for our friends, our family, our neighbors, our strangers, to care for the whole world. So that maybe in some ways known and unknown, intentional or unintentionally, we live for the welfare and happiness of all. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Amen.
