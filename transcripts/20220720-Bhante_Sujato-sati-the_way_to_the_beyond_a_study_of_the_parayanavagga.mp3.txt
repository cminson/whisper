 The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org. Thank you so very much and thanks to everyone at the Sati Center for organizing this and thanks to all of you for coming along. I am speaking to you today from Harris Park, which is near Parramatta in Western Sydney. And this is the traditional owners of this land, the Barramadigal people of the Darug Nation. And as is conventional in Australia, we always pay respects to the traditional owners of the land, past, present and emerging, and acknowledge their unseeded custodianship of this land. So we are going to start a series of four sessions on the Parayana Wagga of the Suttani Pata. I know some of you were hoping to start last week and I had to cancel because of ill health, so sorry to everybody who was inconvenienced because of that. But anyway, we are hoping to, we will be putting an extra session on at the end, so we'll have it, still have the four sessions. Good to see so many friends joining us. Esther, Mike, Susan, and many new friends as well. Ram, Sharoshia, Julie, Star, so good to see you all. And I'm really looking forward to spending a little bit of time talking about the suttas. Now we know that we're living in all of these very difficult times. In Australia, we have, of course, the COVID pandemic like everywhere, and we have also floods have been affecting our country for many months now. So that's like a kind of a two pale horseman stage of the apocalypse that we're at now. And I'm sure that different places around the world are enjoying different sort of phases of the end times. But meanwhile, we still have the dhamma. And one thing that the dhamma does promise us is that there is a way to the beyond, that there is an escape, a way out of all of this. I know that most of you will have some experience and knowledge with the suttas, but some of you may not also. So I'm just going to begin by giving a little bit of a brief background and introduction to the suttas. And what we're doing here, the teacher that we know as the Buddha was one of the many wandering ransi teachers in India about two and a half thousand years ago. And he lived and taught in Northern India, India today, the region of the Ganges Valley. He taught for 45 years and accumulated a large community. And when he passed away, his community got together and organized the recitation of his teachings to preserve his message. And they passed those scriptures down and they've come down to us in various forms today. And the scripture we'll be reading from today is from the Pali Canon, which was passed down in Sri Lanka. And the the Buddha scriptures are conventionally divided into three portions. We call the topitika or three baskets, the suttas, vinnya and abhidhamma, suttas being the main discourses of the Guddha taught, the vinnya being the monastic coat and the abhidhamma being the scholastic treaties. So this comes from the suttas or from the discourses. Within the discourses we have five nikayas or five sections. And this is from the last of those known as the kuddhika nikaya or minor section. And it's within the kuddhika nikaya from a book called the suttas nipata. And within the suttas nipata is from a chapter called the parayana waga. So this is where it sits. Now I'm saying a lot of words in Pali. If you don't know Pali, don't worry about it. I will try to avoid using too much Pali for this session. But if there is anything that I say that you don't understand, please tell me, because if you don't tell me, I don't know. Okay. So please help me out because I just in case you want to, I can't read all of your minds. Okay. And Zoom can't read your minds yet either. I may give us a few years and we'll be able to do that, but not quite. So if I'm talking and the things that I talk about that you don't understand or it doesn't make sense, then please do just pop your questions into the chat and I will keep my eye on that and hopefully be able to answer any questions. Now in the chat, I did put the link for the first chapter of the Suttani Patra that will be off of a section of the parayana waga, which we'll be reading first. All right. Now a little bit of an introduction, general introduction to this text before I start reading. Now the Suttani Patra is a compilation of five chapters, which is unique to the Theravada school of Buddhism. Many of the parts of the Suttani Patra are found in other schools of Buddhism, but the collection as a whole is only found in the Theravada canon. And the same is true for the parayana waga. We do have various parallels and so on, but it's mostly preserved in the Theravada tradition, Pali tradition. And certainly that's the version I'll be reading from. However, the parayana waga is referred to a number of times throughout the Buddhist traditions, both inside the Pali and also in the Chinese and Sanskrit traditions. So even within the other suttas, it refers to verses, quotes from verses in the parayana waga, and it even calls it the parayana waga. So that shows that it was quite an early collection that already existed when the other suttas were being compiled. Having said which, the parayana waga, as we have it today, is a composite. It's not all just from one session, but it consists of the heart of it is the 16 questions of Sola Sapanha. And they, too, those 16 questions have been added an introduction and an ending. And so they create a narrative which sort of wrap up and give context for those 16 questions and give those questions meaning. And I'm going to be talking quite a bit today about the narrative context of the parayana waga, about how meaning is created through the way that the narrative is shaped. Let's when I'm when I'm teaching suttas and I'm talking about suttas, I try and I try to get to the actual sutta as quickly as possible. So we can read through the sutta and then discuss it rather than giving too much information up front. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just share my screen and then we can read through the first portion of the parayana waga. Okay. And let me see, it's going to work. Adhan, may I ask a question? Yes, please. I come from a little bit of a Sanskrit background. Anytime that parayana is set up, it comes with a composition and possibly a meter associated with that as well. Yes. Is that the case here? There is a way of chanting in addition to the essence of the meeting in this particular suttas? Well, the yes, there's certainly a metrical suttas and the verses in Pali, the meters in Pali are essentially similar or closely related to the same metrical styles that you find in Sanskrit. There's no fixed way of reciting, so the different traditions will recite it all with their different styles. Of course, the meter in Pali is very strongly determined by the length of the syllables, but apart from that, the chanting style will vary. I appreciate that. Thank you. Yeah. All right. So this is my translation from the Watu Gattar, the introductory verses. From the fair city of the Kossilans to the southern region came a Brahman expert in hymns aspiring to nothingness. In the domain of Asaka, close by Alaka, he lived on the bank of the Godavari River, getting by on gleanings and fruit. He was supported by a prosperous village nearby. With the revenue earned from there, he performed a great sacrifice. When he completed the great sacrifice, he returned to his hermitage once more upon his return. Another Brahman arrived, footsore and thirsty with grotty teeth and dusty head. He approached the other and asked for 500 coins. When Babari saw him, he invited him to sit down and asked of his happiness and wellbeing and said the following, whatever I had available to give, I have already distributed. Believe me, Brahman, I don't have 500 coins. If good sir, you do not give me what I ask, then on the seventh day, let your head explode in seven. After performing a ritual, that charlatan uttered his dreadful curse. When he heard these words, Babari became distressed. Not eating, he grew emaciated, stricken by the dart of sorrow. In such a state of mind, he could not enjoy absorption. Jahanen ramati mano. Seeing him anxious and distraught, a goddess wishing to help approached Babari and said the following, that charlatan understands nothing about the head. He only wants money. When it comes to heads or head splitting, he has no knowledge at all. Madam surely you must know, please answer my question. Let me hear what you say about heads and head splitting. I too do not know that. I have no knowledge in that matter. When it comes to heads or head splitting, it is the victors who have vision. Then in all this vast territory, who exactly does know about heads and head splitting, please tell me goddess. From the city of Kapilavatu, the world leader has gone forth. He is a skion of King Okaka, a Sakhyan and a beacon. For he Brahman is the awakened one. He has gone beyond all things. He is attained to all knowledge and power. He is the seer into all things. He has attained the end of all deeds. He is freed with the ending of attachments. That Buddha, the blessed one in the world, the seer teaches Dhamma. Go to him and ask. He will answer you. When he heard the word Buddha, Bhavari was elated. His sorrow faded and he was filled to brimming with joy. Uplifted, elated and inspired, Bhavari questioned that goddess. But in what village or town or in what land is the protector of the world where we may go and pay respects to the awakened one, best of men. Near Savati, the home of the coastlands, is the victor abounding in wisdom, vast in intelligence. That Sakhyan is indefatigable, free of defilements, a bull among men. He understands head splitting. Therefore, he addressed his pupils. Brahman who had mastered the hymns. Come students, I shall speak. Listen to what I say. Today has arisen in the world, one whose appearance in the world is hard to find again. He is renowned as the awakened one. Quickly, go to Savati to see the best of men. Brahman, how exactly are we to know the Buddha when we see him? We don't know. Please tell us so we can recognize him. The marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. 32 have been described complete and in order. One upon whose body is found these marks of a great man has two possible destinies. There is no third. If he stays at home, having conquered this land without rod or sword, he shall govern by principle. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes an awakened one, a perfected one with veil drawn back, supreme. Ask him about my birth, clan and marks, my hymns and my students, and further about heads and head splitting. But do so only in your mind. If he is the Buddha of unobstructed vision, he will answer with his voice the questions in your mind. 16 Brahman pupils heard what Bhavari said. Ajita, Tisameteya, Purnika and Metugu, Dhotika and Upasiva, Nanda and then Hemika, both Todaya and Kapa and Japukarni the astute. Badravudaya and the Brahman posala, Mugharaja the intelligent and Pingya the great hermit. Each of them had their own following. They were renowned the whole world over. Those wise one meditators who love absorption were redolent with the potential of their past deeds. Having bowed to Bhavari and circled him to his right, they set out for the north with their dreadlocks and hides. First to Patana of Alaka and then on to the city of Mahisati, to Ujini and Gurnadha and Vedaisa and Vanasa, then to Kosambi and Saketa and the Supreme City of Savatthi. On they went to Setabhya and Kapilavatu and the homestead of Kusinara. To Paava they went and Bhoghanagarra and on to Vasili and the Magadan city. Finally they reached the Pasanaka shrine, fair and delightful. Like a thirsty person to cool water, like a merchant to great profit, like a heat-struck person to shade, they quickly climbed the mountain. At that time the Buddha at the fore of the mendicant Sangha was teaching the mendicants the Dhamma like a lion roaring in the jungle. Adhita saw the Buddha like the sun shining with a hundred rays, like the moon on the fifteenth day when it has come into its fullness. Then he saw his body complete in all features. Thrilled he stood to one side and asked this question in his mind. Speak about the Brahman's birth of his clan and his own marks. What hymns is he proficient in and how many he teaches? His age is a hundred and twenty, said the Buddha. By clan he is a Bhavari. There are three marks on his body. He is a master of the three Vedas, the teachings on the marks, the testaments, the vocabulary and the rituals. He teaches five hundred and has reached proficiency in his own teaching. A supreme person, cutter of craving, please reveal in detail Bhavari's marks. Let us doubt no longer. He can cover his face with his tongue. There is a tuft of air between his eyebrows. His private parts are concealed in a foreskin. Know them as this, young man. Hearing the answers without having heard any questions, all the people, inspired with joined hands wondered who is it that asked a question with their mind? Was it a god or Brahma or Indra, Suj Jha's husband? To whom does the Buddha reply? Bhavari asks about heads and head splitting. May the Buddha please answer and so Ohumut dispel our dark. No ignorance as the head and knowledge as the head splitter. When joined with faith, mindfulness and immersion and enthusiasm and energy. At that the Brahman student, full of inspiration, arranged his antelope skin cloak over one shoulder and fell with his feet to the Buddha's with what fell with his head to the Buddha's feet. Good sir, the Brahman Bhavari, together with his pupils, elated and happy, bows to your feet. And to the Sia, may the Brahman Bhavari be happy together with his pupils and may you too be happy. May you live long, young man. To Bhavari and you all, I grant the opportunity to clear up the old doubt. Please ask whatever you want. Young Kinchi Manasichata. Granted the opportunity by the Buddha, they sat down with joint palms. Ajita asked the realized one, the first question right there. All right, so this is the first, the opening introduction for the 16 questions. Now those of you who have read the Purana Bhagma already will know that the tone and the manner of this introductory portion is quite different to what we find in the 16 questions, and it is universally agreed by scholars that this was a much later addition. And how much later? Well, I'll do a little bit of his text historical analysis here just so we've got a context. But I don't want to spend too much time on this, because I think there are more important things to say about it. But just very briefly, if you look at the journey that was undertaken there, and I'm just sure I've got this beforehand. But I'll see if I can find a map for you. But the journey that was undertaken starts from places that were a long way from where the Buddha normally lived. This is the first sign that it's later. Buddhism spread in the years following the following his, the Buddha's passing away. And we know some of the details about the way that that has spread. Specifically, we know details from the Akshokan inscriptions and from various other texts that date from the time of King Ashoka, about 150 or 200 years after the Buddha. And those texts include some of the same names that we find mentioned here. So this is one very good indication as to the lateness of this particular session. Now, I'm just going to do another screen share. And we're going to have a look at a map. We got the map. Yes. Yes, we got the map. We good. Yep. Thank you. So this is around here is where we started out. This is this is this is many of these are approximate, but this is about where Barbary's Hermitage is. OK, so we can see this is quite far south up here, Benares. And this is Rajagaha and and Savatthi. So this is where the Buddha normally was. He went a bit further, went a bit further east, a bit further west. But normally he was around this area. And so they traveled past Mahisati, Wijeni, Vedisa, Vanasa, Kosambi and so on. They took a detour. So they'd obviously heard that the Buddha was going to be at Savatthi. That's where he spent most of his time. So they sort of took a detour up to Savatthi. And then they're like, oh, no, he's actually down here. He came back down. This is almost this part of the journey. The last part is almost a reverse of the Buddha's journey in the Maha Parni Banasutta, where he traveled north from Rajagaha. So down through these places and ended up in Rajagaha in the hills there where the Buddha was teaching. Now this region down here is called the Dakanapata. And in fact, Dakanapata means the southern road or the southern trade route. And so this was because you can see here, this is quite hilly. It's the area often known as the Dakan today. So this is quite hilly and rugged. So the trade route went down to the southwest where it joined up with the sea trading routes here where there would be trade from about 100 years after the Buddha. There was then trade with the Greeks and then the Romans. And then the southern route then continues down to the east where it reaches Andhra Pradesh and then from there to Sri Lanka. And in fact, this is likely the route that Mahinda and later Sangamita took on their way to Sri Lanka. So we can see that this is considerably outside of the region normally that the Buddha went into and all of these place names that we encounter in that first part of that journey are not found anywhere else in the suttas. So this is one of the reasons for understanding that this is a later text, but there are many other reasons for this as well. It includes various doctrinal ideas that we don't find in other early Buddhist texts. One of those most obvious ones being the idea of wasana. So in those verses we heard that Bhavari was still redolent with the potential of past deeds. This is a concept of vasana, which became very, it was introduced in the very latest books in the Pali Canon, Melinda Panha, Neti Pekarana, and became a very, very common idea in later forms of Buddhism, but we don't find it in the suttas at all. So the idea here is that when we're born in this life, that our character, our spiritual potential is informed by the karma that we've done in our past lives. All right. Now, of course, in the suttas talks about karma and rebirth and so on all the time. And it says that we experienced the different results of it. So it's not as if this is a radically new idea, but this terminology and the way that it's talked about, we don't really find that in the early suttas. And there are a number of other terms like this. Quite a lot of the idioms we find here are Sanskritic in form, some of the narrative devices echo things we find in Sanskrit epic poetry and so on. So we can't really date this introductory portion earlier than about the second century BC, which puts it about two or 300 years after the Buddha. And it makes it one of the latest portions of the Pali canon. So now that if you're interested in the historical analysis of all I just said, there's a great article by the Sri Lankan scholar Jaya Wickrama. He did what is called a critical study of the suttani parta. It was published in the early 70s, but you can still find it on the Internet Archive if you want to go have a deep dive into a lot of the details that I've been talking about there. So we know this is a late text. OK, that's fine. But what does that tell us? What kind of thing are we dealing here? Why is this text there and why is it like the way that it is? These are to me much more interesting questions. So we don't when we do textual study and especially text historical study, I found sometimes that there's a tendency for people to say, well, this is a late text, therefore I can ignore it. OK, sure, you can ignore it if you want to, but that means you're not learning anything from it. And the different kinds and different strata of texts each tell us something slightly different about the time and the place and about the way that the people in those places were responding to the dhamma. I'm going to return to this idea in just a minute. But first, I'm just going to put this introductory text in the context of this chapter as a whole. I'm going to trace, if you like, a narrative arc. So we have our starting point. Think about how this starting point went. We begin with Barvery introduced to him. He seems like a nice guy, right? He's just given away all of his money. He's trying to do what he can to help people. He's sincere. He's earnest. And then this bad guy comes along with this unscrupulous Brahman who wants to rip him off for all of this money and then threatens him with a curse. So we have a dramatic tension. OK, right. Any good narrative, you have to start with some kind of tension. There's a threat. His head is going to explode in seven pieces. And obviously, in the context of the narrative, he takes that very seriously. Now, it seems kind of a bit goofy to us. OK, we might think, well, you know, someone's going to come along and lay a curse on you. Sure, sure, Matt. Yeah, whatever. And we're not going to take it very seriously. But for most people over most time, these things are very serious and they weren't messing around. And when people make these kinds of curses, then it was felt to be very kind of powerful. Now, he can't solve this problem. I'm going to go into more of these details a bit later on. So he can't solve the problem. He can't deal with that himself. He gets help. Oh, this Devata comes to him. Nice, right. It's nice if you can get your own personal God to come to help you out with your problems. OK, nice. And then his students also helping. So this is one of the things that's giving us here is about the importance of community, the importance of spiritual friendship. All right. They go to see the Buddha. Then they ask all of the questions. Now the questions when we get to those in the next weeks, they have a much more serious tone, much more. We don't find that kind of mind reading stuff and the marks and all of those kinds of things. It's much more straight, dumber questions about meditation and living your best life and so on. It's elevating the discourse. And then when we come to the final chapters again, we find that the discourse is even elevated still. It becomes almost quite transcendent by the end. And I think that this is a deliberate choice by the composer of the chapter. And I know that some commentators have to tend to be a bit dismissive of the introductory or late and it's a bit goofy with the curses and things like that. But to my mind, that's the point, the purpose of the narrative is to meet people where they are, to talk to people in terms that they would understand with a popular narrative and then gradually to lift them up to a place of transcendence. And I think that this whole narrative was very, very carefully designed specifically to do that. It reminds me, in fact, of the monument at Borobudu. And I don't know if anybody here has had the chance to visit Borobudu on Java. Has anyone been to Borobudu? If you can, you should go. It's really amazing, really stunning. And what they do in Borobudu is something like this, that you have these different layers and you're supposed to walk around the layers. And each layer has panels in the side that tell stories. And in the bottom layer, it's all like Jadaka stories, like folk tales and morality fables and things like that. And then as you go up, it tells the life of the Buddha. And then as you go up, it starts expressing more abstract and profound philosophical ideas. So actually, your journey of walking around is taking you on that whole spiritual journey, which is encapsulated in the artwork there. And I think this story is doing something, the Purana Wagyu is doing something similar. It's starting out with a popular level narrative and then gradually it's building you up to a more transcendent finish. Which again, begs the question, why? Why is it doing this? Why set something so far away? Actually that whole introduction, we're not going to take that literally from a historical point of view, but why is that there? Then it seems to me that this is a conversion narrative. This was a narrative that was designed precisely because it was about introducing Buddhism to those far away lands. And so typically what happens when Buddhism spreads to new countries, especially after the time of Ashoka, that you would develop a mythology that would make some connection of your place with the Dhamma, which would backdate your connection with the place to the time of the Buddha. So usually either the Buddha himself visited that place or maybe one of the Buddhist disciples visited it or something like that. So in some way, you're making that connection. And so I think this is an early example of a conversion narrative, which I think makes the whole spectrum of it actually really gives it another layer of interest. Now when we think of it as a conversion narrative, right? Then it starts to make sense because the cursors and these kinds of things, you see, in much of the world still today, like holy men, like monks, or wandering Brahmins and things like that, they're not necessarily, I mean, they're a bit scary, right? Because you can do stuff, mysterious stuff, and you've got to keep on the right side of people. Otherwise, you never quite know what's going to happen to you. And people will always kind of project things onto you. So if you arrive in some places a bhikkhu, people will always project things onto you depending on what they are conditioned by. So when, for example, I arrived in New York and I'm traveling on the train on New York, and people see me, they'd go, ah, avatar. That's what they think of. Avatar. The comic, anime, something, anyway, whatever. And so they're like, oh, I'm going to be doing kung fu or something like that. I'm like, yeah, no, sorry. I don't know kung fu. So it's a similar kind of thing. So this is this, this genre of literature would reach people where they are at. And it's part, so part of that message is about showing them actually, you know, you don't have to be scared because, you know, the Buddhist, Buddhist monastics are not going to be like that. We're not going to be making curses and all of these kinds of things. So this is just giving us an initial perspective to try to understand that kind of narrative arc of the Piranha Wagga as a whole and why it begins such a profound series of questions with an apparently slightly popular or a bit weird introduction. So I'm just going to check the chat, see if we've got any questions. So thanks. Julian has given us a link to Jaya Wickram's article. So if you, if you, yeah, like I said, it's a, it's a pretty deep dive and he goes into a lot more than just the Piranha Wagga, but it's really excellent because he gives a lot of the resources, compares with a lot of the Sanskrit texts. For example, one of the things that I just learned this morning that he talked about is in the, I think it's about Hayena, Griha Sutra, one of the Sanskrit sutras or Sanskrit law books. It says that if Brahman visits the Dakyanapata, then they have to do purification when they return. So the Dakyanapata was so far away that it was considered not part of the Aryavata or the sacred lands. So that's, this is again, this idea that we're heading into unknown territory. All right. Let me come back to the sutra itself and go in a little bit more detail in the introduction text. Okay. And please do pop any questions into the chat as I go and I will get to them as I go. And I'll just make a few comments along the way. So from the fair city of the coast, which of course is Savatthi to the Southern region, Dakyanapatang, actually I probably should change that translation Dakyanapatang. It literally means the Southern road. It's a trade route. Kemabrahman expert in hymns, the mantaparagu, the hymns of course being the Vedas, aspiring to nothingness. And now the word for nothingness here is I think playing double duty. Normally in this kind of context it would mean simply owning nothing, possessing nothing. Right? So just, you know, leaving everything behind and just going and living a simple life. But we also find that a number of the questions revolve around the meditation attainment of the dimension of nothingness, the akhincanya yatana. And so perhaps what it means, you could also read that as saying that he went there to practice meditation so that he could realize the dimension of nothingness. And that was of course the meditation attainment, which was taught by Allāh Akalāmā, one of the Buddha's former teachers. So we know that he lived getting by on gleanings and fruit. Yeah. So he's living a very humble life. So he's living a life. See this is throughout the suttas, the Buddha and the Buddhist texts depict a, like a true Brahman as being living a life of simplicity and renunciation, which is not unlike the lifestyle of the Buddhist mendicants. Typically they argued or the suttas argued that modern Brahmins had fallen away from that state and that they were falling into corruption. But here is painting an idealized picture of somebody who's living in accordance with the ancient, the true Brahmanical ideals. So he performed a sacrifice. We're not told what the sacrifice was. Of course, there are many different forms of sacrifice. Hopefully he wasn't doing animal sacrifice. I don't know. But anyway, I hope not. Anyway, so another Brahman arrives, traveling Brahman. This one obviously not, not very reputable, Pankadanto, Rajasiro, grotty teeth and dusky hair asked for 500 coins. That's a lot, I think. Seems like a lot. So we're not getting what he wants. He then threatened him with splitting his head in seven pieces. This threat is kind of a standard threat and did actually happen in one of the Upanishads where somebody got this threat and that actually happened and they had exploded in seven pieces. So no idle threat is all I'm saying. Now in a way, like what this is setting up is because this is a kind of classic, it's a classic kind of Buddhist way of revaluing and reinterpreting ideas from a Brahmanical tradition. So in this context, clearly it means like a physical curse that's going to explode your head into seven pieces. But when it gets to the Buddha, of course, he reinterprets it and says, well, this is ignorance. And so we're going to, ignorance is the head because the beginning of dependent origination. So we're going to get rid of ignorance instead. So this is a typical way that the Buddha would reinterpret these things. So Bhavari became very distressed and emaciated because of this. And this, you know, this is not an unrealistic description. And in many cases that have been recorded where people who get these kinds of curses of black magic and so on. And it has very, causes very real psychological distress. And to my mother, actually, she's living in Malaysia, living in Ipoh. And long story short, but there was one of the people around the place started doing black magic to scare the maid. Like mum, don't he found this stuff out much later. So mum, in my mum's house, she was staying there. They had a maid who was looking after the place. She was a, and she, she was just a, you know, an educated woman. And so someone from the local area started doing all this, like what they call a bomo, started doing all this black magic, leaving these things around the place and icons and these kinds of things specifically to try and scare the maid. Why was he doing that? So that he could coerce her into giving her the key to the place and then steal stuff from the house, which they then did. So this is where it all came out in the court case. Anyway, so a goddess wishing to help approach Babri and said the following. So we don't know who this particular goddess was. Babri was in this extreme of distress at that time. Maybe it's not unheard of that people might have some kind of breakdown, some kind of hallucination, maybe he was hallucinating this goddess, possible. Maybe she was a local deity. So when Babri has moved in there, you know, he's, he's a representative of what would have been a foreign religion at that time. And so this is in a way showing perhaps that the local deities were on their side. So she tries to console him. But she also admits that she doesn't know about heads and head splitting. Again, a standard part in the Buddhist rhetoric when it comes to relating to other kinds of religions, especially theistic religions and so on. The Buddha wasn't interested in trying to deny the existence of gods and so on from other realms. But he just said that, well, they don't really know what's up. They don't really know the answers to the problems that matter. So again, this is a standard Buddhist rhetorical device. It is the victors who have vision, interesting choice of terminology. The victor is more commonly used as an epithet for Nigatana to put up, who was the founder or the leader of the Jane community. Jane's the word Jane, meaning the followers of the victor. But Gina is also used more generally and is used for the Buddha as well. So this deity knows about the Buddha, the world leader, Loka Nayaka, a scion of King Okaka. Interesting that she introduces this idea of lineage here. King Okaka is the legendary founder of the solar dynasty of kings in ancient India. His Sanskrit name is the Ixvaku and the Ixvaku dynasty. There's sort of two major royal dynasties, the lineage of the sun and the lineage of the moon. And the Buddha is said, the Buddha's family is said to be descended from King Okaka and the lineage of the sun. Then the deva offers these verses of homage or praise of the Buddha. And so it's bringing in this devotional aspect. And as we'll see, this also is something which is revisited at the end. And I think this is something that's, you know, clearly this is being deliberately introduced, right? This is a conversion narrative. And so the Buddha is being hyped up, the Buddha is being praised, is being exalted, is being lifted up. And I think it's really important to acknowledge the emotional content and the emotional perspective of these texts. These are not dry scriptures, and they're not just about some intellectual answer to a particular problem or something. It's about an act of commitment. His sorrow fave and he was filled to brimming with joy. So the deva recommends he go to Savatthi, then he addresses his pupils. We haven't heard about the pupils before, the Sisa, the Brahmins who have mastered the hymns. That means they've memorized the Vedas. And he encourages his students to go to see them because he is now too old. Did he actually say that? Anyway. How do we know him? And then they introduce the topic of the marks of the great man, the Mahapurisa Purisa Lakhana. Now the 32 marks of the great man is a bit of a controversial topic. I won't go into it too much detail, but it's mentioned a number of times through the suttas. And there's a list of 32 physical features, which according to the suttas were passed down in Brahmanical scriptures as a sign of somebody who would be enlightened or would follow one of two destinies, as it says here, either they become a universal monarch or they become enlightened Buddha. One of the curious things about this doctrine of the marks is that we don't really find it in Brahmanical scriptures that have passed down to us. So perhaps it's been lost or perhaps it was just something that was invented by the Buddhist. We're not really sure. In any case, so they are using this as a sign to test whether the Buddha really is the Buddha according to their system. And we find a similar thing in, for example, the Brahmayu suttas in the Majjhima Nikayam. But a unique detail here is this idea of just asking questions in the mind. I don't think we find that anywhere else in the suttas, right? Especially, especially not used as a deliberate strategy like this, right? Yeah, quite an interesting kind of little detail. I mean, I know as a monk that a lot of people sometimes assume that you can read people's minds. And so they'll be sitting there and then you might say something completely innocuous. And then they'll be like, oh, I must be reading my minds. Because I'll say something like, oh, you know, if you get attached to things, it'll cause suffering. And they'll say, oh, really, you must be reading my mind because I could attach to something and it caused me suffering. And so it's definitely this kind of propensity to imagine these kinds of things are happening. So it's an interesting kind of rhetorical device that's being used here. Now next we have the list of the 16 Brahmins. Most of them we only find here or in the later books. We don't find them in the rest of the suttas. But we will hear from each of those later on. It sort of tries to hype up each of the Brahmin students saying that they've all got their own followings. Maybe wise ones, meditators who love absorption. Jhayi, jhana, rata, dihira. So in the questions, the 16 questions, we don't really get a sense that they were necessarily famous teachers in that way. But that second part, yes, that's definitely true. Many of them ask questions about meditation. Okay, so then they go up on their journey. Would have taken a while, many weeks, perhaps a few months. This is an interesting, this is a little detail here that it would be easy to overlook, but that in fact is also quite significant, like the merchant to great profit. So dakiya napata on a trade route. And so this is kind of acknowledging the significance of those trade routes. Buddhism in fact spread along trade routes all across Asia. Then they asked about barberry Buddha in his mind, the Buddha answers 120 years old. Everybody's wondering how can be be asking these things. So I won't go too much into all of these details. This particular passage is an interesting one. The particular qualities that are mentioned here for first main emphasis is on knowledge or wisdom and then faith, mindfulness, immersion or samadhi and enthusiasm and energy. So these are more or less the same as the five faculties and the five faculties, faith, energy, mindfulness, samadhi and wisdom. And the five faculties of course taught commonly in Buddhism, but also interestingly that they were taught by a Lara Kalama as well as by Udda Karama puta. So they're taught by the Buddha's early Brahman teachers. So this sort of adds to the idea that perhaps a barberry was from a lineage or tradition that was related to that of a Lara Kalama, whether he's one of his students or at least from a school that had an affinity. Then Aditya bows to the Buddha and the Buddha gives us very nice little blessing to him. Sukito bhavari hoati sahasi sehe hibrahmano taunche sukito hoati tirangivahi manava. Again it seems it's kind of innocuous, but it's a little bit different from what we normally find in the suttas. And in the suttas the Buddha will engage in a kind of polite conversation, how are you, have your journey been well, how are you traveling and so on. But that particular idiom of saying may you be happy sukito, which is, we're so used to seeing that these days is such a common part of Buddhism, but this might be the actual one of the first cases where we actually see this in the texts. Then the Buddha grants the opportunity to ask whatever you want, yankinchi manasichitta. And then this leads on to Bhavari asking his first question. Okay. So this is the introductory portion to the Parayana waga. Like I said, the Parayana, this is quite different from the rest of it, has quite different tone. And it's really just setting up that the context that we're going to be reading later. Now even though, obviously this is an earlier portion, obviously, I'm not going to, I don't think any scholar would really take it too literally as a historical document of what actually happened. I mean, it seems likely given that the 16 questions were early, then it seems likely that there must have been some background story to it. So something happened, which probably wasn't that much unlike what we've just heard, right? These things are normally are not just made up out of nothing. They're usually told and retold as legends, which then get elaborated into a final form. And to me, like I said, this whole narrative, as we go on, try to bear this narrative context in mind, and is one of those places where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Okay. Kator is asking about where I'm going to send the list or outline of the suttas covered each week. I won't be, but what I, we're going to be going through the Parayana Wagga. So it'll be basically be the next few suttas. So 16 questions, so you can do the math. So I'll try to get through about half a dozen of those each week. It's probably a bit ambitious. I might not do any of them, but if you want to do preliminary reading, I would say do at least the next half a dozen sets of questions. They're mostly pretty short. So yeah, it doesn't take too long. Okay. Julian asks a question. How's it going Julian? Julian was curious about the name Bhavari. Does it have a meaning? I could only find the Sanskrit Bhava, Bhavari, Bhavari, an enemy of worldly existence, says the internet related. No. So this is Bhavari with a B not Bhavari with a BH. Okay. Different letters. So Bhavari is yes, the enemy of world existence. Bhavari doesn't seem like it's related. I mean, words can change in all kinds of funny ways, but unlikely. I'm not exactly an expert on this. I know that one proposal was that Bhavari was related to Babylon and that he was a Babylonian, which also could be connected with his location because you remember where he was down in the Southwest near the ocean, which was where the trade routes with Babylon were established. So it's a fairly tenuous argument, probably not viable, but apart from that, I'm not really sure if we have any meaning for the name Bhavari as such. Oh, one thing I should mention actually that I was going to say earlier about the name Parayanavagga. So Parayanavagga, the name of the chapter as a whole is also a very nice meaning. The meaning is the way to the beyond. So literally, Para is the other, the other, self and other here, ordinary word. And Para with a long A is what they call a taditha or secondary derivation, which means the place that is other in this case, and usually used of the far shore. So far shore is the place that is other and the Ayana is the going. You may be familiar from the Ayana from the Saripatana Sutta. Saripatana Sutta has the Ekayana, which is going to one, going to oneness. And so here we have the Parayana, same construction, but here the Para going to the far shore. Very beautiful and very evocative name. Okay, so Kottokot mentions that these 16 questions are in the Thai monk education level, Maktama Ek. Okay, so in the first Dhamma education level. So many monks will be familiar with them. Oh, that's interesting. I remember when I was in Thailand, I read a translation, an English translation of the 16 questions by I think one of the Thai, I can't remember one of the Thai, anyway, senior patriarchs or someone, one of the famous Thai monks. And it was a bit unusual because it's not, you don't find many English translations of suttas in Thailand. So, but that's nice to know that those questions are part of a regular thing. And Kottokot, have you done the Naktama Ek? I might get an answer from him. Yes, okay. How was it? Sorry, getting a bit off topic here. It's a bit difficult. Yeah, it was fun. Good. Well, anyway, I'm glad to see you keeping it up. Good. So we're heading towards an hour already. Seems like no time. Does anyone have any final questions before we break up for today? I'll just mention. Please. Simple little thing. I just enjoyed hearing you recite place names and the personal names with what seemed like a correct accent. It sort of took me back to that time more than almost anything else has done. That's all. Ah, thank you. Thank you. That's really nice. I do try to get the pronunciation correct. So thank you for noticing. True. If anybody is interested in Pali and wants to learn it and so on, then Pali pronunciation is pretty easy to get right. And we know it's pretty well defined and relatively straightforward. But yeah, a little bit of effort and then you can do it. Okay, Rob, I think we should maybe wrap up about now. What do you reckon?
