 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello and welcome everyone to this rendition, this edition of Oh Happy Hour. So for today's happy hour, it's interesting because I was sitting earlier and thinking about what to share. For today's practice, different thoughts came up and then so I prepared a little dharmette on a different topic, which I'll present another day and then something else happened. What happened was just before I opened the room, I was sitting in meditation, I became really, really aware of my own mortality. That time is very, very short. And as many of you know, mindfulness of mortality, befriending mortality is a topic that I practice a lot and teach a lot. So guess what? When one practices this a lot, it shows up in moments on its own very important ways. So with respect to Metta, then the question that came up was, how do I want to show up? How do I want to be? And the feeling was so strong just before you came on that I decided, no, I feel like this is the topic that I'm called to present tonight. This is the same. It feels like this is what's moving through. And often my invocation, my intention, prayer is let the Dharma move through me. Whatever needs to be presented in this moment, let that come through. It's not so much about so much about me in the middle, but whatever needs to come through. And so this is the topic that wants to come through tonight, especially it might be relevant, I realize, because as we are entering yet a new phase of the coronavirus and the Delta variant and the various shutdowns around the world and challenging and not just with so many cases, so many caseloads increasing and life feeling really precarious, our lives and others lives. That's one aspect to really have this contemplation. Love in the time of Corona. Giving a nod to this famous book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Love in the Time of Cholera, Love in the Time of Corona. Love, how do we love? How do we love when really, whether we are vaccinated or not or whether we have some underlying health conditions for us and our loved ones, that life seems precarious. And without having fear about it, in a sense of life is always precarious, right? It's always precarious. Anything can happen at any moment. It really can. Anything can happen at any moment, especially feels more juicy, perhaps more prominent. And also another way that this reflection can be quite supportive is for many of us, perhaps life is feeling, not for everyone, but for many, it might feel like the movie Groundhog's Day, that we're at home again and again. Every day is the same shape or form. Maybe we have some Zoom meetings, we sit in the same chair, eat the same food, same. It is Groundhog's Day. I definitely do feel that, especially with the air having been particularly air quality, having been bad from the smokes and fires here. So being at home, not going out indoors. And yet, and yet with that sense of Groundhog's Day, gosh, this life is going to end. It is not infinite. It might feel like, again, okay, same, same, same. But anything can happen at any moment. It's going to shift, it's going to change. Unbeknownst to that, without any planning, who knows? So, but one thing that we know is that we have limited time. We know we have limited time. We live as if we're going to live forever. We go through our Groundhog's Day, day as if it's going to last forever. This show, this show are called our life, but it doesn't. So, so how do we want to show up for ourselves, for others in the midst of what's happening with all the issues, all the relationships we're having in our lives with that knowledge, with that stark realization that time is short, it's limited, it's going to come to an end. How do we love? How do we love? How do we love? How do we let go? How do we love? So, with that, as the introduction, let's begin our practice together, dear Sangha. I invite you to settle, to rest, to arrive in your seat, in this body, in this mortal body, mortal frame, which is alive for this period, for this limited period of time. Connecting with each breath, as if it were or last. With ease, with ease, with the freshness of spring, in breath bringing life, out breath, in the air, in the air, in the air. With ease, with ease, in the air. With ease, with ease, in the air. And if thoughts arise, it's okay, it's alright, be kind to your mind. It's used to thinking, that's what it likes to do. As if you've noticed a young child wandering off, come on, come sweetie, it's okay, come back. From the breath to the body, dear mind, settle, rest, take refuge. And the freedom that impermanence provides. Just connecting with this moment, with this fleeting, evanescent moment in time. This breath, this in breath, come and gone, this out breath, come and gone. And you're hanging on. And you're hanging on. And you're hanging on. And you're hanging on. And you're hanging on. Just this breath, just this in breath. Noticing aliveness, the in breath. And at the out breath, leaning into relaxing, letting go. Embodied. Embodied. And if this were, if this were this moment in time right now, and be known to you, if this were your last days, last week, last month, feel free to choose a timeframe that doesn't bring to much anxiety, but brings a sense of limitedness of time. Time is short. It's not guaranteed to run forever. Definitely not. How would you want to show up? First of all, how would you want to show up? For the people with whom you're close. You knew this was, let's say your last month. Choose one person. So, as to not to get overwhelmed. Choose one person in your life who's dear to you, an easy person. Let's start with the easy category. Someone who's easy. Where your relationship isn't complicated, to meta kindness flows with ease. It could be a child, could be a pet. And how would your kindness, your love, how would it express itself, your goodwill towards this being? I'm still wishing, knowing that time is short. Can you allow your meta, your goodwill, your kindness to flow to this being, to this person? This place of generosity, knowing time is short. No matter truly how much time you have left with each other, it is still short. You have a month left or not right now, there will be a time when you only have a month left with each other. And you would only have known that in the rear of your mirror. You're trying it on for size now, this practice, this experiment of goodwill, cultivating kindness, goodwill, feeling into your goodwill, kindness, for this being important in your life, from this perspective of time being short. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome to bring other being or beings who are near and dear to you. Easy category if you wish, or just stay with this one, but spend some time with each one. Not jumping too quickly from one to the next, which can unsettle the mind. The true phrases that come up for me in this practice. From the perspective of time being short, unreliable. Life's impermanence with respect to dear beings. Two phrases that come up with the in breath and out breath for me are, Thank you. Thank you. I love you. Thank you. I love you. See what comes up for you. It's an expression of metta from this perspective. Or you can borrow mine. Thank you. Thank you. Invite into your mind's eye. Maybe someone with you, with whom you have a bit of a complicated relationship, just a little bit, not the most complicated one yet, but just a tiny bit. And if it feels okay, inviting them to your mind's eye. From this perspective of time is short, time is very short. You have no idea how short it might be. What might come up in the way of things being let go of on their own, netta rising but well, for both of your humanities, the way you've been entangled. It gets complicated. It's okay. Let it go. If you're not, if the mind, the heart isn't ready for this. Come back on easy being. If not, then stay. You're in a slightly challenging category. Time is short. Time is short. Time is always running out. Time is short. Time is short. All of us, all of us, earthlings. The Dhammapada, the Buddhists, all of us. All of us earthlings, we must die. Those who realize, for those who realize this truth, quarrels end. Those who realize, they emphasize, really realize this truth of common humanity that we all must die. All quarrels end. You're in a slightly challenging category. Now I'd like to invite you to turn your gaze upon yourself. This being who is you, as if you were gazing upon a beloved other who has limited time. But this truth, realizing this truth, how does your relationship shift? How would you treat this being who is you? This earthling, who has limited time? This earthling being yourself, how do you want to show up? How do you want to be? The stories, the stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves. Some of them not be needed or get loosened, the ones that are not helpful, not productive. Do we get cold as back from living our limited time according to our values? Do we get freed from entanglements of our heart that are not helpful, entanglements? Time is limited. Do we really want to spend time with ill will? Do we really want to spend time with lack of generosity of the heart? How do we want to show up for ourselves and others? How do we know? If you knew your time was limited, which it is, how would you want your heart to love, to shine upon yourself and others? How do we know? How do we know? How do we know? Loving and living our days as if it were last, because one day it will be. And for the final fleeting moments of this practice period together, letting go. Of however this practice period was, letting go. No need for judgment, but to just love and appreciate yourself. Thank you for showing up just the way you could, just the way you did, doing your best. Thank you. I love you. Thank you all for joining for this practice. I felt like I wanted to sit longer, but had already been 30 minutes. Such a rich reflection practice to bring in mindfulness of our mortality, together with the practice of metta, of love, cultivating love, loving kindness. And a profound practice, which I vow to bring to do more often here at happy hour. Yes, I see thumbs up for that. So, we have time, we have time for reflections, for comments, for questions, for complaints, for whatever you like to share, dear Sangha. The gems of your insights, your humanity, the gifts you offer to one another by sharing of yourselves. Welcome to type your reflections and chat. You're welcome to raise your hand, please. Love to hear from you. Bring your voices in. One reflection coming in. That was truly great. Thank you. You are welcome. You're most welcome. Yeah. My, my Christine says the reminder we are only here for a short time, brought up panic and anxiety. Yes, that can happen as a part of mindfulness of mortality practice. Also, it can definitely happen. So the invitation I have for this is to titrate is to titrate go into it a little bit, then come back out into mindfulness of body mindfulness of, of breath to calm yourself and then let it in a little bit, a little more, because that way, your capacity for it will get expanded. But that's a very good point. And one can work with it, one can, we can absolutely bring it in and and support it in this practice and work with it. Our says thank you so much for this. I recognize that even when I don't know I'm striving, I'm striving. Beautiful. And our says I missed the intro but this practice helps me get out of a negative mind state. Meta is such a beautiful way to leave this world. Yes, absolutely. Another reflection this one sent to me only so I read the reflection, not the name, that's our common practice here. Thank you, that was very powerful tears came to me. Thank you. And mercy Christine says thanks thank you Mark Christine for raising that very important. And says, sharing a Carl Sagan quote, it's a long one I'll read it the world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with petty stories for which there is little good evidence, far better it seems to me, in our ability is to look death in the eye, and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides beautiful. Thank you now. Yes. Exactly. Exactly. My lean says thank you for this it helps not to feel alone with this awareness of mortality. Yes, we're not alone. One more reflection, my dear 80 year old mother in law was present with me. My cancer has metastasized that she continues to live in joy and service, a great teacher. Beautiful. Oh, inspiring. Thank you for sharing that. Another reflection sadness came up. I thought was if my life ended next month I should probably be kinder and more generous to myself than I am being right now. How I'm living right now is not how I would like to treat myself if my time we're very limited. Fantastic. That is whole some sadness. That is whole some sadness. When you realize that your when you really recognize and connect with your true values intentions and you realize the, the, the little misalignment when you realize there's a misalignment problem which many of us have. Beautiful. I am so delighted to hear that this came up, of course, because our time is always limited and wonderful to remember that to be kinder and more generous to yourself to ourselves. Jerry says focusing on the brevity of our lives. And of the time, as species made me appreciate the gift of my life. And of all. Yeah. Yes. What do I mean by misalignment says Marie Christine misalignment. So this idea of what our values are, and how we actually act and spend our time is called the misalignment problem. So what the person reflecting was oh I want to be kinder more generous to myself but I realize I'm not. So that is the misalignment, or if you realize that you really wanted to serve the world but let's say you're in a career that's not really serving at all. So, oh, misalignment between the way you're spending your life and your values of misalignment problem. You to Patricia says sense of urgency came up in waves for me very profound indeed. I found that mindfulness of the breath was very supportive. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. And the sense of urgency is very common with this practice of mindfulness and mortality, it's actually with respect to practice is called some Vega, some Vega, as a m v v e, g, a some Vega, there might be an h and there somewhere with the transliteration from poly to English but the idea of spiritual urgency or sense of spiritual urgency comes up with this practice, which different ways of you are talking about in different ways. And more reflection. My daughter is my role model, she died five years ago. While fighting her cancer, she lived her life more fully became involved in a new spiritual tradition and got married. So beautiful. Oh, thank you for sharing beautiful beautiful life of this beautiful being your child. Thank you all. Thank you for sharing your goodness and beauty. This limited flash of time that we have, like, stars in the sky we're crossing each other, we're crossing. So, yeah, one last reflection before we go into groups, hearing your words at the beginning describing the groundhog's day since many of us are having coupled with the current seeming more immediacy of death was initially confronting, but as I went into the practice, I went peace and love for myself and others. Over the weekend I was very following the wallop of the second shingles vaccine. Oh, I had the experience of feeling super L, not even wanting to speak with friends on the phone. I had at the same time knowing it was only my body building immunity. Being that sick took me to an unexpectedly happy place without much to be anxious about, as I often am when I'm physically well and thinking about the world, life, and my own little problems. Yes. Yes, thank you Deborah profound practice practice when we are ill is profound practice it simplifies so many things, let go of because we don't have the energy the usual energy to get tangled fact I think some weeks ago I did this practice, maybe months ago, practicing as if you are ill practicing as if you are ill. So that's an audio Dharma. So dear ones we have come to the time when we hold each other these mortal beings that we are. We meet each other in small groups and connect with each other and support each other. So, let us join each other in small groups with starting with 15 seconds of of meta. As always, met talk or Karuna compassion for ourselves for each other and then share as little or as much as you like with each other about this practice. So, the rooms are created. I will open them now. Here we go. Take care of yourselves, take care of each other. Okay. Now, welcome back everyone rooms are closed. And, by the way, sorry. I think the couple of rooms there was someone join late. So sorry Jerry I move you around by mistake, you got to meet more people, that's the gift. You got to talk with more people. So welcome back everyone we have just a minute, any reflections, if any of you would like to raise your hand or share anything. Briefly, the floors up and so many rich reflections before we went into groups. Yes. Going once going twice. Fred please. Oops, there. Oops. Oh my god. Okay, I just, this time I accidentally muted you. Okay. Okay, there. Okay. Well, all I was going to say was it that it's, it's very touching to be with one another. As we're contemplating or at the word the edge of thinking about our own deaths and the deaths of people we love. And it, even in the small group for very few moments that I could feel it bringing us close in this really lovely way. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you friend. And thank you to every single one of you for showing up and practicing this way. Yeah, Jerry says, Joy of being alive with being able to be able to be of service with bits of kindness, joy of being alive with being able to be of service with bits of kindness, indeed, indeed. So, so let's bring this practice to a close so thank you all. Thank you for showing up for practicing for cultivating your heart and kindness and goodness. Thank you for your practice may all beings be free. May all beings. Be well, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Take good care of yourselves.
