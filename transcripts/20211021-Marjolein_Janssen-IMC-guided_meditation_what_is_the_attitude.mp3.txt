 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So you can start with tuning into the body. See if you sit comfortably, comfortable, but still alert. And if you feel into the body right now, are there any places for you, hold any tension? So you can gently, kindly attend to those places. Just hold those places in kind of tension, maybe one by one. If you're holding some tension in your shoulders or your forehead, maybe it's a different place for you. Sometimes just this kind, gentle attention helps to ease the tension a little bit. We don't need much more than just this attention. Sometimes an invitation might be helpful. Maybe this body part, relax. The whole body, relax. Relax the body like this, kind of influence on the mind as well. Helps to settle the mind just a little bit. Notice it like in the mind right now. I switch to the mind. Maybe there are many thoughts. Maybe you had a busy day at work. Maybe it's relatively calm and peaceful. Maybe there's some emotion or feeling. Whatever is most obvious right now, you can just be simply aware. In one area you could pay some special attention to the attitude with which you're receiving the objects. Attitude can be, for example, wanting. Wanting something to be different, wanting something to come into your experience, wanting something to go away. You could also feel like a version, wanting something to go away, which is a second attitude that we can have. Trying to push things away, not wanting. Often when we experience something, maybe sensation in the body, maybe an emotion, and then we start to either push it away or grasp it, try to grasp it. That's kind of like an extra layer on top of what's happening, that we can be aware of. It's like the lens we look through, like glasses we put on our face, to look at our experience and color our experience. When the pushing away, when the grasping is present, we can simply be aware of that. We don't have to push those away. They are welcome too. Sometimes it's just okay. Whatever we experience, we just feel okay with whatever is happening. So you can just enjoy this contentment, it's okayness. During the meditation you can keep a light touch of wondering if any of these lenses are present. If you look through the lens of aversion or desire, the pushing away or the grasping, just be curious how it influences your experience. There's no right or wrong, it's just the way it is. Whatever arises is just nature. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
