The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we go. Great. So hello everyone. Hello and welcome to Happy Hour. And
delighted to feel your presence, whatever your time zone. It's the present
moment. Yay, we're sharing this present moment, this illusion of time in
together. How great is that? So for the theme of this evening, I want to talk
about or invite us to practice with kindness, kindness towards ourselves,
compassion towards ourselves, with impermanence, befriending impermanence.
Sometimes impermanence is on our side. When, say, in the short term, there's
something that troubles us, maybe something that, you know, you had a
meeting that didn't go well or something that just, you know, you've got a
parking ticket, again, the short term, the short term, like, ah, there's an
ouch. But if you take the long term view, the longer term horizon with
impermanence, changing all the time in nature of our lives, changing all the
time in the big picture, this thing that perhaps happened today or last week or
the past month is in the big picture is it shifts and changes. It's not, we can
have a larger perspective. So even though, of course, holding this with
compassion, but it is impermanent. So there's some reflections having to do
with that. So bringing impermanence, long, long term view and kindness,
compassion and equanimity. So, well, we'll practice together and see what
arises. Sounds like a lot, a tall order, but, you know, we'll just take our time
together and explore our hearts and see what is supportive. So, okay, with
that, let's begin together. Let's begin. Let's settle into our seat. We need to
shift and move into a comfortable position. And arriving in this body in
this moment in time. Letting the breath be received in the abdomen, letting
the breath be breathed. Breath, the entirety of the breath, pause, the
entirety of the breath and the pause. Taking some time to befriend the in
breath, the pauses and the out breath in your own time, letting them extend a
little bit, slowing down.
And we have thoughts are arising, still thinking about what happened
before. We're planning for the next thing. It's okay. It's all right. Oh, sweet
dear heart. Let's put down, let's put it all down and just be here and give our
heart fully to this, just to this, right here. This breath, this breath, let it be
felt received in its fullness, like a cherry blossom in the spring. Fresh, fall,
impermanently, glorious, this breath.
This breath, this breath, this breath, let it be felt in its fullness, like a
cherry blossom in the spring. This breath, this breath, this breath, let it be felt
in its fullness, like a cherry blossom in the spring.
This breath, this breath, let it be felt in its fullness, like a cherry blossom in
its fullness, like a cherry blossom in the spring. And now as we continue to be
embodied to feel the breath in the body and the abdomen, receiving the breath in
breath, the out breath, it's impermanent, glorious breath, like a cherry blossom in
the spring. Let us turn, let us open our hearts to appreciating,
appreciating ourselves. We're doing our best, doing our best, showing up in every
moment in this life as best as we're able to. We appreciate that we are doing
our best, doing all the causes and conditions. Many, most of them, most of
them out of our control. So little within our sphere of influence. Doing our best
within that sphere, doing our best within the causes and conditions.
Letting it be, not trying to pick fights with ourselves or judging ourselves,
self-judgment, trusting. Trusting that if things could have been different or
could be different, they would have been. Given everything that came before, so
many factors and forces. And resting with this, not thinking about it, but resting
with it, letting ourselves breathe with it.
you
now, if you like, if there is something that perhaps there is a little bit of an
outch from something recent, today, yesterday, this past week, not the
biggest outch, not the biggest thing, but something that's more manageable to
practice with right now. And acknowledging the outch with kindness towards yourself.
Maybe it didn't turn out as well as hoped, but you did your best. Can you have
kindness, appreciation? You tried.
And letting go of thinking about it and just feeling into
kindness, goodwill for yourself, for this outch, with this outch.
I'm appreciating your own goodness, your own wholeheartedness, your values, your
efforts. And within this sphere of kindness, acknowledging that, yeah, it didn't go.
This was challenging. It didn't go as well as hoped or possible. And it's okay.
It's okay. Life is like this. It's okay.
We have stability, equanimity, equipoise, and whole things just as they are.
Just as they've been with kindness.
And if we could imagine impermanence as, as a friend, as, as an angel, as if in
permanence, Adiv is it and said, Oh, dear one, things change. I'm the angel of
impermanence. Things shift. Always. It's just the way things are. You can put this
down. You can let go and forgive yourself. You can forgive the causes and
conditions. Perhaps learn. There's something to be learned. Without self
judgment. There's need to make amends. Do that. Maybe not. Maybe it's just acknowledging the care,
learning and letting go, releasing, releasing, releasing.
Angel of impermanence kindly invites you to release. Let go.
Acknowledging with kindness, compassion, letting go. With the support of the angel of impermanence,
and permeate our lives, our human lives.
Acknowledging with kindness, kindness, letting go. With the support of the angel of impermanence,
you
may be kind, accepting, loving towards this person who is me, knowing their best.
Who has limitations like anyone else?
It's okay, it's hard of being human.

and can we extend this goodwill? Others may be others we've interacted with or been entangled with, they too are doing their best.
Can we offer them kindness, goodwill? Appreciation, they too have so many causes and conditions.
Or how they act or show up in the world, wishing them well. Generosity of heart.
you
you
sharing this generosity of spirit. This goodwill with others expanding the circle.
people we have interacted with directly and indirectly impacted.
many circles out, wishing so many beings who directly and indirectly impact us, we impact them, wishing them well.
we're not so different, we're all doing our best with what we have, the causes and conditions of this horribly existence.
We're offering our goodness, the goodness of our practice, the merit, the wholesomeness of our practice to all beings everywhere.
May our practice be a cause and condition for our own waking up freedom from sorrow, suffering, cultivation of kindness, compassion, wisdom.
May we be free and may all beings everywhere too be free.
Thanks everyone. Thank you so much for your practice.
So we explored, we practiced with first becoming embodied with our body and the breath, being with the entire breath, in-breath, out-breath, connecting, settling.
And then we opened to appreciating ourselves, a sense of appreciation, kindness, goodwill for ourselves for having done our best and maybe with something that there might be a little bit of ouch with.
So when goodness, when kindness meets the ouch, it becomes compassion. So practice in compassion for maybe a tiny ouch that has happened recently, and acknowledging that we've done our best, letting there be forgiveness, letting there be an appreciation of goodness,
and then extending our kindness, forgiveness, not just to ourselves, but to someone else. Maybe you interacted with them and tangled with them, and then spreading out to everyone.
And oh yes, and there was the invitation to imagine impermanence as an angel, angel of impermanence, letting go, inviting us to let go.
That was a new element tonight we explored, we experimented with, letting go. It's all impermanent. We learn the lessons, we make amends if needed, and then we don't, we don't hold on, we don't hang on, we let go, we open our hands, our fists.
So with that, I'd like to invite us to engage in a small group together and explore.
You're welcome to offer one nugget about your practice, how this practice was for you, how it went, or you can be silent.
You can offer your silent, compassionate presence, if you like. And we only share from our own experience.
We offer a little bit, a little nugget perhaps, or again, silence. We don't ask questions, try to give advice, and as someone asked last time, if you notice somebody else is offering advice or asking questions, it's okay to say,
I'm not supposed to do that, I'm supposed to just speak from our own experience, just eye statements, please, offering safety to one another as much as possible.
And let's go alphabetical order and let the prompt be something like, yeah, with this practice, how maybe specifically with the angel of impermanence, if you lean into that, what does it feel?
Does it support you to lean into letting go, to letting be, not attaching, to see impermanence as, oh yes, as a support, as an angel, as an advisor, as an advisor of impermanence.
So maybe exploring that aspect or any other aspect you wish. So I'm creating the breakout rooms, and again, take care of yourselves, take care of each other, be kind, and let's go in alphabetical order, and here we go, opening the rooms now.
Take care.
Good morning. Here we go, great, and welcome back everyone. So we have some time for any questions, reflections, especially if you haven't spoken in the large group for a while.
I would like to invite you to pull forward if you've spoken recently, pull back a little bit, so you can also type in chat if there are any reflections, aha moments, questions, comments.
What was this like for you? Love to hear from you.
Ali, please.
Hi Nikki, thank you for the practice. I've always, I mean, I came to the practice because of the wisdom aspect of it, you know, those two wings of the bird. I was still heavy on that. So that's why I came to the loving kindness happy hour, because I know that is the ultimate wisdom just to have that one in.
But so having said that as a background, when you were talking about the throwing the impermanence, and I said, I got glad, you know, I said, that's right, that's something I can just, you know, chew on and just like this, turn it around in the mind and stuff.
But I was able to see that as just like, let that go, you know, I mean, that's not why even, I mean, but I was glad you put that in there. But how still I am, and this will be okay. This is okay too.
I'm loving the wisdom part. I mean, that's like, but yeah, that's, that's where I am. And that's what came up for me. It was interesting that I saw. All right, she's talking about that.
That's it. Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, thank you, Ali. I appreciate what you brought in. And actually, before you mute yourself here, you can unmute if you want.
So, so, so what I heard you say was, was given that you're in many people, you know, leaning to the wisdom aspect, a lot more. But as you said, yeah, wisdom and compassion are the two wings of the birds.
If you have mostly wisdom and you don't have compassion, the bird is not going to fly. It's kind of go go around around in circles.
So, so the compassion aspect, the practice of the heart are so important. And wisdom arises, actually, I have seen wisdom arise. Just doing the heart practices wisdom arises and, and ultimately, at some point, if you're just doing wisdom,
compassion might arise at the very end when you see emptiness. But anyway, but the whole path could be pretty bumpy without, without kindness and we're just doing wisdom.
And, and then I also heard you say, Oh, when I brought in impermanence, like, Oh, yes, wisdom path. And yet, and yet, you know, maybe the way I heard it was the sense of wanting to think about with impermanence, but it's actually not a something to think about.
And you know that it's really something to relate to in our hearts. It is part of the, it's a, you know, to, to relate to the wisdom of impermanence in a heart based way because usually we grieve impermanence.
That's the, the, the, the twist I wanted to bring in tonight, we usually grieve impermanence like, Oh, it's impermanent. I want to stay. And it's not like, but I was kind of playing a little, you know, Aikido, like shifting like, Oh, yes, the angel of impermanence is telling us to let go.
It's okay to forgive. It's okay to be kind. It's okay to let it put it down. So that's how I was reframing it.
So just putting a little more explanation around that. Yeah.
Yeah. Thank you, Ali. Anything else or does it feel complete? Give me an okay if it feels complete. Yeah, it feels complete. Great. Thank you.
Yep. Yep. And I saw Erica, please.
Hi, Nikki. How are you?
I well, thank you. Good. So I have a question because I personally have said this in, in groups before impermanence is one of my North stars.
I really appreciate knowing that everything changes. And I guess so the funky stuff, it's going to get better. And the good stuff you don't grasp because it's just going to do the back and forth.
But when you start talking about the angel of impermanence and sort of put this body to it, I'm a little confused. So can you, can you talk about what that is to you and what an angel of impermanence means to you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for that. And I appreciate also what you brought in about the way you've been practicing with it, which is, oh, yeah, it's impermanence.
You know, when, when things are challenging, it's going to change. It's like the saying about the weather in London. If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes because it's going to change.
And if it's something good, enjoy it, appreciate it, but don't hang on to it because things are impermanent, of course. Love it. I really enjoy it. It's not like, oh, don't push it away.
So, and then you're curious or confused. Like, what's this embodiment that you're bringing as an angel? So, so it's, it's to bring the idea, the invitation is to bring some grace to it because I love their attitude.
You have towards impermanence, Erica, which already has a sense of grace, but I want, I want to invite us to feel some grace about impermanence.
Not just about ho-hum, like, oh, yeah, impermanence. One of the three marks of existence. Yeah, these Buddhists talk about everything being impermanent. Yeah, whatever.
Like, no, it's actually, it's the grace of impermanence. Oh, wow. This is the way things are. And it's, there's a grace to it. That's what I'm inviting when I bring the word angel.
It's kind of bringing some grace to shift our relationship to impermanence. That's what I'm trying to do. Does that make sense?
Yeah, thank you. I love the word grace. So that's, that's lovely.
Yeah, great. Thank you. Thanks for that question. That helps me give a little more nuance to, to what I was trying to invite us to, to explore. Yeah, thank you.
Any other reflections? Now, if you have spoken recently, you are invited to speak since we've had around Marianne.
I just wanted to say to you, you're so skillful of a facilitator and bringing people to the front that I just have to help by, by doing that. It's, I so admire how you do it.
And thank you.
For me, the, an angel is also a symbol of protection. And so that makes impermanence easier to come to accept or confront or, yeah, accept maybe. Yeah.
It was a wonderful pairing for me.
Beautiful. Thank you, Marianne. Thank you so much for your kind, kind words and, and yay. I love this, this pairing that you just share in this angel as a sense of protection, as a sense of safety, as a sense of goodness.
It's, and to bring that together and exploring it in that, that dimensionality, that, that door that can open in that way with, with impermanence.
Oh, that's deep. That's very interesting. Yeah, I'm going to sit more with that. Thank you, Marianne. Thanks so much for bringing that in. That's lovely. Yeah.
Beautiful.
Anything else to feel complete, their fellow travelers practitioners, and the chat is open as well. Yes, it is.
Malaya.
I really liked that when you were saying angel of impermanence, because it also made me think of, with all the change happening, that there's a caring presence.
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, beautiful.
Oh, yeah, it's the intertwining of loving kindness with impermanence, what you named the sense of care.
Yeah, that's not just dropped, but yeah, that's beautiful. Thank you for, for saying that. The lights light something up in me. Beautiful.
Thank you, Malaya.
Wow. Thank you all for your practice. This is so heartwarming and just wow.
It's the first time we're relating to impermanence, bringing permanence into a happy hour in this particular way.
And I, I have trust they will open more, more possibilities and more ways to explore it for each of us individually and collectively.
So thank you so much for your practice, dear ones. Thank you, friends. May you be well. May you be happy. May we all be free.
Hmm.
Thank you all. Be well. Take care.
