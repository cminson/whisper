 
 Dharmette:  Mindfulness  in the Time of 
COVID -19

After  sitting  in meditation , I don’t  feel like saying  too 
much,  but I’m sure I will in a minute  or a few seconds.  I 
suppose  how I’m feeling , which  appeared  in meditation,  
is instructive  for these  times  we’re  in. I was centered  in 
my body , and my usual  thinking  mind  got quiet.  And 
now there  is a different  perspective  on life – a different  
way of being  present.  Meditators  have  first-hand  
experience  with this shift from being  preoccupied  or 
agitated  with their thoughts  to the mind  becoming  quiet .  
 
We can be led around  by our anxious , concerned  
thoughts  of wanting  or not wanting  things.  Sometimes  
thoughts  can be quite  relaxed,  easygoin g, light,  and 
soft. They  can seem  to be a dime  a dozen.  At other  
times,  thoughts  come  with a lot of emotional  
involvement , fueled  by feelings  of all kinds.  They  may 
come  with a sense  of importance  or alarm . Somehow  
the picture  we’re  painting  in our minds  – the imagery  in 
which  the thoughts  are circulating  – seem  true or 
important,  and these  become  the images  and stories   
 through  which  we understand  our lives and our 
relationship  to life. 
 
With this involvement  in our thoughts  of some  
subconscious  ment al imagery , story  or context  we think  
we’re  in – our thoughts , for example,  might  have  an 
image  of an apocalypse , or a virus  coming,  rolling  
through  the city streets  like a big tidal wave.  There can 
be a kind of emotional  imagery,  sense , or feeling , which  
is the background  context  for the thoughts  we have.  So 
then thoughts  would  be about  alarm,  worry,  planning,  
and what’s  important.   
 
But there  is a whole  different  shift that can happen  when  
we do something  like meditate,  go for a walk in nature  
or in a park, or sit and have  a nice time drinking  tea with 
a friend  and chatting  about  things.  That can somehow  
settle  the anxious , preoccupied  mind.  But, more  
important  than that, it can settle  the background  story  or 
belief  that it’s important  to be involved  in planning,  
remembering,  figuring  things  out, building  up a sense  of 
self – or whatever  thoughts  we’re  spinning  and swirling  
in. 
 
This whole  backgr ound  context  is an activity  of the 
mind.  It’s not inherent  in the nature  of reality.  It comes  
and goes.  It gets evoked  in certain  situations  more  than 
in others.  One thing  that really  promotes  this 
background  activity  of the mind  is being  busy.  The more   
 we try to rush around  doing  more  and more  things,  the 
more  the subconscious  stuff begins  to percolate  up. The 
traces  of our anxiety  and concerns  with the different  
things  that we’re  thinking  about  remain  somehow  in our 
psyche,  mind  and hearts.  We don’t  just stop thinking  
about  something.  We’re  still living  in the traces  that are 
left over from how we thought.  The background  stories  
have  created  an influence  on our body,  mind,  and who 
we are. 
 
So, to sit is a radical  act. To sit, maybe  close  your eyes,  
with the idea that this is a time when  you don’t  have  to 
figure  anything  out, is a radical  act. This is a time when  
you don’t  have  to solve  the world’s  problems.  This is not 
a time when  you need  to plan ahead,  make  yoursel f 
safe,  fix the social  problems  you have  with work  or 
friends , or whatever  the challenges  are. Those  are for 
later.  If they’re  important,  you’ll address  them  later.  If 
you can put those  aside  in meditation , or at least  have  
the conviction  that this is not the time to devote  energy  
to them,  then it’s a lot easier  to let go of them . The mind  
may still bring  them  up, but it will be a lot easier  to give 
yoursel f over more  fully to the meditation , to 
mindfulness  of breathing,  of the body,  and just staying  
aware  here in the present  moment.   
 
This movement  of coming  back  to the present  moment,  
waking  up here, and coming  back  to the breath  is 
actually  very powerful , and should  not be  
 underestimated.  To do that movement  over and over 
again,  resetting  in present  moment  awareness  once  
again,  is like doing  reps at the gym.  We’re  developing  
strength,  capacity,  momentum , and familiar ity with a 
whole  new world  of showing  up and waking  up. So it’s 
actually  a very precious  time.   
 
It doesn’t  matter how many  times  your mind  wanders  off 
in thought.  All that matters  is how many  times  you come  
back.  It’s not that we make  ourselves  wander  off so that 
we can come  back,  but just celebrate  coming  back.  
Enjoy  it! Come back  in a way that is enjoyable.  Come 
back  to the breath  in a way that you’re  not jerking  the 
mind,  pouncing  back  at the breath , or berating  yoursel f 
for the fact that you wandered  off. Come  back  in a way 
where  you actually  look forward  to coming  back . So, the 
next time you meditate,  you can’t  wait, because  you get 
to treat yoursel f with respect,  care,  kindness,  and value.  
It’s a wonderful  way to treat yourself . Yes, your mind  will 
wander  off. Then lovingly , kindly  you come  back.  Settle  
back.  
 
Over  time, being able to settle  back,  relax,  show  up, and 
develop  some  continuity  of staying  with the breath  and 
the present  moment  takes  the energy  or fuel away  from 
our agitat ion, preoccup ation, and thoughts . It takes  the 
fuel away  from some  of the emotions  that afflict us with 
challenges  and difficulty.  It takes  the energy  away  from 
the way our bodies,  shoulders  and stomachs  are held  
 tense.  All of this takes  energy ; it takes  a certain  kind of 
fuel.  
 
When  that fuel of attention  keeps  going  into the 
practice , and we’re no longer  doing  those  other  things  
so much,  things  begin  to relax.  The body,  mind,  and 
heart  relax.  So, settle  here and really  feel the three -
dimensional  fullness,  value,  goodness,  and benefit  of 
just being  here for a few minutes.  It doesn’t  have  to be a 
45-minute  meditation  like we did just now.  Even  a three -
, two-, or one-minute  meditation  can make  a huge  
difference  in shifting  us out of the preoccupied,  agitated,  
thinking  mind , and into a fuller,  relaxed  presence  here 
and now.  
 
With that, you can go into the world . And what  comes  
next,  the second  half of meditation,  is really  important.  
Meditation  doesn’t  stop because  the bell rang, or you’ve 
gotten  up from meditation.  I think  it’s very valuable  to 
think  that meditation  is always  twice  as long as the time 
that you actually  meditated  Once  you get up, that’s  the 
second  half. So if you sat for two minutes,  then you 
have  two more  minutes.  If you sat for 45 minutes,  the 
next 45 minutes  are actually  quite  precious  and 
important.  It’s a time to discov er how to enter  the world  
with some  sense  of presence,  mindfulness,  attention  – 
really  being  present  in your experience , as opposed  to 
rushing  off and losing  whatever  presence  or calm  you 
had in meditation.    
  
It’s not that you have  to stay calm  when  you get up. But 
can you stay centered  and grounded  here and now in 
this body  at this time?  You’ll have  to face a lot of things,  
but if you can stay grounded  in the second  half of your 
‘meditation, ’ then chances  are you’ll be a wiser  person . 
Chances  are you’ll see and understand  yoursel f better , 
and you’ll have  access  to deeper  places  within  – deeper  
understandings  and values  from which  to live your life. 
 
The idea is to learn  to make  that shift from being  
preoccupied  to being  centered  here,  and to do that over 
and over again  in meditation  and in other  parts  of your 
life until you become  skilled  at it. Then  it becomes  
almost  second  nature.  With practice,  making that shift is 
not so hard to do. So, try it, even  if it’s just a teeny  bit: 
“Here I am. Let’s  pause  for a moment.  Let’s  connect  
and see what’s  here.  Let’s  be present.” 
 
I certainly  hope  that those  of us who practice  meditation  
and mindfulness  are doing  it for much  more  than just 
relaxation  and stress  reduction.  I hope  we’re  really  
doing  it so that the wisest  parts  of us can be a 
contribution  to the world . So that how we are – wise,  
calm,  perhaps  less anxious  or not anxious , maybe  even  
caring  for others  and for the world  – has a greater  
chance  to flow from us, and to engage  and support  us 
as we go into the world.  So that how we live is not only  
 for our own well-being  and protection,  but also to 
support,  protect,  and benefit  others.   
 
Now, with the COVID -19 virus  going  around,  there  are a 
lot of people  who are anxious , and who don’t  have  
something  like a meditation  practice.  So for those  of us 
who do have  a practice , now is an even  more  valuable  
time to meditate . Maybe  you shou ld pick up your 
meditation , or meditate  more  often  than you have  been , 
so that you can be a part of the change.  You can be 
someone  who show s up a little bit calmer  than others , 
and maybe  in some way, this settle s everyone.  Or you 
can be a little bit wiser , or more  caring , for people  who 
are in need  of care, rather  than feeling  that this is too 
hard and you have  to protect  yoursel f.  
 
It will do your heart  a tremendous  amount  of good  if you 
think  about  how you can care for more  people  now.
