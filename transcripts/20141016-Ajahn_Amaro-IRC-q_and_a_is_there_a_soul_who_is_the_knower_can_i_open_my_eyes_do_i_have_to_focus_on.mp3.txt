The term that is used in the scriptures is panya-chaku, or the eye of wisdom, or you can, the comparable terms are that of vigya, awareness, and so that it's that awake knowing quality of mind. 
A way of clarifying that is just to use that question, who is it that's aware, and when you, you can leave it as it is, Cathy, so I prefer the dim, thank you. 
Because when you ask that question in the quietness of the mind, the word who becomes very, very peculiar, right? It's not just an idea that it doesn't apply, but there's a direct sense of, oh, this isn't really a who, it's a what. 
So I hope that answers your question, opens up a few more questions. 
Yes, at the back there. 
Well, I haven't been a leper since I was a kid, but I've been a leper since I was a kid. 
Well, I haven't been a leper since 1978. 
So I can't really talk from direct experience very accurately. 
But in essence, you're not really looking for all feelings to be nice. 
And that one of the most helpful things is to, in a way, to be looking at neutral feeling because about 98% of the feelings that we do experience are neutral. 
It's the pleasant feeling and painful feelings, only about 2% of the whole lot. 
And mostly, I mean, like the feeling of your shirt on your skin, it's neutral. 
Or the feeling of your hands on the chanting book, it's neutral. 
The feeling of the breath, it's neutral. 
So just developing that attention on neutral feeling and seeing how the world of feeling is experienced, rather than trying to focus particularly on the pleasant or the painful. 
Also, as I was saying earlier today, just teasing apart that the quality of, when there is painful feeling, just teasing it apart so that the mind gets to know the difference between the feeling of discomfort or unpleasant feeling and the negativity of attitude towards it. 
It takes a bit of doing, but if you really explore it, you can see there's something as unpleasant and then there's a kind of a bridge that is crossed where, I don't want it, I hate this, when's this going to be over? And when it's just in the realm of feeling, Vedana on its own, it's quite peaceful, quite innocent really. 
And in the teachings on dependent origination, you have sense contact, feeling and then craving. 
And it's often pointed out that the weakest link in the chain of dependent origination is between feeling and craving. 
And so to be able to discern, I don't like is one thing. 
I don't want is another. 
And there is a kind of a bridge that's crossed there and that the world shrinks from, I don't like this, this is unpleasant to, I don't want this, how can I get rid of it, when's this going to be over? And to notice the difference between dislike and hating. 
Or at the other end of the spectrum, noticing the difference between liking and wanting. 
You might see something that you like or you might hear something that you like and say, well, that's pleasant. 
And then just noticing how the world shrinks. 
I want it. 
And that there's a tension there, there's a stressing in the heart that happens. 
And just getting to know the difference between I like and I want or I don't like and I hate. 
And in a way, developing an awareness of the felt sense of a liking and wanting and feeling how they contrast with each other and similarly disliking and hating. 
And by experimenting with that, exploring that, then you can directly know that quality of liking is quite can be quite spacious. 
I like it, but I don't have to get it or have it or own it or be looking towards anything at all. 
It's just, it's just pleasant. 
That's enough. 
As William Blake puts it, using his 18th century English, he that kisseth a joy as it flies lives in eternity's sunrise. 
He that binds himself to a joy doth the winged life destroy. 
He that kisseth a joy as it flies lives in eternity's sunrise. 
So since we're in California, kiss the joy as it flies, you know, option, there's a possibility for bumper stickers there. 
But William Blake really had it because that's the, if you try to grab it and own it, then you, you destroy it, you suffocate it. 
And that that's the kind of, we can use our meditation, our ability to reflect and explore, to look at those very feelings. 
There was a hand down here somewhere. 
Yeah. 
We've been talking, we've been talking about calmly mind and wisdom. 
You mentioned not getting into the area of nihilism. 
We're doing product balance practice. 
We balance it with action. 
Does that help without getting into the nihilism? Yes. 
Yeah, very much. 
Well, it's, there's the whole area of how we make effort is very useful to look at and to explore. 
Because on the one hand, if we relate to our practice, to practice from self view, I want to become kind. 
I want to become compassionate. 
I want to get concentrated. 
I want to develop insight. 
I want to get rid of my chattering thoughts. 
I want to get rid of my afflictive emotions. 
I want to get rid of my doubts and fears and negativity. 
And, and that seems like that's what the books are telling us, or in so many dharma talks we hear. 
So isn't that what we were supposed to be doing? Right? But the, the mistake that we make is that that the, the practice is getting co-opted by self view. 
Like I'm this person who's unconcentrated. 
I've got to become concentrated. 
I've got these anger problems or these fear problems or these lust problems. 
I've got to get rid of my anger, my fear, my lust, and then I'll be a beautiful spiritual person. 
And so even those, those are wholesome aspirations because they get co-opted by self view. 
What was happening is that the subtle kinds of desire, the desire to become Bhava Tanha and the desire to get rid of the annihilating tendency, they're sort of sneaking around the back door and taking over your efforts at meditation. 
And so even though we can practice with great sincerity, there's this, this dynamic of I'm a person with problems. 
I've got to get rid of, if I get rid of my problems, then I'll be a person without problems. 
The moment that be fine. 
But there's still got the person there. 
And as long as there's the person, it's like the person can't really be freed from the prison because the person is the prison. 
And as long as the practice is conceived in I and me, in terms of I and me and mine, then no matter how much effort we put in, how sincere we are, then it's still going to have that frustrating and unsatisfying quality. 
But then it can be quite confusing because you can hear this, but what am I supposed to do? Which is a natural enough question. 
And when we look at the Buddha's teaching, he, he emphasizes over and over again, this is a path, his teaching is a path of action, it's a path of engagement. 
So many of the lists of, you know, the Buddha was the great list maker, as you probably know. 
And so many of those lists of spiritual qualities, there's the application of energy of effort in the seven factors of enlightenment, the eightfold path, the right effort, the five spiritual faculties and 10 parameters, energy effort is all is always in there. 
So obviously, there's an element of acting and engaging that is is intrinsic. 
And the Buddha points that out very directly, so that I did not teach a path of passivity of non doing, because some of the spiritual teachers in his own time, that was, they were trying to espouse a path of non action of non engagement and kind of basically freezing yourself. 
So that's not what I teach. 
But if you look at the, like in the eightfold path, the element of right effort, Samavayamo, it that really encapsulates the best way to direct our actions, so that the right effort is divided into four aspects. 
So restraining the unwholesome from arising as Sangvara or if the unwholesome has arisen, then letting it go. 
So either having the intention not to give rise to anger, but if anger has arisen, then you let it go, cultivating the wholesome and cultivating loving kindness and compassion, concentration, wisdom, and what wholesome qualities have arisen and maintaining them in being. 
So with respect to the unwholesome, restraining or letting go with respect to the wholesome, giving rise to and maintaining. 
So there's, there's work going on. 
There's, there's choices being made. 
There's like, this is unwholesome. 
Okay, let it go. 
This is wholesome. 
Okay, crank it up, you know, feed it, keep it alive, maintain it. 
So there's, there's, there's discrimination going on. 
There's discernment, choices being made. 
But the, the difference between that and Bhavatana, Navi Bhavatana, the desire to become and the desire to get rid of is there's no self element. 
There's no sense of self in right effort. 
What makes it the, the, the, the right element of, of right effort, the samar is that it's free from I and me and mine. 
It's, it's, it's balanced, it's integrated. 
And so that effort is being made, but it's not, it's not being co-opted by the, the habits of self view. 
So yes, the wholesome is being recognized and is being maintained. 
But that's based on mindfulness and wisdom as an action based on mindfulness and wisdom rather than me. 
I've got to get more loving kindness in the mix. 
I should be more compassionate is the, the, the choices are being made. 
The effort is being enacted and embodied, but without the ego co-opting the whole process. 
So that's why the samar vayam or right effort is part of the cure, whereas the desire to become the desire to get rid of is part of the illness. 
And the difficult, the difficulty is they look really like each other. 
So the example I always give is like the left and the right hand. 
They look just like each other, but they're also opposites. 
And so that it's, it's, it's essentially the element of self view and self centered thinking that ego centered habits that I making and mind making, that's the, the, the, the piece that makes a difference. 
And so with, with respect to, to developing the practice, just noticing and being really alert to when that I me in mind wades in and is, is sort of intruding. 
And then so to recognize that, to know that I making and mind making feeling, to recognize that, oh, this is me practicing my practice. 
Yeah. 
My mind. 
Yeah. 
I should, and in a way highlighting that I and me in mind, getting to know the feeling of Inus and mean us, minus and to recognize that, that I feeling is just another mental formation. 
It's just like the, the weight of your body on the cushion. 
Just like the feeling of your glasses on your nose. 
It's just another feeling. 
It's, it's just another pattern of consciousness. 
It's not, there's no thing really there. 
There's no essential I that is there. 
It's just a, a pattern of, of attitude that arises, passes away. 
So when we see that that I and me and my feelings are empty and then have to be bought into, then there's a learning of how to apply effort without the, the me got to become this, me got to get rid of that. 
And that, and often the easiest way of doing it is just as you catch that attitude forming, you just highlight it like, I've got a problem with fear. 
I need to get rid of it. 
This is me and my fear problem. 
And that just by highlighting it, then there's a recognition of, oh, that's not really it. 
There's, there's feeling of fear arising in this moment, but does it really have an owner? Who's afraid? What's there to be afraid of? What is it that's aware of this? Is there an owner of it? And then exploring and using your reflective ability in that way, then there's habits of self view and tend to fall away on their own. 
They sneak back in again. 
But the more that the mind brings the quality of wisdom and mindfulness to bear on it, the more that those self centered habits of thinking and attitude are recognized and the more they're seen and get them front center, they can't stand up in the clear light of day. 
Yes. 
Well, there isn't really a concept of soul in Buddhism. 
In a way, that's one of the defining characteristics of the Buddha's teaching. 
And it's interesting that he never actually says anywhere in the entire Canon, there is no self. 
People often say that the Buddha said there is no self. 
Well, show me. 
He never says that as a categorical statement. 
What he says is that when you, when you look for the self or what, or anything that is self, you can't find anything that that as a qualifies that or defines that or constitutes that. 
So the teaching on is the teaching on Anatha is more accurately represented by saying it's a teaching of not self. 
So it's in a way, it's by a method of exclusion. 
Like you, you're rather than trying to define what you essentially are, you learn to stop identifying with what you're not. 
And so that when he uses that teaching the first time, very, very early on just in the, when he was giving the instruction to his five kind of five companions that he had reunited with after his enlightenment, five friends of his he practiced with before. 
He uses that these, those qualities of Nietzsche, Ducca, Anatha of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not self as a way of, of helping them to, to let go of the habits of identification. 
So he says, you know, is the body changing? Is it permanent or impermanent? It's impermanent. 
And that which is impermanent and changing, is that something that it can be permanently satisfactory or completely satisfactory. 
No, it can't be. 
Okay. 
That which is impermanent and unsatisfactory. 
Can it be truly said of that? This is me. 
This is what I am. 
This is my true self. 
No. 
So it's a way of analysis that he's, he's describing like exploring identification with the body, the feelings, perceptions, mental formations like moods and ideas and thoughts and then consciousness itself. 
And so rather than him sort of saying, I declare there is no self. 
It's like, okay, the things that we normally think of as our self, if they're looked at, they're explored. 
You can see this isn't really who and what we are. 
So rather than trying to define what we are in terms of a concept or an idea or a word, his method was to help us to let go of the habits of identification with what we're not. 
And then what remains is real, is the reality. 
And so it's got a lot in, in common with the Christian method, what they call a via negativa, like approaching spiritual reality by defining what God is not rather than trying to define what God is. 
And so that's a particular specific method that he used in meditation, when you try and find out, you know, try and find who, you know, who the watcher is, you end up with this kind of, you know, that you can see that, well, there's awareness, there's knowing, the more that you try to define that or kind of have any sort of personal, give it, find any personal attribute in it, the less you can find. 
But it's something to explore. 
And rather than taking my word for it to use the meditation to investigate that, because what happens is that, say that the mind is aware of a thought, oh, this is just a thought, this is just a memory. 
What was your name? Rod. 
So this is, this is just Rod remembering. 
This is just Rod's thoughts. 
And this is the awareness of the words, this is Rod's thoughts. 
That's what this is. 
Oh, I am the awareness. 
That's what I am. 
I am pure awareness. 
But then at that moment, that you're not pure awareness, there's a thought I am pure awareness that the mind is attached to. 
And so that the practice, particularly the practice of insight meditation is like, as it was staying at the back wall of being that awareness rather than creating an idea. 
Yeah, I am infinite consciousness. 
That's what I am. 
Yeah, I am the, I am the, the, the, the, the knowing quality of the universe. 
That's what, and then at that moment, that knowing quality has been forgotten. 
And the attention is latched onto the thought. 
Yeah, and I am. 
And, and so what the Buddha's pointing to in his teaching is that all those I ams, they're going to be wide of the mark. 
And the actuality of what is, is essentially indefinable. 
And there's a phrase that he uses over and over again, which in Pali is Yena, Yena, Himanyanti, Tatatanghoti, Anyatati. 
Whatever you conceive it to be, the fact is always other than that. 
And which, and that's a simple principle that any concept is not it. 
And so he was criticized in his own time because he wouldn't come up with some kind of metaphysical description about ultimate reality. 
And so his, his teachings about ultimate truth are very, very sparse. 
And 99% of his attention goes onto the describing the path to realize that truth for ourselves, rather than trying to describe the truth, or describe that ultimate reality, other than you'll say things like, this is the sublime, or it's peaceful, or this is the good. 
That's all you get really. 
There's not much to hang anything on. 
But most of his attention is these are the things that are obstructing the mind from realizing that truth. 
These are the things that need to develop to sustain that realization. 
These are the pitfalls and the hurdles that are allowable to encounter along the way. 
And so that he was very pragmatic in that approach. 
So rather than trying to come up with words to describe the indescribable, he just decided, no, I won't bother, because we're the words can't do it. 
But the words can point you the way to, to help the mind to awaken to its own nature. 
But coming up with a description or a way of characterizing what that fundamental reality is, words don't do it. 
So let's not even try. 
So he, he just made that like a kind of spiritual choice in the way of how he would approach teaching. 
And so that characterizes much of what you find in this particular form of Buddhist teaching. 
And that was pretty fun. 
And I find that when I'm closing my eyes, that's the fastest one-way ticket to India is if you meditate with your eyes open, or is that inadvisable? No, you can sit with your eyes open. 
Whatever works is the right thing. 
And because the practice is for you, it's not like that we're just subservient. 
We don't need to be subservient to the method. 
The method is for you. 
And so it's whatever helps us to wake up and to develop the useful qualities. 
And it's going to be different for every single one of us. 
So in a way, we each have to craft our own path and seeing what are the things that really benefit, what are the things that don't work, because I can put out some instructions. 
And you can say, well, the first couple of things were really good, but that other thing, I don't see that at all. 
My mind is just not working that way. 
Well, fine. 
You go with what works rather than how things should be. 
That note is the discipline of paying attention to the breath and mastery of that component necessary, because I find that I'm more capable as the watcher, if you will, than focusing on the breath. 
Well, whatever. 
The focusing on the breath is just a way to help the attention to stay grounded in the present. 
If that doesn't help, then leave it aside, because it's like if you're already in IRC, you don't need the signpost to get to IRC. 
So if you're here already, then okay, you don't need to get here because you're here already. 
Okay, I see it's now 8. 
44, and I've been encouraged to be a subservient to the carefully worked out schedule. 
Everything in this particular part of the universe is organized on Excel spreadsheets, I am told. 
So not wishing to offend and go against the system. 
We can have a, we'll bring things to a close for this part, and we can have a period of walking for 15 minutes, and then for those who wish, and then a final sitting up until 9. 
30. 
So those who wish to sit can consider on, but if you'd like to go and do some walking meditation for 15 minutes, then please do so.
