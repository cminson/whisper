Yes, if I talk and no one's there, am I really talking? It's a question for our minds when we talk to ourselves, who's there? So thank you very much for those of you who wrote comments in the chat about what this was like to do that exercise we just did. 
And not surprisingly, I think there was a fair number of people who had mentioned anxiety and fear. 
It's very common to have fear or anxiety apprehension be the drive for thinking, especially if thinking is a lot to do about planning. 
And a lot of times planning tends to be fear based, not always, sometimes it's delight based. 
So if people, if meditators get the message that all they're supposed to do is let go of their thoughts and go back to their breathing, that can be a very nice instructions and very helpful sometimes to keep it that simple. 
But it also is a way of dismissing thinking and not really bringing a lot of mindfulness to this whole process of thinking. 
Ideally, in this mindfulness practice we're doing, we're learning how to bring a kind of clear clarity of attention and care and respect to all aspects of our lives. 
And to keep letting go of something and not really take time to really get to know it is a kind of disrespect. 
We're not inspecting it again and again. 
And so there comes a time when we want to really turn our attention to the thinking mind itself and be mindful of that, where maybe even the meditation becomes not thinking meditation in the sense of actively thinking and contemplating something, but thinking meditation in the sense that the thinking is the object of the quiet, attentive mindfulness we're doing, just like we would bring quiet, attentive mindfulness to breathing. 
And it's not about breathing exactly, but it's about being present for it. 
So being present for thinking, but maybe without participating in the thoughts. 
And there's a lot to discover in that world of thinking. 
And without discovering it, about seeing how it works our thinking, what drives it, how we're pulled into it, the energy in it, how we identify with it, those things will operate in thinking anyway. 
And some people get confused about why do I keep thinking the same thing? Or why do I always feeling the same way? Or some people won't understand the teachings about not-self in Buddhism, because they're so strongly identified with their thinking. 
I think therefore I am. 
And who am I if I'm not thinking? That's a locus, that's the center of it all. 
But to be able to step back and watch it and see it, and realize that the watcher is not the thinker, and if we're able to step back far enough, if the watcher can be more quietly, silently here, doing it from a different place. 
And so one of the things to discover is that certain emotions are the fuel for our thinking. 
They provide the pressure to keep thinking the same thing over and over again. 
And if that's the case, then it's really valuable to do a mindfulness of emotions, to respect the emotions, get to know it more deeply, practice with it. 
And some people know how to practice mindfulness of emotions when the emotions are kind of their own thing. 
But when emotions are kind of embedded in our thinking, it's more subtle, or we don't really take time to look at it. 
And one reason not to look at it is that if we think we are the thoughts, we are the thinker, and who we are is observing, say, with the world, it doesn't occur to us to turn around and look at the observer, look at the thinker. 
Because the thinker is the one that's looking, not the one that's being looked at. 
And so we might miss a whole bunch of aspects of our inner life because of not having that ability to look back on what we think is the self, who we are. 
Over time, we start being much more relaxed about having the central locus, the central coagulated center, this is who I am. 
We are something, of course, but we don't have to have any stress and contraction, compaction around that self often has to do with our thinking. 
Sometimes it sort of has to do with that some people are emotionally based, and some people are more somatically based. 
But all these places are valuable, but we don't have to be based in them. 
We don't have to be centered in them as if that's who we are. 
The idea is to be more fluid and inclusive, holistic, include it all. 
So if we're not blinded by our thinking so we can't look at thinking, if we can turn around and look at it, and if we see the emotions there, the moods, then we could do mindfulness of the emotions. 
So say, for example, there's a lot of future thinking that's driven by anxiety. 
Anxiety comes with some authority, some power, some sense of alarm that we have to do something. 
Something has to go on. 
And so we get pulled in, seduced in, in a sense, to have those thoughts, problem-solving, fixing, imagining all the possibilities so maybe we can become safer or something. 
But it can be so repetitive over and over and over again. 
But if you turn around and feel the anxiety, and for some people they've never taken time, never felt it was possible or of interest to turn around and feel the anxiety in the body, to help the anxiety feel safe, help give space for the anxiety to be there, so that it's almost as if the thinking is the signpost for the anxiety. 
It's the messenger, and we stay with the messenger and we don't read the message. 
And the message is the emotions that are there. 
And so we might practice with the emotions. 
The other thing we might notice, and we start noticing the emotions of the thinking, is that having the thoughts is one thing. 
The thoughts we have influence us in one way. 
But the emotions might influence us in a different way. 
Sometimes the primary influence on the ongoing mood and concerns we have might be the underlying emotion, not the content of the thoughts itself. 
Then certain emotions, they influence the kind of thoughts we have. 
So fear thoughts might produce thoughts of danger, all the possible dangers we might run into. 
Anger thoughts, and a mood of anger, a move of aversion, might predispose us to have thoughts about all the things that are wrong and what we don't like. 
If the underlying mood is one of desire, we might be thinking fantasies of desire, looking for things we want and can have. 
So the underlying mood can affect the kind of thoughts we have and motivations we have. 
And when we have those thoughts that are shaped by the emotion, they in return will feed back on those emotions. 
There's a feedback loop that goes on, feedback circle. 
So we can get caught in these circles and spend all day. 
The thoughts are not very powerful and not too much suffering in them. 
They can just continue all day, especially if we identify with it, if we take it, oh, this is who I am. 
If we've done it for so long that this is normal. 
It's become the normal thing. 
So normal becomes invisible to us. 
Isn't that how everything is and how it's supposed to be? The order of the universe is to have these kinds of thoughts or have these kinds of mood. 
This is so normal. 
Maybe there's no normal for this mind of ours. 
It's a dynamic fluid process that the more free we are, the more we can surf and navigate it all not be unduly influenced or caught by any of it, but respectful for all of it. 
And so this ability to look at the underlying mood, emotion, tone of our thinking is eye-opening for some people. 
It's kind of revolutionary. 
It's like the missing link for some people. 
It can be quite disturbing for some people because it upsets what's normal. 
It reveals things sometimes that we haven't admitted before. 
But in the short term, it could be a little bit disorienting. 
But in the long term, this is the way to find some real inner stability, some real ability to be creative and present and let the best of who we are give it a chance to surface and come in a way it can't if we're over-identified with a particular mood attitude of thinking that we don't even know is there sometimes or we so strongly think this is normal that we're kind of caught in its grip with enough care, with mindfulness practice, all the grips relax, not automatically. 
But I want to encourage you to have confidence that this practice leads to the de-gripping, relaxing the clinging that goes on in the mind. 
And so, and perhaps today, you can spend the day kind of looking at this through the day. 
What are the emotions that seem to be behind your thoughts that you have? And see if you can, almost like you're speaking in a different language, see if you can call upon a different part of the mind and start thinking a different way, not pushing away or denying the fact that you maybe are thinking with a lot of fear, anxiety, or whatever it might be for you. 
But simply see if you can find on the side of that somewhere else a place of confidence or generosity or kindness or maybe even humor, playfulness, all kinds of possibilities. 
But see today whether you can kind of shift and change and pay attention to your mind and find if there's different ways of thinking and in the process begin to de-identify with one particular way. 
And as you de-identify, you might become a greater observer of it all. 
So, thank you very much. 
And I look forward to continuing tomorrow.
