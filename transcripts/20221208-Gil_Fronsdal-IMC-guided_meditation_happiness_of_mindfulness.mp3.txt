Hello and welcome.
Today the theme in this week's series is happiness.
A particular kind of happiness that in a sense has no reason, external reason,
isn't that we've won a prize or some wonderful things happening in the world.
But rather a happiness that comes with doing the practice, the mindfulness and meditation practice,
it's a kind of contentment, a warmth, a pleasure that comes from being immersed in the practice itself
without any distractions, without any reference points of other things that we want or that we don't want,
that happen in the world or our concerns about what's coming or what's happened before.
Immersion here in this moment's experience.
So I'd like to say this that what the mind, what attention focuses on can have an influence on the mind.
What the mind feeds on affects the health of the mind, the state of the mind.
So if the mind feeds on a lot of horror movies, then it might be not a surprise that we spend a good amount of time being afraid.
If we spend a lot of time with friends who mostly are angry, complaining, cynical,
and that's what we focus on and there's no surprise then that gets reinforced, that happen to be that way.
If we spend a lot of time on advertisements, no, maybe no surprise that then we end up strengthening our desires.
If we focus on genuine or healthy happiness, that affects and influences the mind differently than these earlier ones.
And so what we focus on is food or affects or has an influence on the mind itself if we do it regularly and repeatedly.
What we think about, same thing.
So it's helpful in meditation to lower the bar for what we think happiness or joy is.
Maybe it's a very subtle contentment or a subtle sense of pleasure of simply sitting here and being here.
And to include that in the focus of attention, let that be food, let that be what the mind feeds on or grows with.
Now mindfulness practice is often about being present for what is, whatever is predominant.
And so what I'm saying might seem contradictory, focus on something that's subtle and ignore the predominant desires that I'm caught up in or the anger that I'm involved in.
It's a little different in that we definitely want to be present for what is.
But we want to notice that being present, being mindful, being aware.
And here I use the word being as a kind of deliberateness, a kind of conscientiousness or a kind of conscious presence and awareness.
That deliberateness or that engagement of awareness, that way of being aware, it's possible to find happiness, pleasure in that.
So if we're being mindful of our anger, being mindful of our greed or whatever it might be,
the way not to have the anger and the greed be fed is to step away from participating in these unwholesome and healthy mind states.
And in stepping away, look at them, be aware of them, watch them, and appreciate the watching, appreciate the awareing of them, the awareness.
Appreciate, feel a contentment, a joy, a kind of happiness in being aware as opposed to in participating with.
So as we sit here today, as you bring up your mindfulness and being aware of the present moment in your experience,
with a very low bar, very low standard of what qualifies, see if you can be aware while there's a pleasure of mindfulness,
the pleasure, the contentment for being aware.
Maybe a delight, maybe not something you're actively thinking about too much, but just the nature of being aware.
The nature of mindfulness contains within it some pleasure, some goodness.
Something that feels this is good, this is valuable, this moment is content to be aware of this way.
To bring that along with your mindfulness, then that is what feeds the mind, that's what influences the mind.
It's a protection from being influenced by the greed or the anger or whatever, the unhealthy mind states, mind activities,
while being aware of them at the same time.
So hopefully that's clear.
So, assuming your meditation posture and gently closing your eyes
and slowly and deliberately bring a sense of gentleness into your body,
being gentle with what is not gentle, being gentle with the tensions, the agitations,
the emotions that might be in your body, a gentle awareness of them.
And if you find your body being, muscles being tense,
almost as if you're not doing anything, but being aware of them, the tension,
allow the tension to release if it wants to release.
Allow your body to relax if that's what your body wants to do.
And then allow awareness to gently be with the movements of the body breathing.
Wherever that movement of breathing, sensations of breathing, are the easiest or most enjoyable to experience.
And as you're aware of your breathing, maybe also aware of any tension and agitation in the mind.
And if that tension wants to be to relax, allow it to the mind to soften, to relax.
And then again, becoming aware of breathing more fully, where there's a light touch in the body,
a light touch between awareness and breathing.
And awareness touches the experience of breathing lightly, but broadly.
Not the fingertip touching, but the whole hand of awareness, making a light contact with the body breathing.
Awareness floating on the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out.
If you find yourself thinking, it isn't so much that you let go of your thoughts,
as you let go of your interest and involvement with them.
So you can be more interested and more involved in the contact between breathing and awareness.
And then as you're aware, you might be aware of breathing, thoughts arising, sounds, sensations, emotions.
All these things might come into awareness.
See if you can also include, be aware of the contentment, happiness, pleasure in being aware.
What you're aware of might not be pleasant and happy.
But some way that being aware deliberately, consciously, knowing what's happening as it's happening.
Lightly, gently, openly.
Whatever way that that feels comes with happiness, contentment, include that as you're being aware.
Lightly, gently, openly.
Lightly, gently.
Lightly, gently.
Lightly, gently.
Lightly, gently.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
In the knowing, in the awareing.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Instead of giving yourself over to your thoughts, give yourself over to being aware.
Here, now.
Sensitive to the slightest pleasure or happiness that comes with being aware.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
And if there is pain or discomfort anywhere, physically, emotionally,
is there a way of lightening up, gently, on how you're aware of it,
opening up the awareness so that awareness of it has a contentment or pleasure or happiness,
or a feeling of rightness.
This feels right to be aware this way.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
Lightly.
So then as we come to the end of this sitting, imagine that how you're aware of the world
is offering medicine or food for the world.
That if you're aware of the world, if you know the world from fear or from anger,
from greed or lust, you're putting into the world something very different
than if you're aware of the world with contentment and happiness, with joy, pleasure, love, kindness.
At least a kind of pleasure or contentment that can come from being aware itself.
The awareness that allows us to see clearly and honestly what is here in this world
without being entangled in it.
To be aware in a way that is the awareness itself contains a joy, a happiness, a pleasure,
the joy of non-clinging, the joy of being present.
To be aware in this way provides a healthy food medicine for this world that we live in.
May we bring the joy, the happiness of mindfulness into all our encounters,
even the ones which are unpleasant, even the ones that we have other emotions.
But at least we have the subtle pleasure, happiness of mindfulness itself.
May our mindfulness be a healthy influence on this world that we live in.
May it contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
And may all beings everywhere be free.
Thank you.
