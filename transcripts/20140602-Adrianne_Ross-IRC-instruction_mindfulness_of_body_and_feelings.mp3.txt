This morning as we continue with our practice, we'll be including awareness of
feeling tone. So we've been exploring the mindfulness of the body and the
breath and it will include more intentionally feeling tone of pleasant,
unpleasant and neutral. The flavor of experience and you've seen you've been
aware already of the tendency to move towards and hold on to what's pleasant
and to resist push away what's unpleasant and sometimes to space out when
things are neutral. And we'll also include in our practice more awareness of
the factor of awakening of investigation, discrimination. So as our
mindfulness builds continuity, we're just moving in a little closer, allowing
ourselves to receive more details of the experience. So let's begin now by
settling into the body, allowing a full awareness of the body just as it is
right now. You might want to take a few deeper breaths and allow the body to
release, to release some of the tensions with each out breath, softening in the face
around the eyes and the jaw, softening in the shoulders and neck, gently releasing
with each out breath. Muscles in the back and the chest, softening in the belly,
receiving the sensations in the arms and legs, hands and feet, and so as the
attention is grounded in the body, the mind can be open, spacious, receiving
experience, receiving the experience of the breath. And as the mind becomes more
quiet, aware of even more detail of the breath, not straining to see something
but relaxing and allowing the breath to reveal itself. As though you could
experience everything about the in-breath, all the details of the out-breath.
Relaxed, curious attention, and as you receiving the sensations of the in-breath
and the out-breath, aware of how the breath changes, sometimes rough, sometimes
smooth, long or short, sometimes pleasant,
or neutral, or unpleasant,
becoming intimate with the experience of the breath in a relaxed, open way.
And if you like and you feel drawn to that, you can continue just being with
the breath. We might want to include sensations in the body, spread the
awareness to the whole body as you breathe. Trust what feels right to you
for your practice. If the awareness is with the whole body, sometimes drawn to
different sensations as they're stronger, aware of the quality of the
sensations, pressure, tingling, warmth, vibration. If the intensity as it changes,
what happens is you pay attention. Other sensations pleasant, unpleasant or
neutral, and then aware of the mind's reaction to that. Is it resisting the
unpleasant, holding on to the pleasant, or is it letting the sensations come and
go? Not to judge, but just to be aware of what's happening, and if there's a
judgment knowing that. And if the mind is judging, what does that feel like in the
body? If it's helpful to you using the mental noting to name the sensations, see
what happens as you pay attention to them. Tingly, pleasant, pleasant, pressure
unpleasant, hating. Just to note softly as a way of connecting with experience.
Tingly, pleasant, pleasant, pleasant, pressure, tingling, warmth, vibration,
when ever the mind is drawn into thinking, as soon as you recognize that, is this
going in a useful direction? Gently reconnecting with the breath in the body.
Not following the thoughts. Not pushing them away. Letting them come and go. Being
friendly towards them, but not inviting them in for tea.
So continuing now at ease, relaxed, and intimate with experience, whether it's
the breath, body sensations, sounds, receiving whatever arises, aware of what
happens as you pay attention to it. At times aware of the feeling tone of
pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Aware of the reaction to that. What's the attitude
in the mind? Is it wanting or resisting?
What's the attitude in the mind? Is it wanting or resisting?

What's the attitude in the mind? Is it wanting or resisting?
What's the attitude in the mind? Is it wanting or resisting?
Notice what's happening in this moment. Is the mind with the breath, the body, sounds,
sounds. What's the feeling tone of experience? Is it pleasant or unpleasant or neutral? Is
the mind resisting or holding on? Is it possible to just be with whatever's unfolding? Not
following, not holding on? If the mind is sleepy or dull or drifty, then to encourage
a little more inquiry, investigation, to look a little more closely at experience in a relaxed
way. More detail of the experience of the breath and the body. What is there to be
known? What's sleepiness like or drowsiness like? If the mind is agitated or restless,
then to keep things still and simple, staying with the breath, releasing everything else,
guiding the mind to calm, or perhaps bringing awareness to the whole body breathing. Calming.
Trusting your intuition to adjust your practice a little.
Meditate your breath and bring things a little bit closer.

As you hear the bell, being fully present and receptive for the sound and for knowing hearing.
.
And as the sound of the bell recedes, see if you can be aware of the impulse to move before you actually move.
And then aware of the sensations as you're moving.
And perhaps aware of seeing as you open your eyes.
These transitions between sitting and getting up and walking are often places where we lose the mindfulness.
We hear the bell and it means break.
And so see if you can let the bell, like I said this before, let the bell be just a message as please continue.
And just let that carry with you.
As we settle into the retreat, it's a beautiful time to allow the continuity to build between all the activities that we're doing.
Walking and sitting and eating and going to the bathroom and closing doors.
When you're going through a doorway, notice the intention to reach for the handle.
And as you let the door close to be aware of that, of that movement going through doors, washing hands, all those things.
And when you're washing your hands, bringing kind attention to your hands, often we ignore these parts of our body.
So just allowing that continuity and settling into the stillness.
As we bring the factor of awakening investigation and discrimination more into our practice,
it's such a helpful support to guide us in balancing our own practice,
in gaining our own wisdom and confidence that we know how to adjust when we go off track.
But to do it with kindness, not with judgment.
And if judgment is our pattern, then to just be kind to that, to explore it.
And as the continuity of mindfulness builds, that will naturally lead to more interest and more inquiry.
And just a reminder that this is an intuitive inquiry.
It's not a figuring out.
And so if you find yourself getting into a lot of why this and why that, just come back to the breath.
It's not an archaeological dig.
It's just to let experience show you itself, trust that it will unfold on its own.
So we have time for a few questions about your practice, if you like.
