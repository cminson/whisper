The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning.
Good afternoon. Good evening.
And a happy Friday to all of you.
So we'll begin with a guided meditation.
So I'm taking a moment to arrive here and now to settle into this moment.
Perhaps feeling the sensations of sitting.
The pressure of the chair or cushion against the body on the back or the backside.
The feet on the ground, feeling connected, grounded, here.
Bringing an aliveness of attention, a mindfulness to the bodily experience right now.
Inhabiting the body, alive to the way that the body feels the sensations.
Perhaps you want to check in with the face and how the face feels right now.
Perhaps you notice there's a little bit of holding, a little bit of tension around the eyes or the jaw.
It might be that bringing our attention to these areas allows some of the tension to drain out.
It might not be also.
We relax about relaxing.
Without turning it into a project.
We're just creating the conditions in which there might be more ease.
Feeling the neck, the shoulders, the upper back, the lower back.
Just tuning into these different aspects of the bodily experience.
The chest, is there a way in which there is a certain kind of closing or holding or tightness in the chest?
That might be softened.
Or in the belly.
Again, not forcing anything, not manipulating or manufacturing.
More of a welcoming, allowing, opening.
Whatever is possible right now with regards to more ease, more presence.
Maybe I will zoom in.
I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about.
Is it possible to set the tone, the attitude, the direction
to be one of kindness?
When we discover that we are lost in thought
in a kind, gentle way, we can begin again
noticing the sensations of the body or perhaps the sensations of breathing.
I don't know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about.
Rather than part of a self-improvement project
can this be an opportunity to rest in awareness, rest in warmth, rest in kindness?
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Can we allow our practice to unfold?
As much as possible in an arena, a space, an occasion of care and warmth
while we rest the awareness on the bodily experience
or if that's your practice on the sensations of breathing.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Nothing in particular needs to be happening.
We are just being with the experience of being in a body.
You might notice that everything is appearing on its own.
You don't have to make it appear.
You don't have to do anything.
You don't have to do anything.
You might gently inquire who or what is doing the knowing of these experiences, these sensations.
Does this knowing have a center?
Are you in the center?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Perhaps you're thinking, what is she talking about?
Can you notice that that is a thought, an experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Is there any part of this field of appearances that you are controlling?
Are you producing the next sensation, the next sound, the next thought?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Is there anything you're doing to notice the experiences, the sensations?
Or do they simply appear on their own?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
Are you on the edge of the experience?
And then to end this meditation feel your feet on the ground, feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body
and when you're ready you can gently open your eyes.
