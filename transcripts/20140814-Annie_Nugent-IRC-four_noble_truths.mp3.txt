One time the Buddha was doing a Q&A session with some of his monks and one of the monks asked him a question. 
He said, what is the world's great fear? That could be a question that we might ask too. 
What is the world's great fear? Anything coming to mind for you? Well, this was the Buddha's reply. 
The Buddha said the world's great fear is doka, is suffering. 
And perhaps that may resonate for some of you. 
Yet even though this is our great fear in the world, it also happens to be the first of the four noble truths. 
We have this tremendous fear of doka, yet it is the first of the four noble truths. 
And without coming to know this first noble truth, there's no way that we can come to open and understand the other three noble truths. 
So let's just mention what these four noble truths are. 
The first one is that there is suffering or there is doka. 
The second one is that there is a cause to doka, which is craving. 
The third noble truth is that there is an end to doka, an end to suffering. 
And the fourth noble truth is the path to the end of suffering. 
So this is what we're going to explore a little bit tonight because this subject was the topic of the Buddha's very first Dharma talk that he ever gave. 
So clearly it's an important one to give. 
It was called the turning of the wheel of the Dharma. 
So after his enlightenment, this was what he chose to talk about, to introduce the Dharma to us, to the world, with an explanation on these four noble truths. 
This too is quite interesting for us to take in because if you think of all of the vastness of his understanding through all of his years of practice, he summed up in essence the result of his practice and his understanding with these four major insights that he had on the night of his enlightenment. 
And fortunately for us, he also said that these four noble truths were all that we needed to know in order to come to know the end of suffering. 
That's to say, in order for us to know true happiness, we need to know just these four noble truths. 
That suffering and freedom from suffering lie within them. 
So they're key. 
It's also said though that these four noble truths are what all of the Buddhas of all times come to realize when they become liberated. 
So there have been many Buddhas over thousands in calculable eons and when each one becomes liberated, this is what they understand, the four noble truths. 
So there, once again, it shows us that they are really important because it's these four noble truths that are, you could say, hidden from us through the ignorance that's in the mind until they reveal to us by a Buddha who then begins to teach about them and thus we can begin to practice and come to understand them and see them for ourselves. 
So why are they noble? What's noble about these four truths? Well, for two reasons. 
Firstly, they're noble in as much as they're uncovered or discovered by someone such as a Buddha or an arhant, a fully liberated being. 
This is what they come to uncover within their own minds. 
And then the second reason they're noble is that they're the timeless, unchanging, fundamental truths of our existence and they're noble for this reason. 
So when we talk about or hear about these four noble truths it's not about learning them off by heart, being able to recite of the first, the second, the third, the fourth noble truth. 
It's such and such. 
Really, it's about imbibing them, taking them in, immersing ourselves in them and bringing them to life within our lives so that we can see how they show themselves within us. 
So that we actually live the four noble truths. 
So that they're uncovered from the darkness within our own minds, you could say. 
So let's take a look then at this first noble truth of Dukka that is our great fear. 
The Buddha makes the statement. 
He says, there is Dukka. 
It's the statement, there is Dukka, or there is suffering. 
It's not my suffering. 
It's not I am suffering. 
It's not life is suffering, but there is suffering. 
It's a simple statement of truth. 
So it's not personal. 
It's not belonging to anybody. 
And it's also not a judgment on anybody. 
So this too is really helpful for us to know because it's not that we've done something wrong and therefore we are afflicted by Dukka. 
It's not that at all. 
So it's helpful for us to know because we can relax a little bit. 
Simply by virtue of the fact that we're here as living beings in this round of samsara, that is this round of birth and death where we reside, there is Dukka. 
So it's helpful for us to take this in. 
It can be a huge relief. 
So let's look at this actual word Dukka that I've used because there are several translations. 
One word I've been using up until now is suffering. 
And this is the most common translation of this word Dukka. 
But it's not the most ideal word. 
It's limiting in as much as although Dukka does include suffering, there's so much more to this word Dukka. 
It has a deeper, more significant meaning for us. 
As a noble truth, really what it's doing is pointing to the inherent unsatisfactoriness of our existence. 
And it's unsatisfactory because everything in our world, everything in our existence is conditioned. 
And it's conditioned by change. 
It's conditioned by impermanence. 
Therefore it is unsatisfactory. 
What could possibly be satisfying about a constantly moving target? You can't pin anything down. 
Just as we're leaning to pin something down, it's changed. 
It's moved on. 
And now there's something different that's arisen. 
So a word we could rather use instead of suffering is unsatisfactoriness. 
And so some of us might use this word too, the unsatisfactory nature of existence, rather than the suffering nature. 
Because even though we do use it, it's a limiting translation. 
So if we do, and I'll be probably using it throughout the talk, when you do hear us use this word suffering, we're actually meaning it in a much deeper, broader way to imply the unsatisfactory nature of experience. 
Some other words that are used too are the unreliability of things, the insecurity of things, or the ungovernability of experience. 
You cannot govern anything that's constantly moving. 
And then for some of us, we've just used this Pali word of doka, which means the unsatisfactory nature of experience. 
And when it comes to doka, there is no exception. 
Everybody experiences this first noble truth of doka. 
Everybody suffers, those that are rich and beautiful and famous, as well as those that are experiencing hardship and poverty and difficulties and so on. 
Everybody experiences doka. 
So rather than denying it, which is often what we do, at all costs, if we possibly can, attempting to deny it and run away from it and pretend that it doesn't exist, rather than doing that, can we rather take up the Buddha's revolutionary offering, his revolutionary instruction, and that is to turn to it, and to open to this first noble truth of doka. 
We must all know that to try to deny it, to try to pretend that it doesn't exist, doesn't work. 
In fact, all of us must know somewhere that to pretend that doka doesn't exist. 
We must all know that that doesn't work. 
Because if it did work, we wouldn't be here. 
We know underneath it all that what we've done up until now, to cry and be happy and avoid unsatisfactoriness, hasn't worked. 
And so why not take up the Buddha's revolutionary suggestion and turn to it? That's what the Dharma is all about, turning to this first noble truth of doka, opening to it. 
So let's take a look at the three possible kinds of doka that we might experience in any given moment, because there are three basic kinds. 
So the first kind, let's pull this a little closer, the first kind in Pali it's called doka doka, but we often just call it body doka. 
It's, or body pain, it's the basic aches and planes and unpleasantness of having a body. 
I'm sure we've all been experiencing this over the last day or two that we've been here. 
So it's the bodily discomforts that we might feel, and then the mental kind of anguishes that can go together with having a body and what transpires when we have a body. 
For example, let's say the body gets sick. 
We get sick in one way or another, and as a result of that, we can't work. 
And so because we can't work, perhaps we can't earn sufficient money. 
Maybe we don't have enough, our employee lets us go because we can't work. 
Therefore we don't have enough of an income to support ourselves and our family. 
And so we can't eat in a healthy way. 
And so now the family gets ill and so on. 
These are the physical and mental aches and pains and difficulties that come with having a body. 
Another way it's also described is the compounded nature of doka, the compounded nature of the suffering that comes with having a body. 
One thing upon another upon another. 
So we know this one very well. 
It's the most obvious kind of doka that there is. 
It's called Obvious doka. 
Then there's the second kind of doka which is not quite so obvious. 
This kind in Pali is called Viparinama doka. 
It's called the doka of change and it's specifically directed towards pleasant. 
Now what happens when we've got pleasant? We think, yay, I've got this pleasant experience and it's going to be here forever or we hope it is. 
But we know that it isn't. 
And so an example related to the second kind of doka was one of my very early long retreats. 
It's a long retreat, a three month retreat, 23, 20, so years ago. 
I experienced a tremendous amount of the first kind of doka, body and mental anguish for three months. 
It just was not ending on and on and on. 
But then one evening one of the teachers came in and gave a talk on the Four Noble Truths and he began to talk about the second kind of doka, the doka of change, Viparinama doka. 
And he was talking about the pleasant experience he was having and how it was so much doka, having this pleasant experience. 
And so here I'm sitting in the room and thinking, what on earth are you talking about? That's not doka, what I'm experiencing is doka. 
But then he went on to explain. 
Now if you take a look in your own experience, if you do have pleasant experience, if you look in a very quiet way underneath it all, you will see that there is an underlying dis-ease that's there. 
Because somewhere we know that it's going to change and within us we're thinking, how can I keep this? We're holding our breath, we're hoping that it's going to stay, we're hoping that it's going to last. 
So this is the quality of dis-ease. 
This is what happened to him. 
In fact, he had to have Sayodore Upandita pointed out to him because he was so stuck and immersed in the pleasant that there was no way that he could see this underlying sense of dis-ease. 
So this was how Sayodore Upandita prized him free from that pleasantness by seeing that even though it is pleasant and fully worthy of being experienced, underneath it all we know that this too is going to change. 
So this is the second kind of doka, the doka of change, specifically related to the pleasant. 
And then the third kind of doka, and this one is often the most difficult for us to understand. 
This is called sankara doka, or we could call it the doka of the unstable formations, the conditionality of all experience. 
Now talking about it in terms of unstable formations is really referring to the constant arising and ceasing of moment-to-moment experience that doesn't last for more than a less than the blink of an eye. 
It's constantly moving and changing, coming together, falling apart, coming together and falling apart, so that in truth there is no resting place. 
Things are always kind of shimmering in movement arising and ceasing in this way. 
Empty of any stability whatsoever. 
So let's look at a couple of very ordinary, worldly examples that might help to explain this kind of doka for us. 
So again on retreat where I had a very clear and direct understanding in a very worldly kind of way, you could say of this kind of doka, the constant arising and ceasing of experience, was related to my fingernails. 
So again these retreats they're long, you know, it's a long retreat. 
So alright the nails need to be cut, so we'll cut the nails. 
So in my mind the thought is right, I've cut the nails done, that's it, over. 
But conditionality, coming together, falling apart, changing conditions, moment to moment. 
The very moment that those fingernails are cut, they're starting to grow right away. 
So nothing is in a stable formation at all. 
So what happens of course as we know, jeez I thought I just cut them, but ten days or whatever later we've got to do it again. 
A slightly different kind of example might be in our home. 
We clean our home, top to bottom, we vacuum, we dust, it is spick and span. 
The very moment it is complete, it is starting to get dirty, right away. 
Because conditions are coming together and falling apart all the time. 
Here we can see there's no resting place, we cannot say done over the end because it's changing, we'll have to do it again pretty soon or later depending on the individual. 
So this is the three basic kinds of docker that we'll experience at any given time. 
This kind of docker is also sometimes called the oppressive nature of experience. 
The oppressive because it doesn't give us a break, it just keeps coming at us moment to moment to moment. 
So in announcing this first noble truth of docker, the Buddha then went on to describe exactly what it entailed. 
He might got the message, he thought he'd break it down for us even more and so there are eight or more little points which will really give us a deeper understanding of what docker actually is. 
So the first one, birth is docker, aging is docker, death is docker, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair are docker. 
Association with the unloved is docker, separation from the loved is docker, not to get what one wants is docker and in short the five aggregates, that's what this human being consists of, five aggregates, there's body, there's feeling, there's perception, there are formations in the mind and there's the consciousness, the wakeful mind, the consciousness, this is docker too. 
That's what he says, he sums it all up, in short the five aggregates of clinging are docker too. 
That seems like an awful lot of docker doesn't it? So then what tends to happen when we hear a talk on this first noble truth, as I'm giving you right now, sometimes what can happen is that it can be construed as dwelling on the negative and the miserable. 
That's what it can seem like, can't it? That we're taking the mind towards the dark and the miserable. 
But that's not what we're doing at all. 
It's not about a case of oh, sort of woe am I with all this suffering. 
It's not spoken about to drag us down in any way. 
Actually, on the contrary, it's to help us to take the identification out of it all and to help us see it with perspective, just to see it with more clarity of mind. 
So we're bringing it into consciousness and saying, oh yes, I see, there is docker. 
But that, it's not about wanting us to get all unhappy and miserable about it at all. 
Because if we don't know the truth of docker, that it exists, that it is there, then we won't take up the mission, the instruction, the practice to free ourselves from docker. 
Because we won't see the purpose, we won't see the point. 
We won't even want to begin to look in the right direction to free ourselves from docker. 
We'll want to continue to do what we've been doing for so many lifetimes, doing as many pleasant experiences as we can get, and we know they don't last. 
So instead of perhaps feeling maybe depressed or deflated perhaps on hearing about this first noble truth, rather we can actually begin to hold it just a little bit more lightly when we begin to see that it's not personal. 
It's not a personal thing at all. 
At the same time though, it's not about holding it with a kind of a flippant or a cold energy in any way. 
That's not what it's about either. 
It's really about simply opening to the truth and taking it in, acknowledging, recognizing that this truth is present and out of this it prompts us to move in the direction of transcendence of docker, to free ourselves from it. 
So the Buddha gave us an instruction related to this first noble truth and he said that this first noble truth needs to be understood. 
So how do we come to understand it? By opening to it, by letting it in, by feeling it, by noticing it, by experiencing it with the support of mindfulness. 
That's what helps us to get in touch with this first noble truth. 
But this has not been our habit has it over many lifetimes. 
Usually we don't have the staying power to be with the painful or the difficult or the unpleasant. 
We've spent so much time getting away from it. 
So it's very difficult for us to begin to turn to it and let it in, isn't it? It's painful. 
So it's a process. 
A process of very gently and slowly allowing ourselves to open to and get in touch with this first noble truth. 
Because it can take us a long time actually in the practice to get the point of the practice and that is that it's not about pleasant experience. 
The practice is not about a pleasant experience at all. 
But it's also not about an unpleasant experience. 
It's about opening to the full range of experience. 
Both the pleasant and the unpleasant and the neutral too, of course, but I'm talking about the two poles. 
So the practice is about opening to the full range of experience. 
Now for some people, not too many people, but some, there is a very deep tendency to open to doka. 
They can do this very well and then get stuck in doka. 
Stay with it. 
In another way you can say attach to doka. 
Attach to the painful, the difficulty unpleasant. 
And it can be quite difficult for this kind of mind to let go of the difficult, of the unpleasant, of the painful. 
So for this kind of mind what we encourage is inclining towards the beautiful, the happy, the lovely, the light, the pretty. 
And that is to help bring balance into the mind. 
So if you happen to be one of those people that are very good at opening to doka, so much so that that's where you find yourself dwelling, then it would be very helpful for that mind to incline towards the light, the lovely, the soft and the beautiful. 
But for many of us we have to shepherd the mind to begin to open to the difficult because that's what's hard for us. 
As we begin to open to the doka, the difficult aspects of experience, something very beautiful begins to happen too. 
We begin to get in touch with the compassionate heart. 
You cannot open to doka without the support of compassion. 
Because it's the compassionate heart that resonates with pain, with suffering. 
So this begins to be ignited within the heart too. 
And so what also happens is that perhaps for the very first time we begin to feel a resonance with humanity, with all living beings. 
We come to see that this is what all living beings experience. 
There is this experience of doka and we all want desperately to be happy, but we don't know how to do it. 
And so really the heart can connect with all living beings just by, through our own practice, opening gently to doka. 
So with the support of the compassionate heart, the practice of wisdom and mindfulness, slowly we begin to open to this first noble truth. 
And we come to understand it. 
Just as the Buddha said, we fulfill his instruction related to this first noble truth. 
We come to understand it. 
And what is it that we understand? We understand that there is a cause. 
And so this takes us to the second noble truth. 
The cause of suffering being craving. 
So craving is the translation, the English translation that we use for the Pali word tanha. 
Tanha is the Pali word for craving. 
And directly translated, it actually is thirst that we use the word craving. 
So if you know the experience of thirst, if you haven't had any water for a while, you know it kind of gnaws away at you. 
It can occupy the mind totally where all we can think of is having that thirst quenched. 
That's the experience of craving. 
When craving is there, it gnaws away at us. 
So it's essential to know the cause of suffering. 
In the same way with the diagnosis of the disease, when we know the cause, then we can find a cure. 
And similarly for us in our practice. 
What usually happens though when there's suffering? What do we usually do? I know that I've done this. 
We blame someone else if we can. 
It's your fault. 
You did something wrong. 
Sometimes we'll blame ourselves in the, I'm bad. 
I'm a bad person though. 
I'm no good. 
Sometimes we'll do that too. 
Or sometimes we'll blame the unpleasant experience or the pleasant sensation or the unpleasant sensation. 
But it's none of those. 
That is not the cause of our suffering. 
With investigation, as we look more deeply within our own experience by means of the support of mindfulness, we'll come to see that it is the grasping at the wanting that arises in the mind that is causing the suffering for us. 
So it's in the mind. 
This is where we're working. 
So what we're really asked to do is to simply recognize in any moment that desire, that's another word that we use also for craving. 
That desire or craving is present in the mind. 
And not get rid of it. 
Just notice it. 
Ah, there's wanting in the mind. 
Or there's desire in the mind. 
Or there's craving in the mind. 
You can use any of those words. 
So this is our practice for us to repeatedly come to see this. 
So we work with opening to this first noble truth of doka by seeing how it arises and recognizing that at any time that there is doka, we will see one of the various forms of craving that could be present. 
They will be there together. 
And when there is doka, when there is suffering, there will have to be craving there. 
And there happen to be three kinds of craving. 
So let's take a look at all of the three kinds of cravings that may be there at any given time when there's doka present in our experience. 
So the first kind, this is the one we usually know best. 
We know it very well. 
This is craving for sense pleasures, right? Craving for pleasant sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and pleasant things that arise within the mind, pleasant mental experiences. 
And we know these very well. 
And we'll do sometimes whatever we can to fulfill these desires for the sense pleasures. 
I don't know if you've noticed that we can be very single-minded, bulldoze our way through something to get what we want. 
I don't know if you remember several years ago there was, I think it was either on the news or in the newspaper, you know they have these sales at these department stores. 
People stand in line from 3 am and the doors open at 5 and everybody stampede and to get their desire, the item of their desire purchased at a lower price. 
Well somebody was trampled to death in the desperate desire to have that item in their hands that would give them this pleasure, this sense pleasure. 
So it's really very sad what can happen as a result of this craving for sense pleasures. 
We'll hurt ourselves, we'll hurt others just to get what we want. 
Not to mention too of course the attachment to the mental, the pleasures that arise through the practice. 
Maybe you've had a little taste of calm for example or just a little bit of ease in the mind and as I said earlier, what do we do? We attach to it and then we suffer when it goes. 
But as we know what arises ceases, all of these sense pleasures come and go. 
That's where the suffering lies, we cannot keep them for very long. 
They come and they go, then we've got to get another one and another one and so that keeps this craving alive, it doesn't deliver for us. 
So that's the first kind of craving. 
So then what about the second kind of craving? This is craving for future becoming or for future existence. 
That's the way it's described. 
It sounds a little more difficult to understand than it actually is. 
Really it's about projecting into the future how we think we're going to be or we'd like to be. 
At the end of this retreat I'm going to be happier, wiser, more enlightened, more patient, more loving with my family, whatever your little story is. 
That's being born into future moments that haven't arisen yet. 
It's all future becoming. 
It can be I'm going to become a better meditator at the end of this retreat or at the end of this sit, it can even be so close and so ordinary as to be in the next breath I'm going to breathe perfectly. 
I'm going to be there for the full experience of this half-breath. 
And the breath hasn't even arisen yet but we're projecting into the future. 
The future can be just the next moment but it's still the future. 
Or perhaps we're sitting up here going to ring the bell and we're thinking when I ring this bell it is going to be perfect. 
I'm going to be the perfect so we're born into being the best or a better whatever it might be. 
This is what it is. 
Craving for future becoming. 
It could be craving for the relationship we're going to have, the trip we're going to be on. 
Any of those things, future moments, future becoming. 
Then the third kind is craving for non-existence. 
It's the opposite kind of craving. 
This is where we're pulling away from the moment. 
The first one is leaning into the moment craving for future existence. 
Now we're pulling away from the moment wanting to get rid of or pull away from what is actually here. 
So we want to get rid of our pride or our judgmental mind or our anger or our fear or our jealousy. 
Pulling away from the moment. 
Not wanting to be with what is present. 
Or we could say wanting the present moment not to exist. 
Craving for unbecoming. 
That's another way of calling it. 
Craving for non-existence. 
So in a worldly kind of way, I don't know if you've had this kind of experience where perhaps we're in conversation with somebody. 
We're needing to go somewhere but somebody has stopped us on route to wherever we're going and they're engaging us in conversation and we want the conversation to end. 
So you had that feeling where inside you're walking away backwards but actually you're standing there having the conversation but you're already in your car driving off somewhere. 
That's craving for non-existence. 
Wanting to get away from the moment. 
I know this one very well. 
It's often that some kind of maybe a social gathering where we're at a party or something like that. 
The first hour all right, you're fine, you're there for the first hour but then you don't really want to look at your watch but you're looking at your watch. 
Then you're backing out of the door hoping that no one will notice that that's what you're doing. 
That's what's happening. 
Craving for unbecoming. 
Not wanting to be with what's happening in the moment. 
It's good to know that it can manifest in all of these kind of ordinary worldly ways because that's how we can bring these four noble truths to life out in the world. 
We can see them showing themselves there. 
It's like this one, this last kind is the kind of I'm out of here experience that we want to get away. 
I just saw this when Andrea and I were having lunch out. 
First of all it was in the shade where I was in the shade when I was on my own. 
So I could see it was craving for unbecoming, wanting to get out of the shade so that I could get into the warmth, become the warmth. 
So then I'm in the warmth and then that changes to wanting to get out unbecome from the warmth and now get into the cool. 
So this is how we live from one moment to the next, living out these different kinds of craving. 
Yet all of these different kinds of craving that can arise for us in any moment. 
They're all born out of this wrong view, this wrong understanding of this is me and my experience that I am having. 
Or this wrong view of self. 
It's the wrong idea that this is me and I'm having the experience and therefore I have to do something about it. 
This is the very birth of doka, the very birth of suffering. 
It's the attachment to the idea of me, myself and mine. 
But with all of experience and specifically now related to desire, it's not about me and my desire that I have to fulfill. 
So the second noble truth once again is about seeing what arises, that this is desire arising, being known, and then we see that it ceases by itself. 
So it's not about judging ourselves and I'm such a greedy person, I'm such an attached person, I'm so ambitious or I'm so anything. 
Really it's just about seeing the arising of whatever the quality is within the mind, seeing it and knowing it for what it is, not taking it personally and seeing that it changes. 
So in this way as we practice we come to see how craving operates to create suffering. 
When something arises and we grasp at it as being mine that I have to do something with, that's where the suffering arises. 
So we investigate the suffering that results when we take an experience personally. 
We see it, this is the craving, taking it personally, we see the suffering that results. 
So with anger for example, one time I was in an interview with Joseph and there was a tremendous amount of anger that arose in me and I was in tears in the interview. 
I'm such an angry person, I've got so much anger. 
What was happening? I was attaching to it, grasping at the arising. 
All he said to me was, Annie, it's not your anger, it is anger, it doesn't belong to anybody, it can simply be known, watched, experienced and we see what happens to it, it arises and it ceases. 
So what was the Buddha's instruction related to this second noble truth? First noble truth, doka needs to be understood, second noble truth that craving, the cause of suffering needs to be abandoned. 
So what does this abandoning actually mean? Another word we can use is either let go or let be because sometimes letting go can imply getting rid of something or something goes away. 
But really it's simply the mind that lets go of grasping at it and wanting to do something with whatever has arisen in the mind. 
That is the abandoning. 
So let me give you an example. 
Many years ago I had a long conversation with my mother about my life, about my childhood and I was trying to explain something to her about my life. 
It was a kind of an intimate conversation and I really wanted her to understand what I was talking about. 
But she didn't understand. 
And so I spent quite a few months trying to get her to understand. 
I wanted her to understand and I could see that I was suffering. 
And so as I worked with this and reflected and saw the suffering that was arising with me and the disconnection that was there, through recognizing, through seeing this suffering through this wanting, wanting her to respond in a particular way, not getting it, and the suffering that was there with it, letting go happened. 
In the letting go, in its place, was loving kindness, the heart of love. 
So instead of the separation that had been there with me and my mother, I wanted her to understand and I wasn't getting what I wanted. 
So I was feeling misunderstood and so on. 
Just a lot of suffering and anger and resentment. 
As soon as I could let go and allow her to not understand, could that be okay? And it was okay. 
That was where the freedom arose and together with that freedom was the heart of love, this open connected feeling. 
So we can also see how when craving is present, how it operates in such a destructive way to create separation and distance between us and life. 
So we hold on to things in life, so many things, so many arenas and sometimes we do get momentary fulfillment. 
Yes, our desire is met, but only momentarily and then it changes again, doesn't it? Then the causes and conditions have shifted, Sankharadukha things have changed and now there's a new desire that's arisen. 
We take a shower, we're out in the sun, out in the heat, a nice cool shower will be wonderful. 
We take a shower, but within a few minutes now it's too cold, now we've had enough. 
We're turning in all prune if we've been in the shower for a long time and now we want to get out. 
Now we want a different experience. 
So this is how we begin to see more and more, things are constantly on the move. 
There's no point in holding on to something. 
Change happens constantly. 
The Buddha's well-known phrase, all that arises ceases, is so important for us to begin to see in all experiences as they arise. 
What's new becomes old very quickly. 
Take a look at some of the possessions we have. 
Cars, it seems I must be a very slow learner. 
15 years ago I bought a new car and jeez, I got so upset when I got a scratch. 
I wanted it to be new, I wanted it to stay new and I could see the suffering with wanting it to stay new. 
Oh, let go, alright, get your dirty feet into the car, doesn't matter and so we let go. 
We care, we keep it clean. 
We allow the process of nature, the nature of experience to take its course. 
Goodness me, that 15 year old car died on me, I bought a new car, the very same thing happened. 
Gosh, banged the door against some pole and a little bit of a dent. 
But I let go much quicker this time, so there was some learning. 
It definitely has been an improvement, definitely has been a shift. 
So more and more we want to see how when there is grasping, craving, I'm using all these words interchangeably, holding on. 
We'll see that there's suffering, so we're seeing the first and second noble truth here. 
In the seeing of this, letting go comes about. 
We let go, oh, it's okay for the car to get a scratch. 
It's okay for my mother to not understand. 
It's okay for that sound to go on for 15 minutes outside the window. 
It's okay, we let go. 
And with this letting go, what have we realized? What have we come to know? The third noble truth shows itself. 
The end of doka, the end of suffering. 
What is instruction related to this third noble truth is that the end of suffering is to be realized. 
It's not that we get it, we realize that this is what we're experiencing in the moment. 
We've let go and taste that moment of the end of suffering. 
I'm going to talk briefly about three different kinds of the end of suffering, three different kinds of the third noble truth. 
Firstly, there is the highest level of the third noble truth. 
There's the highest level of realizing. 
That is the realization of a Buddha or an enlightened being. 
That is when we've come completely to the end of this round of birth and death. 
But then there's also partial realization of the end of suffering. 
That's when there's some degree of realization of the end of suffering. 
That's when there is some degree of understanding of the truth of impermanence. 
We've got it at a fair level of understanding. 
We've grasped it. 
We've seen it directly at a fair level within us. 
That's to say that some of the ignorance in the mind has now been transformed into wisdom. 
A little bit of a chunk has been transformed into wisdom. 
But then there's a different kind, another level that we can all work with. 
It's very important to give this and it's called momentary realization of the end of suffering. 
We want to give this some attention. 
Because more often than not we hear about the four noble truths or the end of suffering and we're looking way over there for the end of suffering. 
And we're missing the many small moments that we may be experiencing at any given time in our practice. 
And so then it's possible that we can feel this heartened because the road looks long and difficult. 
And we've got our sights set down there but we're missing the really valid moments of the end of suffering even if it's just a moment that we're experiencing here and now. 
For example when we let go of wanting the pain in the knee to go away. 
We're sitting, we've got this pain in the knee, we don't like it, we want it to go away. 
So it's the first and the second noble truth, craving, wanting it to go away. 
And so now there's suffering, the suffering in the mind that we're talking about. 
And then we realize, wait a minute, when we've got a body, it's going to have an unpleasant experience. 
Can I just let be with this even if it's for a moment? We let go, we let in the unpleasantness and it truly is okay even if it is for just a moment. 
Taste that moment, in that moment we've known the end of docker, just for a moment. 
It can be just a quick moment but we want to notice it because if we miss it we're already grasping at something else. 
We've already re-grasped it wanting the pain in the knee to go away. 
So it's savor those moments when we have let go. 
Letting be it's the mind of equanimity, the non-grasping mind of not pushing away the unpleasant or grasping at the pleasant. 
We're just letting be with things as they are in this moment. 
So you want to taste and know that ease of the end of suffering just in the moment. 
Because the more we know this taste the more the mind will incline in that direction of non-grasping and therefore there will be more and more moments of the end of suffering. 
A deeper understanding will arise in the mind to give way to a deeper aspect of letting go. 
So when we know the taste of the end of suffering even if it is in just a moment now there's also something else that we know. 
Now we know what to do in order not to suffer. 
That is to say now we know how to live in order not to suffer. 
Or you can say now we know how to live in order to experience the end of suffering or to realize the end of suffering. 
And this is how the fourth noble truth shows itself to us. 
When we have a taste of the end of suffering and realized it just for a moment then we know ah when I don't cling when I don't grasp it's this that brings the sense of ease letting be with the moments just as they are. 
So this is pointing to the way to live or the way to practice in order not to suffer. 
So this fourth noble truth is called the Eightfold Path and this is how we live and practice in order not to suffer. 
You can also call it living wisely in the world living this Eightfold Path wisely in order not to suffer. 
So the Buddhist instructions related to this fourth noble truth were that the Eightfold Path needs to be developed. 
And this is what we're working with right here in our practice. 
We're developing this fourth noble truth to support ourselves to learn how not to suffer. 
So let's briefly go through what these eight steps are. 
There is right view or you could call it wise view. 
That is the view that more and more knows don't grasp at things because they're changing all the time. 
That's one aspect of right view. 
And so then there is the intention to live rightly in the world bringing in speaking wisely, acting wisely in the world. 
Living from a place of wise livelihood, wise effort in terms of how we live and act in the world, wise or right mindfulness and wise or right concentration. 
These are the eight steps that we develop in our life and in our practice in order to come to know how not to suffer. 
So knowing these four noble truths is really the crux of our practice. 
It's pivotal to our deepening freedom from suffering or you could say our growing true happiness in the world. 
We're just turning it around saying it a different way. 
This is what the Buddha had to say related to these four noble truths. 
He said to believe that one can realize true happiness without having understood the four noble truths is like trying to construct the upper floors of a house without having first constructed its lower floors and its foundation. 
It is not possible. 
So we come to know and practice, understand these four noble truths by bringing them to life in our practice in our worldly life. 
And in this way we're using our lives in an onward leading way towards freedom from suffering towards true happiness. 
So let's sit together quietly for a moment.
