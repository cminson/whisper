The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So welcome, welcome, welcome everybody.
Such a great thing to be able to practice together.
So thank you to come and be here.
So I recently just finished teaching a loving kindness retreat.
And it was quite something.
It was very tender as you might imagine.
But a number of people at the end commented that
they don't usually necessarily do loving kindness.
And they thought, well, they would do this retreat
to kind of maybe get their practice going.
And at the end of the retreat, they were wondering,
wow, why didn't I do this earlier?
Why didn't I do this earlier in my practice?
Because even though I've been doing all these wisdom
and insight and mindfulness,
just noticing that having a container of warmth,
somebody described it as kind of having this golden gene to everything,
all the practices, makes a difference, makes a real difference.
And so I was reflecting a little bit about this idea of,
what is practice?
How do we think about practice?
And so tonight I'd like to talk a little bit about one way,
not the only way, one way we can think about practice
in kind of a simplified, generalized way.
And to be sure that there are,
I'm like moving towards simplification in this talk.
And to be sure there's ways in which we could really get into the weeds
and make it complicated,
maybe if that's the opposite of simple.
And sometimes I like to do this,
but sometimes it's helpful just to be reminded,
oh yeah, there's a big forest here, not just the trees.
So why is it helpful to sometimes think about simplifying practice
if we find ourselves feeling a little bit stuck?
Like, I don't know, like a dryness,
I'm not sure where this is going,
I'm not feeling inspired,
I'm doing it because I feel like I ought to,
or this is what I have been doing or something,
but if we feel maybe a little bit of stuckness or dryness,
maybe that's perfectly fine,
and that's just part of the season of practice.
But also maybe there's a way in which we can look at it
in this kind of simplified way
and might see if there's a way in which we might look at things
a little bit differently that can provide a support for practice.
So I'm using this word practice,
what do I mean by that?
I would say the way that I'm defining Buddhist practice
is this general, something that supports the movement
towards greater understanding,
either of ourselves or of others,
or how the world works or doesn't work as the case may be,
or this general movement towards greater ease
or peace or happiness,
or a greater diminishment maybe of suffering,
so this elimination of suffering, letting suffering go,
so this movement towards understanding,
ease and less suffering in some kind of broad brush.
So this real simplified way is to think about
there are two types of practices.
One is cultivation practices in which we're creating,
maybe not creating as much as building or developing
or supporting something
to become a little more steady or reliable
or stronger cultivation practices.
And then on this side,
in this simplified way we can think about letting go practices,
shedding, releasing, renouncing, letting go.
So on one side we're kind of like building up,
making stronger, maybe bigger,
we might use those kind of language,
and the other side we're letting go, kind of shedding
and this kind of a different type of movement.
And to be sure we need both types of practices,
kind of this cultivation and this letting go
one way we might understand it is in
Suzuki Rushi's very famous saying,
I don't know how many times I've heard this many,
perhaps you guys have as well,
he has this quote,
each of you is perfect the way you are
and you could use a little improvement.
Kind of this, we might think of it as a paradox,
and one way that we might understand it too is
each of you is perfect as the way that you are.
It's maybe an invitation to let go of anything
that makes you think otherwise.
And you could use some improvement
just to cultivate those qualities or those properties.
Properties doesn't sound quite right,
but those qualities, mind states, experiences
that can really be a support.
So this recognition that this interrelationship
or the dependence on both types of these practices,
but it's not uncommon for people to have a preference
for one type or the other.
And sometimes it has to do with an aversion
towards one type or the other.
For example, this whole idea of cultivating,
building, developing might feel exhausting.
I'm already exhausted from my life.
The last thing I want to hear about
is something that needs to be done more,
something to the addition of.
The last thing I want, no thank you,
I just want to sit quietly.
Or there could be this sense that they find,
it feels a little bit offensive even to imagine
that something needs to be different.
I'm perfect the way that I am
and just the whole rest of the world
needs to start behaving itself.
How dare you kind of suggest
that I need to cultivate something.
So those people tend to prefer
kind of this idea of letting go.
And they might use language like letting be.
But there's also kind of this sense
of I don't want to do letting go practices
because I'm just barely hanging on.
And it takes everything I got just to hang on.
And you're suggesting I let go,
but that's not even,
that's exactly what I don't want to do.
Or there might be this idea that
everything seems so slippery.
So this whole idea of letting go,
but they're feeling like I can't even hold on to anything.
What do you mean let go?
Everything is sliding away.
There's nothing that I can hold on to.
And different people,
different seasons of their practice,
different times of their practice
might kind of have a preference
or one in which they find a little bit more ease
or comfort or that just naturally arises.
So this recognition that both are needed
and there may be times in which we are going
more one direction than another.
And also I'm making this distinction
between cultivation and letting go,
but let's be honest,
it's maybe entirely artificial to make this distinction also
because in some ways they are the same.
The obvious way is we could look at the practice of generosity.
We think of it as a cultivation practice,
but generosity itself is a letting go.
So we're cultivating and letting go at the same time.
That's an obvious example when there are
indistinguishable these two qualities.
But there's another way in which
we could even say with mindfulness practice.
We cultivate mindfulness being here in the present moment
and with the experience,
at the same time in order to do that
we're letting go with all the ways
in which we intentionally distract ourselves.
So this idea of cultivation and letting go
and separating them,
sometimes is useful and sometimes isn't.
But to say a little bit more about
what does it mean, this idea of cultivation practices
that there are many parallels
between cultivating the mind,
cultivating the heart and cultivating a garden.
And one thing is, of course,
that we just don't think about
seeds being planted and watered.
We actually do it.
So it's not only about believing
or thinking or wishing or something about that,
but it's an activity, a certain type of activity.
And cultivation practices are very much like planting seeds.
We plant them
and we give them what they need
without explicitly making them grow.
Seeds have the potential to grow inside them.
We're not giving them that potential.
It's already there.
And we're just creating the conditions
in which that potential can be actualized.
In the case of plants, sun, soil, nutrients, water.
In the case of our practice, attention, intention.
And a willingness to allow things to unfold
in the way that they're going to unfold
instead of insisting that they be a particular way.
So this recognition that we're just taking care of the conditions
rather than the specific making them grow.
And I think all of us recognize that depending on what we value,
we will cultivate different things.
Because no matter what we do,
we're cultivating something with this idea of neuroplasticity.
So if we have this habit of getting filled with outrage
when we hear or see or read the news or something like this,
then the more time we spend in outrage,
the easier it becomes to become outraged.
I'm not saying that these emotions or ideas aren't appropriate,
but I think we all know this,
that whatever the mind frequently ponders upon,
that becomes the inclination.
So not only the mind, but the heart and the emotions.
And so, of course, the Buddha encouraged us
to cultivate those things that are going to be helpful,
that are going to lead us towards this happiness
and greater understanding and less suffering.
And chances are that you don't need me to tell you
this idea that the Buddha encouraged us to cultivate ethical actions,
to behave in the world in a way in which we don't cause harm,
neither to ourselves nor to others,
and sometimes that's not so easy.
So it requires us to see if there might be some creative way
in which we can work with something
in which there really isn't harm being caused.
It also requires us to be sensitive
to maybe some of the subtle ways in which harm gets caused,
with our words, with our language.
And the Buddha also talked about,
maybe before I leave this idea of causing harm,
not causing harm, I'll add this,
also to become sensitive to the ways in which the inner critic
sometimes rises up and causes harm
for the way that sometimes we talk to ourselves
or some of the language or berates ourselves.
It turns out not to be so helpful and harmful.
The Buddha of course also encouraged us to cultivate a steady mind
so that we can see more clearly,
so that we can see what's happening
and see the consequences of our actions,
just allowing the mind and the body to settle.
These days it seems so often that there's these prompts
to get a little bit agitated in some kind of way.
I'm using this word agitated really broadly,
but it seems like we've created a world
in which we're often like poked,
notified, or somehow there's this way
in which we get...
I'm using this word poked, sometimes it feels like that.
Maybe you have a better word,
but the media of course wants to promote
this way of outrage to you.
This idea of to cultivate a steady mind
in the face of this recognition
that there are industries out there
who are created specifically to keep us agitated
in some kind of way.
The business models, they aren't bad individuals,
it's just this recognition that what they are promoting
isn't necessarily for our long-term welfare and happiness,
to sensationalize or to notify or incessantly.
Buddha encouraged us also to cultivate a warm heart,
so a steady mind and a warm heart.
So with Brahmavihara practice, living kindness practice,
the beautiful part about this is not only to cultivate
a sense of warm-heartedness,
but also to have this movement towards the boundlessness
of this warm-heartedness,
so that it's not just for those we know and care about,
those who feel the most comfortable with
or are most familiar,
but to cultivate this way of boundlessness
for all beings everywhere.
And this does take cultivation,
it's not something that humans naturally do.
And this idea too, also with loving kindness
and all the Brahmavihara's compassion,
sympathetic joy, equanimity,
also this unconditionality.
Is there a way that we can express this
without having any sense of whether people
were or deserve it or not?
Taking that out of the equation, just saying,
no, this is what this heart does, this heart loves,
this heart cares, this heart has warmth,
independent of all the specifics,
the particulars of the individuals.
And then of course the Buddha has all these lists,
seven factors of awakening, ten parames.
It seems like there's no end to the things
that we can be developing and cultivating.
But we can get out of balance
if we emphasize this cultivating part.
And I know this has happened to me in my practice,
unknowingly, I felt like,
Buddha's practice kind of supported this self-improvement project
that I wasn't even quite so aware of.
And so, yeah, I got to cultivate this and this and this
and all these handy lists that I never could quite check off.
We can easily fall into that kind of mind state
or understanding of practice.
And to be sure, there are plenty of sutta passages
and teachings that are about the importance of effort and diligence.
But it might be a way in which we just take that on
and say, yes, I'm never going to be finished,
this is a huge project.
I have to keep on working.
And let's be frank,
we are a pragmatic and goal-oriented culture
that we like to put effort into our jobs,
our relationships, our vacations.
Recently, I've learned this expression,
you know, to have relationship goals.
So there's all these ways that we're supposed to achieve
in all areas of our lives.
Which is great, there's nothing wrong with that
and a vision of what's possible
and an orientation of a direction we want to go.
But outside of kind of the Buddhist practice
and outside of the meditation circle,
there can be a sense of, well, just try harder.
If you haven't reached all these goals
or haven't accomplished all these things,
you might have these expectations about.
Try harder, just try harder.
Ouch, right?
This is exhausting.
It seems like there's no end.
So there's all this cultivation
and that is a part of practice
but we can get out of balance.
And we might think that we just have to try harder
and strive and strain.
But then we end up kind of like tight
and I've got this with my body
because it's kind of how it feels.
And then everything feels, you know,
has this flavor of inadequate
and not enough and need more.
So instead we might have that I need more effort,
I need to put more energy in,
I have to try harder.
Without looking at it,
well, maybe there's a different type of effort,
a different type of activity
and that is the letting go,
kind of the releasing
as opposed to acquiring and building
at this movement of letting it go.
So there might be some,
if we call letting go like relinquishment
or giving up or something like that,
that sounds a bit uncomfortable.
It can sound like a renunciation
or surrender which can sound like deprivation.
Like that's not the direction people want to go.
They don't want to feel deprived, of course.
And that's not the direction we're going.
We're not going towards
in a way that has this personal diminishment
or in a way that suggests any type of weakness
that we just have to let go
because we're not able to hold on
or something like that.
No, it's something different.
It's about a,
or like a shedding,
just in the way that snakes shed their skin
when they grow and during the different seasons
that animals shed fur and birds molt feathers.
Just like, oh, it's just a natural thing to be letting go.
It's kind of like this natural process.
And sure, we can see that maybe animals
are scratching a little bit
that fur is shedding and the birds
or when they're molting sometimes are preening a lot to...
So there can be a little bit of uncomfortableness
but still this recognition, like,
yeah, this is the direction we're going.
And something that I like is this story
that's in the Vinaya about Ananda,
the Buddha's attendant.
And after the Buddha died,
they got together,
they being the senior members of the Buddhist followers,
all the fully awakened senior members,
to recite the teachings to get together,
like, okay, what did the Buddha say?
We have to preserve these,
pass it on to different generations.
Ananda, of course, was the one that had memorized them all
because he was the attendant of the Buddha.
But he wasn't awakened completely.
And this was only for awakened people.
So what was he going to do?
So the evening before this big grand meeting,
he's huffing and puffing and striving
to get a weekend.
And all of us have tried to huff and puff
and strive and strain too, I think, right?
This is just part of the way we tend to approach practice.
So he meditated strenuously
and just nothing happened.
So he gave up,
went to bed,
sat down on this bed.
This is how the story goes.
And lifted his feet up to put it in bed.
And before his head hit the pillow,
this big release only became awakened.
So it was when he'd kind of relaxed,
had given up this idea that things have to be a particular way,
was maybe straining and striving and said,
okay, I just can't do it and let go.
And it became awakened.
And I hear about this a lot on retreats.
And myself, I've had this experience too,
that sometimes during a retreat, sit, walk, sit, walk,
for days and days of sitting and walking,
and people can get really tight and be trying so hard.
And sometimes retreats are really hard.
There's maybe something about this,
the transition of finally the bell rings at the end of the set.
Oh my gosh, okay, I made it.
And then they go to stand up.
And just in that moment of kind of relaxing with the standing up,
there may be something that, oh, a new understanding that happens.
So this recognition of letting go
is just a natural thing that happens.
And sometimes it happens just during the transitions.
We're not making it happen.
It's just an unguarded moment
allows the mind and the heart to open in some kind of way.
And to be sure, we let go all the time in daily life.
We change plans, the weather is now raining,
we're not going to have a picnic.
Through our life, our preferences have changed.
I used to hate ketchup when I was a kid.
Ketchup is fine now.
I'm sure all of us have this idea, right,
of things that we didn't used to like.
And we have different priorities in our older life
that we didn't have when we were young.
So it's just this natural thing of just letting go.
And to be sure, learning to let go is a skill for a happy, healthy life.
And so as part of Buddhist practice,
letting go is not only of what makes us tight.
I can't help but I do this with my body when I'm describing it
because this is how it feels.
But there's a way in which there's not only letting go,
but also the compulsion to want to grab on in the first place.
When we notice we have grabbed on, we can open our fist,
but there's this movement of wanting to grab on,
that gets let go too,
that gets softened and diminished as we practice.
This sense of this enduring self,
that's at the center of everything,
that has to be bolstered and protected and highlighted.
And let go of that, let it be softened.
Like, oh yeah, sometimes there's this sense of self,
but other times I'm busy with other things
and there isn't a sense of self.
And this recognition that it arises, it gets constituted,
and then it goes into something else.
Letting go of this sense of an enduring sense of self.
Letting go of ideas being permanent, anything being permanent.
And letting go of the idea that when things are uncomfortable,
that somehow it's a terrible mistake
and there's got to be an error somewhere
and who's to blame for this?
Suffering is part of life.
And I think unfortunately there's only one way
to really learn that is to have suffering.
So what if we kind of reworded or re-languaged
this idea of letting go?
I think I'm not exactly sure where I heard this first.
It might have been from Gil.
But this idea that instead of letting go,
is this idea of giving up.
Like towards the ceiling.
Because I guess the origin of this idea of giving up
is to put up on the altar.
So to make an offering.
This way it's an act of generosity.
Or we might think of it that somehow maybe it's a sacred act.
It's a movement of the heart, this idea of giving up.
And then some ways then it feels like,
oh okay so it's in the service of what's wholesome
and what's virtuous and
how it supports these beneficial states of mind.
And it's in the service of creating this
spiritual well of this inner treasure
inside of us.
Inside of all of us.
So this letting go, this giving up
is one way in which we help create the conditions
for the seeds that we've planted with the cultivating practices
to sprout and to blossom.
So we can let go into something beneficial,
something supportive, wholesome.
So with deepening meditation practice
and we have this greater range of what is wholesome
and beautiful and meaningful.
These inner states that we discover or explore
become more familiar with.
And we just start to recognize, oh yeah
a little bit of letting go here allows me to tap into,
tune into that particular state.
Be sensitive to that state.
Then letting go or giving up
just becomes more and more something that
the mind and the body and the heart just want to do.
So one thing I do want to say also though about letting go,
I'm describing like letting go into beneficial states,
but chances are if you've had a practice
you know that sometimes this letting go
we could also use this language,
I've heard this language, purification cycles.
So it's this sense of letting things get disgorged.
Maybe something that's, I don't know exactly
what's something that maybe we've been holding on to
for a really long time that isn't helpful
or maybe we don't even know what it is,
but a sense of clearing out something uncomfortable
or this sense of discharging or maybe even vomiting up.
Sometimes practice is painful and it feels like stuff comes up
and maybe gets expressed with tears
or gets expressed with nausea or something like this.
So to be sure this letting go part can be uncomfortable.
And we don't always like get to choose or dictate
exactly how it happens or when it happens
or which manner or something like this.
So this idea can maybe sometimes it's helpful to look at our practice
in a simple, simplified way.
Cultivation, letting go.
And maybe to look at in this big ways
if we feel like we could use some support,
maybe just to, is there something that wants to be let go?
Is there something that can be cultivated?
And maybe we don't even have to know precisely the answer
but it's just the activity of asking that question.
Is there something that can be let go
or something that can be cultivated?
Just having that curiosity might be a way
in which we can, I don't know,
something new can unfold
and we can become aware of to help guide us.
So I offer this, maybe a support
for your practice and your life.
This way of cultivating and letting go.
Thank you.
