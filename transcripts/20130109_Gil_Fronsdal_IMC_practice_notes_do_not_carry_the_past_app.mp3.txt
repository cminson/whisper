Practice Note : Don’t Carry the Past

A few words about practicing here this morning, 
both walking and sitting, in whatever way you 
are here. It is useful to consider that every time 
you remember to be mindful , you are starting 
over again. It might happen that your mind 
wanders off and you get distracted and, when 
you notice that, you are ready to begin again, 
breathing with your steps as you walk, being in 
the present momen t. There is no need to carry 
the past with you into starting the practice again. 
And there is a way in which the past becomes a 
bit of a wind drag for us.  
 
The past could be just a second ago when you 
notice the mind wandering off. Instead of 
berating you rself for that, being upset with that, 
deciding that it’s terrible, that is being weighed 
down by the past. Instead, j ust recognize that 
you were lost and caught up in thought, and 
then focus on starting fresh. Every moment can 
be a complete new start. You  don’t have to carry the past with you into the present moment.  
 
Some of you will be weighed down not just by a 
second ago, but by days ago, months ago, years 
ago. And you review  and rehearse long-finished 
conversations, repeating , and trying to figure out 
what happened long ago  –  sometimes   with a 
lot of emotions and feelings about what you are 
thinking about. It is a normal enough thing to do, 
but the idea of mindfulness practice is to sever 
those ties in a caring, loving way so that we are 
not weighed down or held down or limited by 
them. Then we can start each moment 
completely new as if it’s a whole new beginning, 
a fresh start  – as if you ’ve forgiven the past , as if 
the past is no longer here.  
 
Just show up here. Every moment  is a beginning 
of a new year with a fresh start. So, you might 
consider that as you do your practice today; and 
see if that consideration of a fresh start every 
time you remember to enter into the present 
supports you to be here in a full , embodied way.
