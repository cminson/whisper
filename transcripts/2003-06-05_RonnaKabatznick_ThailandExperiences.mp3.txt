 So my name is Rana Kibatsnik and I was invited to come and address Gil, your Sangha this evening and I'm very pleased to be here. I recognize Lewis who I've sat before but most of you are unfamiliar faces so it's very nice to meet you. I've been practicing meditation for about 18 years and Gil has been my teacher for as long as he has been a teacher and I consider him a dear friend and I was at the opening of the center I guess a year ago January so it's so nice to see what's going on in Palo Alto and be part of it and I'm really happy for you that you have the center and you have such a great teacher. As I'm sure you all know you're very lucky as I am too. In March I just returned when I want to apologize Lewis reminded me it was only a half hour sitting I apologize I was kind of conditioned for 40 or 45 minutes so thank you Lewis and I apologize if I if I stretched anybody beyond. I want to talk about tonight the experience I had living in Thailand I just got back in March I was lucky enough to live there for excuse me the past six months I was teaching at a university in the north of Thailand and as a result of being in the country got to experience Asian Buddhism and I thought tonight I would be able to tell you about some of those experiences I have I've had there and I am on my way back in a few weeks to do a long retreat with a teacher I was very fortunate enough to have met and the reason I want to talk about the experience is not so much just to tell you about my experience but to join us all together in the fact that we come from a very long lineage you know we come from our Theravadan Buddhism which we're learning and practicing here in America is rooted in a monastic tradition and I want to just begin by saying how absolutely inspiring that was to be in Thailand and to have the presence of monks you know be so outstanding there are 400,000 monks in Thailand in Thailand 400,000 you know that's a lot of monks and every morning 400,000 monks go on bindabhat they go on alms rounds because the Buddha the one of the rules is that the monks couldn't just hide themselves away in the forest and meditate and kind of be up in their own lala land and they're in their own heads that they had to every day go out into the community and therefore serve as an inspiration to the villagers and be the recipients of generosity so the Buddha established this beautiful circle of generosity because the villagers provide the physical nourishment that the monks rely on and of course the monks provide the spiritual nourishment that the villagers rely on so it's just the most amazing sight to be in a village or a town and see either a half a dozen monks or hundreds of monks as far as the eye could see in some of the cities that I was in you know just these okra robes just you know from the most senior monks to the most junior monks who are absolutely enchantingly adorable because they're about eight or nine and you know and of course there's probably the hungriest and probably get the least because after all the senior people and some people particularly wait just to feed the young monks it's just incredibly inspiring to see and a friend of mine was joking that in America you know we have like 400,000 psychiatrists and like a handful of monks right but in Thailand there's 400,000 monks and a friend of mine has two brothers in her family two out of four of them are psychiatrists and there's only about 500 psychiatrists in the whole country so it's the exact opposite of what we have we have you know a handful of monks and thousands of millions of psychiatrists God only knows how many and psychologists and therapists and to me that is such a revealing fact about the difference between living in a Buddhist culture and living in a Western culture and I'm not here to say what they have is better and we have is worse because obviously you know there's many powerfully positive and wonderful things about the Western culture but there's there's just so much to learn about living in a Buddhist culture and one of them one of the main things and I'm a psychologist by training so obviously that's a bias but to go into a country where psychological thinking just is it's not a value it's not a it's not something that people spend a lot of time thinking about they don't think about themselves so much you they don't when you go to a bookstore the self-health section is not the most dominant section in the bookstore psychiatrists just that in psychology plays a second-hand fiddle to the Dharma and when you go to talk to a teacher to a meditation teacher one of the masters you know they're not interested in finding out about your childhood or your background or what you do or you know how your relationships are going you know I mean you could you could tell them if you wanted but really they want to know you know are you following the precepts where the pressure is in your nose in terms of the breath going in and out what pulls you out you know is it greed anger or delusion and how long does it take you to get back so it's a very you know it helps you when you go into a Buddhist country to realize that the impersonal nature of what the Buddha taught things arise and pass away and in their ownerless they're not ours there's something very powerful about being given a set of instructions and not being reinforced in terms of the things that keep us hooked into our individual personalities and I was constantly amazed by this because as I said my bias being a psychologist and also being trained as a Western Buddhist and how we here you know are subtly or not so subtly talking about ourselves and thinking about ourselves where as everything that I experienced there was was really supporting the message and the teaching of emptiness and of impersonality that you could you have many problems and you have many hindrances and you have many defilements but none of them are yours none of them are yours and so to sit around and talk about the story you know they look at you kind of like weird you know like it's like what a weird thing to do because the idea of emptiness or the notion of emptiness is something everybody understands I mean they may not get it like a master gets it but people because it's a Buddhist country people understand that there are three characteristics and that things that that dukkah that suffering is inherent to the nature of all experience that there's an unsatisfactoriness based on the fact that things arise and pass away and ultimately they don't that your experience doesn't refer back to anyone or anything and so they're empty of any kind of inherent meaning okay things are just the way they are so it's quite inspiring that you know it's even at the university or anybody that you talk to about Buddhism practitioners are not they understand this at least intellectually of course very few people can get it you know get it to the extent you know that they live it like the meditation masters do but it's it's a very beautiful thing when you talk to somebody and you might mention something sad or something difficult and they say dukkah dukkah dukkah it's understood as opposed to my problem you know it's just a support of the first noble truth there's dukkah very beautiful one of the things I was really surprised to find and I don't know why I was so surprised because the people I've known who've lived in Asian countries told me this ahead of time that the monks are so highly revered and so highly respected that a lot of people project that they're doing the practice for all the rest of us and so a lot of people don't meditate a lot a lot of people see you know they give food to the monks or they go to the annual Katina ceremony which is how the villagers once a year support the monasteries and give robes and medicine and grass mats and anything that the food anything the staples that the monastery might need so I was surprised to find that people's own individual practices unlike here you know aren't as strong because they tend to project it onto the monks so I was whenever I went to a monastery and I established to whoever it was I was talking to that I was a meditator you know there's always a lot of reinforcement and a lot of excitement because it's relatively rare and especially as a woman it is a outstanding Lee sexist culture I can tell you that surprise I mean you know it's something I've always known or read about and stuff but it's when you go there and see how highly the monks are revered and the nuns aren't and of course are treated are not of course are treated very differently tremendous gratitude arises for that differentiation that we have in the west I'm happy to say that my teacher that who I met his name is Ajana Nan was outstandingly unbiased and unsexist and I think has the kind of mind that is so highly developed and so pure and radiant that the time I spent with him I really never felt he was looking at me as as a woman or a man or a person or anything it was just I was somebody there with a particular set of constant ideas and constellate in inner constellations and defilements and hindrances that he was going to help me let go of and I never felt for an instant that I was being treated in a discriminatory way and that was so profound for me to meet somebody at that level who whose genuine compassion and loving kindness was so powerful and so strong that it completely overcame you know the divisions that we normally go by and the conventions that we we find so common that we take for granted and it was really one of the most moving experiences of my life because I almost couldn't trust it you know I was waiting for the waiting for something to happen where I would feel kind of like the the marginality that so many people experience but the beauty of meeting a human being where who whose practice is done you know that he doesn't need to uproot any more greed hatred and delusion he's done it it's quite quite you know poignant and powerful and really life-changing which is why I when he asked me to come back and spend some time in the monastery I agreed to go and as I said will be going and when you go to a monastery in Thailand and Asia and Cambodia or Laos you go 100% free 100% you know you are given a place to live you're given clothes you wear women wear mostly all white or you can wear a white top and black skirt you're if you need toothpaste or medicine or hairbrush or comb or whatever you need you're given if it's there and of course all the food that's donated at the monastery comes from what the monks collect on their daily alms round that's also supplemented by the villagers who might come and cook things in the kitchen and there's 100% you know unconditional support for your practice that's how much it's valued and like seeing the monks in the morning who have the trust and the faith that they will go out and receive nourishment for the day similar to that knowing that you can go to a monastery as a man or a woman even though you might be treated differently you will still get that level of support you will be given everything that you need to practice and that is not discriminated upon you know you will you will get a place to stay you will get most of the time you'll get clothing some of them ask you to bring your own and you'll get food and you'll get medicine they will take care of you and nothing is expected nothing is expected it's um the notion or the practice of generosity is so deeply embedded in the system in Asia that um and there's so much trust that it works and there's so much faith that there's a very there's a very relaxed attitude there's a there's an open-heartedness that the system will take care of itself and um I was moved to tears many times by that because as the generosity comes towards you in terms of the teachings and the monks and the nuns as living examples of what the Buddha taught I think that there's just something natural in the heart that opens and that that desire to be generous in response to the generosity that comes forward it's just a natural response there's nothing there's nothing special it's just what it is and even in very poor villages and Thailand's a pretty middle-class country but of course there's many poor people in it just like America's a very rich country and there's many poor people in it and to see you know from the richest to the very poorest and poor meaning these poor rice farmers who may live on you know ten dollars a month or twenty dollars a month you know from the richest to the poorest everybody giving you know everybody giving and coming and offering um to the monastery it's just it's so beautiful so beautiful and there's not a sense that the rice farmer is giving any less than somebody who gives you know thousands of millions of baht to help build a a temple it's not like that it's still it's just it's the act of generosity and uh which I found so moving when you uh in the morning the first and only meal is at between eight and eight thirty which definitely is a challenge I could tell you and after the monks eat the women who are practicing get food and then the villagers could participate as well but while the monks are but right before the monks go and get in their line to that the alms food is all placed out they come back from with their bowls and they it's all organized and then the monks go in order of seniority and take the collected food and put it in their bowls every single day at least at the monastery that I was at every single day the precepts are offered to whoever there to be participating in the meal offering and it's so beautiful to see you know that that's that's integrated into what people experience they're constantly reminded of restraint of guarding the mind by not killing and not taking what's by not taking what's not given by avoiding sexual misconduct harmful speech and intoxicants so and there's a time in the morning where villagers could also make an offering to the abbot or whoever the senior monk is and often on someone's birthday or anniversary or the the anniversary of someone's death somebody will come and again some people make elaborate beautiful platters of fruit and platters of you know fresh fish or whatever and some people just come and bring a flower and offer it make an offering and pay their respects to the abbot very it's so beautiful so moving and its simplicity and it's in its regularity nothing special it's what they do it's a responsibility the villagers feel the responsibility to the monks and of course the monks because of the rules the buddha set up have are very dependent on the villagers because without the villagers they can't eat they're not allowed to have gardens they're not allowed to cook because the buddha said you can't isolate yourself you have to be available to people and so another thing i was constantly aware of was how the abbot or senior monks are like public figures you know they're they're the village kind of owns you so if this is an emergency or there's a death or there's a there's a crisis you know it's like the kaiser emergency room you know everybody comes to the abbot you know the it's the public there's no difference between the public space and the private space the monastery is just open some monasteries have gates because unfortunately there's a lot of property theft in thailand which is very very sad it's a some of them some things are locked but for the most part uh the monasteries are just you know there's no extent it's just an extension of the village some at some point usually they're out in the forest but there's city monasteries which is different than our tradition we come from the forest tradition but there's no appointments there's no uh set schedules there's it's just that you know that people come and look for the abbot and they come for spiritual guidance they come for blessings they come for as i said advice and um it's so beautiful to see that that's the you know we we do we pay 150 an hour or something to see some psychologist or psychiatrist or social worker whatever they go see the abbot they go talk to the they go talk to the senior monks and one time when i was there and i i left and this car pulled up and somebody came with their sick child you know it's it's a little bit like an emergency room people coming and going and asking for blessings and making offerings and it's it's a busy life it's not so much um like your vision of everybody just sitting around meditating and and going between walking and sitting which happens um for sure and that's a big part of what the the forest monks do but their primary responsibility you know is to is to help people and the and the buddha actually said which i think is so beautiful and as much as i love silence and and i i know that many of you probably had the experience of enjoying and really being nourished by silence but the buddha didn't believe in in going into silence 100 because he said then you can't help people you know as a as a um as a spiritual practitioner that's your responsibility and it's quite beautiful to see when that when um people come for your assistance and you see that how available they are and again i don't speak thai i speak i mean i understand and speak nitnoy as they say very little um but when i had friends translating again it's you know people come with all kinds of crises but the advice isn't so much um on giving guidance about um the issue per se it's helping people to see you know that there is dukkha that whatever they're going through it will change and ultimately it is ownerless and not theirs so always within the context of the dharma and you know you might think well i know what he's going to say you know so what's the point you know i know he's going to say same old for noble truths you know same old you know are you keeping the precepts same old precepts but there's something so beautiful and so powerful about somebody who has embodied the buddha's teachings and who's living that life of restraint and it's a hard life no question who says it from his or her heart so it's not it's not just an automatic response like pushing a button and you're going to get like the anicha tape it's not like that um when i went down to see my teacher um after a friend of mine uh very sadly killed herself and i was just devastated by it just devastated you know that just feeling we just my heart was just ripped apart and um i didn't unlisten very compassionately very open-heartedly and at some other point in another conversation uh he said very gently very gently kau kauanata kauanata which means enter emptiness enter emptiness and it was so startling to me you know i mean like you know he he saw that i was holding on very stiffly to that suffering it was so painful you know that i was holding it in a very rigid way and i could just feel in that moment not that i could enter emptiness like that you know i mean wouldn't that be nice um but it helped release my suffering heart to know i didn't have to i didn't have to own it it's not mine anyway so the simplicity of the teachings especially when you don't know the language um is and also was a very powerful experience for me because um um ties don't have such an elaborate language like we do we have so many words for so many things one of the things that i really loved and uh because you pick up these basic expressions this one expression let's it basically means i understand kau jai and literally it means kau means enter and jai is heart so when you say somebody kau jai ka that's what a woman would say ka for woman kap for men kau jai ka it entered the heart it's very beautiful you know that's that's so it's not an intellectual understanding when someone says kau jai it's it means it entered it enters the heart and jai is a very common word it's used all the time if somebody is angry they say jai ron means you have a hot heart if somebody is um uh someone's called uh jai yan it's a cold heart kind of cool and if you're if you're getting kind of all hot and bothered they'll say jai yan yan like cool down cool down your heart very beautiful or you're in a store or a restaurant and you're looking for something and very very gently someone say you know tam jai tam jai all these people are saying that to me i said to my friend what is that it means follow your heart so you're in a restaurant a waitress or somebody was it tam jai follow your heart you're in a store follow your heart very beautiful very simple they don't have pronouns which is also very interesting considering you know it's uh it's a culture that that um asks people to consider the empty nature of things the more we say i and me and mine and ours right we're supporting that that illusion but there you there's words for i and you but they're not very they're not used very much it's kind of understood if you say um kao jai it just means entered the heart you don't say i and it entered my heart so again the impersonality is built into the language into the culture um at one time i i was feeling very uh frustrated with the job i had and i was talking to a friend of mine who was a monk who's australian and uh he was saying that advice often that is given at the monastery for people who are having a hard time again it's not to get into the the storyline of what the difficulty was but oftentimes you're just reminded to follow the five precepts or follow eight precepts and uh i was so outstandingly moved by the fact that most of the culture even though it's a pretty weird culture because it has such extremes of this the highest level of virtue you know in in monasticism and then there's child prostitution and heavy duty drug trafficking and heavy duty aids population but nevertheless with those two extremes visible everywhere everybody knows what the five precepts are everybody knows and i don't know maybe people do know what the ten commandments are i don't think i could probably get all ten i probably could but um but everybody knows what the five precepts are and uh that's really nice i mean and to be reminded without having to go through them all you know what i mean just whatever your problem is you know recommit to following the precepts it's a beautiful piece of advice and again impersonal not related to what my issues are and my problems and my struggling and my you know because we can always fine tune the precepts we can always fine tune them or um see them in terms of uh where in the where where in the first three noble truths this falls the issue falls and then kind of pick your path pick what you want to do in terms of the solution in terms of the um prescription that's going to make you better um which are the the factors of the eightfold path very beautiful so it's so integrated and people know and people know what you're talking about um one of the things that gill has said many times and many dharma talks that i've heard him give is how america uh needs to become more more buddhist kind of and less american and i think this is one of the ways that this could be accomplished that um the i think what what he means and i've talked to him a little bit about this is that somehow in our country we're so busy on being individuals and we're so busy having our own opinions and we're so busy um trying to count right and uh i think in in a more in a buddhist culture not a more buddhist culture but in some in cultures that really um buddhism is their primary religion the the teachings are first you know and our our relationship to them is our responsibility our opinions about them really don't matter you know they don't really matter and people aren't so interested in your opinions that was the other thing that really surprised me as a teacher i've taught in many universities here and i guess i've just gotten used to everybody having their own opinion they like this assignment they don't like the assignment could they do the assignment differently could they hand it in another time i mean everybody's arguing with you about something or other when you teach here as i said i've taught at many universities now i'm not saying this is better or worse but i was shocked shocked at whatever i said people did and it wasn't such blind obedience i mean you could say in the one hand maybe it was i don't know but i gathered after living there for a number of months that um people just aren't used to giving their opinions whether they like it or not or whether they want to do it or not you know it's not it's not reinforced like it is here you know um you're just not asked what your opinion is very often you know uh the most common question i was asked about in terms of my opinion was what do i think of typhoon people ask me that all the time and the other trick question was what do i think of the king and both answers by the way you have to just give outstandingly positive you know resoundingly exceptionally high praise to the food and the king otherwise people look at you like really weird um but as i said people's uh sitting around and talking about what you think about something it's not so much something that people do all the time they may talk about a topic but it's not so much my opinion about the topic that that was probably the most surprising thing to me because i think that coming from an individual culture like america um where people's opinions are so valued that nothing gets done a lot of times you're just like in the standstill because everybody has an opinion um it was very surprised it was very liberating not to talk about my opinions actually i really liked it because it's tiring having opinions it's one of the things that that the buddha tells us to let go of you know it's part of self view you know fixed views and opinions and uh and we have opinions about everything you know we can have opinions about air you know about you know the most insignificant thing we can come up with an opinion about it and uh to be living around people who don't really care about your opinions it's it really it's eye-opening it's really eye-opening and i loved it um it's one of the things i noticed when i came back about here came back and um i listened to more opinions and it was and to the extent that i i was and continue to try to be able to try to really see it as a form of suffering my own opinions and the opinions of others and uh to really try to use it as a teaching that fixed views and opinions about who's right and who's wrong what's the best or what's the worst um and these kind of polar ways we tend to think that support the self and just create suffering um really deserves a lot of compassion because it's so conditioned in our minds and so it's not something to judge and i really try to be as gentle and as kind as i can to it and just to really see how how we constrict ourselves and i constrict myself around that and um one of the things i'm really looking forward to and going back is um not talking about my opinions because i know no nobody's gonna care nobody's gonna care nobody's gonna understand me anyway so that helps when nobody's gonna understand your opinions and then they wouldn't even care if they did um because i did enjoy that being a tremendous liberation and tremendous teaching for me and seeing how uh how much we have to learn in the west and hoping and praying and on my knees that uh that's something that i could work on within myself to help end suffering and as i said it there's a tremendous paradox and irony that i saw in the culture because there is this beautiful sense of restraint among uh many of the people i met in terms of following the precepts and embodying the dignity that comes from that restraint and then as i said this this culture that has uh i think one of the highest aids populations in the world um we actually went to a funeral of one of the my colleagues at the university whose 33 year old sister died of AIDS and she left an orphan her husband had infected her he had been with a prostitute and came home and slept with his wife and she was he died and then she was infected and then she died and it's very very common all over we i was teaching at a university but my husband and i were also taught some nurses at a hospital in the town that we were living in and we asked as an english exercise what's the biggest problem you face and it was so sad to hear you know AIDS and uh young girls being sent to Bangkok and to the major cities throughout Thailand um at 12 13 14 years old to become prostitutes and bring money back to the village um and then contracting AIDS and then spreading it all over and we were in you know a town wasn't big but it was devastated by AIDS um so the child prostitution industry is enormous uh there's also a big drug drug industry and trade and problem with Yaba which is i think like a form of ecstasy and unlike marijuana and heroin which were huge huge productions in southeast asian you know millions and millions of dollars were made from those productions where you could see them from airplanes and helicopters Yaba's manufactured in labs that are of course invisible and have really infiltrated the country um to a pretty miserable degree and uh there's always articles in the paper about people you know having nervous breakdowns and uh going crazy and uh having people give elephants Yaba to keep them awake and rice farmers using Yaba so they can work harder at night and then of course the teenagers who use it just for um the the sociability or the the sensuality of it um and it's so sad you know that it's um elephants getting it you know so they can work harder in terms of uh logging uh and it's so much part of the culture you know everybody everybody knows what it is and everybody knows that you know people who've been affected by it and um because i'm a psychologist uh a friend my friend's one of the brothers so i told you two out of the 400 psychiatrists in thailand are my friend's brothers one of them runs a psychiatric hospital in chiang mai and um he asked me if i'd be available at some point if you know because if these whacked out americans or westerners came in on Yaba would i be would i be able to help them and talk to them he never he never called me in the time i was there um they usually don't go to psychiatric hospitals they usually just go to the regular hospitals but uh i thought how sad you know how sad at this drug these drugs are so available and um of course undermine and ruin any culture never mind a buddhist culture where intoxicants that cloud the mind or you know is the free and restraining from them is considered the free is that is the fifth precept and so important if you're trying to train your mind and to see that and to understand from reading the papers and talking to people a little i can understand because their english level is awful but the little i can understand um listening to people talk about how um so many people have been miserably impacted by that drug and how it's getting easier uh to get and cheaper because there's a competitive marketplace so there's aids there's there's the child prostitution and there is there's there are drugs that's the kind of dark side underbelly uh but i just can't say enough that the context of the country where you see monks everywhere you know monks are just part of the natural landscape bus stations and on the subway and um in the villages and the towns they're just they're just there that these are you know again living examples of what the buddha taught it's just so inspiring i mean when i sadly think that half the priests we know are in jail i mean not that we know personally but you know in our country the clergy isn't such dis dis what's it disrepair just disrespect just this whatever um and there are problems with monks there are definitely you read sad articles um and you see some monks smoking and you see some monks carrying money but the forest monks the forest monks ajum jimney and it'll be here saturday who's a forest monk who wear the okra robes versus what i call the kulade robes these very shocking uh orange robes i have a very the city monks with the orange robes are very different than the forest monks in the okra robes and the forest monks really have knock on wood been able to maintain a pretty uh extraordinary sense of purity and virtue in the country it's not flawless nothing is um but you don't see forest monks handling money you don't see them eating after after 12 noon which is the cutoff point for eating solid food and um you see them maintaining and embodying the precepts and it's it's very inspiring and people are incredibly respectful of that and when i did see monks and again not the forest ones but the city monks uh eating ice cream or handling money uh as buddhas you know we feel sad you know it's sad when when someone's visibly breaking the precepts um that the buddha laid down 25 or 2600 years ago and um you know you feel somehow it it tarnishes all of us when that happens and of course that reflection is can be said about when anybody lies or steals or anything even though it may not be as visible as a monk handling money when any of us break a precept you know it tarnishes all of us and um because we understand the truth of interdependence that there really is no separation so when the monks maintain that kind of virtue you know you feel supported by it and similarly when they don't you feel diminished by it which is the same of why we why there's a sangha you know the sangha is the third jewel of the triple gem why is there a sangha because we're here to support each other and so anything that we do that's virtuous and meritorious elevates us all and anything that we do that's un-virtuous or un-meritorious you know diminishes us all and I could see that very clearly um with a monk because monks are you know robed we're not but we still have that invisible connection because we've all made that commitment as as practitioners to wake up and use the the the precepts as the foundation of our morality which is the foundation of happiness I guess the last thing I want to say is that I say this is from a psychological point of view that I learned so much from um following the guidance of a teacher there and feeling fortunate enough to meet a teacher that uh I just want to say that I think we're so extraordinarily lucky you know the Buddha said just to be born a human being is extraordinary and then to be born a human being who meets encounters Buddhism is lucky and uh I guess I just feel that more strongly even even although I felt it very strong before I left I feel it even stronger now that um the vehicle and the tools that we've been given to create the causes of happening of happiness and the tools that we see that we know um or the the skills or the the lack of skillfulness that we know are the causes of suffering you know just those two teachings that the Buddha saw you know these are the things that you do that make you happy these are the things that you do that make you unhappy I mean this is incredible that that we're you know that he tells us here's the map this is what you have to do to follow this is going to make you happy this is going to make you unhappy how lucky we are and I know everybody knows that and I know I'm I'm not saying anything that you haven't heard before I'm just saying it from my own point of view that was made all the more outstanding because the the tradition is so vibrant and alive in Thailand and here here we're just kind of starting we're in the we're in the baby phase you know and how lucky we are to know and to encounter the teachings and to use them as the anchor for our lives which are very precious and you know are made all the more strong and virtuous by the practice of Buddhism and to meet teachers whose practice is honestly done you know they've they've penetrated the nature of reality and understand the nature of the mind and heart you know as I said change you know it just changed me changed me on a very deep level because you see what the fruition of practices you feel the meta you feel the meta field of these masters you feel their infinite compassion for all beings and their genuine hope their genuine prayer you know that we find the causes of happiness and we avoid the causes of unhappiness and how beautiful how simple how beautiful how simple yet so hard you know the the doubt the doubt of ching said these teachings are easy but following them is very difficult but at least one part's easy teachings are easy but following they're difficult so I'm filled with a lot of gratitude filled with a lot of excitement about returning feel filled with a lot of inspiration that of what we're doing in America what gill is doing here and in redwood city with everybody here and that every breath we take that's mindful every step we take that's mindful every action we take them is mindful you know helps liberate you know all beings everywhere and to see living examples of that it's a beautiful reinforcement and reminder of what we're doing and why we're doing it especially now and these very troubled times on every level to be committed to the practice and to know and to know that that liberating the heart is possible you know it's this tremendous honor it's also tremendous responsibility it's like there's no going back you know you can't once you know the causes of suffering and the causes of of happiness it's not like it's it's hard to forget so um may whatever merit that accumulates from this talk be for the benefit of all beings everywhere thank you are there any questions yes can you just review the five precepts sure um the first precept is we undertake the the precept to um to respect all living things beings and to refrain from killing so it's we refrain from taking any form of life from the smallest insects to you know human beings um the second precept is to uh to to only take what's given and so to not steal set set in the positive is to only only take what's given and not take what's not given the third is to avoid sexual misconduct and that means usually adultery or kind of misuse of sexuality unskillful exploitation in relationships whether married or not um the fourth precept is to uh avoid false and harmful speech so uh lying exaggerating uh slander or swearing uh ugly speech and the fifth precepts uh precept is to avoid in taking intoxication intoxicants that cloud the mind so um even to the extent of that lovely glass of wine or ice cold beer or whatever that the buddha said don't do it or obviously illegal substances because uh our goal or what we're trying to attain is clarity of mind so we try to avoid things that that cloud the mind unnecessarily the buddha said we have enough clouds in her mind through greed hatred and delusion we don't need to do it by the way i i i used to love my glass of wine and certainly i used to love an ice cold beer and i stopped uh drinking because i you know for my practice sake and um it's not that i don't miss it i do but i you know i'm really i really enjoy the restraint of saying it's what's a glass of wine compared to you know really maintaining the precept that's so much more nourishing and satisfying to me even though believe me i loved i loved having my wine and and and um occasionally miss it uh but it's it's so and it's an easy thing to do for me compared to the the benefit i get from not doing it you know it's such a it's um i think to me it's the least i can do you know and as i said i i i in the whole i don't miss it and when i do it's easy to get myself straightened out by saying why cloud the mind it's clouded enough so those are the five main precepts when i go to thailand i also follow three others which are to avoid wearing any kind of jewelry or things that adorn the body no makeup i think i'm allowed to wear i think i can have a watch and a wedding band but you're not supposed to wear necklaces and um perfume scents anything to adorn the body is is against uh i think this it's either the sixth seventh or eighth precept and the other one is um to not eat after noon i know that's hard that's really hard um but since what does water you're like there's allowables which include peculiar things like chocolate which ends up in a puddle because it's about 10 000 degrees there it's a tropical country you're allowed chocolate you're allowed ginger so there's all kinds of ginger candies and you're allowed um cheese yeah peculiar things and water and tea and sugar and soy milk not regular milk and then the other precept is not to uh lie on anything that's high and luxurious which for somebody like me who loves a comfortable bed it's not easy to be on the grass mat floor i take a little um kind of one of the serma rests with me when i go to the monastery but uh the idea is to not get lost in the delusion of comfort you know because you you tend to sleep you tend to let lay around in bed a little longer if the more comfortable it is for not eating after noon what's the rationale for that it's a form of restraint it's a form of restraint that um and and it's also an acknowledgement that there uh that physical nourishment is is an important component of keeping the body alive but really keeps your heart going is the spiritual nourishment and practice and so food is given less important is considered just something that nourishes your body for your practice and uh it's a hard one i struggle with it a lot because i get hungry or my mind gets hungry because i'm i'm working on my conditioning of three meals a day and wanting wanting wanting wanting wanting so it's hard i was curious also about the eight and strangely enough i had a different list and so i wonder what was that the eating i think is common to them but i had heard two others rather than about adornment about not um indulging in music or theater right is that essentially i think so you know and i don't want to um uh i think that is one that is definitely one of them that you don't go to the movies and you don't listen to rock and roll right well that's that's part of that's part of sleeping on oh that's part of yeah that's part of sleeping not not sleeping on a high bed yeah i practiced in the forest within in the forest uh i i've met a monk at a bayagiri the monastery up in redwood valley who's australian and i got in touch with him and uh i went to his the monastery he was staying at and that's where i met ajana nun the teacher i'm going to be going to see and practice with and which was in the forest this particular monastery is in southern thailand i was living in northern thailand and i also practiced in a forest monastery near near quite near the university i was teaching at so and any other question you know for some reason i thought we ended at 9 30 i guess i didn't read my i i apologize for not being very mindful about the the times and i hope ask for your forgiveness so and i hope you'll come to see ajan junyan on saturday's very special forest monk who comes to the states once a year and it's really a great blessing that he'll be here on saturday thank you very much may may we all be happy
