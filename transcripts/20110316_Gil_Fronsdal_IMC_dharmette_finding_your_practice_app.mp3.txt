Dharmette : Finding Your Practice

It may be  interesting for you to hear a little bit about the 
beginning of my own meditation practice , and what was 
important for me as the foundation for what followed . I 
started meditation  when I was pretty young, may be 19 
or 20. It was a bit halting ly at first, and then when I think  
I was  22, as a college student , I started doing Zen 
meditation every day : twice a day for 40 minutes. I’d get 
up in the morning and sit , and before I went to bed at 
night I would sit. Zen was how  I was introduced to 
meditation, which  was not much of an introduction . They 
don’t teach you much in Zen. I didn’t really know much 
abou t Buddhism , and certainly not much about 
meditation. I didn’t  know about concentration or even 
mindfulness. I had no idea that anything  was supposed 
to happen when you meditate  – some  state s of deep 
calm or insight. I had n’t even picked up the  idea that I 
was supposed to stop thinking.  
 
I thought  Zen meditation was the unconditional 
acceptance of the present moment – just accept this 
moment. So certainly I was aware of how much my 
mind wandered off , and with acceptance in it wandering 
off, I’d come back and be with this moment, be with this moment, and be with this moment. In Zen, you’re 
supported by a particular posture you hold, and I was 
often coming back to the breath as a stabilizing force , or 
a place to be here.  
 
I had no idea that I was supposed to be any different 
than what I was. In many ways there  was nothing 
dramatic to report. There weren’t  dramatic states of 
concentration, peace, joy, bliss, or some of the things 
that people associate meditation with. But it  became 
very important for me . What I discovered was that in 
that radical, unconditional acceptance of things as they 
are in the moment was a sense of what I called at the 
time ‘integrity ,’ and perhaps ‘wholeness ,’ and that just 
being alive and here is enough . There was nothing to 
resist, fight, or try to  obtain  or get. I could feel whole or 
complete as I was , without having to change anything 
about myself. It was almost as if a container was 
created that would hold who I was , and everything  that I 
was as I was, but now there was a container that h eld it. 
What  was comes to mind is that it was like a ping -pong 
ball bouncing inside a container , and  earlier in my life I 
was the ping -pong ball bouncing off the walls. Now I’ve 
become the container , and so it was okay  to bounce 
around. I wasn’t troubled by the bouncing ball, because 
it was being held by something bigger.  
 
Meditation  wasn’t a project , or a self-improvement  thing. 
It wasn’t trying to obtain something  or become  a better person. It wasn’ t proving  myself in the eyes of other 
people . It wasn’t  avoiding some part of me or pretending 
I was different than who I was. It was just whatever was 
here. Whatever  I was was somehow accepted  and held  
in a certain way so that I felt integrity, wholene ss, 
completeness, or peace with it all. That sense of 
integrity I exp erienced was very important for me. At 
some point it dawned on me , when I was 23 or 
something , that my mind was the same mind whether I 
was sitting in meditation , or not in meditation but in daily 
life. And so why should I have this integrity just in 
meditation ? Shouldn’t I have this same thing in my daily 
life as well?  Then  I became very interested in how could  
I be that same way in my daily life. That became my 
exploration , and the growing edge of my practice.  
 
As I continued my practice , that integrity and sense of 
just being there with what is  – and the peace and 
freedom of that – seemed to give independen ce from 
any ideas o f obtain ing or getting anything . This  
supported me tremendou sly when I was introduced to 
Vipassana practice  in Thailand and then in Burma.  
Especially in Burma , there was kind of a goal -oriented 
approach – something   to obtain and get . The teacher 
was waiting for you to report the changes. Sometimes I  
was even told , “Strive, strive…” I felt very fortunate that I 
didn’t buy into that , because  I had this background of 
radical , unconditional acceptance of things . When  I 
heard the instructions , I think I followed them  pretty well. They were interesting for  me. But I followed the 
instructions of mindfulness not as a way to get anything . 
It was a way of practicing the unconditional acceptance 
better. One of the things I discove red in doing 
Vipassana practice  was how incredibly subtle the mind 
is – all the sma ll, teeny movements of nonacceptance, 
resistance, wanting, hating, fear, and anxiety. The mind 
was always moving , and not at peace with how things 
were at the moment. As I saw the subtlety of it, then the 
instructions  of mindfulness  – pay more careful atte ntion  
– support ed and help ed me  to see that I could be more 
thorough in this unconditional acceptance of the 
moment.  
 
In doing that , I found that the mind settles more and 
more , and that some of the states of deeper 
concentration and insight are a byproduct , and  they 
happen in their own time. It wasn’t like I was straining to 
try to see  or get into deep states. If they happened – 
great – and if they didn’t happen , that wasn’t exactly the 
point.  
 
I know that some people who meditate make meditation 
too much of a project. They’re trying to o hard to prove 
themselves. Or some people feel like there is something 
wrong with them , and meditation is how they’re going to 
perfect themselves, make themselves right, make 
themselves look right in the eyes of othe r people , or 
somehow become a worthy person . There  is an investment in meditation much more than is need ed – 
trying  to get or obtain something , or to prove one’s self. 
Sometimes  that whole approach adds to the kind of  
alienation  or suffering that people have because we’re  
stepping away, pulling away or resisting . We’re 
somehow not at peace with how things actually are. For 
some people the route of just  being at peace with how 
things are is a very powerful door that is important to 
open. 
 
Sometimes  in the Vipassana world , there is a saying 
that we’re not trying to have a new e xperience, but 
we’re trying to hold, see, or be present  for our 
experience in a new way. That’s  a wonderful saying 
because , rather than trying to go beyond what’ s 
happening,  there is some wonderful secret,  key or 
specialness about “This is what’s happening.  Okay , now  
how can I see it and be with it in a way that is freeing ? 
How can I be with it in a way that brings peace ?” – as 
opposed to , “This is what’s happening. Now what can I 
do to make it better or different, or to  change  it, or fix it?” 
For some people , it’s very powerful to step back and 
say, “I’m not going to change  anything, but how can I 
relate to this in such a way that I find my peace with it , 
whatever  it might be ?” 
 
So maybe some of those words are intere sting for you 
to consider, but t hen maybe not. Please also  consider 
that there are many approaches to practic e. All of them are wonderful in their own time and place in the right 
person. So you have to find your own way with this. But 
if my example of how it was for me in my early years is 
helpful, that would be nice.
