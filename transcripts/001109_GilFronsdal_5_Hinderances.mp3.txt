 So, it's important to remember that mindfulness practice is much more than simply a meditation on becoming calm or relaxed. You might, in the course of doing mindfulness meditation, become calm and relaxed and the mind might quiet down some. And that's very nice. But an important element of mindfulness is the element of investigation. To be able to start noticing and investigating and seeing more clearly what's going on with you, what's happening. Some people arrest, kind of indulge almost in pursuing some calm state and they don't really notice what's actually happening and what are the common themes and common areas they get tripped up on. So, to spend some time emphasizing the investigation of our experience is important. And certainly when a person does a meditation practice, there's often a very different perspective that's available to see our lives, to understand our lives. And this is one of the reasons why people do meditation, is for this new perspective. So, for example, if the mind is racing around, if you're racing around being very busy, doing many things, the mind gets kind of habituated to being very busy and the mind is skipping ahead and concerned what's happening or what did happen. And as long as the person stays busy, as long as the person stays actively involved, they might not notice how busy their mind has gotten, how reactive their mind has gotten. I talked to someone today who was doing too many things and was very stressed about getting things done and had all kinds of obligations to fulfill. And the person kept repeating kind of frantically, kind of almost out of like a robot to me. Oh, I can't talk to you, I can't do anything for you right now because I can't talk to you right now because I have so much to do, I have so much to do, I have so much to do. And a number of times the person said, I have so much to do, it was so repetitive, you know, it was like this compulsivity of the mind was operating, the person wasn't really settled on themselves, it was the person's stress which was speaking, not the person's clarity. So the mind can be quite busy and very compulsively involved. And then when we sit down to meditate, it can become that stopping and that kind of beginning to pay attention to what's going on, that stopping and bringing the attention, trying to bring the attention to the breath begins to interrupt, begins to put a different means to interrupt the momentum of the mind. And then one of the first things a person might notice is the degree to which this momentum is there. They wouldn't have noticed it if they continued being very busy. But if you sit down and be quiet, one of the things some people will notice is, lo and behold, there's all this tension in the body, all this tension in the mind, all this preoccupation and racing of the mind. And it can feel uncomfortable sometimes to feel that. But the alternative to go back into that world of busyness, which in some sense is more pleasant because you become numb, is not considered to be very useful to do, but rather what's useful is just allow the insight, that understanding of what's actually happening to you grow until you begin settling down. So the stopping, if it begins to pay attention to the breath, becomes a reference point to help us see more clearly what's going on in our lives. One of the very common experience that people have when they do mindfulness meditation is that it's not always so easy. Well, certainly easy to pay attention in the moment what's happening if you remember, but then the mind will be pulled off very easily to distractions and to concerns and thoughts and to feelings. And a person can fall into these kinds of thoughts and either completely lose their presence of mind and be lost in planning or fantasy or remembering or whatever for minutes at a time. Or they might kind of vaguely have a feel like they're kind of present for the breath or something, but really if they're honest they would have to admit that 90% of their attention is taken up in their thoughts and not really very present at all. So it's very easy for people then to become discouraged when this happens, to feel, oh, I'm not doing very well here. It's universal for human beings, for their minds to want to take up concerns, universal for the mind to be distracted and to wander off into all kinds of things. It's not even necessarily a personal failing that the mind does this. The mind wants to think about things, the mind wants to be preoccupied by things. Rather than taking it as a discouragement, you should take it as an area of investigation, as food in a sense for your meditative inquiry. So the Buddhist tradition has a list called the Five Hindrances. And these five hindrances are the five most common preoccupations. They make it difficult for people to be present. And one of the things we need to learn to do in mindfulness practice is not to be really good necessarily at holding on to the breath or holding on to the present moment. What we need to do is become really good at identifying the five hindrances. We get really good at noticing when we get swept up in a preoccupation. And what are the common preoccupations that can to sweep us up when we get lost in? And to really see what those are. So rather than taking a movement away from presence as being a bad sign, rather than thinking, oh, this is unfortunate and this is, you know, I'm doing it wrong. It's very important to think of these things as being here's an opportunity for us to learn more about the nature of these hindrances, to learn more about the nature of what tends to... Oh, thank you. What tends to preoccupy us? So the five hindrances are usually listed this way. Desire, aversion, restlessness and anxiety, sloth and torpor and doubt. So these are the common forces that tend to keep people from getting concentrated or focused. We tend to very easily get lost in fantasies of desire, what we want. It can be as simple as wanting a better or comfortable posture, wanting a better cushion to sit on. It can be wanting a better... better clothes to sit in. Why did I choose to sit in these kinds of clothes today? If I wore white instead of red, I probably would have... My meditation would have been better. So it can be all about what's happening in the present moment, but it could also be the desires can be about things and nothing to do with the present moment. We can get caught up in desires for food, for sex, for recreation, for entertainment, for relationships. It's all kinds of things we might want. The mind is a very powerful tendency to want things. And when the mind starts getting involved with wanting, it's very seductive, very tempting for us to follow through on that desire. Not necessarily do it, but to kind of get involved in fantasies about the desire. And now a sexual desire can be quite dramatic, right? Because here we get lost in some wonderful, you know, wonderful sexual fantasy. And it's very pleasing. It's very pleasant often to do that. And it's part of the reason why people get lost in is they're captivated by the pleasantness of those fantasies. However, it's still being lost. It still kind of mind wanders off into something. Aversion is kind of the opposite of desire. So it could be something about what's happening in the present moment. Rather than thinking about how can I get a better cushion to sit on, because this one doesn't seem to be working and fantasizing about what's the ideal cushion to sit on. Mostly you're concerned about how you're going to destroy the cushion you're sitting on. What an awful cushion that is, and how could you end up with this? And why are you such a poor chooser of meditation cushions? You went to that store and had those cushions, and how could you pick red? You cushion. I'm sure your meditation would have been a lot better if you'd chosen blue. And how, you know, then the aversion is directed towards yourself. So there can be a version about something in the present moment, and often just a flip side of desire. Or it can be a version about something which is not here at all. You can have all kinds of various opinions about what happened in Palm Beach. And there could be a lot of, you know, aversion towards particular strategies, as some people are trying to do. And that aversion has a certain energy and excitement, and so the mind goes off into that excitement, that energy. And it's not, the temptation is nothing because it's so pleasant, but just maybe because it's so energetic, so captivating. So the mind will go off into fantasies of aversion. They can get lost in there, sometimes for days at a time. Then there can be restlessness and anxiety. It's been said that we're an anxious culture, and so that anxiety is common for many of us. Anxiety takes the form of fear, takes the form of worry, takes the form of my anxiety. And restlessness is kind of like, anxiety is more like the mental side of it. And restlessness is the physical side of it, kind of the mind, the body doesn't want to sit still. You might be sitting here and you feel like your legs are just ready to bolt out through the door. And it's, you know, it feels like a rodeo. I know sometimes it is that way for people. It's very difficult sometimes to sit still because the restlessness is so strong. Sometimes it's a successful period of meditation. The only measure of it, whether it's as successful as it is, is the fact that you were able to sit through the half hour. Forget about getting calm or being present. The energy of restlessness was so powerful, so overwhelming. The fact that you were able to hang in there and not bolt is a really good sign. And so we tend to get caught up. Restlessness is very seductive or very tempting, anxiety, because we get pulled into its world of restlessness and anxiety. We get captivated by it. Anxiety often can lead to a lot of future planning. And so we get pulled into the world of planning, how are we going to protect ourselves or how are we going to make it better or something, trying to alleviate the anxiety. Sloth and torpor is a kind of a funny word because we know it, use it in English, usually. I mean, how many was last time you said you told someone you felt slothful. But sloth and torpor is sloth is understood to be more the physical side and torpor more the mental side of the same thing. And this is not just simply sleepiness or being tired, but certainly can make being attentive difficult. But sloth and torpor is a kind of a resistance of the mind, a boredom of the mind, a sinking of the mind, a discouragement of the mind that sets in. And so the mind kind of feels heavy or dull, cloudy, sludge like, hazy. You can't really see anything. The mind kind of, you can't seem to kind of bring up the mind to kind of do anything. It just feels kind of heavy or the body just feels so lethargic. And that can make it very difficult to be present when those things arise. And sometimes they're kind of indulging or they're kind of a resistance. We indulge in a kind of resistance to life. I call it my seer's mind because when my mother, when I was 10, 11 took me to seer's department store to go shopping for clothes. I hated it. And I'd be fine before we were going to go. But once we got into the store, I would be so windy and so tired and oh, I can't do this. Can we sit down? You know, and I would just be, you know, just was so difficult. I'd be so heavy. Every every step was heavy. And then as soon as we left the store, and if my mom said, you know, you like some ice cream or something, you know, then there was no, no tiredness there. It was just had a lot to do with my resistance. My fact I didn't want to be there. One didn't want to do that. And then doubt is also a very tempting place to get lost in. It said that doubt is the struck is potentially the most dangerous of the hindrances because doubt often comes with a very strong belief. We doubt our abilities, we doubt our activity, what we're doing, we doubt all kinds of things. And so we might get up and leave the meditation entirely. We doubt this is a very good time to do the meditation. You know, why did I choose seven o'clock in the evening or Thursday to do it? I could be home watching the news, you know, and finding out what's happening there in Palm Beach. I mean, you know, that would be really that isn't that more important? And so then this doubt sets in. And but also no self doubt is a very powerful distracter from being present. We doubt that whether we can do it, and then we get lost in the doubt. And it's because we're doubting that we can't do it. If the doubt wasn't there, we could do just fine. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, self-fulfilling statement. So the five hindrances, some people think of the five hindrances as five strategies that the mind has to avoid challenges. When we're challenged by something, some uncomfortable situation arises, then the mind might respond to one of these five strategies. It doesn't like what's happening. Let's go shopping. You know, let's go get the refrigerator and find some nice things, nice, desirous thing to kind of get my teeth into. You don't like what's happening? Well, someone's to blame. Let's find something to have a version towards. You don't like what's happening? When comfortable, what's happening? Let's just get anxious and restless. Don't like what's happening? We're challenged by what's happening? Let's just, you know, get lethargic. Let's just drag our legs. Let's develop Gil's seer's mind. You don't like what's happening? Get lost in indecision and doubt as a way of avoiding really facing this situation. So the five hindrances come into play very frequently in meditation practice. And it's very important to say that so that when they arrive, when you experience them, you don't take them as a personal failing. You don't take them as being a problem. You don't take them as being indication that you're doing anything wrong, but rather as indication that this is a stuff of meditation. This is the food in which we work with. This is what we're kind of, you know, it's kind of like the garbage that we put in the compost pile that gets decomposed into wonderful compost for the garden. We take this stuff, which can be very difficult to work with, and we learn how to pay attention to it. We learn how to bring our presence to it. And then that transforms it into wonderful food for the meditative mind. So I was wondering, the end of the sitting, I asked you to notice, to recollect during the sitting, what were some of the common areas that your mind, categories of places that your mind tended to get distracted by or get lost by in the course of the sitting? What were some of the things that came up? Those of you who care to admit that you might have been distracted for a few seconds. Yes. All of the above. I started thinking about dinner, and then I started worrying about money, and then I was falling asleep. I can't remember. That's pretty typical for me. There's also something that's called the multiple hindrance attack. Someone else? Yes. For me, it was mostly anxiety, things that worked, and planning how to deal with them. Please. There was some excitement of changing the drought tomorrow, and so I kept going back to that. It was a good point of thought. So that may, in terms of the hindrance, it could either be, it kind of maybe fit into the restless and anxiety category. In anxiety, it can also be excitement, or it could be tied in with desire, the first hindrance. So maybe we really want some things, we get caught up in those kinds of thoughts. Someone else? Please. Yes. A dog bark, I believe, didn't matter. So I sat there and thought for a while about how good it was that I wasn't thinking about the dog bark. So your particular trap was self-congratulation. The experience says it finds out better than not thinking about that. There are other things besides the five hindrances, other ways in which we get lost. Please. I was getting sleepy, and I thought, well, this is torpor, I got caught up in naming the hindrance. Is it helpful to name it? Oh, yeah, okay. So is it helpful to name a hindrance? It's helpful to, often it's helpful to name what's going on, because in naming it, we tend not to be so caught up in it. And especially with something with a hindrance, with a strong tendency to get caught up, to name that, to use the naming function of the mind, to kind of separate yourself a little bit from it, to kind of be independent of it. It's kind of like, but it's a little bit of clarity. Oh, sleepiness, that part that names the sleepiness is not caught by it. What we're trying to do with mindfulness is not to get rid of these things, what's called the five hindrances. And this is a very important thing to realize, because sometimes when people hear the teachings of the five hindrances, they assume, oh, these are things I have to get rid of in order to be present. What we're trying to get rid of is the hindering quality of these things. So it isn't that desire is bad, but rather it's our tendency to get lost in them, the hindering quality of that desire, how we get lost in it, how the desire becomes an obstacle to mindfulness. It isn't that aversion is necessarily bad, but it's a trap for us. We tend to fall into it and not to come out. I call the five hindrances the black holes of the mind, because it's like a black hole is a star that's collapsed, and the gravitational force is so strong that light goes into it, but doesn't come out. So the gravitational force of these hindrances can be so strong that a light of awareness goes into it and doesn't come out. We get lost in our concerns. So what do we do? So the first thing is to realize that these are common experiences in meditation. The second thing to do is to realize is to not then become aversive to them, not to get anxious about their presence, but to remember, oh, this is the stuff of meditation. This is the food, the fuel, the compost of meditation. If you can come back to your breath and come back to the present moment easily, then it's fine. Do that. But if those things are really strong and you keep going back into them regularly or just keep you're so stuck in it, then it's very important to begin waking up in the midst of it. Wakefulness is kind of a synonym for Buddhism. The word Buddha, you know, you know, you know, you know, the word Buddhism, the origins of the word. It comes from word Buddha, right? It's the ism of the Buddha. And and the Buddha is in a given name. It's just a title, I guess, like the word Christ as a title. And it means and it comes from the root of Bodhi, which means to be awake and and to attain Bodhi. It would one way of translating English is to become awake and awake in person. And I like this expression to be awake, to wake up to what's going on. So we're trying to if you simply can't extract yourself from hindrances easily and come back to the breath, then you want to kind of in a sense stay in it and see, can you wake up in the midst of it? Can you can you develop an awareness of presence? Can you develop a clarity of clearly recognizing what's going on? So in that clear recognition, it's still there the hindrance, but you're not lost in it. It's not hindering you anymore. The desire is still there, but it's not no longer a hindrance because you've woken up in the midst of it. You see desire clearly for what it is. There's a marvelous story from the discourses of the Buddha. In the background of the story is that in Buddhist mythology, there is a there's a figure called Mara. And Mara is kind of like the Buddha, the Buddhist devil. It's the temptation, God of temptation or something. The job description of Mara is to prevent people from becoming awakened. That's, you know, be all end all of his or her job. So the last thing the Mara wants is someone to get enlightened. So here the Buddha and the night of the Buddha's awakening, his great awakening under the Bodhi Tree, the Tree of Awakening, Mara let loose all of his armies of distraction, try to keep the Buddha from becoming awakened, sent all the hindrances, all the desires, every possible temptation of, you know, desire was presented to the Buddha and every possible form of aversion and fear and all the powerful psychic forces inside that are trying to protest and protect the person from becoming free. So the night of the Buddha's awakening, the Buddha, it said overcame Mara, overcame all these psychic forces of distraction inside of him and woke up. So you would believe that the Buddha lived happily ever after, you know, peacefully awakened, enlightened and that's it. And what's interesting is that in the discourses of the Buddha, the stories of his life, after his awakening, after his enlightenment, Mara still comes to visit. And you might ask, you know, if Mara was understood by the early Buddhist tradition to be not literally, you know, kind of a being, but rather personification of all these inner psychic forces inside of us that keeps us from being present. And so the stories, you know, to have the stories of the Mara coming back and visiting the Buddha after his awakening. And what's interesting is what the Buddha does. Each time Mara comes by, the Buddha doesn't chase them away, doesn't invite him in for tea. The Buddha just simply very calmly looks at Mara and says, Mara, I see you. At which point, Mara always runs away. So maybe the Buddha should, you know, be kinder than that. He knows that he has that effect, so he shouldn't. But anyway, it's a, you know, it's a story, it's a fairy tale about the mind. And there's a, we have the ability, which takes a while to develop. If we can really clearly see what's going on, really name it, really see it. Mara, I see you. Desire, I see you. Aversion, I see you. Really see it. Then essentially you wake up to it and you're not feeding it anymore. And the story is, you know, you're not feeding it anymore. And the more you can wake up, the more you can see it clearly, and in that seeing, be free of it. More and more of you is going to be free, and more of that energy of freedom is not going to flow back into the desire, into the aversion or into the doubt. So a very important part of meditation that I keep saying here tonight is learning how to identify the forces of distraction that you have. And then see them as being places to practice with. And this takes some confidence in that it's useful to do so. And you might spend some time reflecting when your, when your throws are some regular preoccupation. Do you really want to spend your time pursuing this? Do you really want to spend your time planning about your work? Do you really want to spend your time fantasizing about some wonderful, you know, gourmet meal or some wonderful desire that you want to fulfill? Do you really want to spend your time ruminating over some, some aversion or some, you know, you have some hate you have or some sense of blame? Because sometimes it really takes that kind of reflection to see, you know, it is really worth my time. It's really what I want to do. Is this really what's most important and precious to do with this precious human life? And that kind of reflection sometimes can shift the balance. So we say, okay, I prefer now to try to wake up. It's actually more important for me to wake up. And unless you make that reflection, the, the momentum of our desire, our preoccupation can be so strong. That we don't even notice we're doing it. We don't even, we haven't really taken it seriously to do the practice. You know, we have this wonderful train of desire and we had no, you know, we were supposed to be here and try to wake up and be present for the breath to be present. But we're not, we're not really that serious about it. So, you know, I'll just, I'll just spend five, ten minutes now with this desire or whatever. But to really kind of reflect and not to get grim about it, but reflect, say, what's really important here? Half an hour of my time, if you're just meditating half an hour each day, it's not a very long period of your life. And do you want to continue with the same habits of mind in your meditation practice as is going on the other 23 and a half hours of the day? And, or do you want to try to make that half an hour to be something different? So kind of a reflection like that can sometimes help make a difference between kind of casually pursuing a hindrance or waking up in the midst of it or letting go of it. Sometimes these hindrances are quite powerful. And then you want to be able to do a number of things. You want to be able to, the more powerful they are, the more you probably identify body sensations that are directly connected to that hindrance. Body sensations of desire or aversion or whatever. And then bring your attention to the body sensations. And that's one way to wake up in the midst of it. Because if you're really connected to the body sensations, you're probably not going to be so concerned about the object of your desire or aversion or the mental ideas connected to it. And it tends to stabilize and calm the mind in the midst of it. It's a way of learning how to be present without getting caught up in the story that's connected to the particular hindrance. It could also be very helpful to, well, let me say something else. It's also useful sometimes to investigate under the surface of these hindrances. If the hindrances are very powerful and really distracting you a lot, you want to kind of look underneath them and see what else is going on there. Because sometimes the hindrances are really a symptom of something deeper, some deeper emotion which is operating. With the desire, for example, as probably most of you know, there can be desires that we want to pursue as a way of filling some kind of emptiness we have inside. We feel lonely, we feel sad, we feel empty, we feel bored. And so the desire becomes a strategy to try to fill that feeling of inadequacy or that empty feeling. If you drop behind the desire, which might be a very pleasant desire to have, and connect to the underlying feeling that's generating it, then it might become a lot easier to stay present. But if the underlying feeling stays unacknowledged, it's still going to be there kind of operating anyway and ready to kick up whatever it's going to kick up in a way. So desire often, I like the word, in terms of this hindrance, the English expression, to be wanting. Because the want is the want, but to be wanting in English sometimes means that something is lacking. The soup is wanting salt, means that salt is absent from the soup. So if you're wanting, what is it that's lacking? To investigate, what's happening here? I'm so much concerned with desire, what is it that I lack? What do I truly lack? With aversion, it can be the same thing. Or maybe there's fear under your aversion. Maybe there's a feeling of threat. And so one way to protect ourselves when there's a feeling of being threatened is to attack things, to blame things outside, to have aversion to things. And it can be much wiser sometimes than to wake up to the feeling of threat and the fear, than it is to pursue all the aversion. Restlessness and anxiety might, the underlying, anxiety and restlessness and underlying that, it might be frustrated desire. So you might have to drop down back to the first hindrance in order to really be present for the restlessness. The word, the Pali word, the Buddhist word for the hindrances literally means the coverings. So the question is, what is it that is being covered over by the hindrances? Now, so do the investigation of the hindrances, become familiar with them, explore them, be very accepting of their appearance, but then try to wake up in the midst of them? It's very helpful people's daily lives, because the hindrances are not, you know, are common in daily life. And the more we can investigate them, the more we can learn about them and learn how to be independent of them and free of them, how to wake up in the midst of them in meditation, the more it's going to help us to do that in their daily life also. And so I would suggest to you, that's really invaluable in the course of meditation practice, to be sensitive to what are the forces that distract you. Don't just simply dismiss them, oh, that's a distraction, and then come back to the breath. But actually wake up to the distraction before you come back to your breathing. That make sense? Well, so what's your comments or your questions? Yes? I noticed just while sitting here how maybe it's a component of the version, not characteristic, but it seemed it was that which took me away from pleasantness. You know, it's not so much actively pushing away, but it was the attention getting drawn to something that would interrupt pleasure. So you're having pleasure in your meditation? Yeah. Just meditative pleasure? Yeah, it was within thinking, within a certain investigation I was going through. And I was watching, there was kind of a pleasure in observing the momentum of this happening. And occasionally a thought or a feeling would arise like, go back to the breath. And in that instant there was an aversion. So I wondered, it was kind of like that was pleasurable, and now there's this thought that wants to take away the pleasure. Uh-huh. Well, this is all just to be investigating, to investigate more what's your tendency. But it's very important for, a very important area to pay attention to meditation is actually what your reaction is to, when you notice that your mind has drifted away, when you're not very present. Because there's all kinds of reactions that people might have. Some people will notice, oh, I've been drifting off, but what I'm drifting off into is so wonderful that I'm going to forget about this mindfulness stuff, because I'm about to write the great American novel, and that's just kind of follow it. Another reaction is, uh-oh, I'm lost, I'm not very present, I'm doing things wrong, I'm bad. So then it would be kind of beat ourselves up. Another reaction might be, uh-oh, I lost track of the breath, and we jerk the mind back on the breath, we kind of jump back on the breath. Or you notice the mind has drifted off into some place, and then we notice, oh, this is not what meditation is, and then we have aversion and hate towards that distraction, because that distraction is not being present. A lot of those reactions that we might have are not needed. And it's only by waking up to what's actually, so some people don't notice the reactions, because the reactions are about the meditation, and anything about the meditation is not something to be meditating about, not something to be mindful about. But it's very important to notice what your reactions are within the meditation itself. And then can you make it simpler? Can you simply notice the mind has drifted off, the mind has preoccupied, and then in a very simple way come back to the breathing, or come back and wake up? I don't know if I said this in the intro class, but there's a very interesting phenomenon in meditation, and that is that we're trying to be mindful. At some point the mind wanders off. It's pretty common. We can expect it. At some point, you notice that's happened. Now, when your mind has wandered off, and you're lost in your thoughts, there's no problem. Right? Because you're not even present enough to know that you're lost. So, you know, great, you're just lost. So don't worry, because nothing I can tell you is going to help that. You're just gone. At some point, through a miracle, or magic, or mystery, or something, your mind wakes up. Your mind notices, I'm really lost. I'm preoccupied. I'm here sitting in a meditation room. At some point, it kind of dawns on you. At that moment, it's very common then to people to react to that understanding. Uh-oh, I've done it wrong. I've got to hurry back to the breath, and we jerk the mind back or something. But what often people don't recognize is that first moment of recognizing that they're distracted or lost in thought, that is a moment of mindfulness. The very moment that you're mindful of the fact that your mind is drifting, the very moment that you're mindful of the fact that you were not mindful, you were being mindful. Right? People often don't notice that moment of mindfulness. They don't think it counts. And so then they get complicated work on the judgments. It's very helpful in meditation to very simply to appreciate that first moment of noticing that you've come back. And noticing often how peaceful that moment is in and of itself, that knowing. And then rather than adding some kind of jerked back mindfulness on top of that, relax and try to promote that first moment. Try to expand that first moment the way you are that moment and try to let that wakefulness expand and become larger. Making some sense? I think it's actually a very important point. Because if you wake up and then you yank your mind back, that yanking the mind back is going to agitate the mind. But you're already mindful in that moment. Maybe not a very strong mindfulness, but there's some mindfulness there when you've woken up to some degree. And then you simply appreciate that moment of mindfulness and see if you can continue it, see if you can promote it, see if you can expand it, then to include the breath. So rather than yanking the mind back to the breath, see if you can kind of like invite the breath back into it. Hopefully this makes some sense. Please. I find that moment, at certain moments, extremely challenging in that earlier you were talking about having the capacity to trust that getting back to being mindful is where you want to be. And there are moments when I realize I'm not being mindful, but I do not trust at all. The images that you talk about are toughest when they seem like they're serving my life. So they actually seem like if I go away from them, I'm actually causing harm. They're actually vital. And so to go away from them feels like I'm actually violating my own self-preservation. Could be. That's why, I'm sorry, you haven't told us what they are, but you don't have to, but it's a little bit hard to then answer kind of generally because I might miss you. But let me say this, that's why having a formal meditation time is very important, where you kind of go into a place where it feels very safe and go into a time and a place where you don't have to act and respond to the world. And so you know in that situation there's no requirement for you to be any particular way. And so at least in meditation practice you can let go of those because you know they're not needed. And then if you can drop down deep below them in the meditation practice, it'll give you a very different perspective about those very things when you go back into the world, where maybe some of them are needed for your protection, or maybe not. The example that comes to mind just the last couple of days I've been doing a lot of writing, and I think you're talking about the great American novel or whatever. I'm going to kind of identify with that. I'm just trying to write a short story. And I have a flood of ideas. And at certain moments when I'm writing, ironically when things are going best is when I get this anxious restlessness. And I can't hold everything. And there's an inkling to notice that, to be mindful of that, to be present with that fact. But there's this distrust that if I do that I'm actually going to lose all the content that I have bubbling up inside. You might. It's part of me that believes so strongly that it's an awful thing and then I'll never get it back. So that's for you to sort through. But it's very easy for a person to be fooled that way for a lifetime. And to never think that, you know, I can never feel like they can relax and stop and kind of discover some other way of being. And it can be a trap that kind of keeps the person going and going and going. So, good luck. But I really hope that you at least sometime during your day discover, you know, go back to some place of being where you're not anxious that way, not trying to accomplish something. You first sit down to try to establish a good, stable, aligned posture. And in some schools of Buddhism, like in some schools of Zen, it's one of the central aspects of the meditation practice itself. It's about focusing on your posture. In our tradition, we don't have that ongoing focus on the posture, but rather you might in the course of the sitting two or three times adjust your posture if you've slumped. But you don't want to spend a lot of time always checking your posture and making corrections because the more you're correct and the more you're, you know, every time you move your body, you're actually disturbing the mind. And so you want to hold the body still. And if the body begins to change posture and slump or lean or something, what we do in mindfulness is rather than correcting it right away, you can go in and bring your mindfulness to that new posture. And that's very, very interesting to do. So, so if you find yourself leaning over to one side, go over and explore that leaning. Some part of your body that's being pulled, are you being pushed someplace or you're collapsing someplace else? And really bring your attention really carefully to that part of your body that seems to be operating with that leaning. And sometimes what happens is that in being very careful attention to something, to some holding in the body, that attention itself will help release the holding. And sometimes with the posture, the posture will right itself. You don't have to do the correcting. The body will correct itself if it's being supported by your awareness. But to generally we want to, you know, having a good posture is very helpful and, but you don't want to be obsessive about it. Let's end with a sitting, short sitting. So as I'm speaking now, and you're listening to me, mindfulness is present. You're aware. It's very easy to hear my voice perhaps. Now relax and expand that awareness. Invite your breathing into that awareness. Let your efforts to be mindful be peaceful. Gentle. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. In the midst of our lives. I'd like to make a few announcements.
