 People talk about death and dying on election day. And it just happens that the week before that is Halloween, which is another celebration of things like death. And this is our closest meeting to Halloween. We're not meeting on Monday. Tomorrow, by the way, there's no meeting on Monday in our regular group Monday, in case you're planning to go. And so I thought I talked a little bit about Halloween. And since I did an interesting holiday in many ways, one of the things that's kind of overlooked by many people, I think, or forgotten, is that the origins of Halloween is that it's the nights before All Saints Day. And so we have this day that somehow celebrates the unseen world of demons and ghosts and ghouls. And that it happens the day before the celebration of the sainthood of all good and virtue and purity and all these wonderful things. And most of us have forgotten to pay attention to the goodness part of it in favor of paying attention to the other side. And partly, there's maybe a cultural need for that, because we tend not to focus on the demonic. Though, if you go back, apparently, in the biblical times, the angels, considered to be the embodiment of purity and innocence and good or whatever, were considered to be terrifying figures in ancient times. They weren't just kind of domesticated in recent times. And commercialized. But they themselves were awesome characters. So even as a culture, we need most cultures to have some time, carnival, for example, where the backwards usually doesn't get acknowledged, the repressed forces or the hidden forces or get the chance to kind of surface and kind of bubble up and be expressed and be exhausted for another year. One of the things I'm fond of saying is that all cultures and probably all families and all societies and all individuals have so-called shadows and have parts of their life that they don't tend to look at very carefully or tend to ignore. And it's quite easy to do that. If you put great value on something because you like it, then we tend not to look at the places we don't value. So in Buddhist culture, for example, there's a lot of value placed on loving kindness, on not being angry, on compassion. And those are beautiful values. But the shadow side of that is that then Buddhists will tend to kind of hide their anger or their lack of generosity or their lack of love or compassion. And because you go into a Buddhist circle, in Buddhist culture, you don't want to show that you're not one of the people that understands the values. And that's pretty normal. Most cultures have that kind of activity. Most groups of people together, that kind of thing happens. So that's the cultural side. But one of the functions of practice, of Buddhist practice, is to highlight the shadow, is to bring it out, to give it a chance to come to the surface. So in a sense, for us, every day, if we sit every day, every day is Halloween. Every day we're willing to look at the unseen world of whatever motivates us deep down inside. And so our own demons, our own hungry ghosts, and our own saints, whatever is inside of us. It was interesting that maybe many of you know this, the word demon, which is kind of these beings of evil that we're supposed to be afraid of, comes from the Greek word diamond. Diamond, is pronouncing it right, diamond, which has a kind of a double meaning. It's kind of a guardian. They're kind of guardian deities, a kind of middle rank. And there's double meaning. They're both being, I guess, sometimes it means beings which are kind of demonic, kind of evil. But also it meant guardian spirits, people who are natural guardians, like a guardian angel kind of things. And so they have these two functions. And we tend to look more at the demonic side now rather than the demonic side, the side of being guardian angels. But maybe it says something about how the things that we're afraid of within us, things that we sometimes don't want to look at, things that trouble us a lot, the demons that hound us, maybe are in some sense have another side to them. They don't necessarily are guardian angels, but they have another side. Maybe that there's something useful there for us to attend to and be present for. And certainly, if a person is going to do mindfulness practice, there has to be a willingness to face their shadows, to face their demons, to face the things that they'd rather not look at, the forces and motivations and things that bubble up that you may be constantly trying to ignore and do away with and not look at. Because as long as those things are kind of hounding us and motivating us and affecting us, they're going to naturally come up as part of mindfulness practice unless we kind of resist them, unless we put up the effort to hold them at bay. Part of the way mindfulness practice works is that the forces of tension, of resistance, of contraction, which takes energy and effort to do, slowly get revealed. As your mind gets quieter and calmer, as your body gets calmer in meditation, it becomes clear and clear the places we're holding intention that's left. If you're living tense all the time, then you might not even notice that you're tense around not looking at your anger. If you're holding your anger at bay. But as you start getting calmer and calmer, that tension stands out in highlight. And so sooner or later in mindfulness practice you have to look at the places where that effort is being made to avoid things or to hold things away. Otherwise the mindfulness practice won't proceed. So it's a very important part of mindfulness practice is to look at the unseen world, that part of the world we don't usually look at. So it's great we have one day a year where at least for us in our culture, popular culture, where we're supposed to pull out, draw out the unseen world. And those of you who are going to dress up for Halloween or do something interesting for Halloween, you might try and avoid doing something which is kind of cute or fun. In favor of maybe doing something which is also cute and fun, but also maybe is a real questioning of what is your particular demons that hound you or trouble you. And maybe there's a new relationship you can form with it. And that in many ways, what we're trying to do in Buddhist practice is see if we have a new relationship with our demons, which are difficulties. And one way to look at this is there's a wonderful quote, which I probably don't have exactly right, from one of the desert fathers, the Christian monks who went to the desert 1,500 years ago. And he said something like, it's not your evil thoughts that will condemn you. It's those evil thoughts that you utilize that will condemn you. And it was a very interesting distinction because many of us will have all kinds of thoughts and ideas that we don't like. And sometimes we want to censor them, we feel shamed about having them. But there's all kinds of thoughts that can arise in the mind. It's not really maybe even your responsibility what thoughts arise. Your responsibility is what you do with those thoughts once they've arisen. And one of the ways for evil thoughts is to utilize them, to get involved with them, and act on them. And he says, it's not your evil thoughts which will condemn you, but rather the way you use them. So in that sense, when you sit in meditation, it's quite fine to let whatever demons arise. But how do you relate to those? What do you do with them? And of course, there's many ways. One is to utilize them and get involved in them. And the other way is to push them away or hate them or want something else. I told this story many times. When I was 14 or so, my father had one of these father-son talks with me. And he told me that as you grow up, as you can go through life, you're going to have some really bizarre thoughts. Don't worry about them. Everyone has them. Just let them go. And sure enough, sooner or later, I had bizarre thoughts. But I'd been warned. Wasn't that great? Most people don't get warned. So uh-oh, what does this mean about me? So in relationship to the angelic side and the demonic side, I think it's pretty normal for people when they choose the angelic side, the good and the wonderful and the light and all that. And that's normal to want to do that. But there's a very interesting poem by Rumi. One Dervish said to another, what was your vision of God's presence? The other said, I haven't seen anything. But for the sake of conversation, I'll tell you a story. God's presence is there in front of me, a fire on the left, a lovely stream on the right. So God's presence is in these two different forms, a fire and a stream. One group walks towards the fire, into the fire. Another group walks towards the sweet flowing water. No one knows which are blessed and which not. Whoever walks into the fire appears suddenly in the stream. A head goes under on the water surface. That head pokes out of the fire. Most people guard against going into the fire, and so end up in it. Those who love the water of pleasure and make it their devotion are cheated with this reversal. The trickery goes further. The voice in the fire tells the truth, saying, I am not fire. I am fountainhead. Come into me and don't mind the sparks. So if you are a friend of God, fire is your water. You should wish to have 100,000 set of moth wings, so you can burn them away one set a night. The moth sees light and goes into fire. You should see fire and go toward light. Fire is what of God is world consuming, water world protecting. Somehow each gives the appearance of the other. To these eyes you have now what looks like water burns. What looks like fire is a great relief to be inside. One molecule moat, second thinking of God's reversal of comfort and pain, is better than any attending ritual. That splinter of intelligence is substance. The fire and water themselves accidental done with mirrors. And then I found this quote by Socrates. He had a big influence on the Arab world, so maybe this is where Rumi got his idea. Socrates wrote, pain and pleasure are never present to a person at the same time. And yet the person who pursues either is compelled to take the other. So in mindfulness practice, we're actually not supposed to pursue the demonic. We're not supposed to pursue the angelic. We're supposed to be present for whatever happens to arise. The mindfulness practice is training in learning how to be open and present for things as they are, not how we want them to be, not our preferences. And that's quite challenging for some people because we'd rather live in our preferences. But if we live in our preferences, then we live with a shadow. And the shadow then comes and hounds us. So a very important part of practice then is learning how to open up to our demons, to the demonic, that which we'd rather not look at, thank you. And so how do we do that? What's involved in that? And the first, of course, is a willingness to do that, the understanding that it's important to do that, that it's useful to do that. But in addition to that, it still can be quite difficult. I find it useful to pay attention to the physical tension that's sometimes connected to the resistance, or the effort, or the contraction connected to these things. Sometimes our fears are easier to attend to. If we don't look at them directly, we'd rather look at the resistance to the being with the fear. And sometimes the resistance is operating so strongly that it can make it very difficult if we keep trying to look at the fear itself. But if you back away from the fear and look at the resistance or the hesitation you have to be with the fear, then maybe you can resolve the resistance. And if there's no more resistance to the fear, then what then? Well, then you have the fear, perhaps. Sometimes the fear goes away. It's amazing. Sometimes it's the resistance to the fear that keeps it going. Many times the motivations of aversion, resistance, actually fuel some of our demons. And this is said in a famous little myth, or fairy tale, or whatever, the Buddha spoke. And there was a time when Brahma, the great god, the great kind of over god, the super god of them, pantheon of Indian deities, left his palace in his throne one day. And while he was gone, an ugly little runt of a yaksha came to and sat on his throne. The yaksha was kind of like an ugly teeny little runt of a troll. So this troll came and sat on the throne. Now the courtiers, the other gods in the court, were quite upset by this. And only the person of highest status should sit on the throne of the person of highest status. So this was an upturning of the order of the universe, and this was not good. So they got angry and started yelling at them, troll, to get off the throne. And the more they were angry and more they were yelling at him, he just kept growing and growing. Got bigger and bigger and stronger and more and more beautiful. And they were quite perplexed by this, so finally they gave up. And they went and found Brahma and said, look, there's a problem with your throne. They told him the story. And he said, oh, don't worry about it. I know what to do. So he went back to his throne. And instead of being angry or telling the yaksa to get away, he said, oh, it's nice to see you. How you been? Let me get down here and bow to you. It's nice to see you on my throne, and I hope you're doing well, and your parents are well, and whatever, and your job's going well. And the more that he offered kindness and care to the yaksa, the more the yaksa began to shrink and shrink and shrivel and get ugly again. And finally, poof, he vanished. And then Brahma went and sat in his throne, and he explained to everyone that this was an anger-eating yaksa. And the more anger you get, the more it thrives in those nutriments. And if you stop giving it anger, then it begins to just fades away. So that's a nice fairy tale. And of course, it often works that way for us, that our anger and our resistance, our fear, sometimes actually feeds those demons that we most don't want to be there. There's also a famous story of Milarepa, who was one of the great Tibetan yogis, Tibetan Buddhist yogis, who lived in a cave for many years. And he himself had been kind of demonic in his, before he became a monk, killed a lot of people, had learned all kinds of black magic, and used it to kill people. And then he went off and practiced for many years very aesthetically as a hermit in a cave. And it said he just ate stinging nettles for his meal. And so his skin turned green, his permanent Halloween custom. And he lived there in his cave. And one day he went out, I guess, to gather some more nettles. And he came back, and five demons had gotten into his cave. And so he thought, first of all, maybe these demons have come because in my years of sitting in this cave, I've never sung any, never made any offerings to local demons. So they're kind of finally coming to get their own. So he made some offerings to them, and they didn't go away. And they said, well, maybe I never sang them songs of praise. So he sang them songs of praise, tried to get rid of them. They were unmoved by the songs of praise. So, well, I better get tough now. So he took all his yogic powers, and he steeled himself up, and he growled ferociously and said, get out of here, you demons. And I'm going to use my magic on you or whatever. And all this ferocity just wasn't enough. They just kind of laughed at him. And then he thought, all I want to do is I'll teach them the dharma. It's like putting up the cross in the West. I'll teach them the dharma, and that'll get rid of them. So he taught them the great profundity of the dharma. They just snarled and giggled. And they started coming after him with their big teeth, ready to sharpen your teeth on their files, where you really want to have a good meal on Melarepa. And then it occurred to me, these demons, they're just projections of my mind. That's all they are. They're just kind of mental appearances. I know what to do now. I've been trying to get rid of them, and that was the whole problem. So he sat down, and he looked at them, and he said, welcome, demons. I'm glad you're here. Come here and have a meal with me, and we'll hang out and sing songs through the night. And it's great to see you. And with that, they finally shriveled up and disappeared. As long as he was trying to get rid of them, nothing happened. But finally, when he was welcoming them, they disappeared. Now, welcoming has to be sincere. I know lots of people who will sit in meditation and hear that, oh, what you're supposed to do is be mindful of things and accept things, my anger, my fear, my rage, my whatever it is, my pain. And I'll just really be accepting of it. I'll just really be mindful of it. I'll allow it to be there as is. I'll practice equanimity with it. And all those things are done as strategies to really get rid of it. Let's welcome it all so it goes away. And it doesn't work so well that way. It has to be sincere. The demons understand. You have to really be accepting, really be allowing. OK, it's OK for you to be there. I welcome you. It's OK. And then in that being OK, maybe then there can be some transformation. So there has to be a willingness to be present for these parts of us. There has to be a willingness to let our mindfulness be open and for all of it. And then to see it clearly, which is the basic definition of epasana, to see clearly. So not just simply willingness to be there, but then willingness to really look at that and see it clearly. What's really going on here for me? What's really happening here? And it's very interesting when you do this, because my impression is that the so-called demons and deep fears and traumas that we have, the more I practice and the more I talk to other people who practice and talk with people and what happens to them as they practice, almost coming to the conclusion that all these demons are really symptoms of something else. And if we react to the surface, to the symptom, we don't understand the cause. And the cause, if you trace it back far enough, this is where it gets a little bit kind of, it should take me with a great assault. But my impression is if you take it far enough back, you trace what's behind the demon. You find at the heart of all of it something really good and beautiful. Somehow the things we most fear about ourselves, the things we most trouble and don't like about ourselves, things that bug us the most, if you learn how to bring your mindfulness to it, really carefully and allow it to be there and in a sense be welcoming of it. And then be able to kind of begin understanding it deeper and what's actually going on, what it's made up of. You'll find that at the heart of it is something really beautiful and something you don't have to be afraid of. I've noticed this a number of times with people who are demon is being judgmental or being critical. If the person's first, I've had people come to me on retreats and really suffering tremendously by their judgmental mind. Retreats have a way of kind of accentuating our common tendencies. So some people don't want to go on retreat because what happens in normal life, these things are operating, but then we don't look at them because we get distracted or it's easy to avoid them or whatever. But on retreat you can't, there's no more distractions. The only distraction, the only entertainment is once a day there's Dharma talk. But otherwise you're left alone. And so these tendencies kind of get strengthened or get highlighted. And so sometimes the judgmental mind gets really strong and people come and express their suffering of this kind of mind. But then if you begin investigating, what's the, not just simply bring your mindfulness to the judgment, but you look, what's going on there? What's the function of that? What's it arising out of? And if you ask the question, what's the function of being judgmental? Many people will then say, oh, well, it's more than just being critical of these people because they deserve to be criticized, but rather it's judgmental because it's a kind of protection. We're protecting ourselves. If we can criticize people out there as being wrong, then we don't have to look at myself, then I'm right. You know, or at least I'm not looking at myself. And as a movement, sometimes a protection. And then you have our protection is a fine thing to do. Maybe it's not, it's a reasonable thing to want to protect oneself. Maybe the form of protection and creating safety is done in an unwholesome, unuseful way, but still the motivation to be protective of something inside of you is a beautiful thing, perhaps. And so rather than looking at the judgment, maybe take a step back into that feeling or desire, motivation for protection. And hang out with that. And if we hang out with that, then what do we find then? Maybe then we find, this is very simplistically stated here today, but you have to do the investigation yourself. Maybe there's many more steps, but maybe you find underneath the protectiveness, you find a kind of tenderness, a sense of vulnerability that maybe in the past has been hurt or crushed by the situations around you, or maybe you're unsure about, or maybe feels kind of tenuous. And so maybe what you need to learn rather than protecting yourself, you need to learn how to feel comfortable with being vulnerable, or how to develop some street smarts with being vulnerable, how to be vulnerable in a wise way as opposed to putting up walls. And that vulnerability maybe is connected to some real beauty inside of us, and tenderness inside of us. Anger, same thing, explore anger. And what do you find? The anger is a symptom of something deeper. Maybe again, if you follow it, trace it back far enough, something beautiful about us. And maybe it's kind of, again, it's kind of an unwise strategy that's really trying to do something precious and important, like misunderstood strategy, anger is. So if you trace anger back for some people, occasionally what you find is there might be, again, fear, fear is one of the primary triggers for anger. And if you learn to hang out with the anger, with the fear, then again, what you can investigate, what are you afraid of? And sometimes you feel afraid of imaginary things, and, or maybe the fear is real, but the fear itself maybe is a wonderful door into some deeper aspect of your psyche that you can explore. And if you explore that fear deeply, again, I think my trust is you'll eventually find some beauty as if there's all these like this tree, all these tree branches, and some of these tree branches have grown unhealthily. And we relate to the fruit of the tree rather than tracing the branches back down to the trunk and back into the roots. And at the roots, maybe it's, you know, is the earth and the earth is always there to support us. Something like that. So to learn to pay attention to our demons, look at them and be willing to let them be there. And then maybe have as kind of a, maybe as a, give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe their presence is not a symptom of something wrong, but maybe their symptom of something right that's been maladaptive. So rather than pushing them away, take them as beings very useful, the maybe maladaptive strategies, but maybe rather than turning away, see what are the lessons here? What can I understand by going into them? What can I understand by learning to open to them, be welcoming of them? Sometimes the demonic side needs to be expressed in order to be seen, to be understood. If we spend a lifetime repressing them. And it's not enough just to sit there in mindfulness and let them arise because there's too many forces of numbness or repression. And sometimes it's useful to kind of act things out. And so we have Halloween. So you might consider what your demons are, what your demon is, and be it for Halloween. And when you be it, feed it. A lot of these demons, what they most, they're kind of like hungry ghosts, but they really want to be fed. So there's another way of looking at the demonic, the shadow sides of our life. They also have something that sometimes needs to be fed. People who are hungry ghost part of the demons, always wants, wanting, wanting, wanting more, and wanting their relationships, wanting money, wanting things, wanting whatever, wanting, wanting, wanting. Rather than rejecting that wanting, sometimes it's useful to sit really quiet or really reflect deeply. What does it really want? It doesn't really want food. It doesn't really want all the different things, things of the world. Probably if you have to pay careful attention, it wants you. And it probably wants you to love it. Deep inside, there's a part of you that wants you to love yourself. The Buddha said, if you search the world, you'll find no one who's more worthy of your love than yourself. It isn't selfish to be self-loving. It's necessary in order to love other people. So we do loving kindness meditation. And sometimes you might experiment next time you have a demon or a hungry ghost to imagine what does it need to, what does it really need? How can you feed it? So as you go into Halloween, and you put on your demonic customs, whatever you're gonna do, bring along a bag of something to feed it with. And think creatively what that might be, part of the custom. So enjoy Halloween, whatever way you're gonna do it. And if you live in a place where you feed other demons, it's very important how you feed your demons that come knocking at your door. Don't just go out and buy the cheapest candy you can find. But this is really important. This is a very important cultural event. What these little kids don't know is what's really going on. It's an unseen world is being expressed through them. And so be very careful and very selective in what you feed these demons that come and how you welcome them. So that's Halloween.
