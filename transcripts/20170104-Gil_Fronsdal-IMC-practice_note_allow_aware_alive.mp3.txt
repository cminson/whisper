Practice Note : Allow, Aware, Alive

One of the interesting statements that people have told 
me over the years  is that they’re not interested in being 
mindful. When I hear this, the first thing that goes 
through my mind is  to restate it to myself. I say, “O h, so 
the person’s not  interested in being alive.” When people 
say they’re not interested in mindfulness, I usually 
assume they take mindfulness to be a technique.  In 
fact, whenever someone talks about mindfulness as a 
technique, I recoil a little bit. In my mind, a technique is 
something extra that you add on top of your life. It’s like 
a little piece of engineering that you do. It’s something 
you do from the control tower . 
 
I like this expression, “the control tower.” It’s a place 
where there’s a sense of “me” or “I’m going to do,” “I’m 
going to decide,” “I’m going to engage,” “I’m going to 
apply myself and do a technique,” “T his is what I 
believe,” or “This is how it affe cts me.”  In all this, there is 
a sense  of agency – of self – operating . I call it “the 
control tower. ” In an airport , the control tower is high 
above everything else. Most people associate what I 
call a control tower with being up in their head, high up, 
looking down. Some people will practice mindfulness that way, where they’re looking from the control tower.  
They’re ob serving their experience from this wonderful 
place, and it’s a technique that’s applied.  
 
But I think of mindfulness as just – it’s almost too much 
to say – but to be alive with presence.  In fact, I prefer to 
just call it “being alive.” To not be mindful – to not be 
aware – is somehow not really being alive. It dampens  
our lives, cutting off part of who we are, limiting us in 
some way. If we spend a lot of time distracted, we’re 
losing our lives. In Buddhism, occasionally there’s very 
strong language about living a distracted life. To 
paraphrase the Dhammapāda , it says  that “if you’re 
distracted, it’s as if you’re already dead.” And in more 
dramatic language,  it says that  “if you’re mindful, it’s as 
if you’re never going to die.”   
 
There’s something about not being alive that actually 
hinders awareness and mindfulness. As we become 
more alive, mindfulness becomes more natural. It’s not 
something we add to our lives, it’s n ot a technique that 
we do.  It’s more something we allow for – and that 
arises and is just there.  
 
As you practice this morning, you might take a look 
under the hood of your practice to see  if you practice 
from the control tower . Do you practice as if you’r e 
doing a technique? There’s nothing wrong with that, but 
it might be limiting you.   
Is there a way of stepping back , and just allowing 
yourself to be alive? And in that simplicity of just 
allowing, can you recognize that there’s awareness and 
mindfulness  there ? There’s recognition of what is there  
will operate naturally if you relax – if you just soften, 
allow, and just be – be alive. In that regard, what you’re 
mindful of – what you’re aware of – will not necessarily 
be your choice. The control tower might choose to pay 
attention to something, but life will give you plenty of 
things to be aware of . If you’re really alive, really here, 
there’s no shortage of things to be aware of. You don’t 
have to be so in charge of what you pay attention to. 
Just allow for your  natural awareness , which is  there for 
whatever is emerging in this life of yours.  
 
If what I said makes any kind of sense to you, it might 
be interesting to experiment with it. And if it seems 
confusing or very foreign to you, then I woul d encourage 
you to not  worry about it. It’s a really good practice to let 
go of what teachers say. Don’t get too caught up in it. 
Thank you.
