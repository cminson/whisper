Opening to just how you are in this moment. 
Allowing there to be a relaxation of the body. 
Not that we're trying to make anything go away so much. 
Just the relaxation can be a condition that allows us to open to how things are. 
Relaxing the body as it's available for you to relax the body. 
And relaxing the mind. 
The mind is not relaxed, it tends to be caught up in thoughts of past or future. 
And so can there be a kind of a relaxing, a setting aside of mental tension. 
Again, that can help us to really land here in the present moment. 
Taking in your present moment experience. 
Experience the connecting with the body. 
Just this contact of aware of the physical sense of the body. 
Sitting here. 
Receiving the sensations of the body. 
Such a helpful stance for our meditation to receive whatever is available. 
Obvious. 
This stance of acceptance of what's happening in the moment. 
Doesn't mean that we have to agree or disagree with the experience. 
Accepting it doesn't mean we have to like it. 
Accepting what is offered is accepting that what is happening is what is happening. 
It's coming into alignment with truth. 
This is what is true in experience in this moment. 
This isn't about truth of some idea or some statement or view. 
It is aligning with this is what's arising in this moment. 
This is what's here now. 
And as the mind does open to that place of allowing, accepting what is here to be here. 
It can create the conditions for the heart to be soft and connected, compassionate. 
Kind attention around what is happening right in this moment. 
And of course the mind will wander. 
It will be pulled into thoughts, memories, plans. 
There will be a moment when you recognize that mindfulness will return. 
In that moment this attitude of allowing and acceptance around the fact that the mind had wandering is so helpful. 
It is what happened. 
We're judging ourselves, resisting it, fighting against it. 
It doesn't change that it happened. 
It doesn't actually support our minds to stay here, to be here. 
So even that wandering mind, when it's noticed, that too is allowed and accepted. 
Not in that it's allowed to continue, but that it's allowed to be what was happening. 
Continuing your practice, meeting experience, each moment, opening to this possibility of allowing our experience to be just as it is. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
