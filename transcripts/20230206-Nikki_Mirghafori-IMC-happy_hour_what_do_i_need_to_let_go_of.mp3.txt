 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. So, hello and welcome everyone to this rendition of Happy Hour, Happy Monday, or whatever day it is in your time zone. And yeah, I'm tempted not to share any reflections as I've been experimenting with in just getting into the meditation. Let's do that. And maybe I'll say a few words to support, to guide. But yeah, I have a theme in mind tonight. So let's, I always have a theme in mind, but anyway, let's practice together. Let's meditate together. Arriving, arriving in this body. Arriving in this moment. Arriving, arriving together. A sense of collecting, gathering, as we feel perhaps that we've been scattered with the demands or thoughts or priorities. Our hearts scatter. Now we collect. We collect. We collect ourselves. We gather ourselves as we gather together. We also gather ourselves. Which is another way to consider the practice of concentration or samadhi or samatha practice. Gathering. We collect ourselves. We gather ourselves lovingly. Come sweetie, come. Become whole. Become aligned. All the pieces of the puzzle scattered. Bring them together. Ah. By bringing our attention. With this breath, to this body. A sense of integrity, wholeness. If there might be demands on our attention, on our emotions, we say yes, we know, we know. And it's okay. We're not going to abandon you. We're just going to nourish ourselves for a moment, for a few moments with silence, with breath, with presence, so that we have more stability to include it all. So with that attitude of openness, spaciousness, coming to ourselves, coming wholly to ourselves, connecting with the breath. Sensations of the breath in the body, not the idea of it. Perceiving the breath in the abdomen. Feeling the sensations. Quite amazing. Feel like a lullaby, these sensations. Thank you. And if thoughts arise, not that there's anything wrong with thinking, but for now, we say no thank you, please come back later. Giving primacy to what's important right now. What is important right now in this moment? Thank you. Thank you. Rest, rest, dear heart, rest. No need to flutter here and there, sweet butterfly of the mind, the heart, rest, rest, dear, dear heart, rest, dear soul, rest, dear soul, rest, dear soul. Thank you. Thank you. Just this breath. Just this. Can we give primacy? Can we make this the most important? I already right now, just this, just this, really rocking. This is the most important act, this dedication in this moment of our heart to this practice, our attention, gathering our attention, it's the most important thing. Can we really get it? Can we really align with this, sort of thinking about this or that or planning or just let go? Just this. Just letting yourself be breathed. Just be awake in this moment. This passing moment. Thank you. Thank you. Can we nourish our hearts, ourselves? Can we be kind to ourselves by just attending to one thing, the simplicity of being, not doing? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thomas Merton, celebrated Trappist monk. I'll share his words. Let them wash over you while you're in a meditative state. The rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form of its innate violence, a pervasive form of contemporary violence. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to admit oneself to too many projects. To help everyone and everything. Just to succumb to violence. Can we in this moment not succumb to this inner form of what he calls violence, hold this way and that, all the demands, but just getting a sense of what is the most important, what is, and sitting, sitting, landing wholeheartedly in the most important thing. And it is said in Buddhism, the most important thing is to know what is the most important thing, the saying from Zen. To rest, to let your heart rest in the most important thing right now. Not running this way or that. Just here, as a sense of metta care, service to yourself and others. What is the most important thing in this moment? Just drop it into your body, to your heart, not into your head. Maybe nothing will come up, it's okay. Sit and breathe with this question. Let it gather you. Call me, settle you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can you imagine for a moment, conjure up, connect with what is the most important priority in your life right now? What value? What act, what service? And connect with that, sit with that, rest with that. So you're sitting in a warm bath. And this aspiration, support you and golf you. No distraction, just one thing, just one thing. Just this, breathe with it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There's an aspect of... as an expression of metta to yourself. What do you need to release? Be aligned with what is the most important thing in this moment in your life. Again not to think about it but drop it in as a reflection. Let yourself just breathe with this question. What do I need to let go of? Say no to. Don't think about it. Just be breathed. The answers will find you. You don't have to go find them. You need to let go of in this moment. Thinking. Just let yourself be breathed. Simple. You need to let yourself be breathed. Simple. Simple. Simple. Simple. you you you you you to and as we turn towards the end of this sitting let go of any self-judgment if it's arising or has arisen not needed not needed let go it's one thing you need to let go of right now any self-criticism, you've done your best, you've showed up. That's beautiful. That is so beautiful. Thank you, Mii, for showing up, doing my best. Yes. Ah, recognizing your own goodness, for having done your best. Without attachment to outcome and offering your goodness, intention, your wholeheartedness, your desire for cultivation, for your own sake and others, offer this goodness to all beings everywhere, sharing. Yes, I share my goodness, I share my life, I share my engagement, the fruit of my engagement, wholesome engagement. I offer to all beings everywhere. May my life be of benefit, may all beings everywhere, including myself, be free. Thanks, everyone, for your practice, theness of your practice. So the aim I wanted to bring in and I brought in for us to contemplate, to consider is, as I read the quote by Thomas Merton, which I'm sure Neil will find later about the violence of our times and send it to the mailing list later, is really about being distracted and pulled and this and that, the other and what do we need to let go out of care, out of love, out of metta for ourselves and others, not to be pulled in so many ways. And what do we need to let go of in our lives and what about this moment? And what is the most important thing? What is the most important? Can we just sit in that? Can we sit in our highest value, our highest intention and just let it sink, can open our hearts and can just become beautiful and a compass and divine compass? Yes, this is what I intend to engage with. I'm intended to be engaging with in this life. So that's the invitation. That was the invitation. As much as it showed up or didn't, it's fine. Let go of any self-judgment. The audio is available for listening later as well. So now engaging in small groups can be quite inspiring. And the query is what are you? What should you let go of? What should you let go of? What is appropriate for you to let go of in this moment? What is appropriate for you to let go of in your life? So what is appropriate? And again, your responses. As you come together and share and hold each other can be inspiring, can be supportive. You're not the only one who needs to let go. I need to let go of busyness. I'm saying yes to too many things. So all of us, it's right. It's a good reflection for all of us. And so that's the invitation. And what is appropriate to let go of right now? And the answer might be, I don't know. I'm just sitting with that. I don't know what's appropriate to let go of. Maybe I engage too much with others. I try to take care of others too much or whatever it might be. Just exploring. And then the other inquiry question that you can reflect on together might be what is the most important thing? What is the most important thing? Do I know what that is? Maybe you do. Maybe you don't. You don't have to share it if you don't want to. Just if you wanted to, that could be another exploration. So two questions. What to let go of and what is the most important thing? Again, you can choose to engage with one or both in any way. So I'm going to create the groups. As always, please take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. And each person can just share from their own experience. And sharing from your own experience, not asking others questions, not directing the group. Just show up, share something, and we'll go in the order of your birth date being closest to January 1st. So at first you'll have a little bit of conversation to figure out the order. The first person will just say maybe a minute of reflections. Make space for other people. Don't go on and on, please. Just a minute of reflections or just one nugget. Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds of reflection. And then the next person. And then the next person, and we'll come back to you. So go around and around. So I'm going to create the groups. Please take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Again, no directing. And if you want to say pass, if you don't want to say anything, that's perfectly fine. You can say pass. So here we go. Enjoy, enjoy connecting with others. Here we go. Everybody's back. Welcome back, everyone. And we have opportunity chants for reflections, questions, and also I have the quote. I put the quote actually in. I'll put it in. I read part of it. I didn't read the whole thing, but I'll put it in chat. You can read the whole thing later, but right now, please pay attention to whoever is going to be sharing their reflections. So especially if you haven't spoken yet or for a while, any reflections from the meditation, from the small groups, what to release, what to cultivate, really sit in, for the benefit of all beings and reflections. You can also put your reflections in chat. You can type them. If they're sent to me privately, I changed the settings. Oh, wait, here we go. You can send them to everyone, in which case you will be public, or you can just send them to me privately. And I will just read your reflection, not your name. Just one reflection. No homo means any inspirations from yourself or your fellow practitioners. One of you says, we shared having anxiety about social interactions. Yeah. Thanks for sharing that. One says, cultivating kindness, letting go of worry and concern for the future, requires courage. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. And Bill says, I thought this meditation was very inspiring. And probably Diana is waving her hand, but I don't see you guys because I only see a small strip. So it will be Adelia. And then Diana, if you can find a way to raise your Zoom hand, that way I can actually see you. Adelia, please. Hello. As I practice more, I am beginning to question, or maybe even some of them are slipping away, some of the motivations in my life and what I'm pursuing. And at the moment it's disorienting. You know, I'm not quite sure. It's very uncertain and I'm not quite sure how to structure my life or what to pursue anymore. But so that question of what to let go resonates. And it feels like some of it will just go naturally. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for sharing that. And speaking really from an honest, truthful place of this is what it feels like when I'm letting go of what doesn't really resonate anymore. There is an unsettledness of what now, what is important, what next? And beautiful. Stay there. Because that place of unsettledness, that place of the don't know mind, that place of, okay, I'm letting go of what doesn't quite serve me anymore, but I'm not quite landing elsewhere yet. It's perfectly fine. It's the Bardo. It's like, you know, you've this image of runners when they've leapt, right? They've taken a leap. They're not on land anymore. Like they're in mid-air. And mid-air, actually if you open up, like, wait, where am I? But trust the momentum. Trust the momentum. And that is a rich place to be. One can see it as unsettling, but one can actually see it as a place of possibility. You've left safe land that didn't serve you anymore. So yes, you're opening up to possibility, celebrating that. Thank you for sharing that, Delia. Beautiful. Okay, we'll take a... last reflection. Well, I just want to thank you. This may be repetitive, but I love the simplicity of this meditation and the questions, and especially not knowing. I don't know, and it's okay to not know, and not needing an answer, the answers will come. This is something that I can really work with on a daily basis. So especially for the feeling of unsettled, I just recently, like today, something's left me, and I've been thinking, what's going on here? Where'd that go? What happened to us? So we can be right in the middle of all kinds of processes. Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you so much, Diana. Yeah, thank you. It's just working with all of that. So I'll share a couple of things that have come to me in chat. One person has said, reminding myself I'm only human and doing my best, self-compassion. Beautiful. Yay. One more person says, my group reminded me we must let go of the past. And what's most important is to know that everything is temporary. This made me feel grateful to be sharing in conversation with my group since that too is temporary. And the last, and let's see, one more. I see all that. When will the recording be available? It probably in, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes, as soon as I can, AudioDarma processes it. Let's see, anything else I can quickly say before wrapping up? Yeah, I think that's it. And how to let go of the cloud of unknowing? Well, you don't want to let go of the cloud of unknowing. You want to embrace the cloud of unknowing. That's where it's really, yeah, you want to be in the cloud of unknowing. That's actually where it's juicy. That's where the certainties were like, we're the know-it-all, but cloud of unknowing, the don't-know line. Actually, maybe I'll do a session on the don't-know mind. All right. Yes, and the video is already available. Thank you, Neil, for pointing that out, for having my back. All right, thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice. Thank you so much for your cultivation, you beautiful people. Let us all let go of what's not needed. Embrace what is most important. What our heart is called to cultivating goodness and beauty for the benefit of ourselves and the world. May all beings be well. May all beings be happy. Thanks, everyone. Take good care. See you on Wednesday.
