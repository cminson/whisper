 As we begin this last evening of the retreat, it can be helpful to think of it as the first day of the retreat, starting newly, dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly to being here, to continuity of practice. As you go to bed or continue your formal practice or have a cup of tea, allow yourself to stay close to your body, to have your mind and body in the same place.

I have not encountered another temple as blissful as my own body. And sweet dreams.
