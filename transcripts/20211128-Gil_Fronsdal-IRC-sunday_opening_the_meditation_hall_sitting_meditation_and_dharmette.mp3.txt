 So, maybe before I begin, I can't quite ask the people in the walking hall if you can hear me, but there is volume control in the wall there, so hopefully if you can hear, okay. So welcome, welcome to your meditation place and what I've loved about doing retreats online during the pandemic is how big IRC has become. The meditation hall at IRC is not just this one room here, but it's spread out into all these homes and places all over the world. It's got huge. And then we came back here, the first retreat last week, the meditation hall expanded even more into the walking hall and into the foyer, into the lobby and into what we call the meditation hall now has become so much more. So welcome. And I also include in that welcome the people who are doing this retreat online. Welcome to the retreat and delighted that you're able to participate this way and delighted with Dines supporting the online practitioners. So it's nice to remember that how this meditation hall has really no walls that just kind of expands outward and outward and outward and represents the idea of the inclusive nature that's possible for our awareness, our hearts, our care. And here at IRC, there's no them here, just all us doing the retreat. And what I hope is that all of us together are creating a welcoming environment. It's certainly Andre and Mai and Kirsten and Jonathan's wish to have all of you feel welcomed here and that you belong, that this is a place for this week, that you can feel like it's your meditation place, your meditation home, that you're comfortable here being yourself as you are. And we would like, you know, many people don't feel included or belonging in our society in so many different ways. And so as the walls expand or break down and we hope that this place is a place that we can all hold each other with our respect, our care, our love. And no matter what our differences are, similarities are, whatever background and circumstances of your life. So I'm very happy to have all of you here. I cherish and value each one of you being here and what we're going to create. A couple of things about logistics maybe. One is that I see that there are two chairs over there that are not being sat in and one floor here that's well supported with support cushions. What we'd like to do in the hall is not to have anybody reserve two spots for themselves, one chair and one floor. And I'd rather what we'd like to do is to have a couple of places on the chairs that have a sign that says something like, not reservable. What happened to both signs? They should be here somewhere. We have them already. Not reservable, but first come, first come. So if you come in and it's free you can take it. Because there are so few places here so we can't have people reserving two spots. Those are empty now. I'm trusting that we can maybe put those signs on them. Those two. And there's floated up the idea that the people who have had a lot of experience of being at higher seat before, some of you have been here before, is maybe you're the best candidates for sitting in the walking hall or outside. So the people who are new, some people are new to retreats even, would have the experience of being in here. It's a little more supported that way for them probably. So I don't know how those of you who are here, maybe when you come back tomorrow morning you can self-select yourself to sit in the outer hall or something like that. And finally, the other thing is chairs. These chairs are meditation hall chairs, but you're actually welcome to bring any free chair that you can see. If there's a chair in your room that's a better one to sit on than these chairs, you're welcome to bring that here. The mesh chairs work better for you, black ones. I think there's more in the firecloths next to the men's bathroom there. Anyway, if you need more chairs, you can even bring up the turquoise chairs, if turquoise is his favorite color for sitting on. You can roll it up from downstairs and up here if that works better for your body. You can talk to the managers about other chairs if you have any doubts about it. At the last retreat we did here, we had affinity groups meet on the forest deck during the day and that worked out really well. The weather was a little cooler than it's planning to be for the next few days. So the affinity groups will do the same thing of two affinity groups' sittings scheduled. They're optional. At 1.45, there will be an affinity group for POC, people of color, people of mixed race. And then at 3.15, there will be an affinity group sitting for people who are LGBTQIA+. So it's optional. You're welcome to go if you fit the category, you fit the demographic. And the idea is to have them on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. So we'll announce it again so you'll know when Tuesday is here. On the first day, on Tuesday, for the LGBTQIA+, Kirsten will be there for the first five or ten minutes in order to just get it established and figure out who's going to ring the bell at the end. Just the very simplest things and welcome you. And Kirsten belongs to that demographic of people, so that makes sense. Not only are the teachers POCs, but they'll come to that POC group on the first Tuesday. And just again, just to be there to welcome you and express appreciation that such a group is happening here. I think it strengthens all of us. But mostly to just, again, the simple logistics about bell ringing and things like that. So that's coming. And so if you have any questions about that or concerns, you can let us know. Okay, so... First, I want to check the volume. Can you hear me okay? Is this working okay? The mic has to be a little further away from the mouth than usual with the masks. Yeah, I think it does seem to be... Yeah, it's amplifying here. I want to add my welcome to Gills. As I said, in the opening circle, this is my first in-person retreat since March of 2020. So it feels a little different to be sitting with all of you here in the room and knowing at the same time that there's a cohort of people in the wider world sitting with us too. So welcome. Welcome to you as well. Those of you who've sat retreats here at IRC before know that we often have a theme for our retreats here. Some kind of an orientation for the teachings to flow to follow with during the retreat. This week we decided to have the theme connected to the teachings from the Buddha, from the Buddhist tradition on the foundations of mindfulness, the establishments of mindfulness, the main sutta in which the teachings are described to how to establish mindfulness in a way that supports understanding the way our bodies, our hearts, our minds work, the way they get caught up, tied up in reactivity and ultimately the way of establishing an awareness and attention that allows a releasing of those habits of patterns of tendencies that make us struggle. So there's one key text in the Buddhist teachings. In the Pali it's called the Sati Pitana Sutta. And it talks about how to establish mindfulness in this way that supports understanding freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from suffering. This word Sati, Sati in the name of the sutta, Sati Pitana, is usually or often translated as mindfulness. And certainly in the West we use that word a lot. But what is it? What is mindfulness? What is this quality? We could say a simple basic definition would be being present, being aware. Actually awareness is my preferred definition, my preferred translation for this Pali term Sati. To me that word aware, are you aware? Is there awareness? Has a more kind of evocative feeling, it's more resonant with the experience that's happening when I'm aware than the word mindfulness. Because often awareness to me has a infused quality, a sense of presence perhaps, and an integration perhaps between body and mind. So awareness feels like it's more touching that quality. Mindfulness feels more like it's connected with the head somehow. So that's just me, but I do like to use that word awareness and will be during this week probably using them interchangeably, awareness and mindfulness. So just wanted to let you know that. Experience also sometimes talked about as a witnessing of experience, an observing of experience, connected with experience, feeling into, knowing experience, all of these just kind of different language to connect with what the word means. Or knowing what's happening while it's happening. Maybe that could be a simple working definition for what mindfulness is. Mindfulness, awareness is, I think of it as related to or connected with the, or based on let's say an ordinary capacity of our human minds that we can know what's happening in the present moment, kind of this self-reflective capacity of our awareness. We can know that we know. And yet we often may not be consciously aware of that experience itself. In some ways I think the Buddha was kind of brilliant to connect with that quality, to recognize the value of that quality when it was directed or meeting experience in a particular way. One of my teachers, Sayadaw Utejaniya, the Burmese teacher that I've practiced with, has a phrase, awareness alone is not enough. And I think what that's pointing to or what he's pointing to there is that we can know what's happening in the present moment, but also have an agenda, have an agenda about that, about what we know in the present moment. So take a thief for example. A thief may be very aware walking through a house as they're looking for things they want to take. Very consciously aware of their sound, their noise. And yet the whole motivation behind that being aware is to steal. And the motivation of that thief is not, what does it feel like to be stepping right now? Does it feel like to be touching right now? It is aimed at taking something. And so the motivation, the attitude and mind that's connected with that being present in the present moment is very impactful. And so the teachings in the Satipatthana Sutta give us some clues, give us some support about what we need to be attending to, how we need to be attending more actually than what, how we should attend to experience so that it moves us in this direction of freedom. As I say that the basic kind of orientation we could say around being mindful is to be curious about experience in the present moment as experience in the present moment. That may sound like nothing, but it's a very different perspective than we may have grown up with, let's say. Our usual perspective with awareness is a perspective that includes I, me, mine, and the perspective that we're encouraged in this teaching is more simply to attend to experience. As an experience, what does it feel like to be stepping? What does it feel like to be reaching? What is the experience of the body as a body? This is a perspective that is pointed to in the Satipatthana Sutta. I will be exploring in our reflections this week of two key areas of the Sutta, two key pieces, and then pulling in, bringing in many of the other pieces too. Sutta is structured, teaching is structured beginning with a kind of a definition of what is this mindfulness that we're doing anyway. And then it goes on to describe in four basic areas of experience, body, feeling, mind states, and phenomenon from the perspective of, we could say, perspective of some of the relationships between experience. There's a lot of different practices with each of these four areas of experience, but there's something in common that's running through all of these aspects. And partly what's in common is the how to be attentive, how to be aware. And this is described in a few sentences at the beginning of the Sutta. And for now, I'll just read it to you. I'll read a mixture of translations here, pulling ones that resonate with me. One abides observing the body as a body, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, setting aside greed and distress for the world. One abides observing feeling as feeling. Argent, clearly comprehending and mindful, setting aside greed and distress for the world. One abides contemplating, observing, mind states as mind states. Argent, mindful, clearly comprehending, setting aside greed and distress for the world. One abides observing, phenomena as phenomena. Argent, clearly comprehending and mindful, setting aside greed and distress for the world. And so this points to some of the qualities that are supportive in connection with mindfulness. And we'll explore over some days a little bit of the depth of this phrase. Another kind of repeated piece of the Sutta that we'll explore together is what, I believe it was Bhikkhu, a nalayo christened the refrain. This is a repeated instruction, repeated encouragement to attend to experience that will orient us towards freedom, orient us towards understanding perhaps the more general qualities, characteristics of experience. It's impermanence, it's nature to not be reliable as something for lasting happiness, not self-nature of experience. So this refrain is repeated after every single mindfulness exercise in the Sutta. After the Buddha describes mindfulness of breathing, after the teaching describes mindfulness of breathing, it explores this refrain for basic aspects of experience to see that instruction that experience through. So the body, seeing the body internally and externally. Our own body, perhaps the body of others, there's some different ways this internally and externally can be understood. So exploring internally and externally, exploring the impermanent nature of experience, notice the arising, the passing, the arising and passing of experience. Establishing mindfulness simply to know, bear awareness. And the pointer to abide independent, not clinging to experience. So these instructions are repeated over and over and over again. They're worth paying attention to. So the first part of the encouragement with the Satipatanasuta, my sense of it is that we're encouraged to really establish mindfulness from this perspective of curiosity, curiosity about experience as experience. And with that establishment when there is a little bit of continuity, then the mind can turn towards the deeper understandings that will free our habits and patterns. I think of the definition, this first part that I read to you, one abides observing the body as a body, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, setting aside greed and distress for the world as a description of the establishing of mindfulness. And then the refrain as being, how do we use that mindfulness established in order to see experience to free that reactivity, that habitual tightening of greed, aversion and delusion. So we'll be reflecting on these topics over the next few minutes. Over the course of the week. And yet, the basic practice is pretty simple. You can sometimes take a lot of words to point to something so simple. Can you be with your experience? Has experience. Just breathing and knowing that you're breathing. Sometimes it's that simple. So now we will shift to exploring the refuges and the precepts together. And Kirsten will talk about the refuges and see if this will. I think we can use this one Gil. How's this volume? Great. Okay. So at the beginning of retreat, we often invite the taking of refuge. So this practice of taking refuge together in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. And Andrea was just speaking to what we might notice when we bring our attention to the present moment. The arising and passing of everything, of thoughts and emotions, of phenomena. So this question or invitation to take refuge, what is it that we take refuge in when we really sense the impermanence of things? Refuge really connotes something that we trust. A place where we're free from harm, free from danger. Something we can really give our hearts to. So in this practice, we invite the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha as three jewels, three things that we can really put our hearts toward and consider a form of refuge of safety. So the Buddha can be interpreted in a couple of ways. One is the Buddha himself and this inspiration of a man who freed his heart and mind completely of delusion, of fear, of anger, and knowing that own capacity, our own innate capacity for that kind of freedom. So we can take refuge in the Buddha for these reasons. And the Dharma also, the Dharma can be considered the actual teachings of the Buddha, this map that he offered, and the real beauty of being on this articulate path towards freedom. And then Dharma as the way things are. When we take refuge, can we surrender to the way things are? Sangha is our spiritual community and here on retreat we have this amazing opportunity both to be with people and practitioners in the flesh, some of us, and others who are connected in virtual, magical ways. We have this Sangha that is without walls. And for those of us who are sharing this particular center, we can really be buoyed by each other's practice, by the keeping the noble silence and really recognizing and reflecting on the sincerity of other people's practice, that that can really help inspire us and fortify our faith when our energy runs low. And likewise those who are perhaps alone in their spaces physically but who are connecting through all of these different ways and knowing that there's others here practicing. And this form of Sangha really could take refuge in knowing that we're not alone and that we have that support, that spiritual support. So this is a moment and invite you also to perhaps reflect on the triple gem, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha as refuge throughout the retreat. But right now we'll have an opportunity to together bring our minds and hearts together and really voice our commitment to this, our place of solace, of rest, of faith together. And we'll chant these refuges and call and response and they're in the language of Pali. So just to share what you'll be saying if you do choose to speak these aloud or hum them if that's easier. And the beginning we'll be giving homage to the Buddha, for the blessed, noble, perfectly enlightened one and then we will go to the three refuges three times to the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. And we'll repeat that phrase three times with a little preamble of for the second time and for the third time. So again this will be call and response and maybe just taking a moment to find in your own heart that sense of refuge for you where you bring your faith, where you bring your hearts. Namo Tasa.

Good, thank you. So I'm going to be talking a little bit about the five precepts. And then I'll go through each of the five precepts and then we will collectively make our commitment to following the five precepts. It may be helpful to keep in mind that these are not rules. They're not meant to be rigid rules that we follow. They're guidelines. It's a way of protecting our sila, protecting our virtue, making ourselves safe for others. There's a wonderful result that comes when we practice, when we follow these five precepts, these five training guidelines. And the result is non-remorse. Non-remorse is a condition out of which tranquility arises. And out of tranquility, concentration arises. So when we follow these training guidelines, these precepts, it's a wonderful support for our practice of mindfulness. And our practice of mindfulness supports us remembering to stay in touch with these precepts. So there's this really wonderful way that this can work together, being mindful, remembering the precepts, and the precepts supporting our practice. So you can think of these five training guidelines really, it's how we can conduct ourselves in a way that is non-harming. And so with the first we refrain from intentionally harming any living beings, even insects. And again, this is an invitation to really explore the wisdom here. And then to refrain from taking or borrowing what is not freely offered, and also to accept what is offered. So if you've been practicing, you feel very familiar with refraining from not stealing, not taking what isn't borrowed, or what isn't offered, then maybe just consider how you can practice with this particular precept and really accepting what is offered, really inviting what is offered, being present with that. And the third, abstain from any sexual activity during retreat. Practice noble silence to refrain from harming by one's speech. In this particular precept we can consider just how we are, even within ourselves, noticing that internal commentary, the internal dialogue, and not causing harm. Again, just being mindful, watching. And the fifth precept, to abstain from using alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicants that cloud the mind. This does not apply to any prescription medication that you might be taking, but again, these guidelines for practice, they invite us to really bring this quality of attentiveness and observe. I think the one interesting thing really is, as you're practicing, you can really see how this leads to non-remorse, and how it is a way of guarding and protecting your virtue, making yourself safe for others and taking care with yourself and others. A way of practicing care. It is a gift that we give ourselves, this non-remorse. And so we will formally take these precepts together, making your commitment while we are here on retreat together. As we form this Sangha, we create this container. And an important part of protecting the container is following the precepts. So this will also be a call and response, but this is just offered in English and spoken. So I invite you to join me here. I undertake the training to refrain from killing living beings. I undertake the training to refrain from taking what is not given. I undertake the training to refrain from intentional sexual activity. I undertake the training to refrain from false speech and practice noble silence. I undertake the training to refrain from taking intoxicants, which cloud the mind and cause heedlessness. So we will finish our time together in the hall this evening at this moment. The hall is of course always open. The sitting spaces we have are always open. And as Gil said earlier today, you can take some amount of effort to arrive. All of the packing, the traveling, the work, I know I've been going since early this morning to get here. So we hope that you will rest well this evening. And we'll see you in the morning. I don't know if it's needed, but I always do it. So I'm going to do it again. Those of you who are practice leaders, because sitting up here to ring the bell, you either sit where I'm sitting here, or you can sit on this chair here. Or this one over there. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's all changed because of this new system we have for the video. So yeah, so if you want to sit in the chair, you sit over there. And if you want to sit here and exit this spot. And then if, and tomorrow is a really good schedule is here, a piece of paper. And I'd recommend that since tomorrow is the first day you do it, check the schedule to make sure you know when it ends. Because it's not uncommon for people to ring it to either 15 minutes too early or 15 minutes too late. Then it's scheduled here. So just because it's variable different sittings, how long they are. So please check. And finally, if you've never rung this bell before, come up here during a break and experiment. Because what it's very common also, people know before, well, I hit it for they think is likely. And it's a big clang. Really large results people. And you can't undo that. But if you do it really softly, so people can hardly hear it, then you can redo it. And they got for it. So, ring the bell softly and then build up the volume until you feel it's just right. So thank you.
