The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I thought we'd start with a brief meditation,
because after all we're going to be talking about mindfulness and concentration,
so let's do a little bit of it first.
Close your eyes.
I think thoughts of goodwill.
Goodwill is a wish for happiness.
A wish that people will act on the causes of happiness,
people here meaning yourself as well as others.
In particular, it's a wish for true happiness,
which is something special,
because the causes for true happiness come from within,
which means that your true happiness does not have to conflict with the true happiness of anyone else.
In fact, they nourish one another.
So you just pose that thought in the mind,
may I find true happiness?
And then start spreading it around.
First to people who are close to your heart,
parents, family, very close friends,
may they find true happiness too.
And then spread those thoughts out in never-widening circles,
people you know well and like,
people you like even though you don't know them so well,
people you're more neutral about,
and people you don't like.
Remind yourself the world would be a much better place
if everyone could find true happiness within.
And then spread thoughts of good will to people you don't even know.
And not just people, living beings of all kinds,
from East, West, North, South, above and below, out to infinity.
So you will find true happiness in our hearts.
As I said just now, true happiness is found within.
It's found by developing your inner resources.
So now take a moment to check and see what inner resources you've got right here right now.
You've got the body sitting here breathing,
and you've got the mind thinking and aware.
So for those qualities to grow, you want to bring them together.
Think about the breath and be aware of the breath as it comes in and goes out.
Notice where you feel the process of breathing.
And pose the question, is it as comfortable as it could be?
You might want to experiment.
Try a couple of good, long, deep in and out breaths.
And if long breathing feels good, keep it up.
If not, you can allow the breath to find other rhythms.
Long in, short out, short in, long out, or short in, short out, or shorter, longer.
Keeper, more shallow, heavier, lighter, faster, slower.
Get a sense of the range of possibilities for how the breathing could feel right now.
When you found a rhythm that feels good, stick with it.
And it may feel good for a while, in which case you have to keep adjusting.
And that's an important part of breath meditations, the adjusting.
Otherwise it starts getting mechanical, everything goes on automatic pilot,
and your attention wanders someplace else.
Try to stay on top of the question,
what kind of breathing would feel really good right now, right now, right now,
and see how the changes in the body will change the needs for different rhythms,
different textures of breathing.
When you found a rhythm that feels good,
you can start exploring how it feels in the rest of the body.
Because the next step in traditional breath meditation instructions, as we'll see today,
is to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in,
to train yourself to be aware of the whole body as you breathe out.
And a good way to build up to that is to go through the body section by section,
to familiarize yourself with how the breathing feels in the different parts of the body.
A good place to start is down around the navel.
Locate that part of the body in your awareness and watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out.
If you notice any tension or tightness in that part of the body, allow it to relax.
Any sense of blockage, think of it dissolving away.
When we talk of the breath here, it's not just the air coming in and out of the lungs,
but it's the whole energy flow in the body that accompanies the breathing.
You may find that one way of relieving any tension you sense down around the abdomen
is to think of breath energy coming in and out of the body right there at the navel.
Okay.
Then move your attention up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach,
and follow the same three steps there.
In other words, one, locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Two, watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out.
And then three, if you notice any tension or tightness, think of it dissolving away.
Any sense of blockage, think of that dissolving away.
All the way through the in-breath, all the way through the out,
no tension builds up as you breathe in and you're not holding onto any tension as you breathe out.
Okay.
Okay.
Now move your attention up to the middle of the chest and follow the same steps there.
Okay.
Okay.
Now bring your attention to the base of the throat
and then follow the same steps there.
Okay.
Now bring your attention to the middle of the head
and try to be very gentle with your focus here.
Don't press down too hard because the nerves of the head tend to be overworked.
And here think of the breath energy coming in and out,
not only the nose but also the eyes, the ears,
and from the back of the head down from the top of the head.
Very gently working through any patterns of tension you may feel around the jaws, around your eyes,
in your forehead.
Working through those patterns of tension and slowly dissolving them away.
Okay.
Now focus your attention at the back of the neck.
Then as you breathe in, think of the breath energy going down both shoulders,
going through both arms, down to both hands.
That's for the in-breath and for the out-breath.
Think of the breath energy just dispersing into the air.
And if you're one, as you're focusing on these two parts of the body,
compare them to see which side tends to have more tension, more tightness,
and think of relaxing it.
Compare the two shoulders, compare the two elbows, compare the two wrists, the two hands.
And relax whichever side seems to have more tension.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Now continue focusing on the breath coming in at the back of the neck.
And this time, however, think of it going down the back, both sides of the spine, down to the tailbone.
And then as you breathe out, think of the breath energy dispersing from the spine out into the air.
And again, as you maintain your awareness of the spine,
notice which side of the back seems to hold more tension.
In the upper back, which side has more tension.
In the lower back, which side has more tension.
And wherever you see those great attention, think of it relaxing.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Now move your focus down at the base of the spine.
This time, think of the breath energy going down from that spot down both legs out to the feet.
Through the hips, through the knees, through the ankles, and out to the tips of the toes.
And again, as you breathe out, think of the breath energy just dispersing in all directions out into the air.
And compare your left hip with your right hip, your left knee with your right knee, your left ankle with your right ankle.
Your left foot with the right foot, whichever side seems to be more tense, think of that side relaxing.
Okay.
Okay.
Now complete one course of the body.
If you're meditating on your own, you could go back and do it again as many times as you like.
For the time being, choose any one spot in the body where you've been focused just now, whichever one seems most congenial, easiest to focus on.
If you have more attention to settle there, then think of it spreading out to fill the whole body so you're aware of the whole body breathing in and the whole body breathing out.
Each time you breathe in, each time you breathe out.
Your awareness will have a tendency to shrink, so keep reminding yourself, whole body as you breathe in, whole body as you breathe out.
And that's all you have to do. Maintain that broad but centered awareness.
It's healing for the body, healing for the mind.
And that's with any medicine.
Like a cream for a rash. You don't just put it on and wipe it off.
You give it time to do its healing work.
