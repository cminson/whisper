The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening.
It's nice to be here
with you all.
It's nice to be here.
There we go. This always seems like there's one little
extra gizmo that needs my attention.
Hmm.
Just a warm welcome for
everybody, wherever it is that you are.
Whether you're here on this side
of the continent, or on the other side
somewhere in the middle, or on another continent
altogether. Warm welcome.
And we'll
begin with a guided meditation.
So maybe beginning with a few
long slow deep breaths
as a way to connect
with our experience.
Sometimes
the exaggerated movements
a big breath
as a way to get our attention
back.
It might also be the case
over the big exhale
might be a certain amount of letting go.
A little bit of relaxing.
And if you haven't already
to allow the breath to return
to normal,
trusting that the
body knows how to breathe,
we don't need to do anything
for a breathing.
And then to settle in to this moment
how does it feel this moment?
The general feeling
of what it's like to be here
sitting.
Maybe there's a sense of delight
made it to the cushion.
Maybe there is a
sense of restlessness
feeling like not quite ready
to settle down.
Whatever our experience is
can we allow it to be there
open to it, welcome it?
After all, it is already there.
And noticing that
some movements of the heart,
mind, body to push away
some experiences
or to pull in
some experiences,
that's extra.
Is there a way that
can soften or let go
whatever might be extra at this moment?
Settling
into our experience
Settling
into our experience
the experience of
having a body
that breathes.
Settling
into our experience
of having a body that breathes.
Settling
in some kind of way to inhabit
our experience
rather than maybe hovering around
or flying around even.
Is there a way in which we might
land, softly land
onto the experience?
Feeling connected
to what's happening?
Feeling connected
to this moment?
Settling
into our experience
of having a body that breathes.
Feeling connected
to what's happening?
Feeling connected to what's happening?
Feeling connected to what's happening?
Settling
And if you find yourself lost in thought
just very simply,
gently begin again
with the
experiences of the body, or if that's your practice, the sensations of breathing.
This practice is very simple, just noticing, being aware of the present moment experience.
And is there a way in which we can let go?
Let go of all the things that make it not simple. Everything that's extra.
The judgements, the self-talk, the story making, in favor of moving towards the freedom of just being here,
the sensations of breathing, the bodily experience.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Keeping things simple.
Just noticing the sensations of breathing, whether that's the movement of the chest or the abdomen,
or maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose,
or maybe feeling what it feels like to be embodied, to be enlivened with some sense of presence in the body.
No need to make it complicated.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Sometimes it's helpful to remind ourselves that this practice can be very simple,
and we can let go of the movement towards piling on more ideas of how it should be piling on
our ideas of what it should not be.
As best we can, can we open to what this moment is revealing?
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Is there a way in which there might be some letting go, some shedding?
In a relaxed, easy way of whatever isn't needed right now.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
Let go of all the things that make it not simple.
So that we can take care of ourselves and take care of others in a way that's helpful and supportive.
And this way this practice is for the benefit of all beings everywhere.
Thank you.
