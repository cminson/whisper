The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, yesterday morning's teachings on karma are an important aspect of Buddhism,
and to appreciate that all our actions have consequences and to be careful of what we do,
and to do the things that are health producing, that are wholesome and helpful, supportive,
that move us towards freedom, and to avoid those who do the opposite.
So this is an important teaching, but it can be heard as if now we have to get to work.
Like, this is a lot of work now.
Every single action I have to track and monitor and think about and try to do it just the right way.
And so it can be taken as a teaching that you have to kind of work.
And sometimes it can even be exhausting just to hear this kind of teaching,
because if the implication is a lot of working.
And sometimes it'd be pastana, inside meditation practice in general, when it's taught,
it might lend itself to the idea that there's a lot to do.
There's a lot of instructions, and you can hear all the instructions,
and you can ask yourself, what do I do now?
Do I do this now?
Now there's a lot of emotions, and what am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to go through the list of the different raft or rain or whatever it might be?
And it could be done just keeping or end up being busy.
But that's not how it's supposed to be.
And I think that closer to the idea is what we did in this meditation,
is to find some degree of calm or peace or ease,
and let that be the reference point for not making things worse.
To recognize that when the mind gets caught up in preoccupations,
in a sense you're losing touch with that peace and that ease.
You're not being peaceful anymore.
And in a sense you're making things worse.
If you start, you're peaceful, but then you start rushing,
and feel tense in the rushing, in a sense you're making things worse.
You start complaining about something, in a sense you're making things worse,
maybe for yourself and for someone else.
And so to have this reference point of some degree of peace and calm,
and have that as a reference, don't make it worse.
And it's not a lot of work to do this.
It's more like stay close to the peace, stay attentive,
and notice when it becomes not peaceful,
when it becomes agitated, when it becomes stressful,
when it becomes contracted or tense.
And with time, we start becoming quite sensitive and familiar
with the feeling, the sensations, the experience of things getting tense
or tight or contracted or agitated.
And we recognize it early and earlier, and then question,
is it really necessary to do this?
And maybe not.
Come back to the peace.
You can still do things and take care of things,
but do things from this calm place.
And so the attentiveness of mindfulness,
this attention to the moment and to the consequences,
can be very simple.
It means stay calm and peaceful the best you can,
and notice when you lose it.
And probably if you lose it, you're making the situation worse.
And one of the fundamental principles of this karma teachings
is don't make it worse.
Whether you can make it wonderful for people
or do wonderful things for the world,
that might be difficult to figure out
and kind of burden to carry that responsibility.
It's nice to be supportive and do nice things for people, for sure.
But the minimum is don't make it worse.
Making it worse is probably some kind of activity.
We have to work to make it worse.
And so if we're a little bit hesitant to do meditation
because it seems like a lot of work,
it's overlooking all the work that we do
that makes situations worse for ourselves and for other people.
And don't make it worse.
And then trust this place of calm or peace or subtleness.
And if you have this reference point of some modicum of peace and calm,
and again, it doesn't have to be dramatic.
It might be that you're quite agitated,
but a little bit you have a sense, a sliver of calm,
you have some sense of what it is.
That becomes a better reference point to highlight how you are tense,
how you are contracted or agitated.
And then to stop and take a good look at that,
become familiar with that.
That's when we bring our attention to.
Sometimes my instructions that I give myself,
sometimes in meditation or in daily life,
is I stop for suffering.
I go about my life peacefully, happily along,
but if I start suffering, if I start getting agitated or tense,
that becomes a mindfulness bell.
Okay, here's something I should pay attention to now.
I should notice.
Here's something for me to learn.
What did I just do?
What did I just believe?
What is arising out of me?
What's the reactivity that's happening here?
And those questions of investigation of looking at it
begins to take some of the authority away from it,
some of the automatic nature of it,
so that I don't have to kind of go barreling into
or participate in this suffering-producing kind of state that I'm in.
For some people,
there's very strong counter-forces to being peaceful and calm.
And one of them is a belief that it's not okay.
And the belief that we're supposed to be agitated,
or I'm so a terrible person that I have to kind of make up for it
and just kind of really try to run around and fix everything up
and make everything safe and everything good and tidy.
And being peaceful just means that I'm lazy
or good for nothing or something.
And my worth is only found in doing.
And so if I don't do something,
I will have no inner worth.
And this piece implies some kind of not-doing.
And so that, then where's my worth if I just sit and be calm?
And this is, you know, not necessary to think this way,
because it's possible to do all the things we are supposed to do,
our responsibilities with our calm, with peacefulness.
We can do it peacefully. We can do it calmly.
And some people have found that they do things better that way.
It's more effective.
It has a better impact on others and on oneself.
But by the time some activity is over,
we feel more settled or more focused.
Then if we did it an agitated way,
and the time is over, we feel exhausted by it, tense by it.
So this idea that Buddhist practice is a lot of work
is a misunderstanding that's easy to come up with.
And I like to think of it as almost the opposite.
It's like the undoing of work.
It's the undoing of all the different forces that are work,
that are exhausting or tiring,
and discovering a place of ease from which we can do things.
And enjoy it.
And find that's a wonderful place to be,
and trust it in some deep, profound way.
So in this way, the instructions in meditation that we give
sometimes are not really prescriptive,
less than what we do, and more what we notice.
Less what we're doing, but more what we're undoing.
So if the attention is to breathing,
then it's noticing how we add extra work to breathing,
to the attention to breathing, like we're trying too hard,
and trusting that it's possible to do it in a peaceful way,
in a relaxed way.
If you bring attention to our body,
feeling that we have to fix every ache and pain in the body,
and so we get busy trying to focus on pain
and get rid of the pain and do something with it,
and as opposed to just being peaceful with discomfort.
Oh, I'm supposed to pay attention to discomfort.
Let me do it peacefully, and no agenda, no work.
Emotions, all these wonderful instructions we give on emotions
can seem like a lot of work.
But what is it like to be with emotions in a peaceful, calm way,
and to use the instructions and emotions
to support a peaceful way, a calm way?
And thinking, you know, a lot of thinking makes it worse,
a lot of thinking is difficult and stressful.
But what is it like to hold that peacefully and look upon it kindly,
and not be too caught and preoccupied by it?
So,
our actions make a difference, our actions have consequences,
and the actions that are done peacefully will have peaceful consequences,
at least locally.
And the actions that are done in an agitated way,
un-peacefully, will have un-peaceful consequences.
So hopefully that simple teaching will encourage you
to stay peaceful and not to use Buddhism as a lot of work.
It can be ongoing, it can be continuous, it can be the center of our life,
but it's more of an undoing than a doing.
It's kind of like we put a lot of work in to stay at ease
and stay close to the place of ease.
And there's a paradox there, if you put a lot of work into that,
you can't get tense in order to be at ease,
but you can't have a continuous attention,
you can have a heightened awareness that keeps you close to that place of ease and peace,
a heightened awareness which is itself an expression of that peace itself.
And that becomes a protection.
And this easeful mindfulness is really a protection,
it becomes a shield from all the ways that we get cut up in excessive work
in the mind and the heart.
So thank you.
And if you take one thing from this talk,
live a life where you don't make it worse,
whatever situation you're in, don't make it worse.
So I look forward to coming back tomorrow,
and next week I'll start the Satipatana Sutta,
I'll start the instructions on the Buddhist instructions
on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness,
and we'll go through it probably over a few weeks,
like we did last year with Anapana Sati.
Thank you.
