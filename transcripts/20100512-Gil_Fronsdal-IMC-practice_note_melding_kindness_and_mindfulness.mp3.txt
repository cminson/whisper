Mindfulness

In mindfulness meditation and practice, the attitude with 
which we ’re mindful is very important. The attitude is 
like the wings that carry the mindfulness, or support it.  
There are many different attitudes that a person could 
connect to mindfulness. Some of them are not very 
helpful. Unhelpful attitudes , for example, involve self -
criticism in the background of the mindfulness  – feeling  
bad about oneself one way or another . Another way 
that’s not so helpful is an attitude of “I have to. ” “I have 
to get concentrated. ” “I have to get enlightened in the 
sitting. ” “Something has to happen. ” There’s perhaps 
striving and pushing – a kind of ambition .  
 
When there ’s an attitude of striving, self -criticism, 
aversion, anger, or a lot of judg ments regarding  what ’s 
going on, it ’s not very inviting to be in the present 
moment , because that moment has discomfort as part 
of it. One of the thi ngs that i s helpful to do in practicing  
mindfulness is to pay a bit of attention to the attitude , 
and bring in an attitude that, maybe, would make you 
more happy to be present . The pre -eminent attitude that is useful is kindness – to infuse  the mindfulness with 
some feeling of kindness, a kind regard, a good will 
towards what you ’re experiencing.  
 
There ’s a wonderful melding of kindness and 
mindfulness where , at som e point, the mindfulness itself  
and kindness seem  to be  distinguishable, but 
inseparable. It seems like they arise together. To be 
really present here, to be mindful and  attentive to what ’s 
going on, in a very clear, grounded way, is a kind act . 
This kindness comes through it. If you ’re really kind, in a 
very grounded, strong, bala nced way, without being 
overly sentimental, or sentimental at all, or hesitant, 
there will  be a lot of mindfulness as part of that as well.  
 
As you practice this morning, see if there is some way 
that y ou could, appropriately call in to your practice, to 
your ability to be in the present moment, an attitude, or 
an approach of being kind towards whatever might be 
going on, including your lack of kindness. Meet tha t with 
some open kindness, good will, and gentleness , and see 
if that can help you be mindful, to be present.  
 
If it’s impossible to be kind , then that ’s okay. Then the 
practice is to be mindful of what ’s in the way , and to be 
kind towards that.
