The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, welcome, welcome.
Very pleased to be here with you all since it's been a while since I've been here.
And tonight I was thinking of talking a little bit about getting triggered.
And we all get triggered at times, like our people push our buttons, or someone cuts us off in traffic, and we might get angry.
Or a friend is late for an appointment, and we might get impatient.
Or, you know, we all know the feeling of seeing the news, getting frustrated, all these triggers.
What we normally don't really pay that much attention to is that we also get triggered into more beautiful or wholesome states of mind.
Maybe when we see a flower on the side of the road, and a sense of wonder might get triggered, or we start our meditation and we kind of get into our posture.
And we feel a sense of settledness coming up, or we get a hug from someone and we might feel warm.
So, because of what is sometimes called negativity bias, we tend to pay more attention to these negative triggers, and not so much to the, yeah, the nice, beautiful wholesome triggers.
But that's something that we can change.
Because we can make a choice to pay more actively attention to the times that we get triggered into wholesomeness into these beautiful states of mind.
And maybe I shouldn't really use the word trigger in this sense, because it seems to have this connotation of negativity to it, at least for me.
So, I was thinking of a word that might be better and I was thinking of maybe wholesome invocation, that it might be a beautiful way of saying it.
So we can become more mindful of these times that we do experience these wholesome invocations.
And when we do that, we can start to get into a positive feedback loop, because the Buddha says, this is a quote, whatever one frequently thinks and ponders upon, that becomes the inclination of the mind.
So, if we more frequently start to pay attention to these wholesome invocations, then this wholesomeness will become the inclination of the mind.
So, in that sense, we can get ourselves into a positive feedback loop.
Besides just paying attention to whenever these wholesome invocations happen naturally, we can also induce them actively.
And there is really nothing wrong with actively inducing wholesomeness.
It can actually be a very skillful means, because even like here in happy hour, we often practice metta or one of the other Brahma viharas.
And this actually is an active way of inducing wholesomeness.
And there are several ways we can invoke wholesomeness next to practicing the Brahma viharas, and a few to name for inspiration.
We actually choose to engage in activities that we know will invoke wholesomeness.
And those activities might be different for each of us.
And some that I can think of are like spending time in nature, spending time with friends or loved ones, meditating in general and also meditating on the Brahma viharas.
Making a bath, exercising or reading a book.
And another way that we can invoke wholesomeness is by reflecting on our own wholesome qualities, qualities like kindness, generosity, virtue, compassion, that kind of kind of qualities to name a few.
And these kind of reflections, we can often think like, oh, might be a little egoistic or selfish to start thinking about how generous I am or how virtuous I am.
But it's actually something that the Buddha recommends to do every once in a while to generate these wholesome states of mind.
And it's not like we're saying like, oh, how amazing am I, it's more like we start to see that we're valuable and that we can love ourselves and accept ourselves the way we are.
And then a third way to invoke wholesomeness is to bring up a memory which we experienced a wholesome state of mind.
And in a bit, I will guide you through reflection like that.
But before we start the meditation, I'd like to end with a quote by Gil Fronstel.
And he says, we do not need to leave well-being to chance.
In Buddhism, it is considered appropriate and helpful to cultivate and enhance our well-being.
We often overlook the well-being that is easily available in daily life.
Even taking time to enjoy one's tea or the sunset can be a training in well-being.
This is what I wanted to share as an introduction for tonight.
And then we can start the meditation.
So you can start by settling into your meditation posture.
Close your eyes if it feels appropriate for you.
Then you can start taking a few deeper breaths.
You can see if we can let go of tension on the outbreath as far as possible.
You can return to a normal breathing if you haven't already.
Become aware of the body.
The body is sitting here.
The body that's here for you.
No matter what kind of things might be going on in the body.
It's here, it's alive, it's breathing.
You can tune into areas in the body where there is some tension or discomfort or pain.
And with the attitude of gentleness and kindness and compassion,
I tend to do that part of the body that might be in pain or is in discomfort.
Or there's maybe some tension.
It doesn't have to change.
It's just a message, like it's okay.
With this part, the body can be just as it is.
I want to settle a little bit further in the meditation.
I can pay close attention to the breath for a while.
Nothing else is needed.
Only attention for the breath.
We can excuse ourselves of all the worries, things on our to-do list
and just only pay attention to this in-breath
and this out-breath.
Know that if the breath is not something that works for you,
you can also pay attention to sounds in the same way.
Or to a anchor that you're used to, meditation objects.
For most of us, the breath will work.
Every time the attention gets distracted,
we can bring it back with kindness
and pay attention to this, only this in-breath.
And then only this out-breath.
Thank you.
Now slowly let go of the breath.
Now what you can do now is bring to mind
or let yourself feel into what quality of mind
you would like to cultivate in this meditation.
Could be peace or joy, generosity, ease, kindness
or something else.
If you've chosen a quality of mind that you'd like to cultivate,
a wholesome state of mind that you'd like to invoke,
bring to mind a memory where you felt this specific quality
a moment in your life.
Could be reason, could be longer ago, it doesn't matter too much.
But what happened when you were feeling this quality of mind, heart?
What was the situation?
Maybe there were other people present.
Maybe there were sounds, smells.
We were seeing things.
And what did you feel like in the body
when this quality of heart and mind was present?
Let's see if you can really connect to this memory.
Let it sink in to this moment.
Can you find this quality of heart and mind?
In this moment.
Let it sink into the body.
Let it infuse the body.
Let it free-sell the body.
You can take a snapshot of what this feels like in body and mind.
Like an imprint that you can come back to whenever you need, whenever you want.
Like you're taking a photo of this moment.
You can just enjoy whatever is present right now for you.
You can hang out here, however long you like.
If you feel like it, you can also share some of this with other beings, maybe a specific being.
Or maybe all beings.
Maybe the others in this group.
Maybe they also experience this quality of heart and mind, this joy or this ease, this kindness.
And that's where it is.
You can also feel free to let go of this reflection, invocation.
And return to the breath or another familiar meditation objects.
Maybe some metathrases.
Maybe you can continue this meditation in a way that feels like most supportive for you right now.
Which could be continuing with the memory, with the sharing of the feeling.
Maybe it's your own meditation, something that feels right for you.
Whatever brings you ease, relaxation, happiness.
That's not so available for you, whatever helps you to be with difficulty.
There's a lot of space here to hold whatever is up for you right now.
Whether it's the wholesome quality of mind and heart.
Or whether it's something else that is more up for you.
All is allowed to be here.
Allowing whatever is here is also a way of evoking wholesomeness.
It's a kindness towards ourselves.
We'll continue in silence.

Welcome back.
Thank you for watching.
Feel inspired.
Maybe something you want to share from the group.
That's pretty impressive.
That's pretty impressive.
I was able to bring back to my consciousness moments in my life in the past where I felt these feelings of well-being, amazing feelings of well-being.
And along the way, I really couldn't hang on to them because there were other body sensations that were coming up that were painful.
As a matter of fact, because I worked like a 12-day work thing today.
I was not able to hang on to those feelings of well-being because my body was hurting in different parts.
And I found myself moving my body so I could feel more comfortable to keep on meditating.
I'm in my car, by the way, and in New Jersey.
For me, the thing here is to be able to be with whatever arises and not be thrown off by it.
Because I think I really was being thrown off by all these other sensations that were not pleasant at all.
So I need to remember that I can't necessarily hang on to those feelings of well-being.
Yeah, that's important to realize we can't hang on to it.
It's just like everything that arises and passes away.
We can invoke it and it sounds like you could feel it, but you just didn't last, which is perfectly fine.
Even just a little bit of a tiny moment of this wholesome quality might already be really nice.
And then back to the reality of the body that's in pain, that's the current reality.
Like I said at some point, giving space to whatever is here, whatever needs to express itself.
And trying to be with that from a kind space as much as we can.
Because we don't control the pain in our body and our response to that.
So yeah, totally understand your experience.
Does that make sense?
Yes.
Yeah.
Being kind for ourselves in the pain we might be in, whether it's bodily, whether it's mental, psychological pain.
We can all come up, we can't really control what is happening and we can't hang on to wholesome state of mind.
So we can invoke them.
We can help them, nudge them, come into being with some of the skills that I mentioned earlier.
But we can't control if it actually happens or if it stays.
So very important point, thank you for naming this.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Anything else in the last couple minutes?
Just like to share.
I wanted to tell you, unmute yourself, I see.
Yeah, yeah, I wanted to thank you for that.
Meditation, I found it extremely helpful.
And I was surprised, you know, as I shared in my little group, like I came to meditation in a pretty agitated state.
And usually it's really hard for me to settle my nervous system and my mind when I come to meditation like that.
But I was very surprised, your guidance was very helpful and I just, I got so calm and relaxed, more than I usually do.
And I'm, and that was wonderful.
And I really like this idea of, you know, again, even though we can't hang on to them, but at least invoking for whatever time period they last these kinds of states and so I set the intention to invoke peace.
And surprisingly, it actually worked.
Yeah, that was really wonderful. And, you know, we'll see if I can do that on my own without someone guiding me, but your guidance certainly helped a lot.
Yeah, that's wonderful. Thank you for sharing. And yeah, I can, I can be really powerful, powerful way of settling and even like starting a meditation.
That's the quality that I want to invoke in this meditation and then there's really nothing, nothing wrong with doing that actively. It's actually very supportive for our practice, and for our path that we're on so yeah, make use of it.
It's also maybe important like to mention to not not cling to that always needs to happen or like then becoming like disappointed if it doesn't doesn't work the way it works today or that's kind of a thing we can we can fall into great.
It's something to watch out for. It will be the way it will be next time. It's just a tool in a toolbox that we can use. Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks everyone.
I because I came late. I have made. Are you going to put this in the audio Dharma. Yeah.
We've come to the end of our time together.
