So the practice of letting go is a powerful teacher. Learn to let go, and you can be
available more fully for our life, for compassion, for wisdom to arise. Practicing
letting go starts revealing all the ways in which we hold on, all the ways in
which we cling, grasp, hold on. And it's hard to see that in daily life often, but
in meditation we can see the subtlety of it, the consistency of it, how easy it is
for the mind to wander off into some kind of concern. And it might seem
innocent enough some of our preoccupations, but it still involves some
part of us is interested in our thoughts, our fantasies, our imaginations, the past,
the future. And that interest involves some kind of desire, some kind of wish
that can be mild, innocent enough. It could also be strong and intense. If there's
a anger about something, sitting in meditation and the mind just can't drop
thinking about what happened and what someone said, and the intensity of
holding on, being concerned about is so strong. But one of the things we learn is
the consistency, how subtle, how thoroughly we're always holding on or
something. And in daily life we don't see it so clearly, the minutiae, the
on-goingness of it. In some ways we are being led around, we're being hijacked,
we're being directed by our desires, and there's lack of freedom. We're not
directing the show, our desires are. And so in meditation we can learn how this
works and learn to let go of it. We can start to cultivate, we can
soften the muscle of holding on and clinging, the intensity, the energy
behind it, some of the mental orientations that leads us to cling and
to hold on to things, the inclination to give authority to our thoughts, to the
inclination to see everything through the filter of me, myself, and mine, the
orientation to have opinions that we need to have, we have to have, all kinds
of things we can see. And so in meditation it's a one laboratory to
discover what it's like to let go of it all. Let go, let go, let go. And mindfulness
practice, you know, as we go through the Satya Bhattana Sutta there has been no
real discussion about letting go at this so far. And so the only thing is
at the very beginning it talks about relaxing the body, but otherwise that's
the closest it gets to actually instructing us to let go. The phenomenal
power of the Satya Bhattana is that we are not the agent for change, we're not
the ones who are doing the change, we're the ones who are knowing, showing up for
experience, knowing it well, and then the letting go happens in a deeper way. And
that's how the Sutta is, but it can be very wise to let go if you know how.
And it can also be unwise, there's unwise letting go, letting go of the wrong
things. But what we're focusing on in Buddhism is not letting, not the things
we let go of, we might let go of some things, but rather we're focusing on
the letting go of the clinging to things, the holding on to things. And for this
regard it's helpful to make the distinction between holding on and holding. So
I can hold on to this striker and I can also hold it like this with my hand
flat. So we can hold things in the softness of our hands and now we're
holding it lightly and if it's something that needs to go or is naturally
going away, then it goes. We're not holding on to it. If it's something that
temporarily needs us to use it for a tool or something, then we can grasp it and
do something and then we return to holding it lightly. And so we don't
necessarily have to lose things in letting go. We lose the grasping, the
holding itself, the holding on though we still might hold. So why this is
important in looking at the second, the Four Noble Truths is that the probably
the most popular and common modern interpretation of the Four Noble Truths
is that the Second Noble Truth teaches that craving is the cause of suffering.
That's craving somehow grasping is somehow responsible for how we suffer.
And in this interpretation if the grasping goes away, then that suffering
goes away. It's possible to argue this and say, for example, not all suffering
comes from grasping and clinging. Some suffering, some pain, sadness, grief is
just a natural part of life. A dear loved one dies. The fact that we feel grief
and sadness doesn't have to entail any grasping, clinging. They're just a
natural state. They're losing something that's important to us. But there can in
the grief also be clinging and attachment. And the issue in practice
is how to hold something like grief without holding on to it. And when you
hold it, then grief kind of knows what to do. If we hold on to it, we limit it's
working, it's unfolding. So it's possible to question this whole thing
about that the suffering comes from craving. That's why I like to turn this
interpretation around and say that if you crave, you will suffer. So it's
not that saying that all suffering comes from craving, but rather craving is a
cause for suffering. And part of the reason that I feel confident in saying
this is that craving itself is a form of suffering, is a form of stress on our
system. And so even regardless of what we crave, the thing we're craving, the
act of craving is suffering. But the act of craving also creates habits in the
mind, creates karmic momentum in the mind that will come back and sometimes make
things more difficult in the future. So then learning to recognize what's
called craving and clinging is important. And I like to think of it as
being desire, as being compelling desire. Desire which we seem to not have
any much choice about because it's so compelling, it's so forceful, it's so
insistent. Put it down that immediately comes back. Sometimes try to let it go
and you can't let go of it. Sometimes it has us complete control over us, the
intensity of the addiction desire that we might have. And so some people
find it phenomenally useful, this simple idea, that craving gives rise to
suffering. And if you let go of the craving, that particular suffering goes
away. Suffering that's there, that's not because of craving, that's a whole other
topic. And this is one of the great, I think, teachings of modern Buddhism,
is this focus on craving and clinging and letting go that allows us to really
release a lot of the tension, the stress, the dukkha suffering that we carry with
us in our lives. And so to see that the second noble truth, to understand it as,
so the first one is the truth of suffering. The second one is the truth
that craving is the cause of suffering. And some people in the modern world
also like to say that in this regard, suffering is optional. And pain is not.
Emotional pain not comes with life, but the suffering. Suffering is the, in the
Buddhist language, suffering is the pain that arises because of the clinging.
So if there's pain that has no clinging, then it's, it wouldn't be called dukkha,
wouldn't be called this, this, who wouldn't use the Buddhist word, suffering for it.
So learning to let go. And, and there's two ways, there's dropping something, and
there's letting go of the holding onto it. And one way some people love to do
this letting go practice is not to let go per se, but rather to let be. And this
is closer to what we're doing in Satipatana. Satipatana practice is a
practice of letting everything be and then just seeing it for what it is,
knowing it. And if we think of the knowing, mindfulness as a letting be
practice, I think it adds a richness to, and a depth to the mindfulness that I
think is very, very significant. So letting things be, so letting go of the
holding on to wanting, expecting, measuring ourselves, how are we doing,
wanting it to be different, wanting it to go, something to go away. There's all
these compulsive, compulsive thoughts, ideas that can weigh us down when we do
mindfulness practice. And the idea is to come to a very free or easy or
satisfying place in mindfulness where we let everything just be, and in the
beingness we know it. We let it be and we know what we're allowing it to be. So
whether it's experiences of the body, feeling tones, mind states, the hindrances,
the seven factors of awakening, a lot of it is just letting it be and knowing it
well. And what we discover over time is that the act of this clear, full knowing
while we let things be, it doesn't, it has an impact. It sets in motion,
something begins to unfold and to move and change. I don't know if this is a
good analogy, but if you take carbonated water, a bottle of it, and maybe shake it
first and then remove the lid, then just removing it, letting go of how the
lid holds on and clings to the top of the bottle, then it releases the
pressure of the carbonation, the gas. And so sometimes just letting go releases
something, frees something. Sometimes it allows something healthy to flow and
move. Our psychophysical beings are processes, they're not things. And so
the holding on interferes with the processes, the dynamic nature of this
life that we are. And so letting be is not, doesn't really let things stay the
same. Letting things be allows a process, dynamic process to unfold, which is not
under your direction. And so there is a kind of letting go of direction. Giving
direction is another thing to hold on to. So you might want to look at what
behavior you have today that's compulsive, what thoughts, what words you
speak, what activities you do that you find yourself doing without deliberation,
without care and attention, like something inside of you is kind of taking
the ball and run with it, where you're not free. And what do you need to let go
of or what you need to not hold on to. So you come back to a place of freedom, of
choice, of agency, knowing what you're doing without compulsion, getting in the
way. So stop through the day, take a good look at this, and you'll learn a
lot. So thank you all, and tomorrow I'll offer a different interpretation for the
Second Noble Truth that relates to the Third Noble Truth. Thank you.
