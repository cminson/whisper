The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Excuse me, the topic mudita, sympathetic joy, and you know sometimes
when I think about, you know, joy, I think of kind of like those awkward
family photos where the children are wearing these like very forced, very
artificial smiles that look basically like grimaces, you know, and like be
joyful. Mudita, sympathetic joy is a tricky one. Yeah, it's a tricky one, right?
Because joy is just like this, this spontaneous upwelling. It's a little,
maybe a little trickier to incline the mind in a way that feels spontaneous and
alive. And so I promise not to command you to be joyful, you know. So a colleague,
friend of mine, Tuari Sala, sometimes she's like the queen of mudita, you
know, she sometimes just, I don't know, when she talks about it or guides
something, she just like goes for it. And I wind up in like a slightly
dysregulated ecstatic blur of delight. She's just like sometimes
relentless with it. And anyway, so I wanted to share a little bit of what
she said. This is from a retreat we did a year ago. A couple paragraphs from
her. So she says, we've come to my favorite, favorite moment in all of
Dhamma. I don't know when I opened this Pandora's box. It's not the way I grew
up with this energy. I don't know. Anywhere in my life, I would say, oh,
yeah, joy is what I would call life. I grew up in a very difficult childhood,
spent the bulk of my life poor on welfare. Joy would not be the underlying
feature of experience that I would point out. But somewhere in Dhamma, I
stumbled upon this mudita, and it's been a game changer for me. So let me see if
I can try to help you see where I'm pointing to. There's a great difference
between mudita and the kind of worldly joy that we try to access regularly in
our lives. I imagine that each one of us on this call, there's 56 of us, we all
get two joys, two moments of joy in our lives this year. That's all you get, two
opportunities of joy. And if you're like me, we've already used them up. So
there's no joy for the rest of the year. You've already had it. So the only way
you can access a level of joy is it has to come from someone else. If I start
telling you about some joy I have, because you're human, you'll feel it. If I
begin to cry, you'll feel that. If I tell you about some sadness, some
difficulty in my life, you'll feel that. And likewise, I realized that I could
feel the joy of another person. And there would never be a day or a moment in
time when I would not feel joy. Never. It's not possible. There are like
billions of people on the earth. And at any given moment, somebody somewhere is
experiencing joy. And all I have to do is to be willing to tap into that joy and
feel it with them. My granddaughter is four years old and she's learning about
jokes. And she just starts laughing. She'll say something like, and then they
said, go away. Laughing uproariously. And I'm laughing. And that is not even funny.
But I'm laughing because she's laughing so hard. Like she told some great joke. It's
just another way of experiencing the human condition that we're all
interconnected. So yeah, let us lean on each other's joy. Let us lean on each
other's joy. And amidst pain, it can sometimes feel like joy is a way of
cheating on one's grief. It can feel like a certain kind of adultery, like
cheating on one's grief. But one of the shifts in Dharma practice is that our
emotional life becomes more supple and a moment of joy does not cancel out the
grief. It's just like we are emotional life. It's more, yeah, it's more fluid and
supple. And so a moment of grief can just be followed by peace and then joy. And
then maybe the heart circles back to whatever it's pain it might be connected
to. But the joy is not cheating on the pain. It's okay. And our, we can depart
from our kind of homeostatic baseline into, yeah, maybe even deep joy.
Sometimes it's easier to talk about removing the obstacles to joy
rather than creating joy, right? I can't chide you, you know, smile, be happy, right?
And so instead, the practice is really like to examine, well, what obstructs
mudhita? What obstructs this like delighting in the welfare of others?
Possessiveness, comparing mind and V. The machinations of ego, the reflex of
ego is really to incorporate all goodness into itself. It's like my ego
tolerates no goodness outside itself. It must appropriate everything. That is a
very fragile, dangerous way of living to not tolerate goodness outside oneself or
to need for that goodness to affirm one's own egoic process. That's a fragile way
of living. And so we're gonna have to actually step in some ways out of self
to truly enjoy other people's happiness, to truly enjoy it. Now it just feels
important to acknowledge like mudhita is not a public policy, you know. So when I
say we must relinquish envy or something like this, I am not talking about public
policy. The disparities in health and wealth are not sustainable. What I'm
talking about here, and there's there are very understandable reasons for things
like envy. I'm talking to the heart of a practitioner. We're gonna have to step
out of some of the egoic forces to truly delight in the welfare of others. So
there's an essayist talking about the seven deadly sins, lust, gluttony, greed,
laziness, wrath, pride, envy, and said of the seven deadly sins, only envy is no
fun at all. And isn't that true? Isn't that true? Envy is is usually about two
people and jealousy about three. And wanting someone something has versus
wanting someone some relationship connection in the case of jealousy. And
of course, these forces likely have real evolutionary benefit. Yeah, they've been
encoded in to us. And still, it's important to remember that evolution doesn't
care about enlightenment, even a little. We're here, we're here because we're the
sufferers. Evolutionary psychologist, despite the manifold unhappiness
jealousy creates, jealousy has a crystalline functional logic, precise
purposes and supreme sensibility. It exists today in modern humans because
those in the evolutionary past who were indifferent to the sexual contact that
their mates had with others lost the evolutionary contest to those who became
jealous. As the descendants of successful ancestors, modern humans carry with
them the passions that led to their forebearer success. The legacy of the
success is a dangerous passion that creates unhappiness, but the unhappiness
motivated adaptive action over evolutionary history.
The to move against the the forces of jealousy of envy to move in some ways
against the stream that the dumb is against the stream. And these mechanisms
of the mind and the especially really shows us where we're identified, where
we're identified it and the envy highlights the insanity really of
egoic life. Identification wherever we are identified it impairs our love and
our capacity to access joy, to receive the joy of another in an unthreatening
unintimidating way in a way that does not diminish ourselves, that does not
evoke the comparing mind. This is a mature card. Envy is the product of a wound to
self-importance and the fruit of an illusion. What can other people's
happiness possibly deprive us of? Nothing of course. Only the ego can be wounded
by it and feel it as pain. These are the results of our having forgotten our
innermost potential for affection and peace. When we feel sufficient, when the
kind of all the the egoic melodramas of worthiness and unworthiness of my
deserving, undeserving, when all of that fades we are, we can delight in the
well-being of others. When we're fluid in ourselves and we ask, am I that? No. Am I that? No.
Then there's less and less to defend and the delight of others is totally
unthreatening, just rushes into our heart. Very natural, easeful, joyous. So I offer
this for your consideration.
