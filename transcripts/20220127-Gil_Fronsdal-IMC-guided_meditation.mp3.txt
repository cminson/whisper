 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So, hello again from IRC, Insight Retreat Center. And today I'd like to continue with this practice of knowing and it's important to appreciate there's a range of maybe intensities of knowing or a range of ways we know. Sometimes it's very intentional and directed and sometimes it's unintentional and undirected. Sometimes in practice when it begins, a lot of people find it helpful to have a directed practice just focusing on the breath for a while. And that focusing on the breath kind of allows things to gather and settle around it so that we're not so easily distracted and the mind doesn't wonder so much. And when the mind is stable, that's when it's useful to listen less directed knowing and in a certain kind of way less intentional. Not a knowing that has any quality of work to it or any quality of doing it, but rather it's a knowing that just arises, just is. And so to give you a little maybe taste of this, I know we just haven't even started meditating, but if you just close your eyes the way you are now. And when you make no effort to be aware, but you're awake, you're not falling asleep, what do you know? When awareness is not directed anywhere, what is known? What comes into awareness? Is it the sound of my voice? Are there sensations in your body or in the environment, sounds in the environment? Not preferring or directing attention in any one direction, but in a sense just being open to the obvious sensation experience that comes into awareness in the most simple form, in relationship to simple sensations, the direct sensations of the moment. And the knowing which is not any work, it's just an openness of mind to let things be known as they appear in their own way. And there's no control over what is being experienced. Perhaps the only thing you can do is relax. If you notice that your knowing has a certain fixation on anything, relax. If you're mostly aware of something in particular, maybe a strong sensation, chances are other things appear together with it or in little moments in between. In a sense, the knowing follows the trail of what arises, what appears. And if you settle into your body, relax into your body, relaxing the shoulders, relaxing the belly, relaxing the arms and hands, even the fingers, relaxing the thighs, calves, all the way down to the feet. Perhaps relaxing in the face, softening around the eyes, the jaws. And with the awareness open now, just open and receptive to the sensations of your body, anywhere in the body. What sensations arise which are then known without any work, without any directedness? The knowing might not be verbal, might be deeper, quieter. Some people might say intuitive knowing of sensations. As they appear, there is a kind of natural knowing of their presence. And no need to linger with any sensation, no need to think about anything. Simply each fleeting sensation that appears, maybe disappears and reappears, the coming and going and different sensations, as they arise, see if you can notice almost an almost effortless knowing, that knowing, for which you don't need to make any effort. Your effort is simply to stay receptive and present in your body.oculars Toys If you're thinking about things or living your preferences or reacting to your sensations, all that is different than the sensations themselves. If you live in the preferences, reactions, thinking, you might miss the dance of sensations in your body as they appear and disappear. Some don't disappear so easily but are followed by some different sensation, sometimes a surprise where they appear in the body. Not directing attention, holding attention anywhere except for the whole body's organ of receptivity. Definitely amazing. Perfect. And because the breathing is one of the bigger movements when the body is not moving otherwise, chances are that the sensations are breathing. Also arise in the field of sensations. See if you can notice the effortless knowing or a kind of natural knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises.

And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing that allows sensations of breathing to appear whatever way they want, whatever way they do. Maybe they appear in ways that are not the common pattern because you're not directing or expecting the common experience of breathing just open, receptive, allowing the sensations to appear as they do and allowing the simplest form of knowing of this appearance. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises.

And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. And if you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then you can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. When there is a quiet receptivity, a sensitive receptivity to our experience, then when we encounter the effortless knowing of what is it that arises, then we can see the effortless knowing of what is it that arises. Then when we encounter the suffering of others, we might feel it more acutely and readily or easily give up the subsidy of knowing. Knowing, suffering without any, without giving birth to effort, directedness, responsibility, needing to do something, without taking it in any personal way, that that suffering somehow requires something of you. The suffering is simply known, experienced, as part of the field of things that appear and disappear. And this doesn't have to be aloof or disconnected. It's actually more intimate. It's staying intimate, staying connected, falling back on responsibility or preferences or taking it personally. That's where the kind of disconnect begins. Taking in the suffering of the world in this simple way of being present may allow for a simplicity of compassion, a simplicity of well-wishing of care and love where our care, our kindness can also arise in this almost effortless way and we know that we care. And we know that we care. And we know that we care. We see the caring arising and to know it with a simplicity of knowing, not being quick to make it personal or need to do anything. Just care, kindness. And perhaps with that as a reference point for the dedication of merit, dedication of our benefits and practice, may these words I speak be your words and may they arise with ease and effortlessly out of your being. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may we as a community and as individuals go into the world to benefit the world, to support the welfare of others. May all beings be happy. And with, as I bow now to end the sitting, perhaps you'll bow in return.
