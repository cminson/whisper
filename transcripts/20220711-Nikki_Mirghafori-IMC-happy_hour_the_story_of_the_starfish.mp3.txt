The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
There. Okay, so hello and welcome everyone. Hello and welcome to this
rendition of Happy Hour. Lovely to be with you on Zoomland, YouTube land, or if
you're joining later and listening to this on audioderma. We appreciate you. So
for today's practice theme of Metta, there's this little story that came up to
my mind and I wanted to share that to set the stage. It's a story of, as I
remember it, someone walking on the beach and picking up starfish and
throwing them back into the ocean so they wouldn't dry out and they would
survive as the conditions were such that that was a possibility and maybe it was
hot or whatever it was. And there were thousands of starfish on the beach and
a friend seeing this person picking them one by one and throwing them in the
ocean says there's thousands of starfish. What are you doing? This is madness, you
know, but you're doing this doesn't make any difference. And the person who's
doing this act of service says, well, it makes a difference to the starfish I'm
throwing back. So I've loved that story. I've loved that story because even at
times it seems like, oh, how can our acts of kindness acts of service act so just
listening to one person giving our caring ear or not losing our temper just
this once just this little tiny act of kindness like difference does it make
just the world is so overwhelming by challenges but it makes a difference of
course it makes a difference. It makes a difference to the starfish to that one
starfish. It makes a difference to the that person we're not losing our temper
with or being kind with or patient with or that person we're saying hello to. So
many stories like this say you go for a walk and you smile to someone who's
looking down and looks stressed maybe it's a neighbor who's walking by you
walking past you. You just smile at them maybe this is the gift the only human
interaction they have throughout the day. It's another story I'm now remembering
just echoes and vestiges of it and just try to find it but the story of how
simple human kindness is of just a smile just the kind of word have
been instrumental and really have kept other people going without the giver
ever realizing that the simple act of kindness the simple act of service that
they were sharing was really so profound really so sustaining the other
person's connection to life connection to life. So do not underestimate the power
of throwing one starfish back into the ocean one starfish one starfish one
starfish. So that's the theme for our our practice tonight and I like to guide us
in a meditation metameditation with that in mind and again if you're new to
this practice there's nothing that you need to know ahead of time whatever you
need will be shared with you and yeah let's let's start let's start practicing
together so I'd like to invite you to get into your meditation posture whatever
that might be for you sitting lying down standing all fine postures of
meditation
and allowing yourself to arrive in this body
really arrive and if you need to move and shift locations just get a sense of
oh I'm here hello body I'm coming into your center coming into yourself your
senses I'd like you to do what is needed for you to reconnect with your body in
this moment.
Ah, landing, landing, releasing, releasing, your heart, first of all, releasing your heart,
letting it feel safe, it's okay, it's okay, whatever is happening, whatever has happened
today, it's okay, offering kindness, safety, support to yourself, a safe space, releasing
your hands, the weight of them, noticing how alive the energy in the hands are, alive,
alert and yet relaxed, let them drop, their weight drop, the weight of your wrists, elbows,
shoulders, releasing your forehead, notice if your forehead is tense or tight, release,
soften, but is there tension in your jaw?
Releasing the weight of your upper body, neck, shoulders, trunk, to your sit bones, releasing
the weight of your legs onto the earth.
Let the breath move through your body, through the abdomen, this breath, the gift, it matters
to you, to this body, this oxygen, this breath, makes a difference, to this starfish that
you are, if you're a starfish back in the ocean, let your starfish limbs relax, be
soft and receive, the breath as if it were the waves in the ocean, this wave, and this
wave, this breath, now this breath.
with thoughts arise, thoughts that take you into the past or future, it's okay
because if you're calling back, a beloved, not a judgment, calling back a beloved puppy,
that is your mind, come sweetheart, rest, rest, rest, just this breath, place of refuge.
and can we see this moment of sitting here, caring for ourselves, caring for
ourselves, by sitting, breathing, in meditation, as a moment of care, as an expression of
care, as an expression of love for ourselves, of attending to our deepest, highest needs,
reconnecting with the kindness at our core, at our center.
Only through sitting, breathing, caring, refuge, finding, making refuge, if you'd like to experiment
putting a palm in your heart center, in the middle of your chest, sort of connecting with
yourself, act of kindness, here, here, dear, here, right here, it's okay, right here, not
complicated, metta can be very simple, simply sitting and breathing.
and if you'd like to add the phrases of metta, may I be safe, may I be happy, may
I be healthy, may my life flow with ease.
All the support that makes a difference for this starfish.
Knowing that, no matter how far and wide you look, all around, the Buddha has said, you
don't find anyone that's more deserving of your own kindness, sharing goodwill.
May this being who is me, this starfish, this being, as a life-sentient being that is me,
may I be safe from harm, I'm just offering this wish, not clinging to the outcome, just
offering this sense of goodwill to yourself, without clinging, fully knowing that the world
isn't safe in every way, but you offer this wish as the gesture of goodwill, may I, may
this being who is me, be happy, may there be joy in my heart.
May this being who is me, this starfish, may they be healthy and well as much as possible.
may this being that is me, this starfish, have ease, ease in their life, ease in the
conditions, fully knowing that life has challenges in yet offering this goodwill, generously.
Offering it freely, letting it lighten your heart these wishes, they're not hammers, not
pounding them, offering them lightheartedly.
Just as if you were throwing a starfish back into the ocean, with a sense of goodwill,
with kindness, oh dear starfish, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be well, may
there be easeful conditions for you, there I'll throw you back into the ocean with Mitha.
It's the same gesture of the heart, it's free, it's easy, it's lighthearted, imagine you
are a starfish, you're throwing yourself back into the ocean with kindness, with goodwill.
now in your imagination, as you're picking up the starfish that is you and throwing
it into the ocean, picking up other starfish, other starfish, in some ways they are both
you, you could have been these starfish, also there are other beings, wishing them well,
there are beings in your life, friends, family, strangers, sharing your kindness, your goodwill,
your service, lightheartedly, without attachment to outcome, doesn't have to be perfect or
perfect, just a little bit of kindness, a little act of goodwill, maybe you chant, maybe you
consider the Mitha wishes, may you be well, or starting with safe, may you be safe, the
people in your life, or strangers, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you have
peace.
you
I would like to invite you, if you would, to consider one act of kindness that you received
recently, today, this past week, this past month, something that was kind, a small gesture.
The first thing that pops up in your mind is fine, maybe it was last year or decade ago,
but doesn't matter. Let yourself feel the appreciation, the goodness. This act of kindness
is made to you. Appreciating, appreciating the kindness, the goodwill, the metta. Letting
yourself receive it from this being, whoever was kind to you. It is the act of metta, act
of goodwill. If you phone call, if you're helping hand, breathe it in. Saver.
Appreciating the goodness, the impact of this act of kindness. For you, you the starfish,
and starfish.
And bowing to that kindness, act of kindness, and its impact, its ramifications in your
life. Small or large, and now I'd like to invite you to consider an act of kindness, metta.
If you shared with someone else, maybe you were a helping hand, you offered a helping
hand or patient ear, whatever it might have been. Let yourself feel the nourishment of
this kindness, this goodness. Let it gladden your heart. Feeling the impact, the appreciation
of the other. The starfish you threw, this one starfish, you threw once into the ocean.
Breathing in, breathing out. Appreciating the interdependence in this kindness. Letting
your heart be buoyed, uplifted. Not a time to remember all the previous wrongdoings.
Your kindness. Let your heart be glad, maybe a smile shows up on your face. Welcome it.
Small starfish. And we all have the capacity to throw one starfish back into the ocean.
So as we bring this practice period to a close, offering, offering the goodness, our
practice together. Touching into kindness, intentions of kindness, recollecting kindness,
turning our hearts or minds, our mind streamed towards kindness, the benefits, the gifts,
the appreciation of it. This is time well spent. But ever you frequently ponder and reflect
upon becomes the inclination of your mind, says the Buddha. So we reflect together on
kindness so that it becomes the inclination of our hearts and minds. May all beings everywhere,
all starfish, all starfish. Hypothetical, physical, imaginal, including ourselves, the starfish,
may all beings everywhere, be safe, happy, healthy, at ease, may they be free.
Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you for your practice. So dear starfish and starfish throwers,
both, we have some time for reflections. You're welcome to raise your zoom hand.
You're also welcome to type them in chat. If you type them to everyone, I'll read your name,
if you just type them to me, they will be private. And if you raise your physical hand,
I will not see you because there are many of us here. And Pat says on YouTube,
the star thrower was written by Lauren Isley in the unexpected universe. An extraordinary man.
Thank you for that reference, Pat. Lovely. Great. Appreciate giving credit where credit is due.
Jennifer says that that was so incredibly beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, Jennifer.
You're welcome. And thank you for your practice. I feel like a starfish. It's kind of fun to
feel like a starfish pointy, right? Being thrown throwing others. This was a fun practice, not
just profound, but also fun. It's good when practice is both. And of course,
it some things may not have worked for you, which is perfectly fine. So any questions,
any reflections offered are all welcome. Any complaints?
So as I don't see any reflections now popping up, I will invite us.
If something wants to pop up, it's okay. I can still come.
I invite us to consider, to enter little, little oceans, little tide pools in small groups,
in small groups of three, and consider each other a starfish and offering kindness, offering kindness,
offering kindness to ourselves, to each other. And the question, the reflection is,
what was this practice like for you? What came up? Whatever you like to share from your first
person experience, and not managing, not questioning, not guiding the group,
but just really from your own experience, whatever you like to share, sharing one thing,
and then the next person will share one thing, or they'll share silence, say I'll pass,
I'll hold silence today perfectly fine, no expectation, all welcome. The third person
will say something and they'll come back to you. So you'll go around a few times.
Question is, is it possible to listen to recording later? It really touched my heart
listening. Oh, absolutely. This recording is going to be available on audiudharma.org. Also,
it will be available on the IMC YouTube channel, both of those. And if you go to my website,
nikkimagafuri.com, under teachings, under Hapier, all these links to both audiudharma,
as well as the YouTube channel are there, as well as on IMC website. That's also there.
Maybe a little more complicated to maneuver. Anyway, okay, I'm going to create the breakout rooms
and take care of yourselves, take care of each other. You're all starfish, tender starfish.
Let's be kind. Let's be kind. Oh, also Neil says, I'll also email the links for the recordings.
Okay, thank you, Neil. So if you join the Google groups, the links will be mailed to you. All
right, I'm going to open the groups. Here we go. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other.
you
you
close to everybody's back, welcome back everyone, and we have a few minutes for any reflections that might have arisen from practicing either with the guided meditation or with practicing in community, metta in community.
So, what came up? The spirit of sharing with others and supporting our reflections can support others' reflection. Diana, I see your hand there.
This is my starfish painting. I do watercolor. I'm a student. There's a bit of a glare. I'm sorry. He's sunning himself up. And from a stock photo of tidal pools in Northern California, and I entered it in the student show. This just happened a couple of months ago.
So, here's the eagle coming out, but I just had to show it to you. Probably people have the bathroom starfish and whatever.
It's great. I see hearts are lighting up and thumbs up are lighting up. People are loving your starfish painting, Diana. Thanks for sharing that.
In our group, we talked a lot about the things we remember, all the various kindnesses, and our appreciation for this theme today. Some of us were remembering just all the various good things and kindnesses just daily.
Beautiful. Thank you for sharing your starfish, Diana, both metaphorical and literal painting of it.
I couldn't believe it.
It's sweet. Thank you. It's great. Michelle says, this is way out of context for the larger group, but the mantra I use when I feel a negative emotion arising is these feelings are inside me and someone's actions triggered me, triggered them.
I have the power to ignite these feelings or not. That's true. Yes, it is out of context. And Michelle, and yes, I appreciate the way that you're supporting yourself with this mantra.
Perfect. Jerry. Real quick, I would say I was in college before I went off to a professional school and I was working for the police and the intelligence unit and another student was with me from high school and found this suicide note that was collected.
And in it, I would never forgot these words. I felt intrusive upon, he was intruded upon the suicide note, but only to say that he had been ridiculed in high school and my mother had asked me to reach out and protect him, which I did.
And in the suicide note, he mentioned that. I never forgot that.
And he said that he even said, maybe he did this because my mother was talking about this. I did, but it reminded me, you never know the effect of kindness.
So this has been very helpful to remind me that I don't know the effect on others, but it can be quite a mantra.
Yeah. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you for sharing that moving reflection. Wow. Yeah.
Exactly. You never know the impact of your act of kindness. Yeah.
Thank you all. That's a profound note from a story and from real life experience. So one of you to end on to really appreciate that and to continue to throw starfish into the ocean and also let yourself be thrown.
Let yourself be thrown. Appreciate the goodness of kindness that's offered by others and keep keep throwing starfish.
So thank you all. Thank you, dear starfish and starfish throwers for your practice for being here, cultivating your heart.
May all beings be well.
May all beings be free.
Thanks, everyone. Be well.
Now I stop the recording.
