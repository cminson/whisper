The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, this is Maslow, 1961, in a short reflection on peak experience. So,
I wrote, the goal of self-actualization seems to be simultaneously an end goal in
itself and a transitional goal, a rite of passage, a step along the path to the
transcendence of identity. This is like saying, its function is to erase itself.
Its function is to erase itself. Self-actualization, self-cultivation points
to something greater, in other words. It erases itself. It erases itself and it
points to something. Maybe we even say, enlightenment erases itself and points
to something. What? Might it point to? I think it points to love. When, when the
self is not a preoccupation, what is left is everything else. What's left is
everything else. And in that context, love becomes much more natural. We're, we're
really, we're developing a practice, a way of being that feels very, very natural.
Love feels natural. Renunciation feels natural. Samadhi feels natural. The
awareness feels natural. And that's important. Yeah, this practice is meant
to feel natural. It may be hard. It may be rigorously hard at times, but it's
meant to feel natural. And we hear so much about choice in, in mindfulness to
choose a response rather than a reaction, for example. And I honestly don't notice
that I make better choices. It's more like my options are much better. It's more
like I don't find myself kind of backed into karmic corners where there's dukkha
in every direction, suffering in every direction. This is not a state-based
practice. It can sound that way at times, like we're trying to engineer, create
state, states, a momentary state of something. But we're really developing
wholesome traits. Traits don't need our effort to be maintained. That's what I
was pointing to in a way in the kind of that quality, the effortlessness, the,
the dimension of awareness that you can't turn on or off don't, it doesn't need
your effort to be maintained. Yeah. We're in the same way, we're developing traits
that don't need your effort to be maintained. I would say we're developing a
trait of love, a trait of love. So where, where does the mind rest? You know, what,
what's the, what's the default position of our attention? Where it's kind of like
asking, where do you live? Where do you live? Where does your attention live? When
you don't need to do your life, where does your mind go? And it tends to be a heavy
mixture of self-referential thought curating the image that others have of
us, curating the image we have of ourselves. I am this, I'm not that. It tends to go to
the future, which is gripping and we predict and simulate futures. We try to
strategize a way through samsara, a way through this realm of the realm of threat
and opportunity. And in that kind of that little bubble of self-referential
thought strategizing, it feels very much like kind of little, little me
contending with big anicha, you know, big uncertainty, this enormous intimidating
world. And some of that strategizing and prediction and simulating is adaptive, no
doubt, but we probably go quite a bit overboard. Where else might we live? Where
else might the mind rest? To what baseline might the mind return? What might
become the kind of default position of our attention? Buddhist suggestion is that
perhaps it's the the Brahma Vihara's, the divine abode's theme for this this week.
So loving kindness, kind of warmth, compassion, shared joy, equanimity. These
places for the heart to rest, all expressions of non-clinging facets of
love. I think of love as like our like our nervous system, just longing for the
Dharma. Yeah, when I really consider, okay, what is what does the Dharma feel like?
What does this path feel like to me, just me? It feels like relinquishment. And in
the wake of that relinquishment, kind of quiet love. And so we have these four
Brahma Vihara's, these facets of love. And if I had to propose a fifth Brahma
Vihara, Gil has not authorized me to do this. But if I had to propose a fifth, if
that was my contribution to American Buddhist discourse, the fifth Brahma
Vihara would be something like puttering. And then you're like, oh, yeah, the four
that pretty much takes care of it. But I just I need one more just puttering.
Sometimes that's the place to rest for me. So these, these places of dwelling,
they're meant to be varied enough so that one of them, one of them is always a
good place for the heart to rest, one of them. No matter what's happening in this
moment, one of those forces is medicine, the warmth, the compassion, the joy, the
joy, the equanimity, the peace. One of them is medicine, a birth, a death, a
marriage, or a divorce, a war, or a peace. One of the Brahma Vihara's has your
back. And there's no, there's no control in these mind states. Clinging is
painful and trying to control it's, it's painful. And it's really important to get
that in our bones, like clinging is, is painful. We can kind of take that on
faith, we hear that in Dharma talks, but we actually have to know that for
ourselves. We have to sort of run into the dead end of clinging enough times
with enough vivid awareness that we sense the pain associated with it. And
that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that the best medicine is always to let go.
But clinging is so painful. We get worried, you know, if I don't cling, maybe I, I
won't get what I want. And maybe that's so, but you get what you actually need.
Peace. Submet, loving kindness. This is, this is love in the face of goodness. Maybe
we'd say compassion, Karuna, love in the face of suffering. And that's, that's
loving kindness. This is, this is love in the face of goodness. Maybe we'd say
compassion, Karuna, love in the face of suffering. Medita, sympathetic joy, love
in the face of happiness. And Upeka, equanimity as love in the face of the
whole endless nature of samsara, this realm. When, when you consider the state
of sentience, you know, just pleasure and pain, the waves of pleasure and pain,
being human is like this. Love becomes just one of the most plausible responses
to that predicament. And as we'll see, some, some Brahma-Vahara practice
highlights love. And sometimes the practice highlights everything that is not
love, but needs love. And just to bathe in this kind of, this love that is not
born of clinging, that is not seeking to control. It just, that is deeply healing,
really, you know, at, sometimes it just takes a moment of abiding in that to
appears a day, or a month, or a year, or a life of pain. So Michelle, Michelle McDonald, a beautiful
teacher on this, in this realm of, of met, she once described this yogi who a long
time dedicated practitioner and, and, and loving kindness for herself just felt
impossible, just so remote, you know, like just, just like bizarre thought to
actually express this kind of care for oneself. And trying over not months, but
years of practice, right, years of practice. And then during one session of a
silent retreat, silent retreat in the silent hall, this yogi suddenly yelled
out, I could feel it. I could. It's so sweet. I could feel it for myself. She
yelled it out in the hall, right? You're not allowed to yell it out in the Dharma
hall as sweet as it is. But we can, we can all yell it out on YouTube. Yeah, I can
feel it for myself. So this week, I'll start, I don't know what I just said, but
we'll start tomorrow with met and compassion, joy, equanimity for each of
the four remaining days. Happy to be with you this week. I wish you all a good
day.
