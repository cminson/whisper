The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org. So welcome.
Really warm welcome to everybody. It's a delight to be here. Somehow I feel a
little bit more present after that sit. Hopefully you do too. Hopefully feel a
little bit more collected or grounded in some kind of way. Hmm. So I'd like to
build on just a little bit of the talk that Gil gave yesterday. He gave a talk
in response to all these incredible fires we have going on here. Yeah it's
quite something to have not only is there of course just the knowledge that
places I've seen some place really dear to me. Big basin. I think it's a state
park or a national park. I'm not sure. Beautiful beautiful place. That's the
headquarters burned down and just you know feeling the heartbreak of that and
some of those beautiful magnificent trees and not to say all the families
who have had to evacuate and lost their homes. It's quite something. So with some
heavy-heartedness recognizing what's happening right now and for those of
you in the Bay Area know that it's not only like news but we experience it with
the ash falling from the sky and the air quality being so poor. And Gil talked
about this a little bit yesterday with the theme of do what you can. Do what you
can. So I'd like to just build on this a little bit and come from a different
area but this idea that we know how can we show up and make a difference in
support not only ourselves of course but others. There's so many others that are
in need. It's not the fires here in the Bay Area. There's certainly fires for
their northern and southern California and all the other things that are
happening right now. And I'd like to link this this idea of do what you can with
kind of the movement of the heart or the movement of the mind that is this kind
of leaning forward in some kind of way. This openness, this generosity, this
engagement. That's the opposite of like grabbing or clinging or stinginess. Kind
of the opposite movement of that. Then I'm reminded that quite a few years ago
right after IRC opened that there was a time when I was doing a lot of
retreat practice and for me there's a you know it's it's a kind of a big deal
to go on retreat at least for me it was certainly then and I would spend a lot of
time planning exactly what I'm gonna bring because you don't want to bring
too much because it's then just clutters up your room and clutters up your mind.
You want to keep things simple while you're on retreat but you don't want to
bring too little so that you feel like you don't have what you need or that you
feel deprived in some kind of way. Just kind of like the minimum amount to have
some comfort and some ease and to have you know belongings and your stuff just
not be an issue. So I used to you know think about this days before okay what
am I going to bring? And the one time I was on retreat down at IRC and I ran
out of dental floss right it's hard to tell those little containers how much
more is in there and how much like how much do you use in a week or two weeks.
So I knew that there was this what's called a yogi needs closet that is a
closet where they would there's some things there that if you use some
twiddle trees and stuff if you run out or you forgot to bring them you could go
to this closet. I thought okay you know I'll just go down there and get some
more dental floss. And I found myself I opened up the closet and I found myself
staring at the contents of the closet and my heart kind of welling up with the
generosity of IRC of everything that the person might need was there not only was
there dental floss but to make toothpaste and a toothbrush just in case you
forgot it but band-aids and some over-the-counter medicine for your belly
if you're having some trouble or some aspirin or heating pads if it's you're
having some discomfort while sitting some cough drops soap razors all kinds of
things just freely offered. You just go to the closet and this feeling that I
had I'm just now I'm bringing it to mind I can still feel it of the respect and
the care and this wish for to support my practice that IRC is freely
providing all these things to support one's practice and you know some of the
thoughts that I had of course is like oh I want to support an organization like
this just like I'm being supported in this particular way I want to be
supported I'm sorry I want to give support having been supported and so some
of you have seen there I think sometimes in the newsletter that goes out
there's a little saying that something about that Dharma unfolding in a field
of generosity and I think that's what's being pointed to here this idea of a
field of generosity that is this movement of opening my hands this
movement of letting go this non-stinginess you know it's not grasping and
holding on but instead offering and giving with respect and with care you
know not because that oh I feel sorry for you here let me give this to you but
like oh this might support you it might not also it might but if you find it
will be helpful you're welcome to it this kind of this gesture of the heart so
in this way there's this idea of we can think of generosity as a sense of
openness I like kind of this expression non-stinginess because stinginess
implies a real tightness right kind of a holding on grasping for dear life kind
of a sensation or experience we could also define generosity as a type of
sharing like we have generosity doesn't mean that we have to give 100% of what
we own therefore we don't have anything left but maybe it's sharing and
somehow that kind of makes my heart sing also this idea of sharing we all
learned this back in kindergarten so this is the the role of generosity and
Buddhist practice it actually is foundational to the practice but part of
the role is just to help create the conditions in which there is this sense
of delight in which there is this sense of happiness when we share when we
stop being stingy there's this openness as well as just this it also points
specifically to letting go and you might say that the entire Buddhist practice
the whole all the way the path to freedom to awakening as well as the path
to just greater well-being all involves letting go so generosity is just one
particular movement or maybe one particular flavor of that letting go and
the Buddha talked about this a lot to actually that that's bringing generous
brings happiness and it brings a sense of delight and think of when you bring a
gift to somebody and how about that's this feeling of you know if it's wrap
you to opening up the gift or even if it's not wrapped of course just the
feeling that you have of yes I thought about you and is a little bit less
self-centeredness for me I'd like to offer this to you so in this way
generosity is not a business transaction it's not in which I give and I expect to
receive something of equal or greater value and in return or it's we're not
trying to get a profit out of this gesture instead it's this feeling of
open-heartedness of sharing and this this recognition that everything that we do
everything all of our actions all of the things that we say and all the things
that we have in the mind have consequences and so of course I've been
talking about how being generous kind of has some uplift in the heart maybe some
delight in the mind but also we are often generous not always but we are often
generous when we have a feeling of abundance when we have a feeling of I
have enough a little bit of wealth and here let me let me share and let me
give this sometimes we're generous from that isn't our predominant feeling but
often this feeling of having a certain type of wealth is underlying this
feeling of generosity what's really interesting and we find with practice
that so often that if there's a relationship where this feeling of
abundance leads to generosity it works in the opposite way too when we're
generous in that moment we feel a certain type of wealth a certain absence of a
lack with like there's enough there's I have enough there is enough in that
moment if there isn't enough then maybe if you don't have that feeling when
you're being generous or sharing maybe it's an opportunity to examine your
generosity and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a moment but first I
wanted to point out that the Buddha did talk about generosity a lot very often
or classically certainly here in the vipassana scene we talk about the path
of practice towards greater and greater freedom to be with this movement we use
these three categories Sela Samadhi Panya ethical behavior mental
development and wisdom that's one way we could translate that but there's
another path of practice there's another three ways of practicing and it starts
with generosity dana then it goes to Sela and then Bhavana so for the first
step is generosity is the Buddha recognized for some people that's where
I start not with a meditation practice not within practice with ethics but to
start with this movement of giving and in a way that makes sense for them and
is appropriate for them in a way that enables them to maybe broaden their area
of concern or in a way to consider like what might be helpful for others or what
might be beneficial for others not only for themselves so to undermine some of
the self-centeredness or obsession we sometimes have with a more more more
right we're certainly encouraged to acquire and attain and so this can be
quite a practice just to start with this kind of like letting go of this the
opposite of acquiring instead sharing and be non-stingy so the Buddha would
start by talking about the importance and benefits of practicing
generosity with this recognition that it can take some practice and this is a
fantastic place to start it's just with this movement of softening any clinging
that we're doing and then based on this foundation he talked about the
importance and benefits of the practice of ethics because one of the greatest
gifts we can give to others is this gift of fearlessness the gift of feeling
safe around us knowing that we're not going to harm them because we have a
commitment to behaving ethically because we have a commitment to behaving in a
way that's wholesome and helpful and healthy so we can give to others the
freedom from fear freedom from feelings of hostility or freedom from
oppression by the way that we behave classically this is with the five
precepts so giving up killing stealing false speech sexual misconduct and
intoxicants by abstaining from those were able to give the gift of safety to
others and we shouldn't underestimate how powerful this can be I remember that
when I was early in my practice there was somebody that I would spend time
with who was further along the path and I was had been practicing for much
longer than me and I noticed that I always I didn't notice this at first but
when I heard this idea this giving this gift of fearlessness I started to
reflect where do I feel the most safe in my life and I discovered that it was
with practitioners who had undertaken this practice of that behaving ethically
this had a big impact on me for it allowed me to relax and to open up and
to really touch into the experience of just being present knowing that I didn't
have to protect myself now that myself to my practice to go deeper as I kind of
recognize yes there are others out there that are trustworthy so we shouldn't
underestimate how powerful of course behaving ethically benefits ourselves
but can benefit others so the Buddha taught Dhamma generosity
Sela ethics and Bhavana Bhavana means cultivating or developing and usually
we talk about it as developing the mind and in this context developing their
mental inner states so in some ways we could talk about the practice of
calming and quieting the mind so that we might begin to see we might get to
notice and we might begin to feel all the ways in which we are not letting go
what does it feel like to be holding on so tightly to whether it's an idea or
it's an actual object or whatever it might be an experience so as we calm
and quiet the mind we start to feel the the suffering that's associated with
holding tightly and we might feel that this this pinch maybe of stinginess or
tightly grasping and also Bhavana with mental development we might have some
insights to it was the mind calms down and we can see some more there might be
some insights number of them and one we can point to here is this idea of
ownership is a useful social construct but we don't really own things in the
way that we think we do that is things aren't inherently mine or inherently
yours they just are what they are your car would be just as happy if somebody
else started to drive it right if you sell your car it's no longer yours it's
the same car but it's now it's somebody else's responsibility or so we may be
like stewards of objects but we don't own them this they aren't mine in the way
that we think that we have complete control over them or some kind of way
so as the mind starts to quiet and we start to feel the pinch of stinginess
we also start to see that this activity of think making things me owning this
experience or making objects mine kind of like owning that object isn't that
what we initially think it is or what we might think it is at the first blush or
at first examination and of course these insights supported by a calm and
stable mind lead to deeper and deeper levels of freedom to all the way to
complete awakening but all the way also to just some general increase in a sense
of well-being a sense of happiness as we stop trying to own everything and
trying to make that these objects behave in a way that we want them to or not
change and not to go away or protect them or something like this to be sure
we should protect those things for which we are stewards our belongings I'm not
saying to give away everything but it's really quite something to just examine
this idea of ownership this idea and recognize that it is a belief and it's
a very useful one and we get to social convention that we've all bought into so
it has value but it could be useful to get a little bit curious about it what
is that experience like and then of course once a person is awakened they
continue to be generous a generous with service by supporting others in the
practice or supporting others in whatever way seems like the right thing to
do with wisdom it might be a story in Gil's book a monastery within I'm not
sure but I remember either hearing or reading a story that was meaningful for
me and that was this idea that this question of how can you tell who are
those individuals who have the most freedom or who are awakened and the
answer was those who are serving others those who are helping others who are
like giving of their resources or time or energy so in this way generosity is
letting go this giving is cyclic and is throughout the whole path of practice
Donna, Sela, Bhavana and the Effort of Awakening there's not only helping in
whatever way is appropriate but also this idea that to give the gift of the
teachings or of the Dharma to support others in their practice to support
others in their understanding of the Dharma not that we have to go out and
be evangelical but I think all of us that have the opportunity to talk about
the Dharma with others recognize that it's really supportive to explore Dharma
concepts or meditation experience or explore our questions our doubts things
we're confused about the things that we are not confused about it really makes
a difference to share and to not only that we support others but that we feel
supported to so generosity of course not unlike loving kindness or
compassion is something that we can practice and that we can gain greater
facility and strength with it might be that from your cultural background your
family background social background whatever background we you have that
maybe being generous isn't so easy maybe that's not the way that comes
naturally or only comes with a certain amount of effort that's okay that's okay
we all start where we are and we can practice we can practice with this this
act of being generous this it's recognizing that it's an expression of
non stinginess but also non greed so each time we are generous that movement of
the heart that movement of the mind is strengthened so whether it's letting the
person in traffic go in front of you or whether it's really making sure with
social distancing and mass squaring that people feel safe I mean that
is a kind of a generous gesture or maybe it's just being generous with our
attention when we're with somebody we're listening to them or being with them
that we're not holding back we're just fully with them or maybe it's being
generous with certainly money like donations but also with skills that we
have anytime whether it's a small movement or a large movement a small
gesture or a big gesture can really support this practice or this experience
of generosity it's easy to romanticize this idea of generosity we have in this
feeling that it should always be perfectly delightful and easy but it
there might be some times in which there is a little bit of discomfort or a
little bit of like a hesitation and that's an invitation to just examine
what is this hesitation about and it might become clear like okay maybe I
shouldn't be generous here this hesitation is telling me that I'm giving
away something that actually I'm going to start resenting that I gave it away
or something that's precious to me and then I'm just going to feel the great
sense of lack so if we feel some of that
uncomfortableness that's just an invitation to gain some better self
understanding to do some examination to give some spaciousness to ourselves so
that we can explore and see what that's about and maybe we don't aren't acting
generously so we can differentiate between what we might call right giving
and wrong giving right generosity wrong generosity so wrong generosity is if
we're giving because we have some moralistic sense of should I should
donate I should give right we want to be cultivating this openness of hearts
this activity of letting go and the sense of should is kind of a tight and
collapsed feeling that's the opposite of cultivating a wholesome open-hearted
experience and if there's this and if the sense of giving is accompanied by
resentment or anger that's also not the direction we want to go instead what if
there's some delight or some happiness or spaciousness with the giving and then
some recognition that this is a practice so we stretch ourselves a little bit not
so much that it feels really uncomfortable but it's such enough that
our generosity can grow this this letting go can grow and can support us in so
many ways so when we are discerning kind of like right or wrong generosity
there's some questions we can ask ourselves to help us discern this and
have some wisdom and the way that we are generous one question is how does it
feel how does it feel in the body how does it feel in the mind is there a sense
of openness or is there a sense of collapsing and shutting down is there
a sense of fear is there a feeling of depletion or anger or confusion or
contraction if so take some more time maybe you aren't generous right there
but take it an opportunity to learn something another question or what
stories or beliefs are underneath my giving do I have this idea that if I
give this then I'm going to get this and in return so that's some type of
transactional activity or or if I give this then everybody's gonna think that
I'm such a beautiful generous person or we want to be seen a particular way or
what's what is what are the beliefs or ideas that are underneath and and can
we go underneath them can we recognize when they are there and maybe find the
impulse of generosity that's underneath them and just feel into does this is this
if I'm going to be generous does this support some openness and delight or not
and then one thing that maybe I'll end here is what last question we could ask
ourselves is is what I'm giving appropriate are we giving lots of bread
to somebody who's gluten intolerant I just made up this expression but this
idea of to just be aware of the context and is what we're giving or offering
what's needed and useful and beneficial or will it be burdensome for whomever
receives it is it are we giving because we want to get rid of it or are we
giving to so it might support somebody else so coming back to this I
idea of with the fires and with all the difficulties we do what we can and in
some ways that might mean to be generous and to recognize that generosity is
this idea of letting go and letting go is integral to the entire path of
practice and Buddhism and just very simply letting go just brings greater
happiness and greater well-being not to mention the way that we might support
others with our generosity so may your generosity bring you delight and support
and may you experience the benefits of other people's generosity so in this
way there can be this field of generosity in which the Dharma can freely
flow for the benefit of all beings everywhere thank you
