 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org....and see something else arise. You're pretty aware that our experience is pretty fluid. That things are always kind of shifting and changing. A person is a fluid experience. Life is fluid. Emotions are fluid. Thoughts, even memories, change with time. We're not fixed, static. We might get frozen at times because we're resisting or fixated and ruminating. But even that shifts and change gets worse, stiffer. In some way, it changes. You know, life is not some block of solidity. Who we are isn't this solid thing. It's a changing constellation of potentialities, of traits. You are a mandala. Let's take a moment to imagine if you could see yourself as a mandala. What does your mind show you? We're a composite and all of our experience is a composite, an amalgam. A coming together of past and present. Every experience is somewhat informed by our previous experience. And our beliefs affect how we see and what we see. Our preferences, dislikes. And then there's the veda now, the emotional tone, the feeling tone. Do we like what we're feeling, seeing, being with? Do we not like what we're being with, seeing? And how does that influence it? Or are we indifferent or not even aware of how we're relating? Do you see how there's, you know, all these little pieces coming together, including how we're relating, that create our momentary experience? And how do we kind of help ourselves keep meeting this moment as if it's unique? Because it is colored, flavored, impacted by the past, yet it's its own thing. And the practice that, you know, what we've been kind of trying to create space for today is to allow everything that comes up to be seen. Right? Hello. I see you. And then working on finding a way to relate to it in a way that allows its space to be. Matt shared a practice he has of sort of sitting back like he's in a theater and seeing his life where these things unfolding in front of him. I have a practice of imagining a table in a space, like a cathedral maybe, or a large room, or the forest. And the table can be as big as it needs, and chairs can be as big as they need, many as you need. And this sort of, as things unfold, allowing each thing to have its own seat at the table. And we can go about our experience by trying to pull it apart. But in a way that's kind of violent. It's like taking a yarn that is all knotted up and intertwined and just pulling, pulling on all the strings. And what happens? Maybe something gets looser, but then the rest of it gets tighter. Right? There's an art to allowing things to untangle, and it's much more of an allowing than a thinking and analyzing and trying to figure it out. Versus like this digging, and then there's just sort of coexisting, kind of the palms that are open and able to hold it. And then allow it to do what it wants to do, like a bird that's been stunned, and you pick it up in your hands. And if you hold it too tight, what happens? It's going to freak out and fight. If you don't hold it cupped enough, it will fall, maybe get hurt. But if you hold it in just the right way, it gets to kind of stay or go on its own. Here's a quote from Carl, by Carl Rogers. When I have been listened to, and when I have been heard, I'm able to re-perceive my world in a new way and to go on. I'll say it again. When I have been listened to, and when I have been heard, I'm able to re-perceive my world in a new way and go on. The quote goes on, it is astonishing how elements that seem insoluble become soluble when someone listens. How confusions that seem irremediable turn into relatively clear, flowing streams when one is heard. I have deeply appreciated the times that I have experienced this sensitive, empathic, concentrated listening. I have found that it's never too late to practice mindfulness. In a way, it's not even ever too soon to practice mindfulness either. By that I mean, something might have happened in the past, and I can't go back in the past and change it. But in the moment, if I have a memory of it, I'm having an experience of that memory in the present moment. And as I imagine what happened, maybe that's what's happening, I can be mindful with it in a way maybe I couldn't at the moment. But I can have the experience of witnessing with mindfulness. I can meet the memory with awareness, with allowing, with wisdom, with this openness, even the shame, even the regret, even the hatred, the hurt. I can even see or feel that with mindfulness, with this kind of open, caring, and yes, wisdom is required, discernment. The ability to see and be with without merging, joining, agreeing, or succumbing, collapsing. So you might say that whatever we attend to with this kind of mindfulness is given the opportunity to be free from past conditioning. But what happens when something is given a chance to be free? What always happens, what happened before, from our expectations, our wishes? See if you can notice what happens, maybe different things happen at different times. We're going to move now into a period of service, serving and caring for our sangha, this place we practice, our temple.
