 So how's it going so far? Any questions or comments or reflections about the loving-kindness practice so far? Any discoveries? Come and sit closer. If you want to sit in a chair, bring the chairs closer so we all kind of more together. I'm wishing loving kindness when I'm in different places and I just need people and it becomes a partner. And Sunday I went to a presentation. It was from some women who had been to Vichon and they spoke of women's issues and women's issues that were really important. Heart, the issues are suffering and from manipulation and not sort of a nice thing happening. And I found myself wanting peace and happiness to all people everywhere and of course I was thinking of these women because they were there in the fudge show which really matters. And just also at the same time it dawned on me that the perpetrators of these not so nice experiences, they were people too. And I was able to feel loving kindness and wish peace and happiness for not only the victims but the perpetrators. And the way it felt was like, and it was just the same in here, it wasn't weighted more towards the victims who suffered quite a bit and more than for those that apparently caused suffering. I just noticed a whole bit of that. Wonderful. And you weren't condoning what they were doing. No. That is wonderful. So you're actually ahead of us because today we're going to talk about difficult people and having loving kindness for difficult people. And so you've brought a wonderful example of how it can be done. If I let my head click in and think, it becomes more difficult. I was going to say what do you think, but what are you connecting to in those perpetrators that allows you to feel loving kindness for them? That there is a universal goodness, there is the essence of humanity in all people. And that I too could be a perpetrator of the different kinds of life. And I would want happiness and peace from itself just as much as I want. Great. Thank you. So someone else. I wish we were loving kindness and just playful. It was amazing. It was a miracle. Anything else? Reports, questions, comments about loving kindness so far? Did anybody practice offering loving kindness to neutral people? No? Just last week? I had a very interesting thing happen with a difficult person. I started off thinking about some of the things that were difficult with that person. And then I switched and I started picturing this person more as full of peace. I was wishing, I was actually seeing her in a way that was more full and full and way better. I hope there wasn't too manipulating for it, but it was a big change just being able to view a person in more open and kind of a way. Nice. Yeah? On some of the times I've got such a burning, a hurt here when I'm not focusing that way. Do you know how that is? Focusing on who? With loving kindness I've kind of centered part. Just loving kindness in general to anyone? No one will practice here. And other times when I'm just at home focusing on the way. Sometimes it doesn't happen, but sometimes it's a real burning, constricted feeling. I don't know what it is, but it's not unusual to have such sensations and feelings when we do loving kindness. I think I said a number of times, loving kindness kind of softens things to see what's going on in the body emotionally and around the heart. And sometimes the heart is in a difficult place under the kind of surface. So the surface gets relaxed, you see the difficult place. And that's considered to be fine in the practice of loving kindness. In the practice of loving kindness you don't have to end up feeling loving. You end up softening the heart. And what gets revealed sometimes is difficulty, anger, pain, frustration, resentment or grief. At this point you could continue to do loving kindness and probably the best place to do it is towards yourself. Or to do it towards your heart, to send loving kindness to your heart and to your pain, to your constriction. Or switch to start doing mindfulness practice. And it's often considered also very useful to switch into mindfulness practice when difficulties arise from doing loving kindness. The light of loving kindness reveals difficulties in holdings. Rather than judging yourself or struggling with it or trying to do loving kindness and you can't do it so well, you can change gears and do mindfulness practice towards it and allow it to unfold in the light of mindfulness. Years ago my first exposure to Buddhism was through Tibetan Buddhism and I couldn't understand the teachings so I found my way to Theravadana teachings, which I thought I understood. But there was one practice that I heard and then didn't use and that was, but I did use it yesterday. I woke up in the morning with a hurt in my heart and other uncomfortable feelings. And as long as I was just trying to stay with them, when the practice that I heard came back into my memory. It's a form of loving kindness and what it is is to send loving kindness to everyone else who is experiencing the same thing at the same time. And so I did that when I narrowed it down to everybody who was 67 years old who was waking up with this pain and it evaporated. I'm not hearing a way with this. Beautiful. I think it's often helpful to feel your connection with the universal aspect of suffering that we have. We often identify with our own suffering and our own situation and we feel sorry for ourselves or wherever. But it's actually a universal phenomena and to feel the universality of being a human being can lessen the holding and the judgment and many of the extra stuff around it. And it might actually disappear. That's nice. Did anybody memorize the metasuta? Did anybody fast out? Even after I gave it a little plug for how useful it is to memorize it? Another thing that's considered useful to memorize is the eleven benefits of loving kindness. And so you might memorize those too. And I haven't memorized them. But I'm sure many of you have read these before. But the first benefit is sound sleep. And then the second benefit is you'll awaken happily from sheer sleep. And you'll have no bad dreams. You'll receive respect from others. You'll be loved by the devas, by all the gods. And also you'll be protected by all the devas. You won't be harmed by fire, poison or any weapon. The mind will be quickly calmed. You'll have a clear complexion. You'll have a calm death. And if you only do this practice and no mindfulness practice, then you'll be reborn in the heavenly realm. That's a pretty good. You can choose which one motivates you the most. And then the other thing that's considered useful for the purposes of developing loving kindness is to reflect on the disadvantages of anger. Because anger is kind of like the opposite or ill will. It's the opposite of loving kindness. So you reflect on the disadvantages or you reflect on the suffering involved with anger and getting to know anger really well. And you're less likely to be interested in pursuing anger if you realize the amount of pain and suffering and conflict that arises from anger. And maybe you're more willing to see the situation in a different way, where anger is not the organizing principle for the situation. So part of all that is letting go of resentment. And understanding anger is very important for understanding loving kindness. And a big piece that needs to be understood is resentment. Because resentment is a holding on to anger. Anger by itself can be cleaned without any holding. It needs to be lashed out and it's done with. But resentment is just holding, lingering holding that is like poison in the system. It can really poison the person for years and years. And so what does it take to release that resentment? So part of what's sometimes taught together with loving kindness meditation is a forgiveness meditation. Where we'll spend time asking for forgiveness from people that we've hurt, offering forgiveness to people who hurt us, and offering forgiveness to ourselves for any harm that we ourselves have done to ourselves, any injury we've done. And forgiveness is a powerful practice. There are some teachers who will teach it. They have one day meditation retreats, all they do is forgiveness practice. And I think a lot of the power comes out of it because of how much holding that so many people have. We close our hearts to others or to ourselves. And that's really painful. And if you're going to do loving kindness practice, you have to open up your heart. And sometimes loving kindness practice is not enough. You have to actively be involved in the process of forgiveness. But forgiveness is not so easy. You can't just decide to forgive from one day to the next or one moment to the next. And what we talk about in our forgiveness is that it's an attitude or a process, it's a willingness. Forgiveness practice is a willingness to enter into the process to bring about forgiveness. To have the intention that you think this is a good idea, I want to do this, this is something I want to do, find a way to do it. Not necessarily that you're going to do it overnight. But I've been in situations where I was so close to someone that even the very notion of thinking about forgiving that person was unacceptable. And just to simply get to the point where it was okay for me to think about the possibility of forgiving that person was a major step forward. And to reflect, think about forgiveness, think about what the holding is, reflect on what the cost is of that holding of resentment and anger. What the cost is for ourselves. Because often anger is a major source of suffering for the person who's angry. And is it worth it? And is there another way of understanding the situation, the understanding situation through the eyes of anger? So there's forgiveness practice. Releasing the holding and being open-hearted again to oneself and to others. I guess maybe I've already said this in the earlier weeks, but I think it's quite phenomenal that we take an hour each week to do loving kindness practice, kind of make that a theme and a focus. And it almost kind of makes me want to feel, or makes me feel loving kindness or metta. Just thinking about the fact that we're going to spend an hour doing loving kindness. I think it's such a wonderful thing. And for me, part of, one of the ways, so there's a number of ways to get to loving kindness. One way is to understand anger and resentment really well. Another way is to understand the benefits of loving kindness. Another way is to go through a process of forgiveness. Another way is through the door of gratitude. And this is something that I often feel is tremendous gratitude for many things, but for just life, for being alive. Gratitude for the sangha, the people who I practice with who have supported my practice. And in that field of gratitude, that sometimes almost for nothing at all, just a state of gratitude, it seems like it's very closely related to loving kindness. And it seems like out of gratitude comes loving kindness, out of loving kindness comes gratitude. So reflecting on gratitude and what we can be grateful for is an important piece, I think, in the whole process of loving kindness. One of the members of our sangha here in the lane is very fond of the subject of gratitude. She talks a lot about, often enough she's talked to me about, that rather than talking about giving, which the Buddhist tradition talks a lot about, the importance of giving, you should spend more time talking about receiving. Because more people have trouble receiving properly. And actually we're receiving constantly a tremendous amount from the world. And we're actually receiving, you know, I mean our whole life is receiving just a whole bunch of things all the time. And we tend to be so narrowly focused, this narrow band of existence that has to do with our self-identity, perhaps. That we miss that, you know, the other 99.9% of our life. It is wonderful support that makes life possible. And so because we miss the wider band, the wider spectrum of what's happening, we're losing an opportunity to feel tremendous gratitude for the fact that we're just alive, and that our bodies work as well as they do, and that there are less accidents on the roads. It's phenomenal to me. I'm driving here 60 miles an hour up there in the skyline, and they pass me and nothing happens. So let's sit now. So take a moment to just feel yourself as you're sitting here. Feeling perhaps the preciousness of being alive, of sitting here within body that sits upright. And then you can take a couple of deeper breaths, slow, deeper breaths. Settling into your body, settling into your heart. So... And then breathing normally. Imagine that your breath comes in through your heart center, filling your heart, filling your chest, your being, with warmth, with fullness, with loving kindness, with all the support that the world gives us so we can exist. And then as we breathe out, we breathe out our kindness, our calmness, our peacefulness out into the world. And then as you're sitting here, bring to mind a person or some of the people for whom you have caused some harm or some insult, some hurt. Maybe not a major kind of hurt, but it's something you felt bad about. And thinking about this situation, this person. Reflect on how forgiveness could be a part of your relationship to this person or their forgiveness of you. And the phrases of forgiveness are as follows, and you can say them as you wish quietly to yourself, like you would say the phrases of loving kindness. For whatever harm I have caused others, either knowingly or unknowingly, I now ask their forgiveness. Perhaps thinking of someone from today or this last week, you might have hurt or been disrespectful towards. For whatever harm I have caused others, either knowingly or unknowingly, I now ask for their forgiveness. And then letting go of that. And now think of situations or someone who has harmed you or been disrespectful towards you. And thinking of such people, for whatever harm that has been caused to me, either knowingly or unknowingly, I now offer my forgiveness. For whatever harm that has been caused to me, either knowingly or unknowingly, I now offer my forgiveness. And then letting go of that. You can reflect now on any harm or disrespect that you've given yourself. Ways of being excessively self-critical or judgmental or ignored ourselves or ignored our deeper wisdom, ignored our body, taken care of it. For whatever harm I have caused to myself, either knowingly or unknowingly, I now forgive myself. For whatever harm I have brought on myself, either knowingly or unknowingly, I now soften and open to myself with forgiveness. And then holding yourself, holding an image of yourself, a felt sense of yourself, feeling maybe the preciousness of your humanity, of your life. Offer loving kindness. Open up to yourself in loving kindness. Soften your body in loving kindness to yourself. Breathing in and breathing out. May I be happy. May I be free from worry and anxiety. May I be filled with joy. May I be free from harm. May I never forget my deepest goodness. May I be at peace. Breathing in through the chest, through the heart. Fullness, loving kindness. Breathing out calmness, peacefulness. And then bring to mind now some part of yourself which you find difficult. Some part of yourself which causes you anxiety or distress or that you're critical of. And hold this difficult part of yourself in the field of loving kindness. Or as Rilke says, all things difficult within us are things which are helpless, which really need our love. May this difficult part of me be at ease. May this difficult part of me be free from harm and worry. May this difficult part of me experience the warmth of loving kindness. May this difficult part of me be at peace. And now softening your mind, softening your heart. Bring to mind someone in your life these days who is a friend or a benefactor. Someone for whom you feel love or respect or delight in their existence in your life. And perhaps you can have an image of their face in front of you or a felt sense of their presence. May you be happy. And as you say these words you can maybe say their name as you sink into the feeling, the intention of the phrases of loving kindness. May you be happy. May you be filled with joy. May you be free from harm and danger. May you have good health. May you be filled with delight. May you live your days in ease. May you be at peace. And then continuing to breathe in and out through your chest. And then bring to mind some person from your recent times today or this week or recently who somewhat mildly irritates you. You don't like particularly but someone who's never done you any harm. Simply there's something about them which you find difficult or irritating. Remembering this person, visualizing them perhaps. Remembering the situation you were in last. Who you were with them or near them and you felt your irritation. And then imagining maybe reflecting on the good quality or qualities this person also might have. Or reflecting on the desire and the capacity of this person for happiness. And if you know their name you can state it quietly as you say the following phrases. May you be happy. May you be relaxed and content with your life. May you be free from anxiety or worry. May you be filled with joy and delight. May you be at peace. May you be at peace. And then you can bring to mind some other difficult person from your life that you know. And you can perhaps imagine that the two of them are sitting together. The first difficult person and the second one. And you can use your creative imagination to imagine how they would sit together so they can enjoy each other's company. These two people you find difficult. May both of you enjoy each other's company. May both of you be at ease. May both of you be filled with happiness. May both of you be at peace. And then bring to mind now finally a difficult person who has done you some harm. Perhaps not great harm. You don't have to think of the most difficult person possible. But think of someone who has done you some harm. And holding this person's memory or image of their face in front of you. Breathe in and out through your heart. Let in your heart be open and soft. Perhaps stating the person's name. Holding the name of the memory in your heart. And to whatever degree that you can, begin offering some loving kindness to this person. May you be happy. May you be free from worry and anxiety. May you feel content and safe in your life. May you experience the joy that arises out of your fundamental goodness. May you experience the joy that arises out of your fundamental goodness. May your fundamental goodness blossom throughout your body and your behavior. May you be at peace. And then letting go of all these people. Simply sit here with the feelings that exist in your body right now. The moods, the sensations. And let go of all these people. The sensations. Breathing in and out through the chest. Softening into the body. Yielding yourself into your body. Breathing in and out through the chest. Breathing in and out through the chest. Breathing in and out through the chest. Breathing in and out through the chest. Breathing in and out through the chest. And perhaps for the last few minutes here, you can send loving kindness to yourself. Sinking into yourself. Allowing maybe the loving kindness to arise out of your fundamental goodness. Sinking into yourself. Sinking into yourself. Sinking into yourself. Sinking into yourself. Sinking into yourself. Sinking into yourself. Sinking into yourself. There are various ways of beginning to soften the heart, to send loving kindness to difficult people. One way is to reflect on some good qualities they might have. You might be easier to think about many of the bad qualities. But spend some time thinking about maybe they have one or two that you can think of. And that can be a toehold to start feeling some loving kindness towards them. You can also sometimes imagine someone is very causing a lot of difficulty for you or is angry with you or whatever. Sometimes their behavior arises out of their own suffering. And sometimes it's possible to reflect on the suffering that must be behind that person's activities and actions. And if you can feel the suffering then or see it, to perceive it, then sometimes you can have compassion for the person. And compassion is very closely related to loving kindness. And the compassion becomes the way in, to begin to have some softening to the person and some open-heartedness. And it's also said sometimes, I don't know if it just pops psychology or what it is, but it's sometimes said that when you find someone... Something that someone does irritates you. It's sometimes said that... because they have some quality that you don't like in yourself. Now, maybe sometimes it's true. Maybe it's pop psychology, maybe sometimes. So it's an interesting thing to explore. If you meet someone, just they kind of rub you the wrong way. What's going on? And what's actually rubbing you the wrong way? Is it them or is it something within you? Or something you don't want to see in yourself or you fear in yourself? Sometimes turning the mirror back on yourself in such situations is very useful. And before, I guess before I ask you how all that was, I'll read you a story. Mula Nausurdein decided to start the flower garden. He prepared the soil and planted the seeds of many beautiful flowers. But when they came up, his garden was filled not just with his chosen flowers, but also overrun by dandelions. He sought advice from gardeners all over and tried every method known to get rid of them, but to no avail. Finally, he walked all the way to the capital to speak to the royal gardener at the Sheik's palace. The wise old man had counseled many gardeners before and suggested a variety of remedies to expel dandelions. But Mula Nausurdein had tried them all. They sat together in silence for some time and finally the gardener looked at Nausurdein and said, Well, then I suggest you learn to love them. So how was that today, sitting here? With forgiveness and yourself and difficult people? Yeah? I'm flunking. You were sitting there with a big smile on your face. I was going to flunk with such a smile. My brain, I just, you know, I'm an irritated person and you say, you be empty and I think, I schmuck. I came up to a counter to each thing and then people that aren't really angry at me, I just had to open my eyes. And like last week, like the one person that comes to mind is my husband's boss, who even told me one time she takes a certain enjoyment of being sadist to her employees. The best I can come up with is like not sending her a box of shim. But you know what you want to do when you start doing this, it's a slow process of beginning to open up loving kindness to wider and wider circles. But you don't necessarily want to start with the people most difficult. You start with something really easy. I mean, maybe, you know, there was a store clerk today who was just, you know, slightly rude, just very slightly. But the next person he was, you know, next person they helped was just, you know, they went out of their way to help this little girl who was kind of, you know, I don't know. Just think of something, you know, start with someone who's just maybe not so difficult. And then slowly you can be an experiment. I started with this neighbor, and then I would think things like, well maybe it would be a piece except for the mirror, and it's getting addictive because it's so noisy. I guess it feels contrived to really... So maybe it's not appropriate to do it to them. Just do it to loving kindness in the directions that you can. And to yourself and to your feelings that you have. And how do you feel about having such feelings for your husband's boss? Do you feel indignant or justified in them? Or do you... At this point I feel like it's okay to have those thoughts as long as I know it's best on it. To someone else. Yes. I was wondering about doing a part of your setting loving kindness to someone who's heard this person came up from the inside of a crime. She's been there for some time. I'm so sure because I've heard that kind of a story when I haven't done it. I've done something about this very appropriate. At the end we haven't talked about that. I don't know how that works. Classically, in the classic instructions, you're not supposed to send loving kindness people who are dead. It says only to living people and people of the same sex, they said also. But I've known... But I've known in that situation where people have actually harmed you or hurt you or something, I've known many people who have done loving kindness afterwards. Loving kindness is closely related to forgiveness and it's kind of a releasing of the bitterness. So if you do loving kindness to someone you're sexually attracted to, you know, it's like someone sexually appropriate sex, it might get kind of complicated, loving kindness. But if you're doing it to someone who you have resentment or anger towards, I think you're less likely to have that kind of difficulty. But you still have that holding. And as long as you have the holding, you're in pain. So you want to find some way to release that and open it. And one way to do that is to begin doing loving kindness. And loving kindness doesn't mean that you're condoning or ignoring or forgetting about what they've done to you. You still allow that to be there. But given that, is it possible to find some way to feel warmer or more open-hearted towards them? Same thing with forgiveness. In order to be able to forgive, forgiveness is this wonderful virtue in the West, at least, especially in Judeo-Christian traditions. So you're supposed to forgive. But in order for forgiveness to exist, there has to be resentment. If there's no resentment, you can't forgive. So suddenly, you know, now resentment becomes kind of close to being good. But forgiveness doesn't... also in order to forgive, the event that you're forgiving someone for had to have been wrong or injurious. Because forgiveness is not excusing them or justifying it. Or finding someone, you know, understanding the situation better, understanding why they did it and therefore it was okay. Then there's no reason to forgive them. So forgiveness and loving kindness doesn't mean that you stop seeing the situation as having been inappropriate. You see it. You say, yeah, that was wrong to have done that. But even so, is there some aspect of their life or some aspect of who they are who you can offer loving kindness to? So I think it's probably often very appropriate to do it to people who are dead. I'm sorry I talked so long. Maybe you had more to say. Yes? I guess it was kind of hard about someone that you've hurt when I hurt. Just feeling bad about it. I realize I didn't feel bad about it. I guess there's still some feeling of justification. So at that time, do you just decide, well, it's not time to try setting this as loving kindness? I can't really come up with a feeling bad about having... I could think it was kind of co-creative and it wasn't just me. Like this person who hurt someone that was dealing with it. So maybe at this point it's inappropriate to be involved in the process of forgiveness. But certainly it should still be possible to have feelings, open feelings of loving kindness to that person. And if you can't, then I would suggest that there's some kind of holding. Some kind of holding back, some kind of blockage of the heart. And you might stop doing loving kindness then and explore that with mindfulness. Explore your heart and what's going on with that person and the feelings there. My experience is that it's very easy for me to do this in the group. And both with the loving kindness and with the vipassana, I feel like my experience is much stronger within a group and I have a lot more difficulty sitting on my own. And staying focused and being able to sit for any length of time. But in a group it seems very powerful to me. It is very powerful. One of the things to be said about that is that I spent years, not my first years of practice, but many of my early years of practice in Zen monasteries where it's all group practice. And there's no question about, are you going to go meditate? The bell rings and you go, or you leave the monastery and kick you out. It's like you follow the life of the monastery. And everybody's doing the same thing. So you have all this group support. Now it's time to go work, now it's time for this, now it's time for everybody's doing things together. And what I saw was that for some people in that environment, they never found their own motivation to practice, their own intention. They didn't kind of find some way to discover their own deepest intention to practice and how to follow through on it. And so when they left the Zen monasteries and went off on their own, they fell apart. They didn't know what practice was, they didn't know how to practice. They didn't even know why they were practicing. It was easy with the peer pressure to kind of practice. And I think that it's very important at some point, when you first start practicing, at some point to discover in yourself the source of motivation that encourages you to practice on your own, to find some way to bring practice into your daily life and into your own sitting practice at home. And part of that is finding your own deepest intention, your own motivation, what you really most want, what your heartfelt deepest wish for yourself. That's part of it, and the other part is to start noticing what gets in the way of following through on that heartfelt wish for yourself. And I don't know where you're at, whether you need to find the intention or you need to find what's holding you back. It might be a combination of both. But I would suggest to you that that's a very, very rich and important area for you to explore and get to understand yourself in. And to hopefully find your own spirituality, find your own practice that is self-generating. And I mean, you're welcome to always come to a group, it's probably beneficial, but I would hope you find your own. And that's something we can talk about some other time together privately, or if you want to talk more about it. Is there anything that a person could do that shouldn't be forgiven? I mean, I'm asking that because I see some of the worst behaviors. So maybe we forgive, we're not forgiving what they did, we're forgiving them as a person. We're not condoning what they did. What they did remains wrong. But forgiveness is a willingness to be open-hearted to that person again, to let go of the resentment. But it doesn't mean that you've condoned or even accepted the rightness of that phenomena. But if we're going to forgive this to happen, and probably often for loving kindness also then, because we don't want to get too idealistic around all this, having to do it to everyone because it's a good idea, but in order for forgiveness and loving kindness to really work with difficult people, it really helps if they have apologized. It really helps if they stop doing what they're doing. If you're still receiving the injury from someone, it's very hard to forgive someone as they continue injuring you. So sometimes you have to get the situation to stop, and you have to get the situation, and it's very helpful if the person apologizes because if a person apologizes and confesses, that means that they recognize. They're saying, I don't agree with this anymore, I don't condone what I did, I don't stand behind what I did anymore. So the person themselves has separated themselves from the event that they've done. And if they separated themselves from it by a confession or apology, then it's a lot easier to open up to them as a person. But if they're still standing behind what they did, and maybe even still doing it, I think it's very hard, maybe even inappropriate, in that situation to have forgiveness to someone. I can be firmly complaining, and I can understand intellectually the concept and the benefits of that, but there's certain people, for instance, this man that murders two of his children, and I was dealing with him and he'd done it to his second child. He just can't even be, and he wasn't admitting anything, and maybe he was coming out later, but... I had such a... Before I even knew it was... That's what had happened, I was having this reaction to him that was like, this... And I trusted that. I said, I don't know what that is, but my body knows something's wrong. And it just seems like there's some people who are so twisted, hard to imagine. One of the ground rules for mindfulness, and probably from Buddhism at large, is to... It's very important to distinguish between the ideal and the actual. And there's often a big difference between the ideal and the actual, right? And Buddhism has more to do about the actual than the ideal. So what you really want to do is to discover and wake up what's actually happening. And don't be too concerned about some kind of ideal of loving kindness or forgiveness or all these ideas. We do it as a practice. And remember, see, maybe it's because we have this Judeo-Christian background, where forgiveness is this absolute thing that comes from God, you know, and we have to confess, you know, and it's a major thing. Forgiveness is this major theological thing in the West. And, you know, are we right? Are we wrong? Are we this? Are we that? You know, and it has to happen and all that. In Buddhism, loving kindness and forgiveness practice is a meditation practice we're doing for ourselves, for our own benefit. And so we do it to the degree which is helpful for us. So you don't necessarily have to kind of have some kind of, you know, great idealistic justification. You have to, you know, forgive the most difficult murderer in San Jose and, you know, just start where you're at and make it easy for yourself. This practice is for your sake, not his sake. Why? Just because they don't even know they're doing this. Sorry? They don't need to know that they're thinking this. Yeah. So anyway, there's a very important point, I think, is distinguishing between the actual and the ideal. And in Buddhism we tend, you know, we kind of forget about the ideal in favor of waking up to the actual. And the teaching of Buddhism is if you can really wake up to the actual, then everything will be fine. But if you try to live the ideal, then you begin entering into problems. Does that make sense? Anything else for us to end today with that you'd like to talk about? What you're saying is don't be too perfectionist about it. Exactly. Give yourself a break. So my intention is to come for the next two weeks and just continue doing Loving Kindness at five thirty. How many of you think you will come? So it's nice to continue. Good. And then I don't know when, I mean, my ideal is to be able to offer this every Thursday. But it's not so easy for my life to do that. And so probably I'll do it two more weeks and then I'll try to think about, I'll figure out when I can start again. But it might not be until January. And what would be nice to have is a group of people who felt that they wanted to lead Loving Kindness Meditation. So it could happen without my necessarily always being here. But I don't know if any of you have enough experience and background in it that you feel brave enough to do that. And I don't know anybody that can invite in just for this hour. So until we figure it out, underline the word we, I'll do it when I can and when I can't come I guess we won't meet. Unless I hear other ideas from you. Is there room for anyone? No. Well, someone has to get a key. There's no key. I have a key. And anyway, so thank you all very much. It was a wonderful four-week course and I guess it's going to be a five-week course next week. A six-week course after that. Great. That needs more work.
