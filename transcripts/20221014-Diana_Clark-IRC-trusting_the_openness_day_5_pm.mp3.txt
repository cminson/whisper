 So continuing on this theme of stepping away from our lives while we're on retreat, so that we can bring the Dharma back into our lives. And what is it? What is it that we might bring back to our lives? This even sounds a little funny right back to our lives as if we have this other life. We just have one life. But one thing that we might consider, something that's being cultivated here that can be a support in more and more arenas, is this notion of trusting openness. This openness to our experience. And part of retreat practice is to create the conditions in which there can be some opening, requires some stilling, some quieting, maybe a feeling of a little bit more safety, less hurriedness, allows us to open in some way to what's happening, whatever that might be. Whether it's an event that's out there, whether it's an inner experience, whatever it might be. And so this being with whatever is arising. So increasing our capacity to be with difficulties, to be with the beautiful, to be with the boring. Right, we're having all these experiences here and just to increase our capacity to allow the experiences to be experiences. Without our insisting that they be different, without our demanding that they somehow make us feel better. Just trusting the openness, including opening to seeing ourselves in new ways. Maybe we had a certain idea about ourselves, or, I'm the person who does this, I'm the person who doesn't do that. I'm not sure who I am, but I'm certainly not like that. And Brian spoke about having this thick self and thin self. Sometimes this thick self is really congealed and stuck in some kind of way. And one way that maybe goes from thick to thin is to see, to be open to, you know what, I'm not always that way. It's open to new ideas about ourselves, including some stuff that might not be that flattering. Sharing stuff that maybe is beautiful and has some warmth and care that we've touched into and be towards people that we don't even know but we're sharing this retreat experience with. Open to seeing that maybe other people are more nuanced in the same way that we are more nuanced than we often think about. It's tempting, it's easy, it's comfortable to just kind of say, put a label on somebody and say, this person is like that. And then we have a relationship with the label, not the person. And that doesn't feel good to anybody. So, part of what we can bring to more and more aspects of our life is this trusting of openness. But of course, it requires that we have some of experience of openness before we can trust it. And so we create this artificial, we might say, container of retreat experience. I mean, it's real, right, because it's actually here, but it's distinct from our daily life, our ordinary life, in which we can explore and experiment, discover. What is it like to be more open? And what does that even mean to be open? Because maybe we are noticing that when we are not open, that's a way in which we feel confined, constricted, limited, maybe in ways that we're not even recognizing until we get a little bit of taste of some of more openness, and then in relationship to that more openness, like, oh, I see how I was limiting myself. Unnecessarily, perhaps. I have this story that there was a time, this is quite a few years ago, that for whatever reason, I think there was a Dharma teacher that was giving a lot of talks about this topic, so it just kind of became like a trendy thing to talk about. And that is this idea that human beings, making this gross generalization, come in three types, the greedy type, the aversive type, the person who has delusion, and that we have one of these three, one of these three qualities that shows up the most for all of us. I recognize everybody has all three, but often we tend to want one or the other. And so, like as practitioners, we would kind of like talk about this, and sometimes in Dharma talks, I think it was coming up. And I remember a friend of mine, a fellow Dharma practitioner, saying, yeah, like you, Diana, I'm a delusion type, and then XYZ. I'm like, oh. But then I started to just think, oh, this person must be right, because look, I was deluded there, and oh, I'm deluded here too, and there, and I didn't even know, and oh, wow, maybe that's a sign that I'm deluded, that I didn't know that I was deluded, and all this. And then a couple months later, another friend of mine, well, you know, Diana, because you're the greedy type, that you have to, oh, maybe I am greedy, because look, I'm always wanting this, and I'm wanting that, and I'm striving after this, and straining to get that, oh, I guess I'm greedy. And this is a true story, because a few months later, a third friend said, yeah, you know all that aversion you have, Diana, because you're an aversive type? Like, oh, maybe I am aversive. But then realizing, no. But having been told that I was, and kind of like thinking that I was, I was just collecting all the data to support that particular view, and sometimes we do this, not open to the idea like, okay, I have a little bit of all kinds of stuff. Some of it's what I'm expecting, and our habits, and patterns, and some of it is maybe new and different, and we're a mixture. And there's some real beauty in that. We don't all have to be the same as individuals, we don't have to be the same as we were yesterday, and we don't have to all be the same with each other either. We have this mixture, and it's beautiful. So there's a way in which we kind of flatten our experience when we are assigning a label to it, in the same way that Brian yesterday held up the three different sized leaves, and instead of saying this one's the bigger one, and then realizing, oh, actually, in other settings it's the smaller one, right, the biggerness of it isn't inherent in the leaf, and the beauty of just a leaf. So there's some openness to, okay, what is this leaf like at this moment? And part of the bringing into the greater aspect is this idea of trusting this openness, and this is a practice. We might see things, feel things, understand things differently, but we also have to respect the momentum of our patterns and habits and our usual way of doing things. I teach Brahman Vahara practice a couple of times every week, and sometimes as part of equanimity practice, or sometimes working with the inner critic as that is a practice, I offer a phrase that we can use in the practice that I think would be sometimes, well, has been helpful for me, and I imagine it's helpful, and I have heard it is actually helpful for a lot of people, and this phrase is, I'm in the process of learning new ways, and this takes time. I'm in the process of learning new ways, and this takes time. So we might have experience of this openness, but then the trusting the openness takes time, and that's part of what practice is. This is something that affects all areas of our lives. And there's a story, I think it's a remarkable story, by a very esteemed member of this tradition, an elder in this tradition. Many of you have maybe practiced with this individual. I've heard a lot, I myself have not practiced with this person, but I've heard a lot of people have been touched by their teachings. That's Ajahn Succito. He's a monastic, I think he ordained in the 1970s, dedicated his whole life to practice. He's written some books, I think he was the abbot of a big thriving monastery. And he tells this true story that I'd like to read a little bit portion of, and with a bow to Brian who pointed out this story to me. It starts with Ajahn Succito writing, in my case, the trust in openness was most dramatically demanded of me when a group of bandits, brandishing axes and cudgels, jumped me near Rajgir in Bihar, India. Usually many of you know that monastics don't carry money with them, they have so few belongings, and they have, often they have like maybe a little satchel that they'll carry. They're completely dependent on the lay community, so monastics themselves don't have a whole lot if somebody wants to steal something from them. So he gets jumped by these bandits. Ajahn Succito continues, what do you do when four armed men have grabbed you? And in the heat of the moment, one is grimacing and waving an axe at your head. Fortunately, there's not much else to do, but to stay open. For me, in that moment, the reflection arose that everyone has to die and maybe this was my time. The only choice that was available was to go without fear. So instinctively, I bowed my head to the man with the axe and drew the blade of my hand across the top of my skull to indicate where to hit. This won't take long, I thought. The bandit paused and his energy and body language softened. I stepped forward, again offering my head. The heat in the situation dropped like a stone. The man with the axe looked confused and lowered his weapon. The other man released my arms. I slipped my bag from my shoulder, placed it before them and slowly walked away. In my case, the trust and openness was most dramatically demanded of me when a group of bandits brandishing axes and cudgels jumped me. Trusting openness. I felt really touched by this story. Think of like in the tussle of the moment with these bandits with weapons and to be able to have the wherewithal and the able to see the bigger picture like, well, I guess everybody has to die and maybe this is my time and I don't want to go with fear. And so choosing openness instead. This is freedom to choose. I don't want to go with fear. Couldn't do anything about bandits who have weapons. But this is what's being pointed to here. Something really incredible. Something powerful to have this kind of freedom, to have this kind of wherewithal, to be balanced and open in these kinds of situations and seeing the bigger picture rather than just collapsing into the moment. It's beautiful. Trusting the openness. That doesn't mean that every time we trust the openness when everything horrifying happens to us that it's going to work out well, right? But this ability to say, I don't want to go with fear and to not have fear. This is what the Buddha is pointing to. This is the freedom that's possible with practice. And so what is it that's a support for this trusting, this openness? In the Buddhist language of the early Buddhism, there's this word. Many of you are familiar with it. It's upekka. We often translate it as equanimity. It's this kind of stability, unshakable, this balance not being pushed around. This willingness and ability to be open to things as they are, whether they are challenging or boring or maybe there's some joy that maybe we don't really feel like we deserve so we can't even open up to the joy or the beauty. So upekka, some, I think we literally translated upa plus iksha is, we could say it as looking upon. And I think it's really important that it's looking upon. It's not looking away. It's not this, I can be balanced as long as I am ignoring or don't come into contact with that. And upekka is looking upon also highlights this seeing the bigger picture, which we don't have access to when we're busy trying to make things match our preferences. Is this what humans do? Of course we do. But it's also a way in which we kind of limit ourselves, limit our lives. If we're just chasing after our preferences, it's exhausting. And if you noticed, there's always one more preference to chase after, it's quite something. So this equanimity is this capacity to be steady and balanced and to see the bigger picture and to be sure that works both ways. When we're balanced, we can see the bigger picture and if we can see a little bit of the bigger picture, it's easier to be balanced. They definitely go together and we can work with either of those dynamics or aspects, whichever is available to us, whichever is the most comfortable for us at that moment. And so this equanimity allows for an even-minded acceptance of oneself and others that grows out of respect, that grows out of care, not indifference, not disconnection. The English word equanimity also translates, another polyword. It's a little bit unusual that we have two polywords that we use a single English word for. And I just like to say this word, it's a fun word to pronounce, tatra maja tata. We don't have words like that in English, tatra maja tata, to stand in the middle. So this not leaning or careening, but to be standing in the middle. And you see that when I express that, I just found myself sitting upright. It's quite something, how even just that activity of the body being upright helps the mind to be upright. And steady helps the heart to be upright and steady. It's much harder to meet things, right, if we're like this. Sometimes and for those of you who can't see me, I'll say that I just was slouched over. It's more difficult to meet our experience that when we're slouched, there are times in our life when we, that's all we can do is slouch. Seasons with illness or terrible brokenheartedness when maybe that's all that's available. So I don't want to say that we shouldn't be that way because sometimes we are. I just want to point out the equanimity. There's a number of things that support it and we shouldn't discount the role of the body as a way to support some of this steadiness, this uprightness. So equanimity, for those of you who have been around the Buddhist scene for a while, you know it's in a lot of lists. And maybe you've noticed in all these lists, there's something in common with all of them. It's the last element in all these lists. And for me it's noteworthy that five faculties, well it's not in the five faculties, but all these lists, four noble truths, seven factors of awakening, eight of this, ten of that, twelve of these, that when we see them in the suttas they are always in the same order. Always. So there's a little bit of, maybe a lot of significance in the order and equanimity is always at the end. Probably this idea that it's part of the path of practice, so we do practice towards equanimity. This is a pretty high bar that Ajahn Su Chito described. It's an amazing thing. You practice a tremendous amount. So it's a product or it's influenced by all the other practices that we are doing, other things that are in these lists. And so some of these things, if we look at them, that's where it's before equanimity, it's like what's immediately preceding equanimity in these lists. If we have this idea that it's a progression, joy is before equanimity in the Brahma Vahara's. Happiness is before equanimity in the jhana's, the third jhana has a quality of happiness, the fourth jhana has a quality of equanimity. Loving kindness is before equanimity in the paramese, the list of the paramese. There's something that these things have in common, right? This kind of warm heartedness, this well-being, this warmth. Sometimes we forget that the direction that we're going or part of what we're cultivating along with this idea of wisdom is this warmth and well-being, loving kindness, happiness, joy. These are integral parts of the practice, absolutely. And I will say for myself, my practice had such a big change when I finally realized that. Oh, there needs to be effort and ease. It's not always easy to find that, like how do we have effort and ease and when is there a little bit more effort that I'm getting stretched and it's uncomfortable, but I still have a sense that this is the way forward. And what is ease as opposed to getting completely disengaged and doing a whole lot of sleeping, which I've done plenty of on retreat, going into my room and just sleeping or maybe hiding away from what was being seen in the meditation hall. It's a part of why Brian and I are pointing to you in this practice of noticing the well-being, noticing some of the pleasure that's associated with practice as a support, as an integral part of this path towards equanimity, towards freedom. So there's a story about seeing the bigger picture. It's a Zen story, at least it's attributed to Zen, I don't know if it actually is. And I remember when I first heard this story, you know, it's really stayed with me. I don't know if this, if you hear it will stay with you, but it was helpful. Probably it was Gil Fronstoll that I heard this story from initially. There once was an old Zen farmer. Every day the farmer used his horse to help work his fields. This makes sense, right? We use horses to all kinds of things. They plow the fields, they carry the people who are riding them from one place to another. And they're like really integral part of farming. If you're in a setting in which you're using horses, they're really an integral part of the farm. One day the horse ran away. All the villagers came by and said, oh, we're so sorry to hear this. This is such bad luck. The Zen farmer responded, bad luck, good luck, who knows? And the villagers were kind of confused by his response, but decided to ignore him. A few weeks went by and then his horse returns. But this time the horse was bringing other horses with him. He had joined a pack and the pack were following this. So this group of horses come to where the farmer is. They follow his horse and somehow they all get into a corral. So now the farmer had more horses. And the villagers come to him and say, wow, what good luck you have. This is so fortunate for you. And the farmer responds, good luck, bad luck, who knows? A few weeks later the farmer's son was helping his father work on the farm. And while trying to tame one of these new horses, he got injured terribly, broke his leg and seemed like he had maybe some other injuries and was laid up in bed. And the villagers came by and said, oh, what bad luck that your son that helps you on the farm is no longer able to help you. Bad luck, good luck, who knows? A few more weeks go by and the farmer's son was still recovering and he wasn't able to walk or do any manual labor to help his father around the farm. And a regiment of the army came and they were going to conscript all abled-bodied men, young men. The farmer's son was not able-bodied so they didn't conscript him and they left. And all the villagers came and said, wow, what good luck you have that they didn't take your son. And he's like, good luck, bad luck, who knows? So this idea of not just immediately deciding, oh, this is bad, this is good, but instead being open, this feels really uncomfortable and I wish it were different. It's different than saying this is bad and just kind of slapping that label on it and no longer really being open to what's there, some of the nuance, some of the richness, some of the teachings maybe. So I love this story, like maybe at the moment we have this idea, something's terrible, but probably all of us have this experience of something at the time is unfortunate, but later we realize, oh, it helped create the conditions for something even better. Maybe somebody that I know from me in high school, sure that at such a young age I desperately want to live the rest of my life with this person. Mom, dad, you guys don't understand. I thank goodness I didn't end up with that person. You don't have high school. But at the time it seemed like this is terrible, this is the end of the world. So all of us have those types of experiences, so can we trust maybe some openness that yes, this feels really unfortunate or yes, this is perfect and this is going to be a source of lasting happiness, I'm sure of it. But instead to maybe hold things with open hands instead of like clinging or grasping them and saying, no, it's only this one way. But to maybe have some equanimity, some stability, seeing the bigger picture, being able to stand in the middle and to see, yeah, there's some nuance here. This is where the richness of our life is too. So some of us, maybe when we hear the story of the Zen farmer, we might have this feeling, I don't know, this equanimity thing, it seems kind of unattractive actually. I'm not so sure about this. Maybe we feel like it's a disconnection or not caring. This farmer's just saying good luck, bad luck, I don't know. And he seems like kind of an indifferent, cold farmer. But equanimity is about having this stability and an openness of heart and an openness of mind. So it's not being shut down, it's not being cold, it's not being removed, it's not a dull gray state. It's some brightness, some vitality, has some warmth. And to be sure, as part of our practice, as we're exploring and learning, as we're trusting openness and more, allowing this openness to get into more and more areas of our lives, there are times when we'll slip into some indifference, we'll slip into some disconnection. Of course we will. This is how we learn. This is how we've like, oh, this type of aloofness comes with a coldness and a little bit of a cramped experience, as opposed to the openness that I felt on retreat that time when I was walking and I saw that bunny rabbit and it made me have this little delight and just some openness to seeing what I had been so tightly grabbing onto just a moment before. I don't have to hold on so tightly. But we, as humans, sometimes we do slip into indifference. And then just to recognize, oh, okay, I'm a little bit disconnected. And maybe sometimes we're disconnected because we don't want to get into overwhelm. And maybe that's a wise thing to do, is to back up a little bit from something that we're about to stumble or fall into. The word that's coming to me is overwhelm. We don't want, that's not where we want to go. But equanimity is not indifference. It's this spaciousness, this openness. And also there might be a way in which we might think about equanimity as, I don't know, if I'm really so interested in this. I don't know. I'm not really sure about it because somehow we like having drama in our lives. There's a way in which gives us some juiciness. It gives us some thing to feel like I get to fix this. Who would I be if there weren't a problem that I were fixing? Or it's a way in which we have this sense of I need to get something or I need to get rid of something and that gives us a sense of purpose or meaning or something. And we're loathe to soften that. What if? What if all that's left is something that's gray and dull and cold? Or maybe we want some of this juiciness and drama in our lives. Maybe that's the way that we grew up. This is how love gets shown or something as part of our culture, our family. So there might be a way in which we might think that, I don't know about this equanimity thing. But equanimity is about being connected and being steady. It's about letting our hearts be touched, touching others' hearts with warmth, with openness and steadiness. This is what we all want in some kind of way. So equanimity is a place where we're unagitated and we have access to our greatest wisdom, open-heartedness. Liberation has these same qualities. Wisdom has these same qualities. Unagitated, open, warm, not being pushed around but free. We all have these moments of equanimity. We might be brief. We might maybe want to be dismissive because they're not necessarily these knock your socks off kind of experiences. This is the direction we're going. These little tastes of liberation, these little tastes of freedom that are showing up along the path. We don't have to wait until we have complete awakening. And it's the conditions of equanimity that allows the deepest letting go that allows for the deepest freedoms. And deepest is relative to wherever we are. Maybe what was deepest for you at the very beginning of your practice is not the same as what's deepest for you today. This idea of trusting the openness. What does it mean to be open? Part of what we're exploring here. And then what does it mean to trust it as part of what we're exploring here? And this is something that we can take with us after retreat. Let's just sit for a few moments. Let's just sit for a few moments. So thank you for your practice and thank you to all of you for your support. Thank you for your kind attention. And I have one announcement. Tomorrow Brian and I will offer practice discussions on a sign-up basis. So that means there's another blank sheet of paper, well not completely blank, but with blank spots. And there's enough spots for a little bit less than half of you. So if you feel like it would be a support for your practice to meet with us tomorrow, you're welcome to sign up for either me or Brian. Then we encourage those people or maybe newer to practice or don't have access to a teacher or a song, perhaps maybe encourage those people to sign up. So first, if you do have access to a teacher or maybe you're part of a song community, maybe to hold back just a little bit to have some those to sign up. And it's on the dining room door just where it was on Monday and I don't think there are any other announcements. Okay, thank you.
