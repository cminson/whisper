Here we go.
Okay, so hello, hello and welcome everyone to happy hour.
Lovely to see you, wonderful to be with you, always happy making.
Just going around and saying hello and reading all the places
in the country and the world that you're joining from.
We're all joining each other. It just makes me happy. It just brings joy.
It's happy making for me. So many people are dedicating this time, whether it's Friday afternoon,
Friday evening, early evening, late evening, middle of the afternoon, middle of the day,
in Saturday as the case is for Marie Christine joining us.
So that we come together and practice together just makes my heart happy.
And also folks are joining us from YouTube to acknowledge them.
Hi, hello, says Nick. Hi, Nick.
So, alright, so for the theme for tonight, what I would like to share is
inspired by something that I read from John Keats, the poet who
who lived who actually just a little bit about John Keats, which I didn't know he died from tuberculosis when he was 25 years old.
And it was actually he also lived through a time, a time of pandemic.
There were many people in his family who were ill who died before him.
He went through a lot of suffering.
And this is from a letter, this quote that I found is from a letter that he wrote to his brother, which is so beautiful, so beautiful.
So he says, call the world, if you please, the veil of soul making.
Then you will find out the use of the world.
I am speaking now in the highest terms for human nature, admitting it to be mortal, which I will take care for granted.
Of course, he's talking from a particular perspective from the Christian perspective, but let me I say soul making soul is distinguished from intelligence.
There may be intelligences or sparks of the divinity in millions, but they are not souls till they acquire personality itself.
And then he ends, do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school and intelligence and make it a soul, a place where the heart must feel and suffer in a thousand diverse ways.
I read again the highlights, the parts I want to highlight.
Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school and intelligence and make it a soul.
So here, maybe in the words, talking about intelligence, so knowing awareness and that that all the pains, all the sorrows of the world are necessary in order to take this knowing to take this intelligence as a human being to make us into a heart.
Instead of the word soul, I use the heart, how to make a mind and make it into a heart that that the suffering of the world is needed for us to feel compassion for ourselves, for the others.
And he ends by saying a place where the heart must feel and suffer in a thousand diverse ways.
Call the world, if you please, the veil of soul making, or maybe I would say the veil of compassion, the veil of heart making.
So there are different ways, different teachings. Of course, this is a teaching in Buddhism that that that compassion arises. Suffering isn't just in vain. And and of course, all here's another teaching in Buddhism that comes to mind that there are two types of suffering in Buddhism.
There is suffering that leads to more suffering. And there is suffering that leads to the end of suffering.
So the type of suffering that leads to more suffering is just why me, this is terrible, why is it happening to them? So it's often just more suffering, just suffering, wallowing in suffering, wallowing in pain, wallowing in pain. That's the type of suffering that leads to more suffering.
And of course, we all know that type right when the mind just takes off and we're wallowing in it.
The suffering, the second type of suffering is one that leads to the end of suffering. And that is a profound teaching.
So in that way, it depends how we approach suffering, how we see suffering, if we wallow, if, if we get lost in it, they're just piling, piling on more suffering. Whereas, if we open our hearts, open our hearts to compassion, we cultivate compassion as Keats call the world in this world,
the tale of soul making, he says, I call it compassion making, making us into real human beings who feel, who love, more compassionate, fully inhabiting our humanity.
And a compassionate heart has freedom, there is freedom in compassion, there is strength in compassion, there is beauty in compassion, there is peace, there is bliss in compassion.
So the suffering, as we work with it with compassion, it can open our heart for compassion towards ourselves and others.
And also, there are wisdom practices when we see, when we see the unsatisfactoriness, the suffering then can lead to seeing the three characteristics, which I have mentioned before, impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not self.
And again, it's the end of suffering in the way that we're not impacted by it. Of course, the suffering still happens for us and others in the world challenges, but there is, instead of saying we're not impacted by it, maybe I should say, we don't wallow in it.
That's what I need to say. Of course, we're impacted because our heart opens up to compassion when there is suffering.
Of course, our perspective changes so that when suffering arises for ourselves and for others in the world, the automatic response is compassion, is care, and there is a stability, there is a beauty, there is a goodness in compassion.
And in the bigger perspective of equanimity, holding it all, holding it all spatiously, very, very spatiously, very spatiously, is comings and goings. Again, we are impacted, and yet we don't wallow, we don't wallow in it.
Our perspective doesn't become limited to just the suffering, we don't just identify with the suffering for ourselves and others.
Okay, that was a longer dharma than I intended to give, but that's the framing for tonight, dear friends. Let's practice together. Let's land. Let's land in our seat.
If you need to shift and move so that you're comfortable, it's the perfect time, sitting or lying down or standing, arriving in this body, arriving in this moment in time.
And for this moment, releasing, releasing out of care, out of love, releasing entanglements just to stabilize,
just to cultivate stability, to arrive, feeling each breath in the lower abdomen, let it be breathed on its own.
Thank you.
Feeling the bottom of your feet on this earth, earth on earth, the solidity, the contact points.
As if you're breathing through your feet, as if the breath was being breathed from other earth into this body, each breath nourishing.
Moving up from the feet, through the legs, through the sit bones, through the belly, up through the torso.
Touching the belly of the chest, arms, head.
Not in an effortful way, let it, let it happen on its own. Connected to Mother Earth.
Sheised and breathed by Mother Earth.
Sheised and breathed by Mother Earth.
Feeling each breath soothing, comforting, settling your body, deeply settling.
Settling your heart.
Settling your heart.
Settling your heart.
Settling your heart.
Settling your heart.
Settling your heart.
Settling your heart.
Settling your heart.
Each breath nourishing, settling, breathing through the feet, up through the legs, through the torso, expanding through the body, calming, nourishing, healing.
Stabilizing, settling the heart and mind.
Bringing a sense of stability with each breath, both tenderness and stability.
Relaxed, alert.
Tender, the heart.
Stable and grounded.
Stable and grounded.
Now let us imagine, if you will, Quan Yin, Quan Yin, the Paragon, the Perfection of Compassion as Being.
You're not familiar with Quan Yin, you can imagine the Prada, either Quan Yin or the Prada.
Whichever, whomever with you have a relationship, imagine them.
Gazing upon you, holding you, as you sit in their presence, in your mind's eye.
They hold you with their gaze, with a compassionate gaze.
Knowing your life, knowing your history, knowing your sorrow, sufferings, knowing your joys, your goodness.
The goodness within, they see that more than, even more than you see it yourself.
They see all of you in so much more than you can see yourself.
Let yourself be seen with eyes of compassion, letting your body relax.
Continuing to be breathed through the earth, being embodied.
Maybe this is not visual, maybe it's a feeling, that you're being held in the energy of compassion by them.
Or maybe it's more felt sense, you're sitting on their lap, being held maybe like a newborn.
And appreciating how their compassion is stable, it's powerful, it's a soothing balm.
They love, care, hold, all that you are, the ten thousand joys, the ten thousand sorrows.
Expansively, without being toppled into your suffering, they care, and yet there is a stability.
Now imagine that they so gently and lovingly set you down, and say to you, let me show you how it's done.
They invite you to see the world through their eyes.
As if the Buddha or the Kwan Yen, you invite them to enter your heart, enter your mind, shining out.
So it's your body, but they're gazing out, they're feeling.
So you feel the sense of stability.
Looking through their eyes, their gaze, this unbounded compassion for yourself and for the world.
Hearing the cries, the cries of sorrow, yourselves and others included.
Others were suffering and war zones, and you hear the joys also.
Being breathed through Mother Earth, through your feet, your heart expensive.
Looking through their eyes of ultimate compassion, allowing yourself to be impacted, of course impacted.
You feel, you feel, of course, there is love, there is caring, and yet not toppled over.
And holding the sorrows, the suffering of the world, opens your heart more to compassion, to the goodness of compassion.
Not empathic distress, which is agony, but compassion which is soothing, healing, wishing well.
For others for yourself, there is care, warmth.
Your heart quivers with, feels with.
Your heart feels with the sorrow, the suffering.
And the stability.
The world is the veil of compassion making.
The world is the veil of compassion making.
The world is the veil of compassion making.
The world is the veil of compassion making.
The world is the veil of compassion making.
The world is the veil of compassion making.
The world is the veil of compassion making.
Let yourself be held in the compassion in care and love.
A gentle cultivation and training.
A gentle cultivation and training.
A gentle cultivation and training.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
And if there is any judgment arising, I can't do this.
This is hard. My mind is wondering, etc. It's okay.
It's okay. You're doing your best. Let it all be held.
Expansively with compassion, with care, you're doing your best.
Let the judgment be held with compassion and care and love.
With non-judgment.
With non-judgment.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
And as we come to the end of this practice period,
allowing your inner Kwan Yin, your inner Buddha to hold you in however this practice period was.
What it was, what it wasn't, let it be held with care, with compassion, with appreciation.
Letting go of any judgment that you've done your best.
Offering your goodness, our goodness collectively, to all beings everywhere.
May all beings everywhere be safe and at ease.
May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be free.
Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice.
So we have a few minutes. Any reflections, questions, you can type them in chat if you wish.
If you type them to me privately, I won't read your name, just the reflection.
You can also type them publicly or raise your hand.
Any questions, comments, complaints, everything is welcome.
Any aha moments, anything that you discovered.
Did anyone discover, realize that you had more stability than you realized?
With Kwan Yin or the Buddha, Neil, I see your hand.
Yeah, but you just said what I was going to say, you ruined it.
I'll take you back, Neil, you say it now.
So first of all, that was a lovely practice, right?
And it was, you know, you started and I'm like, you know, why are we doing this earth thing?
You know, I'm like, whatever, right? You know, I had nothing better to do, so I went with it.
You know, and then, you know, you're funny, Neil, I just want to say, you're, you're back.
I'll be playing here all week.
You know, and then, you know, and then, you know, we started talking about difficult things, you know, and, you know, I found myself sort of flipping back and forth in my head.
You know, we are when things got difficult, you know, I would like, you know, for a breath or two, I would like feel the ground inside of me.
You know, and it was, you know, it was just, it was just, you know, it was a very strong stance, if you will. It was very nice.
Beautiful. Thank you, Neil. Strong stance. Lovely. Thank you. I'm delighted. Yes.
There is a method to the madness.
Mardora, please. I don't know if I'll be able to articulate this, but I come from a family of people who are always trying to save, you know, saviors, right?
And, and I, I feel like I could feel in this meditation, like, like embodying Quan Yin or having Quan Yin embody me that like, just how different it is to be with versus to like jump in, you know, and
I think I understand that conceptually, but it was nice to feel it like in a bodily way. It's a lot, if there's like a coolness to it, that I was really appreciating.
And I feel like I could, I could use more of this. I don't know if you have recommendations for like.
My dear, it's available to you. It's your inner Quan Yin, your inner Buddha is always available to you. Call them up and they show up and they embody you any moment.
Yeah, there's something about like that embodiment that, you know, because when I do a meta practice, I, I can sometimes just get like caught in the.
Yeah. Right. So this is, this is a method, right? This is a method. This is, and, and as you ask, okay, how do I do this? This is available to you anytime. Right.
This, this could be your practice. This could be. Oh, oh, yes. There is an image of Quan Yin. Oh, beautiful. What a gorgeous image. Thanks for sharing that.
Oh, my God, that is so perfect. That is so perfect. Maybe at the very end, when we, before we close, maybe we'll spotlight you and you can put hold it up after we, yeah, yeah, that's awesome.
Thank you. That'd be lovely. Yeah. So just to say, yeah, this is another way of practice. So it's available. If it's clicked for you, use it anytime in White Quan Yin.
Let, let her enter you and you know, just this is, it's all skillful means. If this worked, yes, great skillful means. Beautiful.
Thank you. Thank you. It's beautiful. Susan, please.
Yeah. Thank you for that practice. I guess I've been influenced mostly by the Chinese version of Quan Yin. And, you know, she's sitting cross-legged and looking very serene and almost joyful while she's being compassionate.
And then when I invited her to be and embody us to embody her and look out through her eyes, I remembered her. One of the translations of her Chinese name is the one who listens with ease to the sounds of the world.
And I was, I just felt that like she's just like so rooted in, you know, the present moment of, you know, just the wholeness of everything or, you know, the non, what do you call it, the emptiness side of things.
Yes.
She's so rooted and joyful in that and that she's unperturbed and there's this room for this big heart to just feel the compassion.
Beautiful. Yeah. Thank you for bringing that in and the embodiment, the ease also that you felt in her listening joyfully. It's true that the depictions are so beautiful.
She's listening with ease and also this invocation of emptiness because she sees the emptiness and yet she is moved. It doesn't mean like, oh, I don't care.
It's all empty. It's all, it's, it's, there's, there is the dance of, of just to say, just to bring this in since we just brought, we brought emptiness in emptiness.
It doesn't mean that it's pointless or, or empty. The word shunyatta, empty translation as empty is kind of funny a little bit, but it's, it's full, it's full of possibility.
There's so much, there's so much, it's both, it's, gosh, I feel like I need to give a hold on. No, I'm just going to leave it that I'll go back another time to this.
Thanks, Susan. Thanks for bringing ease to this. I can't, I'll pack it in just a couple of minutes. Thanks, Susan.
A couple of reflections and then we'll go into groups. Steve says this was a new visualization, having the passionate one inside us, the compassionate one inside us and seeing through those eyes.
Where did this come from something to do more of and get better at. Yes, yes.
So, yeah, where did it, I mean, there's so many skillful means. And I've learned to so, you know, these practices, some of them I come up with on my own or that, or they come through me, I can't say I come up with they come through me.
And, and, and this one is inspired by something I learned, I think, I see now, I think Jack cornfield has some version of this, maybe, I think, or someone else so that to where that that maybe this is where it came from some version of it.
And then a private reflection, I appreciated the earth breathing us, the earth breathing us from the feet up. Usually I begin meditation, beginning from the top of my head down. Yeah, yeah, all these different ways of experiencing that open up.
So, for the practice, small groups, I want to spend some time as I did last time to really set them up, because I think that helps the community practice more, you better together.
So, so as we come into groups, small groups, I invite you to speak only from your own experience, not comment on somebody else's experience, not ask them question, and not serve as a facilitator.
Only speak from your own experience for your own benefit. And you share a nugget from your own experience, if you wish, or you hold silence, you can say pass.
Or you can, and then you pass it to the next person instead of a monologue, long monologue, you just share one nugget, you pass it to the next person, the next person, maybe says pass, hold, hold silence or shares one nugget from their experience, and then passes it to the next.
And so it goes around and around, and staying close to the integrity of your own experience, speaking for your own benefit, not educating or impressing anyone, just a sacred space, and entering the space with love, with care for yourself and others, as if three
Kwanians are showing up, listening to each other, holding each other with care, with love. So, so with that, I'm going to create the breakout rooms, and the breakout rooms are on Zoom, information is on IMC website.
So, okay, so I'm just creating the rooms here. And in a moment, I will open them. And, okay, oops, wait, hold on, let me.
Be gentle with yourself. Be kind to each other. Here we go.
Thank you.
