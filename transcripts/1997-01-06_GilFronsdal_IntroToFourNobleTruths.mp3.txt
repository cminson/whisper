 I would like to start with a story, a famous story. It's said that it's been recorded that the Buddha was enlightened, awakened underneath the Bodhi tree on the full moon in May. And that's the hot season in northern India. And it's incredibly hot in Budh Gaya. And probably it wasn't as hot back then because they had more trees. But it's a very, very hot time. And I can well understand that someone inspired to resolve his spiritual questions would stay up all night. And it's said that then he was awakened, experienced his awakening early in the morning just before dawn. And it's probably the most pleasant time, that time of year. Probably the coolest, most refreshing, clearest, least dusty. And he attained his awakening, a man in his mid-thirties. And then it's said that he spent the next week continuing to do a lot of meditation practice, both sitting and walking practice, just enjoying himself, enjoying the experience of awakening that he had just had. Then it's said that for the next six or so weeks, he continued his practice, but now he started to reflect and think about what it is that he had discovered, what had happened to him. And how to be able to teach and explain to others so they also could get a taste of the same experience he had. And after these seven weeks of enjoyment and reflection, he then considered who he might teach first. And he remembered his five companions in the ascetic life. He had spent six years as an ascetic. And prior to deciding to let go of the ascetic life and to eat nourishing food. But he was still, I would imagine, had quite the look of an ascetic at this point. He probably was quite initiated. And rather than this beautiful image we have of this basically kind of well healthy looking person, I suspect that the night of his enlightenment, the Buddha was actually pretty frail. But he decided to go to visit his five ascetic companions who had abandoned him when he had abandoned the ascetic life. And they were residing 150 miles away outside of Varanasi in what's called the Deer Park in Sarnath. And by this time it is getting to be close a week away from the full moon of July. And by this time it's monsoon season in northern India. And here this man then, who then as it is recorded, spent seven or eight days walking these 150 miles from Bodh Gaya on the dirt paths, dirt roads to Varanasi, I suppose in the monsoons. It was quite wet. And I have this image of this man who attained his awakening. And he wasn't kind of easy to go lucky and come what may and I'll just sit here wherever I might come and I'll teach them if not I'll be fine. But rather, it is an example I think of a person who is in some ways quite determined. Maybe determined is not the right word, resolved or who set his mind to something and then followed through. And he was in a very kind of direct and full way to walk 150 miles, 20 miles a day in seven days to reach his friends. It said that he reached his friends and they saw him coming in the distance. And it was probably seems to be late afternoon just before dusk. And they saw him coming and they said to themselves, you know, here comes old Gautama who renounced the ascetic life. Let's just ignore him. He comes our way. Let's not do anything pretending not there or whatever. And because they looked down at him because the ascetic life was kind of the be all and end all, the last final frontier for spiritual life. And when he arrived, he walked up to them as he approached. There was something about his presence, his demeanor, his way that compelled them to stand up and to greet him and and offer him a nice seat and all that. But they even so, even though they kind of broken their agreement because of this compelling urge to kind of meet this person, they still addressed him as friend. And the Buddha explained that it wasn't appropriate to call him friend anymore. So I imagine they thought he was this guy now. And he was here to and he was now a Buddha, an awakened person, and they didn't believe him. And because they'd known him for only six years. How could he suddenly in a matter of a couple of months have been so transformed? And he three times you try to tell them that he was now Buddha and they should listen to him. And in the third time he said, look, you guys, you knew me for six years. And in all that time that I did every possible ascetic practice to the nth degree, did I ever claim that I had any understanding, any knowledge, any awakening? And they said, no, you never claimed that. And but now I come to you and I claim that you give me the benefit of the doubt. I'm not doing this casually. And so something about his presence and his, I guess, his argument convinced them to listen to him. And that evening then, and now it's the full moon of July in the monsoons season. He then sat down again outside under the trees in the deer park. And the deer park was known as a refuge for sages, for religious mendicants and people. And it was a gathering place with such people. And perhaps being a deer park and also it was a place that was safe for the deer because the sages and mendicants weren't going to do much to the deer. So the deer were around nearby and the Buddha then began to preach. And the first sermon that he gave was called the turning the wheel of the Dharma, setting in motion the wheel of the Dharma. And in this, he begins this talk by first explaining what he sets out to be the middle way. And the middle way he explains to his five ascetic friends lays in the middle between asceticism and sensual indulgence. So that seems like a pretty good place to start with someone who's an ascetic. And maybe that's why this famous, this teaching started that way. Kind of talk to them at their level of what their concerns are about. And this idea of the middle way has become very central to Buddhism. That it's not one, there's a tendency not to go into extremes but to find the middle way. Even the extremes of asceticism or dogmatism or sensual indulgence or whatever. And then after having explained that, he went into to explain the Four Noble Truths. And the Four Noble Truths are, I would say, the most central. If anything qualifies as the central teaching of Buddhism, it would be what's called the Four Noble Truths. And the more that I have studied these and thought about them, the more profound I realize that they are. I used to think that they were kind of simplistic and they're easily understood. Almost anyone could understand them. But the more I understand my own life and practice and the people around me, the more I understand how profound these are. So I'm going to talk a little bit about them this evening. But what I want to do for the next, probably some three, four weeks, is to do a series, actually for the next three months. Talking about carefully about each of the Four Noble Truths. And the Four Noble Truths are actually very simple, the way they're classically stated. They're classically stated, simply, there's a truth of suffering, there's a truth of the cause of suffering, there's a truth of the cessation of suffering, and there's the Eightfold Path. And then it takes some explaining what all that means. And everybody's going to explain it a little bit differently, I suppose. And so you'll get my version. So we have three weeks on each of the first three, and then we have eight weeks on the Eightfold Path. And that should keep us occupied for a while. So I'm actually looking forward to doing this kind of a series, because I've actually never done this and actually never talked about the Eightfold Path in all these years that I've been teaching. I think it's very important to talk about. The Four Noble Truths, I take to be a very unique way of presenting a context for a spiritual life. Unique in the sense that I know of no other major religious leader, and major religion, if you call Buddhism a religion. Where the major doctrinal or teaching context for the religion doesn't refer to metaphysics or to theology. When you refer to metaphysics and theology, then it seems like you have to start accepting authority, which is not your own direct experience. And it gets a little bit tricky to understand, certainly metaphysics and theology. It's a very, very difficult quagmire of discussion that goes on in theological schools. Included in this notion of no metaphysics, there was no discussion about consciousness, in the nature of consciousness, or ultimate consciousness, or pure consciousness, or cosmic consciousness, or whatever. All these kinds of things that Buddha would put in the category of metaphysical speculation, and he wanted to offer a rationale or context or formula or whatever for a spiritual life that doesn't involve any of that, but rather stays very much grounded in our direct experience, and what we can experience for ourselves and know for ourselves. Because, I believe, the idea in Buddhism is that each practitioner is supposed to become their own authority. The Buddhist institutions, or a Buddhist, that's the wrong word, I suppose, the Buddhist, the wide organization of Buddhism, the monastics and institutions and whatever, originally didn't have anything called priests. The monastics were not priests in the Western sense, but they were intermediaries between you and God, or you and some ultimate reality. They were just there providing the model and the teaching, pointing their way in a sense, for what each individual had to do for themselves. And the fact that there's no metaphysics, and so very little for the theologians or academics that kind of build great edifices on, doesn't mean that formidable truths are simplistic, even though they're very simple to explain. I also find it significant that the Buddha, as he was dying, refused to appoint a successor to be the kind of takeover of the community that he had started. He didn't want there to be a leader of the community. He specifically said that the Dharma and the Vinaya, the Dharma and the precepts, the Dharma and ethics, should be the leader, should be your leader. And it's something we should each negotiate for ourselves. So the Four Noble Truths, the first truth focuses on suffering, the universal experience of everyone, and just says that there is such experience as suffering. Suffering does occur. And as you know, many of you know, when the Buddha set out on his original spiritual quest, it started with an encounter with a sick person, an old person and a dead person. And the dramatic meeting confrontation with these three kinds of people jarred him from his soft palace life, protected life, and inspired him to try to come to some kind of resolution, some kind of solution, some kind of peace with these kinds of universal experiences of sickness, old age and death, with suffering. And as he went about trying the different ways in which the people of his time, different religious leaders, offered solutions to religious life, he would try them and succeed in them. He would attain the highest states of consciousness that they offered at that time in India, and he would see that these weren't providing the answers that he was looking for. And he tried asceticism, and after six years he decided that was not the way either. But his quest was not a quest for great oneness, overcome duality. It wasn't a quest for communion with God or to understand, to have some kind of intellectual understanding of the nature of the universe. But rather, his quest was to understand this thing called suffering, the pain we feel in life, the difficulty, the stress, the strain. The word that he used for suffering is dukkha. And dukkha, the ka of dukkha, the root of it means a wheel, or the hub of a wheel, the axle of a wheel. And the du part means bad. And so the original meaning of the word dukkha was a wheel off kilter. So when something was off kilter, what is that about, and how do we get things to run smoothly again down the path? So the first noble truth is simply the call for us to look very honestly at suffering itself, without bias, without hesitation, without prejudice. But he's very honestly to understand suffering. And as we know, there's this tremendous movement within us to say, well, that's enough suffering for today, let me try something else. Or to turn away, or to avoid, or it's socially awkward to kind of bring up the fact that there's suffering here in this relationship, and let's go to the movies. So the call to recognize suffering directly, something which I would say is not so popular. Someone tells you, look at your suffering, forget this religion. So anyway, but this is the call to look at our suffering. The second noble truth is that there's a cause to suffering, and the cause is considered to be, is called desire. Not desire, we want to avoid that word, thirst or craving. And the third noble truth is that there's a possibility of ending suffering, the cessation of suffering. And then there's a path that helps us lead us along the way, to support us, that provides the way in which we can do these, have the cessation of suffering. So to look at suffering, the Buddha said repeatedly, it was actually in the context of people asking him metaphysical questions, asking him if he was a nillist or eternalist, or did he believe that the soul lives forever, did he believe the soul kind of dies with us at the end of our life, or you know, trying to understand the nature of the soul. The nature of the physical understandings of our life. The Buddha, in reply to that, said, I don't teach any of that stuff, basically because it's not necessary. You don't have to understand those things. What I teach is suffering and the end of suffering. I teach you to understand your suffering and how to bring about the cessation of suffering. And that's quite a remarkable thing to say for this founder of a religion which is huge, covers most of Asia, inspired people for centuries. And he says, the core of what I'm teaching is suffering and the end of suffering. And you see over and over again, all the teachings of the Buddha go back in some way or other to the central issue, suffering and the freedom from suffering. And you might wonder, what's so special about the freedom from suffering, cessation of suffering? Compared to some of the great grand religious experiences and quests that have been described in the history of humankind. Dissolving in rapture and oneness with God, or dissolving into cosmic emptiness. You can name them all the kinds of ways, all the ultimate kinds of experiences that have been offered. And what's so special about cessation of suffering? It doesn't seem to offer much. However, I think that if we look carefully at the suffering in the world, in the human world, we'll probably make a statement that's maybe not as much of a generalization as the one the Buddha made, but maybe close to it. The Buddha said, the world is established on suffering. The world is founded on suffering. And I believe that so much of what happens in our society, what happens within us and around us, much to much greater degree in which we realize is influenced or has its causal roots in human individual suffering. And maybe it's not a good example, the best example or whatever, but the example I came up with today was the suffering of someone like Adolf Hitler. And people like, I think maybe Ericsson or someone has studied his childhood and the kind of suffering that that person had. And it's probable that the things that he set in motion he created was his response to his suffering. And look at the devastation. We're still dealing with this one person's suffering and the way he chose to respond to it. And you probably look at most wars, most forms of exploitation that goes on in the world that influences how we live our life. We're right here in Palo Alto. Has this genesis in someone's suffering and someone's attempt to do something about that, probably in a maladaptive way, through greed or hate or something. Suffering is this foundation of the world. The world is founded on suffering. Now, I don't think we want to take it too seriously, such statements, but it's a very different kind of statement than the Western idea of something like, the whole world turns on love or something. Love makes the world go around. And maybe it does. Maybe both things are true. But I don't know if glass is half full or half empty kind of thing. But anyway, the Buddha, he tended to look at suffering, but not because he was a pessimist. The image I have is this person who's completely radiant and at peace with himself, at peace with the world, who in that joy that he experienced, he was teaching this thing called suffering and freedom from suffering. It wasn't supposed to be a downer of a thing. And I'm somewhat prejudiced in my seat here. But I think that I'm very fond of this particular way of offering a religious life through the Four Noble Truths. Because it's a way in which each of us can take responsibility for our own life. You know, it's called the Noble Truth, the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Way. And it's maybe an old-fashioned word, the word nobility. But the idea of someone becoming awakened in Buddhism is described as someone who has attained nobility. And someone who has nobility or dignity is someone who I believe perhaps is somewhat self-reliant in the world, someone who maybe doesn't necessarily, can't necessarily take care of themselves, not necessarily independent. But someone who is not so much personally phased, personally troubled, or challenged, or blown about by the winds of the world around them, that had to have some stability, some dignity and nobility in the midst of it. The Buddha said, once he was walking in the forest with some other people, and he picked up some leaves in his hands, and he said, What do you think is greater? The number of leaves in my hands, or the number of leaves in the forest? And they said, of course, there's many more leaves in the forest than there are in your hand. And he said, in the same way, what I teach you, and what there is to know, is like the leaves in my hand and all the trees and all the leaves in the forest. What there is to know is actually a lot more than what I'm actually teaching you. But actually, what I'm focusing on is really very near what you need to know, the core of what you need to know, in order to become free. And don't get involved with things you don't have to know. You know the famous story of the simile of the arrow, the man who was struck by an arrow. And before he wanted to get helped by the surgeon, he said, Wait a minute, before you take the arrow out, it helped me. I need to know the name of the archer, his cast, the name of his father, and where he comes from, and all these kinds of things about him. And the doctor says, Well, if I find out all those things, you'll be dead before I come back. And the Buddha likened that to someone who spends a lot of time getting lost in metaphysical speculation. By the time you ever get some kind of solution to your metaphysical issues, maybe you lost your chance. So then he offered the eightfold path. And I like this notion of a path that we follow. Larry Rosenberg, a teacher in back east, no, it wasn't Larry, it was a Stephen Bachelor, a teacher in England, talked that a path has three characteristics. A path is a way through the brambles and the forests and the thickets or whatever, that is unobstructed. You walk a path, you walk something which is unobstructed. The second characteristic is that a path usually is something which other people walk also. A path is not something you walk alone, but other people walk before you and walk after you. It's something you do in fellowship with others. That Buddhist spirituality is not a self-centered ego trip, you do it for yourself, but it's something we do together supporting each other as we go along this path. And the third characteristic of a path is that it goes somewhere. You have some confidence that it's going somewhere, and that it's not simply some kind of vague path into the darkness, but that it's going to take you to some destination, and if you know where the destination is, so much the better. So these are the characteristics of the Buddhist path. The Buddhist spiritual life is often described as entering the path of practice. And it's discovering that which is unobstructed, discovering a way to be in our life that doesn't have any interference, any obstruction for our inner life. It's to go together with a community of others to be in fellowship, people practicing in the past, people practicing all over the world today. And it's to have some confidence, I hope, that it has some meaning in our lives, that there is a possibility of following a path that leads to the alleviation of suffering. And this is considered to be in Buddhism one of the great aspirations of a spiritual life, is to alleviate to end suffering, both for ourselves and for our friends and family and society around us. And it might sound very simplistic or dull to talk about freedom from suffering, but what you find the Buddha doing over and over again is defining the highest goal of Buddhism in negative terms. It's freedom from suffering, freedom from clinging, freedom from all the different preoccupations of the mind, freedom from the filters that prevent us from really seeing reality clearly. It's freedom from, it's the negative definition. Partly, I believe, it's because he didn't want to give us some kind of metaphysical or something positive, something, you know, an object to which we can latch onto and get confused. Because it's very, the power of suggestion is so strong that if you're given something, you know, positive formulation, a positive object, we could easily trick ourselves into grabbing onto it, clinging onto it, thinking that we have it when we don't, or whatever. And, but it is something marvelous. Freedom from suffering is not something to be snared at. It's not something to be laughed at, it's being simplistic or not so great. If we're free of suffering, then what is there left to motivate us? What is an important task that are left as a human being to do if we ourselves don't suffer anymore? The idea of freedom from suffering is actually some kind of romantic idea, ideal, or is it something which is really tangible and possible in our own lives? So maybe that's enough for today. The original inspiration to talk about this is a series, was that for January, February, March, I'm going to be in seclusion in order to work on my dissertation. And I thought I would come down Mondays, you know, every couple of Mondays or so and kind of stay in touch. But then I thought, well, I got inspired by this idea of the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and I said, well, this is really great. Why don't we just do that as a series for these three months? And I said, I'll do it if I didn't have to prepare. So hopefully you don't see me with any notes the next three months. And we'll see how we do on our path. So what are your comments on what I've said or questions? Responses. Yes? Well, I liked what you said about freedom from, because part of the way I experience this path is as a process of letting go rather than adding on. So that kind of goes... Yes. In that light, people are sometimes called in meditation hall a garbage dump. And he's letting go of all this stuff. And also, I like the... I don't know if this is metaphysical or not, but the idea that the core of us is okay and good or whatever. Whole. And that all we need to do is let go of the conditioning. The one metaphysical teaching... One of the metaphysical teachings, which seems to be almost universal in all schools of Buddhism... It's kind of hard to find something that has universality. Is the one that says that the mind is pure and luminous. The mind in its original nature is pure and luminous. But even that may be going too far. It's as if we're okay in the core. Maybe we're not. Maybe we don't have a core. Are you comment on whether Buddhism is a religion? Me? For example, you alluded to the fact that creationism, the origin of the thing that I said, I'm not question that Buddhism is a purview of what needed to be known. Have you said that? What is a religion? Is Buddhism ever a religion? It was very interesting that the Buddha said... Someone like, I'm never in argument or in contention with the world. Even though the world would be in contention with me. And it's kind of an interesting statement. One of the ways I understand it is that he didn't need to be an argue-anybody. About any kind of what is true religious or spiritual or theologically or whatever. That arguing about truths from falsehood was not so important for him. And so he didn't need to be contending with anybody or disagreeing with anybody or criticizing anybody or defending himself. If a person was suffering and the person came to the Buddha, the Buddha would talk about the suffering and the possibility to be free of it. And that was all that needed to be talked about from the Buddha's point of view. Now the question of religion... I mean it's not a fair question. Because you're asking me to define the word religion. And then you're asking me whether Buddhism is a religion. Now is that fair? And... It doesn't seem to me that it's community in mind in the reality of this point. What is the very way of life? As maybe an guide to living. Yes. That's a very popular approach by many people. Many people don't like the word religion for many reasons and don't want to see Buddhism as a religion. In America it's very useful for us to see ourselves as a religion because we get non-profit status. But I was told that back in the days of the USSR, Buddhism definitively was not a religion. There. It was a way of life because being a religion in a communist country was problematic. So it's rather flexible. And it's been pointed out by scholars that the word, the category, the word religion is a western term. And it doesn't exist in Asia originally. It's very difficult. They have no words. The Japanese invented one and they have kind of words. I don't know what they did in Hindi but there's not supposed to be a traditional Buddhist word or an Asian word for this category we call religion. And so what do you do? And this thing called Buddhism, that's a western invented word. So suddenly they say, I don't like isms. Well, you know, it's a western invented word. So as soon as you have an ism, Buddhism, then you have to look for, you know, then you have inter-religious dialogue. So is it a religion or not? My definition of spirituality is a person's individual, a personal relationship with what that person would consider to be the ultimate. And religion is the expression of that spirituality in the context of our society, in a relationship to other people. So that's my definition. So if you allow that definition, then I think we can say Buddhism is a religion. But, you know, we're just playing with definitions, right? I think the Turn of Revenue Service defines humanism as a religion and human service with corporate religious cooperation. Very nice. And it's a very fair question you ask, and a lot of people ask it. Some people wonder, isn't Buddhism just a form of therapy? And, you know, the Four Noble Truths is a formulation the Buddha borrowed from the medical vocabulary or formulas of his day. It was an Indian medical way of talking about illness, the cause of the illness, the possibility of curing the illness, and the way to do that. That was the way in which doctors talked back in ancient India. And so the Buddha was, one of the titles of the Buddha, he's called the Supreme Physician. So therapy seems like it's, you know, pretty good. But then, you know, it doesn't seem to quite suit the bill either. What? The EMA would be really pissed. They could license us. Yes? Buddhism suggests what we can do to help others in their quest to reduce their suffering, other than just ourselves being the eightfold staff. Sure. Well, I think individually leading the Eightfold Path helps us because if you're not out there lying or stealing or killing, that's going to help others. And then it has teachings. I mean, I think a very central important part of Buddhist teachings is to be helpful to others and to be of service to others, be sensitive to others in what's going on around you. Compassion and wisdom are the two pillars of Buddhism. And wisdom is the understanding clearly. Compassion is sensing actually what's going on, the suffering of our fellow humans. And yes, there's teachings on how to do that. What's called the Brahma Viharas is a way of reflecting on how we act in relationship to others. Being of service is a very important theme in Buddhism. And much can be said. Yes? I've been reading a book recently that talks about the post-40 psychoanalytic discussion regarding existential angst suffered by Western men. And it seems to come to a very central... Just the men? Western society. The Western society. And it strikes me as interesting that I think the conclusion that modern post-40 psychoanalytics comes to about what this angst is about is very similar to what Buddhism posits as the existential angst in man. And I wonder if you can comment on that. Not until you tell me what it is. Well, interestingly enough, I never looked at it this way. A lot of the neuroses and suffering that we have, according to modern psychoanalytic theory, is a normal response to what the suffering that goes on in our lives. And the fact that we're the only creatures that understand that we're going to die. And that would be my comment. There, I think, are some commonalities. I think it was Jung who said something like, neurosis is anxiety about legitimate suffering. Right. So the normal people are the people that are suffering from neurosis. It's the people that are able to rationalize their way and lead a so-called, what we call normal life despite the suffering they're able to suppress or somehow avoid it. Or really not the normal one. But what struck me is that I think the conclusion that you can come to from an Eastern tradition and a Western tradition are actually quite similar when you look at them at the core. So that's what I wanted you to maybe comment on. Well, I don't really know enough about psychoanalysis to say much. I've looked at a couple of books. One of them, Mark Epstein's book, Thoughts Without a Thinker. And I thought it was a great book. And there's a couple others. Another one I saw recently. I forget the title. It's more academic than Mark Epstein's. And certainly you can find... The thing about commonalities is that... I'm not going to say that there aren't important commonalities to be found. And I think it's going to be useful to find Western understandings and have a dialogue with Buddhism. But what I've noticed is that over the decades of this century or the last hundred years, or 120 years or so, there's been fads of finding commonalities with Buddhism. And it seems like everything wants to... So sooner or later, some way, either Buddhists or the others want to find a commonality. And it's gone through every possible fad. Psychoanalytic, philosophical, scientific. Let's find... Oh yes, it's just like Buddhism. Just like Buddhism. And I wonder, when it's such a strong tendency to find commonalities, I'm slightly mistrustful of it, whether we really understand each other when we do that. My response is not directly related to what you said, but I'm just talking. It's the last one. I'm going to share an experience that I know recently of walking a labyrinth. And the similarities that I had with the connection in my mind when you spoke about the path that ran through the brambles of the practice, whatever is there, shared by others, leading somewhere. I had an interesting thing that I thought about the labyrinth, but there's only one way in and one way out. You look and enter in and you wind around a few of this route in the middle, where you kind of aren't winding, where you have some opening experience, and then wind your way out where you connect, where you come to the same point in which you entered. It seems to me, aha, well, there you are. The present moment. And in your end should be your beginning. Thank you. Yes? Why is the Third Noble Truth so short? I mean, with First, Second, and Fourth, there's a lot of discussion there, I think a lot of that. But with the Third, it's yes, no, and maybe. Well, there can be a lot of discussion there also. I mean, the First Noble Truth is simply suffering, the truth of suffering. And then there can be, you know, you fill it in. One of the things about the Four Noble Truths, I see them, is that they're kind of formulaic. It's kind of like, you know, it's like a blank, basically. And you're supposed to fill in the blank. So the first one says, the truth of suffering. And you have to fill it in. What is the suffering of your life? You know, what are the particulars of your life as you fill this in? Don't just talk about it abstractly. The second one, there's a cause for suffering. And usually it's said it's thirst. But what is thirst? Fill in the blank. You know, in all the different ways in which that means, probably you could think of 50 different words that could fill in that blank there. The third one is the cessation, the ending of suffering. What is that? What are all the different ways that we experience that? So it's for us to fill it out. Not, you know, not the Buddhists. Yes? Yeah, we're going to do announcements now. So why don't you start. I just last week donated a copy of his book to our body. I'll just leave it out in depth for people to bow and return to the group. Maybe you can write, you know, the Middle Peninsula. Great. Great. Yes? I don't know if anyone else has noticed that there's really an incredible number of aircraft around Palo Alto. And I noticed myself getting really pretty sick around all those stuff. It's all going right over my house, actually. And when I looked into it, this is really unbelievable, but true. But all of the major air gateways, all the paths from all over the world right now are converging over Palo Alto. And the amount of pollution is absolutely incredible. And I think there's sort of an each in kind of message in it that if you shine too brightly, you're going to attract the opposite. And that perhaps some FAA bureaucrat was a little jealous or something. But anyway, one way to help change it is that SFO does have a complaint number. And I guess they count them up.
