 As Lyn had mentioned in her introduction, this fall I did a six week retreat at IMS, Insight Meditation Society in Barring, Massachusetts. And it gave me an opportunity to kind of review my practice. And one of the things that came up for me was kind of a renewed interest in exploring the part of practice known as right effort. So I wanted to start by asking, does everybody know about the eight fold path? Is there anybody that hasn't heard of that? Okay. Alright, well then you know that right effort is a very important part of the process is part of the three, part of the category of the eight fold path dealing with right concentration or right meditation. And usually in the, as the teachings of the Buddha have been brought to the West, one of the first things that's taught is right mindfulness, mindfulness meditation, and along with that right concentration. But the element of right effort usually isn't necessarily a part of the process. It's a part of the process. But the element of right effort usually isn't emphasized or brought to people's awareness at the beginning because I think because being from the West were quite often so caught up in striving and wanting to accomplish something to get somewhere, that the idea of instructing the meditator to just be more simple with their meditation, to just allow what comes up to be there and to pay attention to it. And so I think that's a very important part but not to try to spend much time evaluating it or judging it or trying to make it somehow different. And I think that's important for us that we all have ideas of what we think meditation ought to be like. And so just allowing that simple unfolding of the meditation practice to occur is a useful beginning. I wasn't really instructed in right effort until a couple years into my practice when I was on a ten day or I think a fourteen day retreat with Lee Brazington to study concentration practice. And at that point he talked about it much more explicitly. So it's been, it's kind of been on my mind but I haven't really pursued it too much since then other than through developing a practice outside of sitting meditation of checking in with myself whenever it occurs to me to look at what is the state of my mind right now. So when I'm driving down the road and I get this impulse, okay well what's the state of my mind right now? Is it kind of tight or is it relaxed? Am I feeling ill will or loving kindness? Am I confused or do I feel fairly clear? Am I dissatisfied or am I content? You know that kind of level of just checking in from kind of at odd moments during the day to kind of look at what's the state of my mind and my heart right now and not doing too much more than that with it just kind of noticing what it's like and the feeling tone of it is it pleasant or is it unpleasant or is it neutral? So I think the teachings on right effort go a little bit beyond just paying attention to it to the state of mind. They're actually about bringing some attention or some intention to influence the state of one's mind particularly within meditation, within sitting meditation but I think also even in day to day practice, even when your eyes are open and you're walking around. So let's see, I'm going to read something from Tinistru Bhikkhu, he's the abbot at the Wat Mehta monastery down in San Diego who's written extensively not only translating the suttas but also interpreting them and giving teachings and he has a website called Access to Insight where a lot of this material is available and that's been a kind of a real handy reference set for me. So in the area of what he calls the four right exertions, I'll start by reading some of Tanjef's words and then I'll switch into the section of the suttas that he's quoting and then back to Tanjef's words again. So Tanjef says, the four activities included in this set, how effort can be applied to developing skillful qualities of the mind. The basic formula runs as follows, now this is from the suttas, there is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds and exerts his intent. One, for the sake of the non-arising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen. Two, for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskilled qualities that have arisen. Three, for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen. And four, for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development and culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen. Tanjef says, these four aspects of effort are also termed guarding, abandoning, developing and maintaining. All four play a necessary role in bringing the mind to awakening, although in some cases they are simply four sides of a single process. So to follow this through of course we need to know what our skillful and wholesome states of mind and what our unwholesome and unskillful states of mind. And I think probably at some level we probably know that as we sit in meditation and observe the state of our mind, the state of our heart. We probably have all some intuitive sense of if a mind stream or an emotion or an emotion or an emotion or an emotion or an emotion that is going on is there because of greed, delusion and hatred or whether it is there because of the opposites in greed, delusion and hatred. But I'll start by reading a classical list of 16, what they call 16 defilements of the mind. And what I'd like to do, just before I start going over the rest of the mind, is going through this, I'll go over them, I'll go through them fairly slowly and deliberately and you may want to just close your eyes during this and see if any of these resonate with you, if any of these seem at all familiar, whether you recognize them as occurring from time to time. The first one is covetousness and unrighteous greed. The second one is ill will. The third one is anger. The fourth one is hostility or malice. The fifth one is denigration or detraction, contempt. The sixth one is domineering or presumption. The seventh is envy. The eighth is jealousy or avarice, selfishness. The ninth is hypocrisy or deceit. The tenth is fraud. The eleventh is obstinacy or obduracy. The twelfth is presumption or rivalry, impetuosity. The thirteenth is conceit or comparing mind. The fourteenth is arrogance, audiness. The fifteenth is vanity or pride. The sixteenth is negligence or heedlessness. In social behavior, this leads to lack of consideration. You may have recognized some of those. You may kind of feel how some of those feel. I think in this list of four right efforts of guarding against the arising of unwholesome mind states which haven't yet arisen and abandoning unwholesome mind states which have arisen, or at least of the first two, I find that the second one is where I start. Most of the time I don't really see the unwholesome mind state before it's arisen, but I know once it's arisen and then I'm in it, I get that moment of kind of waking up and noticing, oh yeah, I'm angry or I'm being petty or conceit is operating and comparing myself with someone else. Sometimes just that simple paying attention, that simple mindfulness can often be enough that when I see one of these states clearly, it just diminishes, drops away. Some over time after I've experienced it over and over again, it suddenly occurs to me to put up a warning sign that when I see certain conditions coming, I know that this is a time when an unwholesome state could very likely arise. The instruction for guarding against the arising of unwholesome mind states is a restraint of the senses. So recognizing that there's something at the sense doors and being mindful of it and discriminating, but not going off and getting into it. One of the, I'll tell a story from my experience at IMS about guarding against unwholesome mind states arising. Quite often when you go on a long retreat or even a day long retreat or even just an evening, a single sitting like this, you might find that there's some other person in the room that just seems to be really irritating. It's just there's something about the way they sit or they come in, they make sounds that just can trigger some, could be just mild irritation or maybe some resentment or some anger. Particularly on long retreats where you're not talking to each other and you're not making eye contact, those impulses if left unexamined have a tendency to grow and grow to amazing proportions given the kind of the how small that what's going on, what's happening actually is. But I found on every retreat that I've gone on, there's always usually somebody that has, that violates my rules of how yogis ought to behave. And so on this retreat, there was a young man sitting in a room and he was sitting in a room and so on this retreat, there was a young man sitting in front of me who I hadn't met before and here I was going to be sitting behind him for six weeks straight, 14 hours a day for six weeks and he was almost a caricature of the worst yogi I've ever met. He would always come in late. He would never bring Kleenex. He had a runny nose for like three weeks straight and he would just snort and never think to bring a Kleenex. He'd kind of flop down on his cushion. He'd stare out the window. He'd make huge yawns, just yawning sounds that filled the whole room. And somehow I recognized that I could easily spend a lot of time with anger and animosity and judgment. And I was really fortunate because after all of this, after his, what I thought very un-Yogi-like behavior, he would always do three prostrations to the ground before he got up and left. And somehow that was a very, very, very, very shifted things for me. There was some compassion that was arisen from seeing him do that. And even though I had never talked to him and I hadn't met him, I had a feeling that there was, that all of his restlessness and everything else was coming out of some suffering. And so after about the first day, I just decided to let go of all of the judgment and the judgment and all of, to the extent that I could, of all of the judging and all of those kind of ill will towards him and just stay with the compassion as it turned out. And so by and large those difficult mind states didn't arise, even though he was a little bit in front of me virtually the whole time. And later, when we did get a chance to talk, he told me that he was in the process of coming out of drug and alcohol addiction. And so, I felt like the compassion and the meta that I had for him helped both of us in some ways. So I think it's possible to, at least I've found that at least in some situations where I know that unwholesome states often arise for me, that I can construct warning signs for myself, that this is a place that maybe I should bring more mindfulness. And the instruction that I found in the teachings was that for guarding against the arising of these unwholesome states is that mindfulness holds hindrances in check by keeping the mind at the level of what is sensed. So I found when I could just stay with what's the direct experience, just the hearing of the rustling, the seeing of the movement, and the thoughts arising in awareness, but not going beyond that, just staying at that level that it kept the unwholesome states from arising. So the second effort is that of abandoning unwholesome states that have arisen. And I think that's where I've probably spent the majority of my time. Particularly on this retreat, I had an excellent teacher. He was another yogi that I was doing the pots with after breakfast each morning. And there was something about the way, I don't know what it was, but he had an ability to press about every single button I had and even then some. And with him, I found that he would often get to the kitchen early and start to do, well, there were three of us doing this job and we had it divided into three separate sets of tasks that each person would do, and then each day we would rotate through the three positions. And yet every morning when I'd come in, he'd always get there early, he'd not only have done his stuff, but he'd start having done my job. And I just wanted to tell him, give me my space. I know how to wash pots. I don't need you to show me. And so quite often in working with him, I would find that I'd already be having some ill will towards him or some judgment of him, some pride in my own ability. And so I think with him, I was able to practice all five of these instructions on how to deal with abandoning unwholesome mind states. So the first instruction is to expel the unwholesome thought with a wholesome thought that's its opposite. So if I could take that thought of being displaced with a thought of being helped, that sometimes that would work for me. Sometimes I could see that his intention was to help and that it wasn't to try to be some kind of be the one in charge or something. That there were some times when I could just use this technique of kind of replacing a wholesome thought, an unwholesome thought with a wholesome thought. And in this category, there are specific instructions for things to do if you're in meditation. So if for the five hindrances, if desire arises, the instruction is to meditate on impermanence. So if there's something that seems very desirable that you really want, then meditating on its impermanence, that whatever that is, however delightful it would be, it's going to go away. For the hindrance of ill will or aversion, switching meditation to doing metta, doing loving kindness can often be a helpful antidote for having those thoughts and qualities of ill will. Let's see, for the first time in the last five years, there's actually four different instructions. One is to imagine a bright ball of light. I don't think I've ever tried that, but the simpler version of that is just opening your eyes a little bit. So letting in some light can often help dispel that dullness and drowsiness. Getting up and doing brisk walking meditation, if that's appropriate or just standing, is often helpful. This one I had never seen before until I started studying this was reflecting on death. I think this is kind of like reflecting on your own impermanence, that our time in this human realm is really pretty short and that there's a great value in waking up, waking up from our dullness of the moment. Then the final instruction is, if none of those three works, just bringing a certain willpower, a certain determination to continue to practice, even though it seems like it would be a lot easier to just close your eyes and not off. For the hindrance of restlessness, the instruction is to bring your awareness to just a simple object. So if you're doing mindfulness meditation and you might find that you're going from the breath to your knee to a thought to an emotion, that you're just moving from object to object, it could be helpful then to just stick with one simple object, so maybe just stay with the breath and let the other objects that are arising just stay in the background of awareness. That can often reduce the restlessness. Then the fifth hindrance is doubt, in particular skeptical doubt about the practice. This was one that actually came up for me quite a bit on this last retreat. I had gone into the retreat thinking that I was going to have a very serene six weeks. I decided I was going to get very concentrated. I was hoping to do some samadhi practice. Instead, I spent six weeks with back pain and aversion to back pain and aversion to my coworker in the kitchen. I started seeing aversion much more prevalent, was a lot more prevalent in my experience than I like to think of myself as having. One of my teachers had suggested this. It's like really investigating that doubt, these thoughts of doubt coming up that are kind of, well this might be a little contradictory, but these thoughts of doubt that are questioning you, you could turn your awareness and question them back. Well what's the point? You can say, why should I believe these thoughts of doubt? Where are they coming from? What gives them any power? Turning that light of awareness onto those thoughts of doubt and really starting to question them back, I found helpful. I didn't always remember to do it because doubt was a very subtle and kind of seductive hindrance that the thoughts would come and before I knew it I was questioning, why am I here? Why am I doing all this sitting? It just snowed. I could be out walking in the woods. I could be sleeping. I could be reading. So in those moments when you recognize that doubt is operating, bringing some investigation can often be real helpful. The second instruction for dealing with abandoning unwholesome states is bringing the two characteristics of hiri and otamat, the two characteristics of hiri and otapa. These are sometimes translated as shame and moral dread. These were translations done by the English about a hundred years ago. I've heard Gil translate these two words as conscience and fear of consequences. So when some unwholesome states arise it can be helpful if you can consider their undesirable consequences and keep considering the undesirableness or what the consequences of holding these thoughts are until a certain revulsion arises. I remember seeing this instruction I thought shame and moral dread. I don't know. That doesn't sound like western Buddhism to me. But then I had a chance to think about it and I thought, I had a chance to experience this when I was on the retreat. This coworker of mine from the kitchen, over time I developed a keenly tuned sense of my aversion to him. I don't know where this came from. Even outside of the kitchen I would find that if I was about to walk into the bathroom somehow he would just appear in front of me and start walking incredibly slowly. In this one case I was trying to get into the coat room and the door wouldn't open and when it did I found that he had been leaning against it so that he could take his shoes off and then he left his shoes right in front of the door. Very calmly he turned and he walked away and I just imagined myself very mindfully bending down, picking up his shoes, very mindfully walking to the front door of the building, very mindfully opening the door and very mindfully throwing the shoes into the snow bank on the other side of the driveway and then actually feeling some glee at doing that until in my mind those shoes hit the snow. When they hit the snow I suddenly really recoiled. I mean this was in my mind. When they hit the snow I really recoiled at kind of the meanness and pettiness that was behind that and it shifted my relationship with my thoughts and feelings towards him that I really didn't like the feeling that I would harbor that kind of meanness and pettiness to somebody because of where he put his shoes. So I think that that particular strategy for me worked in a way that was kind of mysterious. I mean it wasn't something that I had planned to do but it was quite effective. I mean when I saw where holding that mind state led me it was really a place that I didn't like. I didn't like the and it was effective at tempering that animosity that I had been sort of almost savoring. So then the next strategy for dealing with the abandoning of unwholesome states is diversion of attention. So sometimes I've found when the thought process isn't too strong that sometimes I can just move my attention to something else or just not realize that it's going on but just not feed it, not put any more wood on that fire. And then the fourth instruction is sort of the opposite of that rather than diverting one's attention is to really confront that mind state and investigate it. So again with my coworker in the kitchen towards the end of the retreat I wondered why his wanting to help me. What did it keep triggering? Why was I so resistant to letting him help me? And when I started to look at it I realized that when I go back and visit my father he often does that. He's often trying to help me in ways that I don't want to be helped. And this man was about the same age as my father and doing things very similar. And so I could see that this was kind of like a very old pattern that was actually that this poor guy on the retreat was getting the full brunt of. So I found the investigation was a very helpful thing in that particular case. And then the last instruction for abandoning unwholesome mind states sometimes they're just so strong that none of these other four strategies seem to work. That the groove is so deep and you've thrown so much fire on that wood already that just suppression, just as a last resort just using one's will to just say no. Kind of take the Nancy Reagan approach just say no to this mind state. So those are the instructions for the second noble effort. So now we get to developing unerision wholesome states. And the list of those are basically the seven factors of enlightenment. And the seven factors are usually written in a sequential order although they don't necessarily have to arise this way. The first one is mindfulness. So that's something that we're in meditation we're already doing. So as we strengthen our mindfulness in meditation then you're already bringing up a wholesome state of mind that you're paying attention. The mindfulness can be followed by investigation. So mindfulness in itself is just noting the bare experience that's happening. And then from there going to investigation. Paying a little bit more questioning or a little bit more what is asking that question? What is this? Looking into it. From there there's energy, some persistence, some greater interest in continuing with the mindfulness and the investigation. Joy or rapture. Just a physical sense of well being and joy. And then tranquility or serenity after that concentration and then followed by equanimity. So although they're given in a linear progression like this I suspect we've all had moments of being both in meditation and outside where we've had that state of serenity, state of feeling concentrated on one object and feeling like it's fairly stable. And then also equanimity. That ability to not fall into extremes of emotion. So to stay, to not get blown all the way to one end of the emotional spectrum or the other but to stay balanced in the midst of changing conditions. I have to admit that's for me those developing these unerision mind states has mostly been during long retreats. And usually accompanied not only by doing mindfulness meditation but also doing some kind of concentration and also some loving kindness meditation. And then the final noble effort is maintaining wholesome mind states that have already arisen. And there I have to rely almost exclusively on the teachings rather than my own experience. But the instruction there is to keep firmly in mind a favorable object of concentration that has arisen. And I think when I think about that one I've experienced mostly when I've done long periods of meta. I maybe spend an hour of just doing meta for myself and for my teacher, for a friend, for a neutral person, for a difficult person, for all of us as a group and then expanding outward. And during those times I have found that this sense of well being and loving kindness has arisen and has actually been able to maintain it for some period of time. Right through into leaving the meditation hall and going out for walking. And then so that was a lot of different instructions for these four right efforts. And the last part that I wanted to talk about was or actually again read from Tan Jeff was about what's the right amount of effort. These were all about specific categories of effort. But I was really kind of instructed by something I read the other day from Tan Jeff talking about how does one apply this. It says this emphasis on personal exploration is crucial to the practice of right effort for it encourages one to be sensitive to what can be discovered with one's own mindfulness and discernment. Let's see. Thus through observation one will realize that skilled effort has no room for doctrinaire approaches. The polar extremes of constant exertion to the point of exhaustion and its opposite a knee jerk fear of efforting are both misguided he or she. And so I think that's a good thing to know that the efforting are both misguided here as is the seemingly middle way of moderation in all things. The true middle way means tuning one's efforts to one's abilities and to the task at hand. In some cases this entails an all out effort. In others simple watchfulness. The ability to sense what kind and what level of effort is appropriate in any given situation is an important element in developing the basic for skill mindfulness and discernment by putting them to use. So we still have a few minutes. Do you have any questions or anything you'd like to share about your experience with dealing with states of mind. I have that judging mind that's really strong and I don't have to keep that kind of doing when trying to look at states of mind and influence them and become this people who are judging state. Well I would think that you'd want to start by really being mindful of judging. You know just notice that's what's going on and bringing some investigation to it perhaps. That's one of the instructions is who's being judged. Why should I believe these judgments. What gives them any traction. It's one of the I dealt with that quite a bit on this last retreat. Actually one of the techniques that helped me both with judging thoughts and with thoughts in general was a technique that Guy Armstrong taught me of kind of using your awareness like a spotlight. He said thoughts are kind of like thieves in your house at night. And if you turn the spotlight on them they'll scurry away. So when I kind of find that there were just these kind of background of thoughts going on I'd say okay let's turn on the light and then kind of play it was sort of like playing a game of like seeing okay what's the next thought going to be. Just really paying attention to what you know like when does the next thought arise. And it was amazing just that that idea of like turning you know kind of shining this light on your mind and on the thoughts. They really scampered. I mean eventually you know I mean a thought would come back and I'd look at that but I found that one really useful. I guess I just want to say thank you because it's such a broad topic and it is very useful and it's not something that I hear explaining in this kind of way. So thank you very much because it's valuable to try to think about visual qualities and how those techniques for dealing with such dominant problems are there a practice always on. Yeah thank you.
