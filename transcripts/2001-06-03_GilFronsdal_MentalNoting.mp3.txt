 So, good morning everyone again. Someone this week was talking to me a little bit about their practice of mindfulness. They've been practicing for a number of years. And for many years, the experience of their mind being present for one or two breaths and then just disappearing for long stretches of time. And then come back maybe some point to another breath and then disappear for long stretches of time. And the person was quite mystified by reports from other people that they seemed to kind of have a calm presence to what was going on and able to maintain some kind of calm presence a little more consistently than he was. And then after a number of years of practicing now, something had shifted for him and now he amazingly had been able to maintain a little more continuity and it wasn't so such a mystery anymore the possibility of staying present for experience as it's happening. And it is kind of a skill that we learn, a skill of being present. And the mindfulness practice often can be understood as being a matter of cultivating or training ourselves, cultivating ourselves, cultivating some skills, some strengths of the mind so that the mind can stay present rather than mind getting preoccupied. And the mind for being something which is incredibly invisible is phenomenally complex. There's a lot of different factors within it and there's a lot of things that can be developed and skills to be developed and things to be strengthened. What I want to talk about today is one of the basic tools and it is a tool which is not necessary to use, it's one of the tools or skills that are used in Vipassana practice to help maintain presence, to help us stay present with things. Not only help us stay present but also help us stay present in a way that is useful because there can be unuseful ways of being present. And that is the practice of noting. One of the basic practices is as you're present for something, to name it. So if you're listening to the loudspeakers, you just note hearing, hearing. Just acknowledging that's what's going on. Or if you're staying with the breath, you acknowledge the breath by a simple label of breathing in, breathing out or in, out. Have an itch, itch, itch. If suddenly you're feeling sad, sad, sad. So whatever you happen to notice in the present moment, you name it. And the idea is to maintain a continuity of this naming over time. And the continuity over time means like a steady stream, slow, gentle, calm stream of naming. Because as long as you're naming what's there, then you're most likely to be present. If you're not naming, you might be present but you might also be fooling yourself. Or you might not be fooling yourself at all, you're just not doing anything. You're just gone. But there has to be some presence of mind, some presence involved if you're naming your experience as it's continuing through time. There's a lot of challenges to maintaining the naming. One of the challenges is that what comes up might seem really interesting. And so it's more interesting than our continuing the stream of naming. So here we're going along naming an itch, a breath, a sound. And then a memory comes up of some wonderful vacation you had 20 years ago. And so maybe you noticed that, you said, oh, remembering. I'm remembering right now. In the present moment, I'm a human being who's having a memory thought. You name that, remembering. Oh, but that vacation. That was really, I wonder if I can do that again. Maybe I can get the same cabin. And so off the mind goes, kind of off into its fantasy. And maybe not consciously, but unconsciously the mind gets seduced by those thoughts. So it stops doing the naming. But in stopping the naming, it's also easy to get lost into the present moment. But if you maintain the naming, then the naming guarantees that you don't get caught by that memory, to some degree, guarantees it. So that you might have, you should keep seeing memory, memory in the present moment, having a memory is happening. And so the pull, the gravitational pull into that memory, into that preoccupation is checked by that part of the mind was kind of observing that phenomena. The observer we sometimes talked about, but it's observing. So you stay and stay. You're not denying that movement of the mind. But you're keeping yourself from drowning in it. So the naming is kind of like the life ring that you wear, that keeps you floating, keeps you in the observer, keeps you present for what's going on. One of the challenges for naming, for some people, is that the naming seems relatively coarse. And it seems like the naming of the labeling seems like it goes in the opposite direction of the stilling of the mind that you're trying to accomplish, to think you want to accomplish. Some people in our culture have a very negative view of words. It's just a spiritual people, at least. They have this idea that how words are an obstacle to really being present, really seeing reality as it is. That words are kind of a pale imitation of what reality is like. And that your words get in the way of your experience, your intuitive presence for experience. And that sometimes the discrimination that these words get, discriminatory prejudice that words have to receive from some of us spiritual types is quite intense. I feel quite sorry for them. And language and all that. And so sometimes you see people, oh, you know, that gets in the way. And it does sometimes, especially if you've been doing other kind of meditation practice for a while, and you're used to the mind not being so active as you would as you were naming things. It can seem like you're kind of agitating the mind making the course. But the naming, maintaining this calm, steady quality of naming, is kind of like learning to ride a bicycle where at first it is, riding a bicycle is awkward. It kind of requires a lot of effort at first. But then once you get the hang of it, it gets quieter and calmer and easier and easier. Before you know it, you can ride the bicycle without your hands and without almost anything. It's kind of second nature to ride the bicycle, and you can do a lot of other things. So in the same way, the noting becomes second nature at some point, and then it doesn't require much effort. And its value in helping us to stay present becomes really great. So the naming is a subset of the world of words and language. And the world of word and language is quite a rich world. And for many of us, it's kind of an invisible world. It's kind of like the air that we breathe. We don't see it often how much we negotiate our life through concepts and words. And in fact, mindfulness practice is designed to help us see the way in which our languaging and concepts does in fact sometimes get in the way of our experience by interpreting it and living in interpretations of stuff. But it's not meant to be a critique of even interpretations or a critique of the power of importance of words. And rather, it's a matter of learning how to use the words wisely. In Zen, sometimes they talk about things that words can kill or bring to life depending on how you use them. And so it's not a matter of kind of discarding words, but learning how the words can bring life as opposed to how they can kill. Many of you probably know this famous passage from Helen Keller. She writes, someone was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over my hand, she spelled into the other word, into the other, the word water. First slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motion of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as something forgotten. And somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that W-A-T-E-R meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened in my soul, gave it light, hope, set it free. So here's someone who didn't have language and I guess she was deaf and dumb. And was he blind too? So didn't have much going. And somehow his teacher, his amazing teacher, conveyed to her the possibility of language and she felt her soul was set free. It's really a marvelous thing to learn words and to a great degree what it is to be a human being is to have words. And words do really set us free, a tremendous amount of possibility opens to us when we have the ability to speak and to use concepts and words. But then we have the kind of critique of words that, you know, in Taoism for example, you have something like this, they say, disciples were absorbed in a discussion of Lao Tzu's wisdom, those who know do not say, those who say do not know. When the master entered, they asked him what the words meant. The master asked, which of you knows the fragrance of a rose? All of them expressed that they knew. Then he said, explain it in words. All of them were silent. The fragrance of a rose. How do you explain it? Rachel Noemi Raymond in her wonderful book, Kitchen Table Wisdom writes this. She says a label, sometimes on the mental noting that we use in Vipassana, sometimes called a label. A label is a mask life wears. Great. We put labels on all life. We put labels on life all the time. Right, wrong, success, failure, lucky, unlucky. These may be as limiting a way of seeing things as diabetic, epileptic, manic depressive, or even invalid. Labeling sets up an expectation of life that is often so compelling that we can no longer see things as they really are. This expectation often gives us a false sense of familiarity towards something that is really new and unprecedented. We are in relationship with our expectations and not with life itself. Then she goes on and talks about how labels we use for illnesses can sometimes make us a victim beyond just what the illness is, the difficulties of the illness. So labels can be quite painful as we know also because they often have values and judgments as part of it. The mental noting and labeling of Vipassana practice is meant to be value free. It's meant to be without any judgments of what it is we're experiencing, but rather simply just naming what's happening now, what's happening now, what's happening now. In part, as I said, it's ideas that help us keep us in the present moment. It's also meant to be a truth teller, kind of acknowledging what's there. Often it helps us say what's really true, and saying what's true will often set us free. I've had the experience many times of struggling with something, struggling with some feeling or some mood or some difficulty that stayed relatively unarticulated, unclear what it was until I had a very simple name for what was going on. Oh, what's happening is I'm depressed. In naming the depression, just simply naming the fact that I was depressed, somehow I've experienced a certain level of release and letting go of the things I was holding onto because I can name and see it for what it was. Somehow the naming set it free. So it's like the stories, fairy tale stories of when you name the dragon, the dragon loses its power. Or the story of the Buddhist discourses where Mara, who's the Buddhist kind of devil, comes periodically and visits the Buddha after he was enlightened. And it's very interesting that he should visit the Buddha after he's enlightened because at the night of the Buddha's enlightenment there was a great struggle between Mara and the Buddha. And Mara is understood to be the personification of all the internal forces of doubt and temptation and despair and fear. And the Buddha conquered Mara at the night of enlightenment, was freed of all these things it said. So you think if that's a personification, if Mara's a personification is inner forces, what are these inner forces doing visiting the Buddha after he was fully awakened? Maybe the Buddha's not so different from us. The difference is maybe how, what the Buddha did about it when Mara appeared. And each of the occurrences where Mara appears after he was enlightened, the Buddha simply says Mara, I see you. Which is kind of a little bit like labeling, naming what's there. I see you. This is what's going on. And each time the Buddha does that, Mara runs away, goes away. So the Buddha is not inviting Mara in for tea and is not trying to chase Mara away, but as a matter of fact, these names, this is what's going on. I see you. So they're kind of a truth telling that's very helpful with the mental noting. One of the things that the mental noting is very helpful also for is if you pay attention to the way in which you label in your mind the inner voice, which is doing the naming, it can often give you an indication of what your relationship is to your experience. So it's not simply a matter of, mindful is not simply a matter of notice, noticing what's happening in the present moment, but also noticing what your relationship is to what's happening in the present. And so that, so if you're naming and you don't like what's going on, like you have a knee pain and you say, you name it, you know, you see, you learn to name it pain, pain, but the label really is pain, pain, you know, and there's a certain level of contraction and aversion going on that if you pay attention to the quality of the voice that's doing a naming, sometimes indicate that. Or if you have this lot of pleasure in your meditation, you're sitting there with great bliss. And so you name it bliss. That kind of extended way of naming might indicate a certain kind of attachment or a certain kind of indulging in the experience rather than just seeing it mindfully and clearly for what it is. The task of mindfulness is to neither indulge nor resist what's going on, but to very matter of factly see what we like and what we don't like, what we prefer and don't prefer with the same equanimity, same background. We prefer and don't prefer with the same equanimity, same balance. So you're coming along and meditating mindfully, mindfully and something unpleasant arises. It doesn't cause any ripples because, oh, unpleasant, unpleasant, and something pleasant happens. Oh, pleasant, pleasant, you know, kind of a matter of fact kind of thing over and over again. The idea of the mental noting is to do it very softly. And I like to say that to encourage people, if they have some sense that there are different levels in their brains and their minds to their thoughts, their thinking, like there's coarse thinking and medium thinking and refined thinking. You know, for example, if you've just had a tremendous fight with your boss or your spouse or partner or something, and then you're kind of walking away and your mind is just kind of furious and really loud inside, that's one level of thinking. And if you've had this wonderful hike up Windy Hill and had this wonderful nice little snack and had a little snooze and you'll nap underneath the oak trees and you wake up to perfect temperature and you look out across the bay and, you know, the mind is just really calm and peaceful and just very subtle kind of thinking is going on. So you maybe have some sense of different intensities of thinking. And the idea is to choose the, to label the experience from the softest level of thinking that's available to you. And so it's kind of a whisper. So it's not like you're not to kind of like a sludge, not a sludge hammer approach, you know, just yelling at the experience, but it's kind of whispering at it. And part of the function of the naming is to just simply nudge the mind into the felt sense of the experience, nudge your mind into the present moment experience to stay present for what's going on. So if you're trying to stay with your breath, you're trying to gently nudge, encourage the mind to stay with the breath by labeling it in, out, or rising, falling. You say, oh, stay there, you know, like patting, gently patting, you know, stay there, you know, be there, stay there. And then sometimes it's said in our tradition that the naming, 95% of it, 5% of what we do is name the experience and 95% of what we do is sense it and feel it and experience it. And the naming is kind of like placing a frame, a reference around the experience. Okay, this is what I'm going to pay attention to. So it could do it quite softly. It's kind of a nudge into the present moment. As a kind of a nudge into the present moment, it's not necessarily important to be accurate with your word. There is place times when it's very valuable to be very accurate with the word to name it for what it is because of the power of truth, of saying things as they are. But sometimes when you're coursing along in very strong, deep meditation, you might just let go entirely of being accurate and just kind of, you know, if you're not clear what the label should be. You don't want to spend a lot of time or any time thinking about it. What exactly is it? Say if you're angry. Am I angry? Am I resentful? Am I wrathful? Am I rage? Am I annoyed? Am I impatient? Am I irritated? What exactly is it here? If you spend a lot of time with that kind of analysis trying to find the right word, you might actually be missing the experience. So maybe it doesn't matter so much. And sometimes you can just name it, you're not sure what to label it. You can just name it experience. And that is to call it an experience because the trick is to help you stay present, not to get lost in the analysis. And sometimes in the deeper states of meditation, I've just labeled my experience yes. Everything is yes. It's a generic label for everything. And that's somehow just a little yes, a little nudge. And sometimes actually I've just used the word uh-huh, uh-huh. A little kind of grunt or something. And I found that it actually helps me stay present. It keeps me on track more easily than if I don't do the naming, my mind wanders away. There are some people for whom the naming doesn't seem to ever work for them. It's not like their practice. It just somehow doesn't match between them and their mind. It's not necessary to do the noting. But what we've found over the years is that in a general sense, and it's just a kind of statistical sense rather than right for any individual person, the people who do the noting tend to go further or deeper in the practice of vipassana quicker than the people who don't. It helps keep people on track. Some people will note all the time. They'll note right down to the very deep estates of meditation that's available to vipassana. They'll still be doing a very subtle kind of noting. It might be just a little grunt or something, but the kind of noting can go on quite a long time. Some people will find that it works best to only note in relatively coarse levels of the mind. But as the mind gets more refined and quieter, there's less need for that nudging. And the naming kind of seems for them, some people get in the way and so they drop it. Some people never use the noting. They seem to manage just fine without it. Some people will use the notes judiciously. We'll use it selectively for particular things that they pay attention to. So for example, I've known people who will only name thinking. They won't note their breath or their feelings in the body or sensations or whatever, but just if the mind wanders off in distraction and thoughts, they'll name it thinking, thinking, remembering, planning, or something. It seems to be very useful to name that particular animal of experience with a note because it's countering a thinking with a thought and brings it all back into balance. Some people I know only label their emotions because emotions are the trickiest for them where they tend to get most swept up and get caught by things. So wherever they tend to be most caught, the naming maybe is the most useful. They don't use it everywhere, but just there. I knew one person whose primary way of noting was he noted only pleasant and unpleasant. So whatever the experience was, he would note, this is pleasant, this is unpleasant, this is pleasant, this is unpleasant. That kept him on track and also kept him from getting reactively involved with the experience. We saw it for what it is. What we're trying to do in the naming or mindfulness in general is to identify what's happening in the present moment without identifying with it. To identify what the experience is, but don't identify with it without letting experience be a definition of who we are, without holding onto it in some way saying, uh-oh, this is me. So naming can be very helpful for that because identification is very subtle, almost invisible, sources of it in us. We have a knee pain and his mind knee pain, of course, right? Who else would it be? They said the way in which the mind appropriates something as this belongs to me is a very subtle functioning of the mind, but it's also optional. It doesn't have to be operating. And it does also kind of entail a certain level of attachment and suffering to have that very subtle, seemingly innocent at time identification with things. And it's possible to develop that function of the mind that observes without identifying, this is mine. And when you get a sense of how to do that and stabilize in doing that, there's a sense of great freedom that comes because then a lot of experience can occur, but it occurs quite freely without taking it personally, knee pain, feelings or whatever. And I have some examples, clinical examples. I thought it was quite nice. There's a now somewhat classic study, I think it was done in 1982 by maybe a therapist writing about studying grief. And I'm not sure how to pronounce his name, but sometimes people's names lead them in certain directions of work. Because one way of pronouncing this guy's name is death rage. So he does the work on grief therapy. It might be death the rage, I'm not sure. So he, this guy was using, had studied Vipassana practice and had taken some of its principles and applied it in clinical settings. In one case, a divorced woman would have bouts of depression and anxiety when she remembered her ex-husband's bizarre sexual demands. She was trained to label her thoughts as remembering, remembering. And within a few days, she could see the causal relationship between the thoughts and the anxiety and depression. That's pretty good, a couple of days. Another woman who was hospitalized for manic depression and schizophrenia was instructed to watch the second hand of a clock. And when her mind went off the clock to name the distraction, soon she realized that most of her distractions were related to the past. She was then instructed to label them as remembering, remembering. With this technique, she learned to identify herself with the objective watcher of her disturbing thoughts instead of the depressed thinker. And so that's a lot, you know, we stay with a breath and then the mind gets, wonders off, and we name where it's wonders off. Oh, I was planning or remembering or whatever thoughts. And to start identify by naming it, sometimes we can see the pattern. If we just simply come back, without clearly recognizing, identifying what, where the mind has been, we might not see there's a really regular pattern of what takes us away and what distracts us. But if we see it as a pattern, we begin to free ourselves from the very pattern, the tendency. And then soon she began to gain insight into the nature of her illness and was released from hospital. Another woman who was hospitalized for anxiety, depression and inability to function adequately rebelled against any suggestion of introspection as she was a Mormon. And as she was a Mormon, the word Buddhist or meditation was not mentioned. As a therapist interacted with her, it became evident that much of her day was spent fantasizing and imagining to avoid the anxiety of her life. The habit of fantasizing was discussed with her and then she was asked to undertake a psychological procedure. To her surprise, she was asked to bake a cake. However, she had to do it extremely mindfully with minute attention to detail. When the persistent fantasies would arise, she was instructed to just observe them. After a while, she found that she could intentionally return to the present moment and so function more adequately. She also began to gain insight into the nature of her anxiety and depression. So naming can be very, very powerful, very, very effective. And I've also known people who have very powerfully disturbed patterns in their mind who found that the mental labeling has really been a lifesaver for them. It provides a great good balance from them getting lost or taken over by their reactive thoughts. The naming is not supposed to be a judgment, not supposed to be a value judgment. And that's part of the value of the naming is to start abiding, living in that part of the mind which doesn't judge the experience. If you do judge experience, then you're supposed to name that judging, but without any judgment. You say, oh, that's what's happening now, judging, judging. And slowly, first, maybe the door, the crack is very small, but you make a little crack of freedom in the midst of the very constant reactive mode, which we often find ourselves in, judging and evaluating, interpreting experience. And we just see it for what it is, see it for what it is. Because the naming is supposed to be very simple, very rudimentary kind of word, just maybe a single word naming the experience, it often then becomes a counter also to the more abstract conceptualization, abstract labeling that we make of our experience. And we can, and part of the function of mindfulness and the labeling is to highlight that into the, oh, this is an interpretation. And then start, we start seeing, oh, interpretation, not necessarily what's there. We start finding some freedom from being caught by the interpretations or convinced of its truth, but rather say, oh, this is possible, but I'll try to see things freshly as they actually are. So it's an art form denoting rather than, you know, I think it was a common art form. I think mindfulness is an art form. So in saying that, maybe they can be kind of a playful feeling and also experimental feeling approach to it. And also a sense that, that it's something very personal, you find your own way to how to do it. And one of the paint brushes we use, so one of the tools for the mediums for the art of mindfulness is this thing of using the mental notes. If you've never used them, I'd encourage you to give it a try, try it for a while and see if you can kind of get the hang of it and find its usefulness and see how it helps you kind of become more observant rather than in the experience. And if you've stopped doing it, because you've gotten kind of lazy or complacent or something, then I encourage you to try it again, you know, get back into it. And if you have any kind of experiences as you go along and difficulties or whatever, and you want some help with it, come and talk to a teacher, come and talk to me. Because it's very interesting for me to work with people with their capacity to name things and explore what comes up as they're kind of naming their experience as part of vipassana practice. So that was my thoughts for today. So now, your turn. Comments or questions? Also, you know, if you have your own experience with noting that you want to kind of talk about a little bit, it'd be nice to hear about it. Yes, please. Well, that's nice. Yeah. So what you're saying is that if something powerful is happening with you, and if you haven't really acknowledged its presence clearly enough, but you kind of rush ahead and kind of have some sense that it's happening, but you kind of name it from a distance that just keeps you a distance from it. And you haven't really kind of, yeah. Right. So yeah, so that I think is a very good point is that sometimes the noting can also be a technique of avoiding experience. We kind of take up too much in the noting. We kind of run away into the noting and name, name, name, and try to use it to keep a distance from our experience. So rather than learning how not to identify with experience, which is a very important part of mindfulness, we're learning to be disassociated from it. So there is a danger with doing the noting. So that's very good. The noting is not, you know, the noting is actually not so foreign for what we already goes on in the mind. Even if you don't note at all, there is a very subtle verbalizing going on of what our experience is. And I think you almost referred to that when you said, I have to kind of note it before I can label it. I have to really note and acknowledge it. The kind of fully being present and acknowledging there will be a very subtle kind of verbalizing going on that really helps you be there. What the noting is doing is partly kind of piggybacking on the very subtle verbalizing that goes on that helps us identify with the experiences. Yeah. I remember doing that on my presentations and I was surprised at how much of my time you don't want to react to it. One day when I decided to see how often I judge, I found myself in the judge and much more than I would have ever found that I did. And also to take the edge off of the experience. So that myself as a judge, sort of like, I'm supposed to be repeating the questions. They tried for over the years to train me to repeat questions and Lewis is making a valiant attempt to. So I'm trying here. What you said, I think because it's for the value of those people who are not here. So, but I agree. What you said was that it can be a surprise to note regularly what's going on because we notice patterns. We don't necessarily, they're invisible. The patterns are invisible otherwise. So like, for example, as you said, judgment. That by noticing, you didn't know you judged as much, but by noticing you judged how much you judge, it took some of the edge off the judging. I know that when you think, in any given moment, we might think that what we're thinking is quite compelling and believable. This is really true. This is how things are. But if you're really aware that this is the 900th time that day that you've had a judging thought, you say, well, 900 times, and it's only nine o'clock in the morning. Maybe it can be a little bit of a hypothesis or a little bit lighter about the judging. Yes. I've noticed that there's a certain level that, my mind becomes very chaotic. It's not a normal, or for what I consider normal, just kind of mind wandering, coming back, mind wandering, coming back. And that level of inclusiveness and employing it's like, ooh. And it's very hard then to label it. And I find myself leaving the meditation and going on. And I'm wondering if other people have that experience and how that may be chaos-like. Yeah. I think so. There are times, as you said, there are times when the mind is quite chaotic and quite impulsive and jumping around all over or very difficult to be with. And pretty much everyone has that experience. I certainly do at times. And what I've found is that if I have some narrow idea of what mindfulness is, like I'm trying to stay with one thing, like I'm supposed to stay with a breath or I'm supposed to find out what I'm feeling and label my feelings or something, that sometimes I'm missing the forest for the trees. And sometimes it's very important to back off from trying to be very precise or particular with the mindfulness practice and name the whole shebang, the whole show, the whole catastrophe. So the label chaos looks great. And then it can be a lot easier to stay present. But if you're trying to avoid the chaos, but trying to get inside and see where the trees are, it's just hopeless. And of course you're going to give up. But if you, just chaos and become more localized, pretend that you're getting a PhD in chaos. And so great. Yeah. And then it becomes much more interesting. Okay, what does chaos like? What does that feel like? And how does it feel? When my mind is as chaotic, what does it feel like in my body? What does my brain actually feel like physically? What happens? What does it feel like? And kind of you start with the widest possible framework for your experience. And then as you begin exploring it, you might kind of get closer and closer and smaller, smaller, more precise, but you don't want to be precise quickly. You want to kind of, for something like chaos, you want to just be broad. Confusion is another one. Just confusion. Yeah. I know when I come back to naming, I call those patterns out. I mean, I'll call those patterns out. They start getting closer to the experience by naming it. It dawns on me that it's not what I think whatever is, whatever I'm holding in my mind underneath it, it's a limited framework. Beautiful. That's really tricky to get to. Beautiful. Thank you. Last one, please. I think to sit here and be minding your breath and then to note, feel your anxiety, note an anxiety is great. And then to be aware that it might have been there because of the caffeine you had this morning, then note caffeine. It might be innocent enough where you can note caffeine anxiety or something. It might be true enough, but it is removed from the experience. There's interpretation from the experience. And rather than notice, noting caffeine, caffeine, what you want to do is note, oh, making a connection, making an association, associating, associating. So that's what's happening in mind associating this experience in the present moment. The mind is associating this experience with what happened this morning. So you want to kind of be able to use the noting to help you actually stay with what's happening in the present moment. And if you started drifting off into association, then you name the associating part of the – And with this, part of the – somehow the – my nudge to give this talk today who came from this – this is from this week's local almanac, Country Almanac. Some of you live around here might get this. I don't know how closely you study this important – but this was on the the want dads, you know, and it's, you know, the items for sale. This is what it says. Used tombstone. Perfect for someone named Homer Hendelberg and Hengzel. One only. A thousand dollars. And there's a phone number. Some labels. You have to be very careful what you choose because they stay around for a long time. So thank you all very much.
