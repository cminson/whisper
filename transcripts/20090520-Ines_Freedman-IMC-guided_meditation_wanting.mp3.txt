Sit in a comfortable and alert posture. 
And gently close your eyes. 
Take a few deep breaths. 
And with each exhale, settle into your body. 
Relaxing any obvious tension or holding. 
Allow the breath to return to normal. 
And get a sense, a general sense of how you feel right now. 
It can be helpful to gradually scan the body and relax what you can. 
Relax what you can let go of. 
If it's not possible to relax something that is tense, that's okay. 
Just try to soften around it. 
Relax your belly, let it be soft. 
See if you can get a global awareness of your whole body. 
Let your tension wander around your body, feeling it, sensing it. 
Relaxing what you can. 
Now bring your tension to your breathing and wherever the breath is easiest to notice. 
Allow that area to be your home, your anchor, the center of your tension. 
Now stay focused on the sensations of breathing. 
Keep your tension connected with the physical sensations of every breath. 
Let go of any of the surface concerns of the mind. 
Whenever the mind wanders away, gently come back to the breath. 
There is no need to judge the wandering mind. 
When you notice it's wandered, simply return to the breath. 
Allowing your mind to rest in the breath.

Now notice any time that the mind wants to move away from the breath. 
What is it moving towards? Stay alert for any movement of the mind towards an object, it's an idea, a desire, a fantasy. 
How does that movement feel? Notice any time the mind wants something and name it, recognize it. 
Wanting, wanting to be comfortable, wanting to be peaceful, wanting to eat, wanting to think. 
Notice if the mind is wanting something, just accept it. 
Give it permission to be there, give it room, give it care. 
And if it's a strong desire, turn your attention from what it is that you want to what it feels like to want it. 
If you want comfort, turn your attention away from the feeling of the leg that you want to move, or the low back that feels a little uncomfortable to how the mind feels wanting to move, wanting it to be different. 
How does it feel to want? Is it pressure or tightness? How does wanting feel in the body, in the heart, in the mind? How does it feel to want? How does wanting feel in the body, in the heart, in the heart, in the heart, in the heart? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? How does it feel to want? If you find you're not at peace, what is it that you want to be different than it is right now? What are you wanting to be different than it is? Thank you for watching!
