 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning and welcome. We'll start as usual with the meditation. And maybe I'll offer just a light guided meditation. Taking a moment to just settle into the sitting posture. I've noticed over the years of observing long time meditators and meditation teachers, it seems like the very experienced practitioners often really take their time to just settle in, tune in to this body, to feel from the inside what is it to be centered and balanced. In our meditation practice, all of the qualities that we're cultivating, calmness, awareness, confidence, all of these qualities can be expressed in how we sit. Just taking some care. It can be helpful at the beginning of a meditation to take a few deep breaths. And perhaps with each out breath, just enjoying the feeling of letting go. We may take a moment to just scan through the body. Noticing perhaps any places of holding or tension or contraction. Sometimes the muscles behind the eyes, the jaw. Noticing the neck and the shoulders. Just inviting whatever ease may be available. May this body be at ease. May this body be at ease. Noticing the belly. What is it to breathe with a soft belly. Just a soft feeling. An opening. What is it for this body and mind to be so soft that they can accept this moment exactly as it is. Sounds coming and going. Sensations in the body. Arising and fading. Thoughts and images in the mind. Just passing through. Perhaps some feeling. Emotion. All aspects of this moment. Emotion. This great invitation to sit right here. In the center of our life. Emotion. No need to make anything special happen. To achieve something. And somehow improve this moment. To be so present. We can appreciate a completeness of what's already here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. At some point we may become aware that breathing is happening. How do I know this body is breathing right now? You may notice the rise and fall of the belly. The movement of the chest. Perhaps the flow of air right at the nostrils. Let's see if we can be present for one complete in breath. One complete out breath. Just one breath. One complete out breath. There's no need to change the breath in any way. It's not easy to receive this breath. It happens to be right now. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath. One complete out breath.
