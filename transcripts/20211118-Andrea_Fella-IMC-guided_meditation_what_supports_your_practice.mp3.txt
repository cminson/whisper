 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Connecting to your present experience, however you are in this moment, as we start from there, not trying to put ourselves into a particular state, but just opening to what's already here. How is the body checking in? Is there tension or ease in the body? How is the mind calm or agitated? At ease or processing something, reactive to something, thinking about something. Just taking stock of how you are. Receiving, being aware and receiving how you are. Sometimes this very simple exploration of how is the body and mind right now, just that orientation to be willing to receive what's here and be curious about it, allow it to be here. Sometimes that very simple process, that simple connection, can create some space around experience or create a sense of ease or a sense of, it's okay to be with this. Sometimes just turning towards our experience and giving our mind and body some attention. Our mind and body will soften into what's here. Sometimes just the attention is kind of what the system is asking for. And then there can sometimes be a trust that that kind of attention is supportive. I often like to start my sittings in this way just to connect first and kind of see how is this body and mind right now. And if there is that capacity to just be with, allow, receive, and there's a sense of some bigger space in which that receiving is possible, a sense of capacity to just sit with it without it feeling like it's a problem. And that's enough. That is the practice. And mindfulness with this curious allowing attention is supporting a movement to understanding, our hearts and minds. And yet sometimes as we connect with experience, it can feel like, oh, there's still, it's hard to just connect with what's here. And so it can help sometimes to do some relaxation, consciously relaxing, allowing the body, allowing the mind to relax, finding places where attention is held and seeing if it can soften. This is a different way to connect with our experience. It's like having taken that inventory we might know, wow, it's really tense. This part of the body is really tense. And maybe there can be a sense of, well, can that area soften? Maybe a breathing with or breathing through that area. Sometimes it can be supportive to bring in some reflections that might support holding that difficulty. It's okay, this is happening right now. It doesn't have to go away. It's impermanent. Sometimes those thoughts can help us hold something that's challenging. And sometimes it can be more helpful. And again, it depends on how strong that challenge is. Sometimes it can be more helpful to having explored being with it, trying to connect if the mind just gets pulled into it and is so wrapped up in it. And it can be useful to turn the attention to something else. See if there's some place in the body where it feels simple to connect with sensation. Maybe the hands connecting, touching each other, feet on the ground. And letting the attention let go of that challenging area for a while. Sometimes it can help to, for myself, I would sometimes say, I'll be back. I'll come back to you. I'll connect at some point, but right now it feels helpful to turn the attention, be with something else. We all have to explore for ourselves what's helpful in our practice. Conditions change. Sometimes we can simply rest and receive. And other times we may need to turn the attention to something to help the mind settle, help the mind to let go of something challenging. And it's not, neither one of these is better than the other. They both support us at different times in our practice. Let's go exploring for yourself what's helpful. What's helpful right now. What's helpful and allows the mind to connect with what's happening in the present moment with some aspect of what's happening in the present moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
