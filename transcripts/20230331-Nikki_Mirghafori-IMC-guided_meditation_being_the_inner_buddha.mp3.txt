 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Greetings, friends. Greetings from Mountain View, California, unceded all ony land, where I am in this moment in time. Lovely to be with you. Lovely to feel your presence. And happy Friday, if it is Friday in your time zone still. Happy this moment in time. So we've been exploring. We've been exploring the theme of Dharma of improv, the improv of Dharma for the past week. And today, and as I was planning on the theme for today, there are a few more themes, Dharmic improv themes. So I had a hard time, I have to admit, choosing one to conclude our week. So here we go. This is the winner. So you know, there are, of course, there's always more. It's always good to know there is more to grow and learn. So this theme is the theme of we are a character in our story. We're a protagonist in this story. Given all the causes and conditions we have become this protagonist, this character in the story in this particular way, these thoughts, emotions, etc. And it's not as fixed as we take it to be. It's really not as fixed as we take it to be. It changes all the time. Have you noticed? Impermanence? I've heard that somewhere, Anicha. So this is not taking ourselves to be a fixed entity. And also it relates to this another mark of existence, not just impermanence, but also anatta in personality, that there is so much flexibility. You wake up feeling one way, having particular thoughts, body feeling in a particular way. Two hours later, different thoughts with relationship to someone else, as if it's a different person relationally. So we all co-create. We are being co-created by the environment, and we keep co-creating ourselves in the environment. So not to take ourselves at this fixed person in a playful way, in a playful way, not in a judgmental way, but in a very playful way, acknowledging that, yeah, this person who's me, there's a lot of range, there's a lot of flexibility, not feeling stuck, as we sometimes do when our vision gets tight in our lives. This is the only way. I'm in pain. This is difficult. There's so many possibilities, even in the midst of pain and challenges, always so many possibilities. So with that in mind, I will invite us with some invitations during our meditation, and then more on this when we practice, when I offer reflection. So with that, let's arrive in this body in the way we know it in this moment in time, arriving with the body, greeting the body, greeting the moment. And if you might remember from yesterday, let us feel in body, let us feel, sense our feet on the earth, our legs, our sit bones connected to the cushion, the chair, our abdomen and our chest, our neck and shoulders, our face and head. Feel this body sitting, relaxing, letting go of tightness, releasing, feeling itself from the inside. And talk about it. you you you you you you you you you you you you receiving the breath, the spread breath. In this moment in time, it keeps changing, shifting, in breath, out breath. Greeting it with light, with lightness, but the lightness of changing nature of this moment. Impermanence has a sense of lightness to it. Can be delightful. This fleeting nature of phenomena. This breath. And now we're going to try some dharmic experiments, if you wish. As you feel your limbs yourself, however you're showing up in this moment in time, meditating. Imagine, always imagine, that you have an invitation from a meditation teacher. Living or in the past, to enter, enter their mind, enter their heart, their body, and rest, meditate like them. So perhaps accepting this invitation, let your body take the shape of sitting like their body. A sense of integrity, a brightness. How about your heart? Let it feel into the mind, resolve intention, as well as the gentleness, the openness, of the mind. Let their mind, perhaps you imagine it being undistracted, steady, calm, peaceful, Is it Wyn if you could bulldoored into the mind, or the rightly imparted It's like a transmission, inner transmission. You are practicing as them. In this moment, try it out for size. You are practicing as you are practicing. Have fun with it. Have fun with this inspired invitation in any way that it might support you. Not too much thinking. But being, simply being. Letting go. Letting go of this available to you later, keeping any lessons that might have come up, any insights. Now we'll shift it around. Now imagine the Buddha. You might have chosen the Buddha in the past invitation, but now inviting the Buddha, your inner Buddha. Both the Buddha as a historic figure. Who knocks on your door and says, let me help you, let me support you. You feel your inner Buddha. Feel the Buddha infused in your heart, in your mind, in your body. Practicing as you, with the heart of compassion, wisdom. Such unfathomable, beautiful qualities. You don't have to think about them. Your inner Buddha is shining. You're feeling infusing your body and mind. And you're practicing now. You're practicing as this inner Buddha. No thinking, just let it be. The Buddha guide the way. You don't have to think and figure this out, or doubt it. Trust. There is an inner Buddha in you. You're practicing in your inner wisdom and compassion. Trust. Let them lead the way. Let them practice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. At any moment you can begin again. You can begin again. It's the inner Buddha meditating, becoming the inner Buddha in this moment. Reconnect with it. Begin again. No need for self judgment. The connection gets lost, not a problem. Connect again. Practicing as your inner Buddha becoming the inner Buddha in this moment. What would the inner Buddha do? How would they feel? How are they? Be them. Be them. What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? What would the inner Buddha do? As we turn to close this sit together, for the last minutes, feeling into the qualities of the Buddha in your heart, body and mind, peace, happiness, resentment, joy, wisdom, love, service. Let them shine. Let your inner Buddha shine within you, infusing you with a taste of whatever is needed. Trusting that goodness is always available, could be faint, could be called upon. Your inner Buddha, inner source of wisdom, love, peace, is always here, sometimes subtle, always here. Waiting to be uncovered, listened to, connected to. Trusting that we're planting seeds of reconnecting, uncovering, becoming our inner Buddha more and more, and offering our goodness, offering our co-created collective. Goodness, inner Buddhas, to all beings everywhere. May all beings be well. May all beings know their own inner goodness. Wake up, may all beings wake up to their inner Buddha, to their Buddha nature, including ourselves. May all beings be free. Thank you. Thanks for your practice, friends. So, as we take a moment to transition the recordings, if you like to put a word or two in the chat, about what's arising for you in this moment, bring it into the field you are welcome to.
