So, now for a few more remarks about balance, meeting what comes with balance, and I hope
you're feeling it useful, finding it useful, feeling and finding it useful.
And look at the effect of balancing energy in your practice and in any daily activities
that you had to take care of today.
And I thought this afternoon, this afternoon in California anyway, I know it's quite a
lot later for some of you, I thought I would introduce a couple of their teachings that
point to the importance of developing balance in practice.
I hope I don't overwhelm you with different lists, but I just, I really want to emphasize
the balance aspect of all these lists.
You don't need to remember all the details unless you already know all the details about
them.
The first, the first I want to talk about is the five spiritual faculties, the Indria,
Indra, Indra, Indrika.
And some of you I'm sure, probably many of you are really familiar with this list, faith
or confidence is the first, energy or effort, that's veria, mindfulness, right in the middle,
concentration or samadhi and wisdom.
So, they point to five qualities of mind that are really essential in our practice and that are important to keep in balance.
Faith without wisdom, often they balance on the ends.
The first and fifth balance and the second and fourth balance and then the one in the middle is like the fulcrum.
It's mindfulness.
Faith without wisdom can lead to dilution or gullibility and wisdom without faith, it can be dry, kind of uncaring or just skeptical, really skeptical.
And energy without samadhi, energy without samadhi, it leads to restlessness, you know, in the mind.
And samadhi without the balance and energy can lead to what we call sinking mind.
Sometimes I was making this sort of sinking gesture with my hands to sleepiness, to dullness, to vagueness.
And then, as I said, right in the middle of this list is mindfulness.
And it's the fulcrum and it's the one mental state that we often say you cannot have too much of it.
It's not possible to have too much mindfulness.
I've never experimented with that myself to see if it's true in my mind, but I trust that that's the case.
It's inherently balancing mindfulness is it mindfulness is a balanced state of mind.
One that sees clearly without falling into unwholesome desires or aversions that keeps us in that middle way, not falling to one side or the other.
And the more mindfulness there is in our minds, the more clearly we're able to see what we might need to cultivate in order to come back into balance.
So it's just, you know, it's, it needs to be there.
It's really necessary.
What did the Buddha say to Sona in that Sutta I read from the earlier in the morning.
We find a balance of the faculties and learn the pattern of the situation.
And then we tune our effort so that it matches what's needed so that we're more able to meet what comes whatever that happens to be.
So the five faculties with mindfulness in the middle.
And then another teaching list where balance is is important is in the seven factors of awakening.
The bojanga seven mental states that when really strongly present and well balanced in the mind can provide the conditions that make the mind ripe for deep insight and awakening.
And three of the seven are called a livening energizing uplifting factors.
The energizing factors are energize and our energy or or effort very of the same as in the five faculties. Investigation Dhamma Vichaya which is really being attentive paying attention wise attention to what's actually true what's going on in actuality.
And rapture or our joy PT is the polyp ITI.
And so these three are the energizing factors and then on the other side of the of the full cream you might say are three calming factors.
Tranquility. Asadi is the is the poly tranquility or serenity sometimes it's translated concentration Samadhi which is also in the five faculties list.
And equanimity, which is kind of the crown jewel of mental states.
And our meditation practices going really well, and the mind is really absorbed teachers will often suggest looking to see whether these energizing and calming factors are present, whether they're balanced, and whether there's strong mindfulness to, which keeps them balanced
and allows them to, to, to be seen in their in their clarity.
So mindfulness is the seventh of the seven factors of awakening is listed at the very beginning because it's necessary, but it also acts as that kind of balancing point it's like it's what allows us to see what needs to change.
If it needs to change, perhaps, nothing does.
So as with the spiritual faculties if there's a lot more of the energetic than the tranquilizing factors restlessness can result.
And of course the opposite is true also with tranquility is really strong, we can lose focus we don't see as clearly we might enter a kind of a dreamy state that's really pleasant but not so useful in terms of being able to see clearly.
So first of the seven factors, it can be seen either in its aspect of balancing as I just kind of described very briefly, or as a progression, going from mindfulness through energy to don't be tired investigation through PT rapture or joy through serenity and
and then to equanimity. So equanimity is the is like the culmination of of this, this list, if you go through it as a progression.
And this last state equanimity that it is probably the most sublime form of balance that we know of in Buddhism and it's a beautiful balance of mind that is so peaceful that when it's really fully developed it's it's it's described as being very close to awakening to the relation.
So, talking about equanimity is really talking about balance directly pointing right to it. And there are two words for equanimity in the in the Buddhist texts, representing kind of two different ways of being equanimous of being really balanced.
And the one we often hear about the most I think is Upeka, which points to a really unsafe, shakeable evenness of mind to sublime state. And it's one of the Brahma Viharas in one of the heaven the boats the heart qualities.
And homologically, the word Upeka is related to looking over something, having an overview. So similes for that are used in the sutas that really point to this, this quality of being over, having an overview.
One is a person on a watchtower, you know, seeing what's what's far below watch tower on a castle or something, seeing what's below and really having the view of it. And another is out of a large bird like an eagle soaring bird bird prey looking down and seeing having a view of the whole countryside.
In these similes, there's an implication of some detachments, a little bit of detachments. It's not cold. It's not indifferent. That's really not what it is. But there is a sense of some distance that kind of a wide view, not a close up view with your face right in the, you know, up against what you're seeing to balance to be
seeing things as they are, seeing things as they are. So that's one, one version of equanimity in brief. And the other word for equanimity in Pali is Tatra Maja Tata. I just, I love this word. Tatra Maja Tata.
And it's a compound word that means literally standing in the middle of all this, standing in the middle of all this. And often when we speak of these two ways of being equanimous we think of Upeka as a state that arises in deep meditation practice or in Ramabihara practice of boundless evenness of mind and heart.
In daily life, I think this form of equanimity, this Upeka form of equanimity is when it arises in us in daily life and we're able to have it as we walk around and meet our responsibilities and our challenges.
It's a sign that we're not taking ourselves too seriously, not really taking things personally, not attached to particular outcomes in our life, even minded, you know, having a broad view.
But I think of this Tatra Maja Tata standing in the middle of all this as the most common way that we practice equanimity in our daily lives with all their ups and downs, all their surprises.
Those wonderful surprises like a granddaughter's birthday, which just occurred in my life is a couple weeks ago, or a new job that we're really excited about, or, you know, really distressing kinds of surprises like illness or like some of the news that we read in the papers,
or maybe most of news today recently that we read in the papers, or the death, you know, of someone we love, death of a friend or family member, to something else that I experienced lately.
And this meaning standing in the middle of this standing in the middle, there, once again, it points to the middle way, you know, a point of balance, a point of steadiness, not being thrown to either side by the worldly winds.
Sometimes our minds are, you know, so full of ideas and thoughts and emotions that it can seem like there's a storm inside. And this Tatra Maja Tata, this equanimity in the form of steadiness can really help us to stay in the middle of all of that.
So where Upeka allows us to see with a balanced views, Tatra Maja Tata allows us to stand steadily balanced in the middle of things in our lives and in our practice.
The poem that I read this morning, which is, it's also, you know, it's in the handouts on the retreat page. If you'd like to save it, it's there, you can download it. I think it points very much in the direction of this kind of equanimity is Tatra Maja Tata standing in the middle of all things.
Each line places us in the middle of what's going on. If there is cost I choose to pay, when calm I choose peace. So being in a balanced relationship to what's present in our lives that begins with accepting the current conditions are the current conditions.
It's like that accepting in rain, a wrath that I mentioned earlier, accepting that the current conditions are the current conditions right now. It's like this.
Only when we're willing to be present to what's actually occurring in our lives can we be balanced in relationship to it.
It doesn't mean we have to like it. We just accept that this is how it is right now. I can see the time, it's actually time for us to quit, but I'm going to continue. I just have a few more minutes to say.
So please stick with me. I hope you will. I've tried to offer some, you know, some, some kid bits that would be helpful to you in your daily practice and in your daily lives as well today and I there was a variety of teachings and I hope there wasn't too much variety.
But all of them point to cultivating a similar balance of energy, a balance of mental qualities or attitudes and both the body and the mind.
The balancing of effort like a son is loose, you know, not too tight, not too loose before wise efforts, cultivating what's beneficial, letting go of what's not. And then why is effort and it's kind of broader sense, gauging the quality of our effort, either backing off, or engaging more if we need to, in order to make the effort balanced.
Balancing the energy, energizing and calming aspects of the five faculties or the awakening factors, and you can find that kind of balance and other lists as well, I'm sure.
And cultivating equanimity, you know, kind of really directly going for balance cultivating equanimity, which is this equal mind is seeing.
But you know Pekka and then the steady balance in difficult times talk to a magic talk to.
And each one of these teachings points to the important the importance of that that quality of balance just finding finding the sweet spot.
So you don't have to remember all the details of the Dharma teachings of course that I referred to today. The principle I think is enough to tune our attention to the situation, and we adjust our efforts so that it's in tune.
And if the mind strays too far into straining, over-efforting, restlessness, we use the tools we've learned to make to bring more ease, more relaxation.
And on the other hand, when the mind seems unfocused today, disengaged, we use tools that bring more interest more energy, more curiosity.
It's something we do from the very beginning of our practice to the very, very end.
And having the clarity of mind to see what's needed, it's based on mindfulness, mindfulness is always necessary in our practice.
So I hope the day has been useful for you both through your practice on the cushion and off the cushion. And it's been really a pleasure to be with you today.
I'm sorry, I couldn't get to, you know, to speak with each one of you. It would be nice if we were in person, but he's online. I'm sorry, such a blessing. And if you need, if you feel a need for a follow-up,
you know, IMC offers both individual and group practice discussions every week. And I'm offering groups on Friday mornings currently, but Maria Stratman is another IMC teacher also offers groups.
And there are quite a few others who offer individual meetings. And the links to these, I think they're going to be on the retreat.
Maria Stratman is going to make sure that you can see them on the retreat website. They're also available, of course, on the IMC website.
And once again, I'd really like to thank Verana for all the effort that she put into making this day happen. Thank you so much.
Yeah, three jobs. And I think all of you, each of you, individually and all of you, sincerely for making up our song today for your practice and your attention and your dedication to the Dharma too, to becoming free of greed, hatred, and delusion.
And if you'll bear with me for one more minute, I'd really like us to share the merit of this day, which is something we traditionally do at the end of a period of practice.
So mainly share the goodness that's generated by our sincere investigation, our sincere practice with everyone we come in contact with, and may that spread to everyone they come in contact with.
And outward in ever widening circles so that all beings are touched by the goodness that we generated today, including us.
May all beings everywhere, known and unknown to us, be saved and have peace in their lives.
May they have the strength to meet what comes. May they have ease of mind.
May all beings everywhere find the peace that comes from freedom, the peace that comes from liberation. May it be so.
