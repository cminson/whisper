So once upon a time there was a king called Melinda, King Melinda of the Bhatka community and he was a king who loved to debate and loved to inquire and he drove his ministers and his councilors crazy because he kept asking them questions they couldn't answer and so they guided him to Nagasena, very wise sage and there are many writings of all the questions and answers between the two and in one of them King Melinda asked the question by how many of the factors of awakening does one actually awaken and Nagasena said just one investigation of Dhammas and so Nagasena says well why just one if there's just one then why are they all the seven why do you need the rest of the seven if you only need that one to awaken and so Nagasena said if you have your sword in its sheath can you cut with it and it takes all the other six factors to un-sheath the sword and then be able to use it and this is the sword of discriminating wisdom that cuts through ignorance and so it is the director and pointer to wisdom but it needs all of the other qualities all the other factors of awakening to be able to use it effectively and so this sword of discriminating wisdom the Pali word is Dhamma vichaya and that's translated as discriminating wisdom investigative powers of investigation investigation of Dhammas and when they talk about investigation of Dhammas it means Dhammas with a little D and that's when Dhamma is used to mean all phenomena all of the arising and passing and when it's used with a big D it means the teachings the Dhamma the truth the unfoldings of all the wisdom that the Buddha shared and investigation has these two roles both the investigating part the exploring the understanding and the discriminating part and so both of these are important these two functions investigation and discrimination and it's that investigation that's curious and inspires us to keep going it's that looking more closely that Gil was referring to the other night of mindfulness bringing the attention in and then investigation just exploring and looking closely it's an inquisitiveness a keenness to know what's really here what's happening right now and the continuity of our mindfulness builds that and then once it starts to arise we're inspired to be more mindful to keep going so it's questioning and reflective and it's an intuitive rather than a figuring out when we have this intellectual figuring out the energy gets dispersed but this kind of reflective open intuitive questioning brings energy and brings joy and curiosity so it's a feeling and a sensing and it brings a freshness to experience so rather than a looking and a figuring out it's much more relaxed and back and letting things reveal themselves so it's seeing things as they really are rather than superimposed with all our ideas and concepts and assumptions about the truth what we take to be a certain way we get closer and closer and see what's true and we start to see how our mind brings assumptions in we connect more fully and see what's actually happening and I really used to notice this when I was practicing as a physician how someone would come in and they'd say something and I could see a thought coming in and deciding this is what's wrong and then I learned to let that just let that go okay that's how I'm seeing it for now and let more and more become clearer so rather than closing the door and seeing just this view just to let things okay that's what I'm seeing for now but what else is true what else might it be so letting assumptions fall away and letting more and more of experience show us what is actually happening and you could see I could see the projections of my mind based on this one thing that I thought was going on that prevented me from seeing further seeing more deeply getting what was really happening for somebody so it's let's hold that interpretation lightly and inquire further what else might be here so that's the investigating part the discriminating part is seeing what's skillful what's not skillful and this was such an important contribution the Buddha gave it's that ability to not just see what's here but see what's skillful what's unskillful so we're seeing what's happening and is it wholesome is it beneficial or not so both of those coming together are really powerful so the Dhamma Vijaya adds an active component to the mindfulness the two together are very powerful it's like shining a flashlight that's often the analogy that's used shiling a flashlight in the dark so you don't bump into things so you can see more clearly what's there it lights up the field of awareness and it eliminates this the truth it shows us what's really here what is it that I'm actually seeing and then we start seeing the correct an application of attention to things I think I was talking about it that a bit the other night correctly applying attention what do I really want to be looking at what am I choosing to look closer at a week ago I was walking in the woods and I was looking at the green all the different greens and the trees and seeing them really clearly and it was so wonderful and looking at the birds and everything everything was coming into greater focus felt so expanded and light and wonderful and I tripped over something because I wasn't including the whole picture and so it's discriminating wisdom what are we choosing out to look more closely what's appropriate here and the other thing is this investigation is very much a turning inward to let things and first of all we're experiencing the sensations in the body sounds that the direct experience getting letting that become more clear but we're also looking at our reaction to all of what we're sensing and feeling we're looking closer and what's the effect of that so we're not just looking at the sounds and sensations but we're also looking at the qualities in the mind that are receiving those sensations how we respond to what's arising and when we do that when we combine those together we start to see certain things the truth of certain things more clearly and the first of those is we see more clearly how am I contributing to suffering how is it that I'm contributing to what's going on Gil was talking this morning about pain and they how when we look more closely we can see what it's composed of and we can see how we're contributing to it so we might have a painful physical or emotional experience and as we look more closely we can feel the sensations in the body what they're composed of are they hot or cold or vibrating or how big they are what happens as we pay attention we look more closely and then we also see what the effect of our attitude is this is impossible to work with am I are we tense around it or we're resisting it do we have a story about it are we judging it and we see the effect of all those so we see how it is that we're adding to the suffering and we look at the qualities in the mind of a tight or judgmental or fearful or peaceful so we see both the wholesome beautiful qualities and the difficult qualities another thing that we start to see as we pay closer attention is we start to see how much of experience is just coming and going when we pay attention to the sensations we see that they're they're just as the sensations of tension and pressure and vibration are changing all the time and constantly moving also our reaction to it is changing so maybe the sentience are really unpleasant and we see how the aversion to them is coming and going the sensation might become pleasant and then we like it and the liking is coming and going we like it for a while and then we get bored with it and that becomes irritation so we see how all these things are constantly changing and then we see as we look more deeply that even our sense of self is changing that that are the ways we see ourselves are changing from moment to moment we're having a really pleasant experience now I'm a really good meditator and then it becomes unpleasant and now I can't do it and I'm a useless meditator and that identity changes and our identities change over time the ways we see ourselves are not fixed so many years ago I was sitting cross-legged I didn't need all this stuff and I can't see well enough so I have to have it closer and and I can't remember so I need more notes and so our sense of self changes knees don't work as well and my image of myself as being flexible and competent and all these things has gone and the degree to which I'm attached to that is the degree to which they're suffering but events investigation shows that it's all changing there isn't anything as solid the assumption and some beliefs we have about ourselves are changing all the time and that's a relief as well it's both scary and it's also a relief when investigation sees that the assumptions and beliefs aren't so solid it gives us a little space our perspective changes there's just that bit of more allowing and with that comes more strength and stability we start to be able to trust more this is just passing it's okay to let these difficult states come I'm not gonna get it right all the time this is a moment of getting it right this is a moment of getting it wrong and so we're able to let them go and there's a greater sense of ease and spaciousness and we're less pulled around by the thoughts and feelings when we know that they're coming and going there's an ease and we can actually see how they operate so there's more choice about how we respond it gives us spaciousness so mindfulness sees what's happening it remembers to come back to be here to look to see and the Dhamma Vijaya adds is this skillful is this going in a useful direction and it shows there's a possibility and a choice do I really want to follow this train of thought maybe we're caught in a very pleasant fantasy and mindfulness notices that and investigation really looks more closely all seduced is this going in a useful direction is it possible to let go of this right now so in our practice we start beginning to know how to make adjustments it's very helpful this quality because it helps us make adjustments and and tune our practice more finely what's needed and what might be more helpful right now so maybe mindfulness shows that we're sleepy sleepiness is here and as we look more closely with this investigation just looking more closely not trying to figure out it might just like might notice oh well actually this boredom here or maybe this fear or maybe this is pleasant and I'm attached to it so it starts to tease it out a little bit and then just from seeing what's here that reveals what might be useful so it might be if we're just tired that we need a little more energy or it might be that we need to open our eyes it starts to become clear what it is to do without us having to figure out just from looking closely once I was on a retreat and I was very sleepy and I'd been quite concentrated but I was very sleepy and so I saw these voices come you should stand up no no you should open your eyes no it would be better to take deeper breaths and then all of a sudden I saw this voice say well let me know when you guys have figured it out and I think I'll take a little nap while you're deciding and so it sort of revealed that the going back and forth and figuring it out wasn't helpful and what was needed just was just more lightness and so we start to see it starts to show us which tools that which tools are needed so rather than getting caught in figuring out just by looking more closely we start to trust what might be needed in each moment so it's not an intellectual figuring out but an attuned alert full presence so we're becoming more fully attuned with our whole body mind and heart so the they if you remember when we were talking about the factors of awakening the first thing to do is to notice are they present or absent so we notice is this quality of investigation present for me or not and if it is then we can continue to cultivate it and if it's not how can I bring it about what would support it and obviously continuity of mindfulness really helps really tuning in getting a sense of connecting when I was sitting just now I was I kept starting to drift off and then oh what's needed is more continuity of mindfulness there's actually no discriminating wisdom here but if I had a little more continuity of mindfulness then I might be awake enough to have some discrimination and so just that little bit of continuity really helps and how do we inquire what is it that we're paying attention to we're paying attention to the body and the sensations so for example how it might work when we're paying attention to the breath is for example we might notice that this tension or tightness around the breath mindfulness notices all this contraction and tenseness feel tight in my chest and this tension around the breath and as we look a little bit more closely then we start to notice oh I'm striving this striving here oh there's an agenda I want to be really concentrated and I'm not and so just that looking more closely reveals what's happening and then naturally we can give a little more space or relax a little bit more or maybe we're spaced out maybe the mindfulness shows oh the spaciousness I'm not connecting with the breath at all and so Dhamma Bhavichaya with the investigation we notice a little bit more closely what's underneath that and we can fine-tune and come in more closely so it helps balance in that way so we're looking more closely at both the body and the breath and also the feeling tone of unpleasant pleasant and neutral and how that comes and goes we're starting to see things arise and pass and we're also starting to see our attitude to things are we judging or are we not are we being do we have a kind attention what's the effect of judging oh it's uncomfortable what's the effect of kind attention I feel relaxed so it just start to see the impact of how we are and what happens so if we frequently give attention to mind states as we will be doing in the next few days we start to see which of the mind states are beneficial and which are not and that's so helpful in our practice we start to see how how it is that we're the negative mind states are perpetuating what am I doing that's perpetuating them and with investigating wisdom we start to see that it's kind of like having a garden what is it that I'm growing here am I growing aggressive arugula sorry it's just what came spontaneously how am I growing belligerent broccoli calm cucumbers get better stop we start noticing what is it that we're cultivating and and that gives a gives us a possibility and a choice to do something different what is it that we want to do we're looking at what feeds the factors of awakening these beautiful qualities of the mind and what are we doing that's feeding the difficult ones so mindfulness and investigation give this fine tuning together there's a connection and an intimacy and there's also a positive feedback loop the more mindfulness there is the more the investigation grows and as the investigation gets stronger we get more interested and that feeds the mindfulness and whatever it is we're doing whether it's walking or sitting or eating whatever it is gets more interesting and more fascinating and more and more opens up and so it's it's like the hourglass that Gil was talking about the more we enter this part of the the hourglass the more interesting it gets and the more everything opens up so we're shining a light that's constantly revealing more and there's more understanding another analogy I like is this you know those domes that glass glass things that we had as kids the snow domes where they were this thing and you shake them up and they're all full of snow whatever it is and then as it settles it gets more clear so we see clearly but then what happens is we realize oh there's no ceiling and we see even more clearly it's like being in a bubble and the bubble breaks and we can see even more and then the next layer of the bubble breaks and we can see even more and we're more and more curious so the limits of what we know keeps expanding and that's the beautiful thing about this quality an analogy I like from my childhood is when I was small my mother used to take myself and my siblings ponding in England and we used to go to the local small ponds and we had these jam jars with a string tied around the top and we would hurl them into the pond and then pull them back and they'd be full with all these pond creatures and at first you know the water would be murky and we couldn't see very much and then we'd see all these different little things in the water and we'd take them home and we'd put them into a glass aquarium and we'd see even more and more and as we look more closely we could see how all the little things behaved and then we could see the effect that they had on each other just like you can with your mind you see more and more closely how all the little things behave and then the causes and conditions so if there were no snails in the tank the all the sides got covered with green algae if we put snails in they ate it all and we could see in some things ate others and we could see the effect of all the different dynamics in this little small microcosm and in the same way the further we explore inside the more and more we see the causes and conditions that are occurring in within and what leads to liberation and what leads to confusion and wanting and a version and the other thing we start to understand as we use this fact or more and more is how to balance how to create balance in the mind how to use mindfulness to create balance so that shows us when it's useful to use this quality of investigation and when it's not and the Buddha had a beautiful sutra about this where he used the analogy of a fire and when the fire is when you want the fire to to start that's the wrong time when you want it to blaze that's the wrong time to put wet grass wet sticks and wet cow dung on it and in the same way if if the mind is is dull and sluggish and tired that's the wrong time to use the factors of calming and equanimity and concentration you put the fire out but it's the right time for dry grass dry cow dung and dry sticks so it's the right time to use the factors of investigation and energy and joy so when the mind is calm sorry when the mind is sluggish then you want to use investigation but if the mind is agitated or restless that's not a useful time to put on your dry grass then you want calming things you want calm equanimity and concentration and so if you're having a really restless time and the mind is agitated then it's more useful to be bring a calming factor in that it is to use investigation also if the mind has got caught in a lot of thinking and analyzing and conjecture not so useful to use investigation more useful to use calming and keep things very simple and stay with the breath so if after the talk and tomorrow you are bringing this quality in a little more you'll see quite quickly if it's not the useful time if you start getting more thoughts and getting more agitated then that's the time just to go back to the breath keep things very simple bring calming in and it's very self-correcting it will show you very quickly that this isn't a useful time so you don't need to worry about overusing this quality because it will self-correct and as long as there's mindfulness that says oh oh there's too much agitation here then we can bring the calming in and what happens is we get increasing skill at fine-tuning at the beginning of our practice it's more a course tuning you know and we find we're swinging from one side to the other and as we get more settled and some of you mentioned that that you were either too sleepy or too restless you were sort of ping-ponging between one and the other and as we settle down we start to be able to fine-tune a little more so that we can make adjustments because there's never one thing as Gil was saying there's never one one perfect adjustment that will get us right and that will be it forever we're always very gently fine-tuning depending on the energy and the conditions that are happening each moment and that's always changing so we can we can notice with this beautiful quality when we try some gentle adjustment is this working is this helpful and it's a helpful thing to monitor our practice in that way so we're not just kind of going along without this oh is this working is there is the is the clarity growing or am I just kind of hanging out in a sort of spaced out zone or have I been in fantasy for the last half of a day whatever it is we're just fine-tuning is this working and we learn for ourselves what's right for us we're all different one way of working with pain may be useful for one person and not with another and we trust what's right for us but it's not helpful to have this there is this working become am I getting it right in a judgmental way I have to get it right I made the wrong adjustment this is not okay but it because the judging are mistakes or judging when we've overcorrected or undercorrected is it is a hindrance and it's a block to the development of this quality arising it gets in the way and blocks the energy rather than releases the energy it's where we're sort of blocking the discriminating wisdom from arising this a lovely analogy Rachel Naomi Rimen in one of her books has tells the story about the very first Concorde flight and the very first time the Concorde flew across the Atlantic they invited a whole bunch of VIPs to come on board and some of them were taken into the control room and one of the VIPs was sort of horrified to see there was no one flying the plane kind of and there were just these two computers that were there and he heard this constant whirring and clicking and all these noises and he said what's that noise and they said oh well one one computer is set in course and the other computer is correcting every time the plane goes off course he said well how often does it go off course oh about 90% of the time and he said oh my god will we really get to Paris yes we'll get to Paris and we'll get there on time exactly wow 90% of the time it's off course well we're kind of like that too Rachel Naomi Rimen said we're off course all the time and wouldn't it be wonderful if every time we went off course there was this self-correction and we said oh thank you for setting me on course again and instead when we correct ourselves and we're off course we get pissed off we don't like being off course but it's a natural thing that's how we find balance is by is by getting imbalanced that's how we come to balance again and so just if you can think of it that way I find it very helpful oh I'm off course no big deal at least I noticed thank you for showing me that I'm off course now I can now I can get balanced again and so it's that it's like a graceful way of finding balance and that really helps our practice we really learn a lot about ourselves and our capacity and we get finer and finer tuning all the way to equanimity and the more this the more we travel through these factors of awakening the finer tuning we're able to do with this quality so each of the other factors helps us develop this quality more and more of fine tuning and a deeper and deeper understanding and we get a deeper trust in our own capacity to see clearly what it is that I really need in this moment and that's such a powerful thing to trust what's right for ourselves so we also can use this quality of discerning wisdom to support us in our practice in when we come against emotional or physical difficulties or distress to help us work with it help us see how we're caught and help us stop acting out the same patterns like so often I know for myself I I respond to difficulty with the same patterns of behavior that have never worked and still don't and so this is a helpful way of of learning and some of you are familiar with the acronym RAIN how many of you familiar with that yeah quite a few of you and really it's simply mindfulness plus investigation that's what it amounts to the R is the recognize what's going on that's the mindfulness what's happening right now and then the a is noticing our attitude are we resisting are we allowing what's the attitude and the I is the investigation the discrimination and investigation and it's not cognitive it's just getting in touch in a deeper way with what's actually going on and then as we do that what's underneath it starts to reveal itself more and more the tangle untangles gradually and there's a shift in identity we're less caught and that's the end we're not so identified we're not so caught and we're back in wholeness again we've been separate and and disconnected and now we're back in wholeness and so it's almost as though the gentleness of the rain dissolves the identification dissolves the place where we're caught and a self who's stuck or afraid or angry or whatever it is or in pain or whatever the difficulty is and we're we're whole again so it's recognize allow and investigate or recognize know the attitude and investigate so we're seeing allowing we're directly sensing and it's this direct sensing that starts to reveal and allow the unfolding and instead of being identified we're shifting to a more compassionate presence and that compassionate presence allows a transformation and because we see the suffering underneath compassion arises naturally it's not something we have to actually force or bring in sometimes just clearly recognizing the state itself is all we need to do that's all that's it there's nothing else that needs to happen but sometimes is a real storm whether it's physical or emotional we really caught in it we're lost in it and by gently inquiring just looking more and more deeply then we start to see what's underneath it might be fear or sadness or anger whatever it is and when we see what it is we can align with it and when we're aligned with it then there's more acceptance rather than a confused resistance so suppose the mindfulness shows there's a whole bunch of negativity here we're caught in some negative mind state and mindfulness says there's lots of negativity here and then investigation just looks a little bit more closely what's feeding these negative mind states oh I'm resisting that's feeding oh I'm believing I think that they're all true that's feeding them start to see that that's what's happening and the more we follow that means more we see what's really underneath oh the sadness here oh sadness oh caring for the sadness or maybe there's loss or betrayal or whatever it is that's underneath we really understand and without understanding this I'm letting go so investigation points to the direct experience and it helps loosen all the layers so that we can really understand where we're caught one retreat I was sitting I I had everything to be going quite well and then all of a sudden I was dissatisfied with everything I was I everything was irritating and I my noticed my mind was complaining about everything I was resistant to going in the hall I was resistant to my work meditation everything was disgusting it was really feeling dissatisfied and I couldn't I was confused about what was really going on but as I began to pay attention more closely I started to see that that what was happening was that I wanted the peaceful clear states that I'd had before and what was happening now was kind of ordinary and not good enough and because it wasn't good enough I was wearing not good enough glasses for everything that was going on and so sort of having some gentleness and humor about that and saying oh I have a choice to take those glasses off and see if just this moment can be enough this ordinary moment and of course it was and so seeing that dissatisfaction was what was going on was helpful and so we start to begin to understand the cause and effect relationships of our practice this is arising because of that the criticality was arising because of the underlying things are not enough and then as we look more deeply we begin to see really and really deeply understand the impermanence and changing nature of everything we start to see and really sense everything really is changing none of these mind states are lasting none of these sensations are changing all of the mind states you had in the last sit have gone they may have come back again but other things have come in between they are changing the thoughts that you had five minutes ago have gone different ones are here and we see how it's this nature of body and mind is just a paired process it's really amazing how that happens there's there's the sensations in the body and the knowing of them hearing and the knowing of it and they're together but they're separate can't separate them but they're arising together and we see that both the knowing and the object that we're knowing are not self both of them are not self it's just this paired knowing it's weird it's this is this is round and it's also brown and it's also makes a funny sound all those things are in this one object you can't separate them but they're occurring together and it's the same way with this knowing the sense of the sense of my hand moving and knowing I'm moving it to separate things occurring together and we really start to be more and more aware of that process and as that happens there's more possibility of letting go of every moment being fresh this is passing anyway so why hold on to it even the holding on is disappearing the moment of holding on is gone the me that was holding on has become the me that's got open hands they're just continually coming and going and so when we when we really sense that everything gets less sticky and this investigation of dhammas reveals that it shows us more and more clearly how things actually are this fluidity of everything the movement of everything and in that when we're not stuck to things then it's more possible for us to see the shining nature of reality that's not obscured by all the things that we're caught in so rather than looking at the stuck stuff we're seeing everything we're seeing the wholeness so this investigation of dhammas is showing us this process and it's also showing us really clearly the teachings of the Buddha like the first noble truth it's showing us that there's suffering and that we have a possibility of not perpetuating the same patterns we can use the dhamma principles to change our experience we can see oh I'm holding on to something as possible for me to let go I don't have to repeat that pattern again sometimes in my practice and in my life some really irritating habit pattern will surface again and it'll be oh no not again and instead if I can have the attitude oh thank you for seeing this this is a possibility of doing this differently of not watering that seed again the fact that it came up and I saw it means I now have a chance to water a different seed to not keep going in that way and so in that moment that's the third noble truth just a moment of freedom I didn't follow the old path I I was suffering I saw the cause of suffering and I didn't follow it all right and that gives me the confidence to keep going with the fourth noble truth to keep going with being mindful and having some wise effort and having some concentration and having a little integrity having the intention to not be harming in in my thoughts to notice oh oh those are not skillful thoughts you know it's just to keep practicing so it's inspiring and you can see as I'm talking how this investigation of dhammas really brings in the whole of the teaching just by exploring and continuing by looking at these qualities of mind so it feels like in a way that this is a useful place to bring this to a conclusion discriminating wisdom can show me that well that feels kind of complete it may not be that I've talked for an hour but is it really skillful to talk for an hour not always and so I'd really support you in exploring this quality in noticing when it's there and appreciating it and really appreciating your own intuition we all have it remember it's both that quality of just seeing more clearly investigating not a looking and appearing but a relaxing back and letting things reveal themselves but being there for them and then bringing in the discriminating part is this skillful or not and just through those two things can really support our practice so beautifully and then what supports it is the continuity of your mindfulness and that will naturally bring that in and as the continuity builds and the investigation comes in you get more interested and there's more energy and that's the next factor of awakening so thank you for your attention and may your interest grow and bring you joy and let's just sit in stillness for a few moments.
