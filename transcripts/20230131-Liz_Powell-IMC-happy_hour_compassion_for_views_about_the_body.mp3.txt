 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good evening and welcome everyone. Welcome to Happy Hour. I so enjoy sharing this evening with everyone and these beautiful qualities of heart and mind that we develop with these evenings of Happy Hour. I've been reflecting lately on the ways we get stuck in daily life and in mindfulness practice and how to get unstuck. You know, wondering how is it that we aren't completely free of happiness, stress, and suffering already? How can we become completely free? And how do we get caught in repetitive patterns of mind that are unwholesome? Anywhere from slightly unhelpful habits to some that we can clearly see are harmful to our well-being. How do we free ourselves of unhelpful mental patterns? One way that came up that we inadvertently get stuck is that we develop and hold views or beliefs about ourselves, about each other, and about the world. And without knowing it, these views or beliefs can lodge themselves in our minds and contribute unconsciously to a kind of mental inflexibility. And then when events don't unfold the way we expect, we react in ways that are painful, ways that are even mildly preferring things were different or feeling stressed because people and events are not as we expect, all the way up to extremes of despair and suffering. So with the practice of mindfulness, we can develop awareness of the times that our views clash with things as they are right now. And if we continue to practice this way, recognizing views over time, we start to see how beliefs and views create stress and suffering. We can begin to let go of beliefs that aren't helping us and recognize even subtle ones over time. So what are some of the types of views or beliefs that perpetuate suffering? One view is that we are this body, this set of emotions, we are this mind. If we get hooked on these fixed ideas, we've already frozen one moment in time or one set of moments in time and started to act as if that were true all the time. We've started to believe that there are permanent or unchanging states or phenomenon within ourselves, and that sets us up for suffering. One example is the ideas, views we have about this body, identifying with it, thinking it should stay one particular way forever. Like it should be strong or have certain abilities consistently for an entire life, or that we should consistently look a certain way according to a certain set of standards. And with those kinds of fixed beliefs, what then happens in the mind when we fall ill or sustain an injury or lose a capability or simply grow older? Unhappiness. There's no point in identifying with the body in any particular state, even states of illness or impairment or old age. Any time we limit our view to some fixed idea, we set up unhappiness. We are not our aging bodies, nor are we our young strong body. We're not our illness or our disability. We are not our appearance. Any time we have fixed expectations of ourselves as being this body and about how the body is supposed to be or perform or look, we'll feel unhappy or suffer sooner or later. If instead we're able to realize that the mind is in a changing relationship to an ever-changing body that is in dynamic relationship to an ever-changing environment, we can reach an equanimity with this constant flow of change. The practice of compassion, one of our happy hour practices, can help us get unstuck from the inevitable suffering, stress, and even self-harm that flow from clinging to or identifying with this body as me, these emotions, this mind. Compassion can also free us from suffering that comes from other people's views of bodies. We live in a culture, an ecosystem, and on a planet with billions of other humans, and some of the views about the body arising in this larger system might be having quite an impact on you. So this evening we'll practice various ways to offer compassion to the body and to the views we have of the body, compassion to ourselves and to all others afflicted by being stuck in these beliefs. So with that, allowing yourself time to settle into a posture that will support you to stay alert and aware, as well as allowing as much physical ease as is possible at this time. Recognizing how you feel in this moment, giving that space, allowing it to be known and experienced, knowing the felt experience of the body, the most prominent sensation or sensations. And if there's any area to which you might bring more ease, perhaps taking a longer or deeper series of breaths and releasing or softening any tightness on the out breath, and if there are areas of tension or tightness that cannot be released, just accepting them, allowing them exactly as they are with kindness. There's no right or wrong experience. We're just knowing any experience of body, any feeling of body or heart that is present, recognizing it, allowing it, experiencing it. So, aware of any thinking that's happening. Recognizing it, respecting that thinking has arisen. Perhaps for now not feeding it any fuel or further thoughts, but rather allowing yourself to set it aside for later or letting it be in the background for a time. And taking your time with this, bringing to mind any fixed belief you may have about your body that can sometimes cause unhappiness, stress, or suffering. Letting any belief or beliefs fill the awareness with how it affects you when it arises. Any sensations associated with the belief? Any images or thoughts? Knowing this belief and sending compassionate wishes to that belief about the body, to this body that's been a companion and a support for my entire life. I care about you and the way this belief or view causes suffering. May any view or belief about this body and the suffering that it causes come to an end. I care about you and your suffering. Any views about this body that cause mental suffering and physical suffering come to an end. If there's any part of you that finds it difficult to send compassion to the body or to these views, simply recognizing that, and perhaps sending that part of you, the kind wish. There are understandable reasons this difficulty is here. And sending this heart, mind, and body, the wish, may you be healthy and at ease. And if the body is feeling calm, having pleasant sensations, and is not suffering, sending the wish, may this happiness continue, enjoying it. Continuing to practice in this way for the next number of minutes, sending compassionate wishes to the body. I care about you. May any views or beliefs about this body, may any suffering about those beliefs come to an end. I care about your suffering. May any physical and mental suffering about this body come to an end. May you be healthy and at ease. Sending wishes of compassion and kindness to this body and heart, mind. Thank you. And if the attention has drifted for a while, simply, gently recognizing that awareness is back, and sending compassionate and kind wishes to this body, heart, and mind. Thank you. And you can continue to send kind and compassionate wishes to the body, recognize how it is in this moment. Or if you'd like, you can allow another person that you know and care about to come to mind, especially if you know they struggle with views or beliefs about their body. Allowing images of them and your knowledge of how they struggle, fill the mind and heart. Inclining compassionate wishes towards them, not as any kind of agenda or demand, simply, a gentle wish. I care about you and your suffering. May any beliefs about your body that cause mental suffering come to an end. May suffering in the heart, mind, and body come to an end for you. Sending their heart, mind, and body, kind wishes. May you be healthy and at ease. May you be safe and free from harm. And continuing with these compassionate wishes for them, I care about you and your suffering. May any beliefs about your body that cause suffering come to an end. May you be healthy and at ease. May you be safe and free from harm. May you be healthy and at ease. May you be healthy and at ease. And you can continue to practice in exactly the way that you have been. Or if you wish, you could extend the mind to a broader group of people, people whose beliefs may cause them and others suffering. Their beliefs about the body, creating stress or unhappiness. Allowing those people to come to mind and sending them compassionate wishes. I care about you and your suffering. May views or beliefs you have about the body that cause suffering come to an end. Sending them the kind wishes. May you be healthy and at ease. May you be safe and free from harm. May you be free from suffering. May all beings be free from suffering in the heart, mind and body. May all beings be free from beliefs and views that cause suffering. May all kindness and stress come to an end. Thank you.
