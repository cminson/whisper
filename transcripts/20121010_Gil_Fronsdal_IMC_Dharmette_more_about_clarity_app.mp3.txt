Dharmette: More about Clarity

The Buddhist word for  the insight practice  we do  is 
vipassanā. The passanā part comes from the verb ‘ to 
see,’ and one meaning of the prefix  vi is to give 
emphasis. So vipassanā  means  something like  
“emphatic seeing .” One way vipassanā  is translated into 
English is “clear seeing .” Mindfulness involves seeing  
clearly .  
 
What does it mean to be clear in our seeing , to see 
clearly , to be clear about what’s going on ? There are 
different meanings of the word ‘clear .’ One is to be 
certain or definitive  that you really see and know, “This 
clearly is what’s going  on!” As I said earlier today, there 
are many times when we benefit from being a li ttle 
clearer about what’s going on . Even when we already 
know what’s going on to some degree , there’s a 
difference between kind of  knowing , and being really 
clear  with yourself  about what's happening . It’s like 
admitting it directly , or fully acknowledging  it: “Now I’m 
clear. I’m really clear. This is what’s happening now. ”  
 
It can also mean  clarity about one’s purpose . “I’m clear 
this is what I’m doing right now. ” When I was in the monastery in Japan , I went into the kitchen one day and 
asked the cook a question . He was chopping 
vegetables . He put down his knife , very clearly turned 
towards me , and answered my question . Then he very 
clearly turned back to his vegetables , picked up his 
knife , and start ed chopping . I asked another question . 
He put down the knife, looked at me, answered my 
question, and started chopping again . I asked a third 
question . He put down his knife,  looked at me , and said 
very kindly, “I’m only going to do one thing at a time , 
and my task right now is to chop the vegetables. This is 
my purpose ; this is  what I’m doing here. ” I got it  – 
although I was a bit slow . He had a sense of purpose , a 
job to do . He may have had  a time limit to get the meal 
ready . This was not the time for me to be talking with 
him, and he was clear about it .  
 
This is being clear or definitive  about one’s  purpose, or 
domain , or what the situation is . Be clear about it , as 
oppose d to, “Everything is okay . I’ll just work with this , 
and accept it as it is . And I’ll learn . When someone’s 
interrupting my work , I’ll just let go of what I’m supposed 
to do , and be with that  new situation .” I think it is naive 
to just easily float with everything , when  at certain times 
there  is some purpos e, and things need to be  done a 
certain way.  
 
Part of clear seeing is to have clarity about the purpose . 
For example, “ This is what I’m doing right now. I’m practicing mindfulness. I’m practicing meditation. ” It’s 
been helpful for me , because , still to this day there are 
times when I sit down to meditate  – perhaps  because I 
do it regularly  out of habit – I might  sit down without 
having  clarity , certainty , or purpose . I might sit down , 
and start thinking about what’s for dinner , what I should 
buy, or what the menu should be. Then after a while,  I 
remember,  “Wait a minute. I’m not here to sit down and 
do high quality menu planning  [laughter] . The reason 
I’ve sat down is to be fully present for what’s here in 
some clear way. ” I remind myself to be clear  about what 
I’m doing here . For me , that clarity of establishing my 
purpose helps me get more rooted or present . 
 
In addition to  clarity about the purpose , there’s also 
clarity about what’s actually happening . Sometimes I 
might be thinking about the dinner menu , and I kind of 
know that I’m thinking about it . I can let go and come 
back to my breath . But then I keep thinking about the 
menu , and then let go  again . For me there’s a 
qualitative difference between doing that , versus turning 
towards my thinking mind , sitting up straight , 
metaphorically stand ing on my own two feet , and say ing 
clearly, “I’m thinking about food. I’m thinking about the 
menu. This is what’s going on right now. ” I have real 
clarity seeing  that t his is what’s happening . It’s tu rning 
towards something , and fully acknowledging it .  
 
Sometimes  I kind of know someone’s there . I kind of  know my kids want my attention when  I’m cooking a 
meal  or doing  something  else.  They’re asking for my 
attention,  and I kind of say, “Later .” Or if they’re doing 
their homework , “Yeah , the answer to four times four is 
sixteen .” But it’s a whole different thing to stop what I’m 
doing – like the cook  who was chopping the vegetables 
– turn towards them , fully acknowledg e them,  and say, 
“I’m here. I see you. ” I’m clear , and I tell them, “ This is 
not the time .” I’m going to speak to them  fully – not 
casually , or kind of on the side , as if answering them is  
a minor thing.  
 
Many people find it beautiful , and very meaningful when 
people turn towards them , and are clearly there for 
them . We do that for ourselves with mindfulness 
practice . Are we clear about what’s happening? In the 
alchemy of the mind , something very different happens 
when we clearly acknowledge what ’s happening . “This 
is what’s happening. I’m clear about it. My mind is out of 
control , and I’m full of anxiety .”  
 
When we have  that sense of purpose , clarity , turning 
towards, and fully acknowledging  what is happening , a 
certain  inner strength and indepe ndence begin to grow . 
We find ballast , stability , or calm when we’re not caught 
by what’s happening . We’re not involved in it, lost in it, 
or wandering around.  
 
Clarity or clear seeing can also mean that the seeing becomes clear . Our seeing is not obscured by our 
desires, bias es, aversions, fears, judgments, or by our 
self-identity issues tied up in it all . Seeing starts to 
becom e clear er and clear er. We see things as they are  
– more directly without the filter of a lot of stuff betwe en 
us and that .  
 
Part of the purpose of relaxing and calming down in 
meditation is so  that there  are fewer  and fewer  filters 
between us and our experience . At some point , seeing 
itself begins to sense that our awareness is now 
becoming clear . In a similar way , it’s like how the air 
becomes clear when the rain or the wind blows away 
the smog . It’s quite something to look out and see the 
hills across the bay when the air is completely clean . It 
doesn’t happen  that often here in the Bay Area, but 
when it does,  it’s remarkable . In the same way , our 
attention can become clearer and clearer , and it’s quite 
a remarkable thing to have that clarity.  
 
When clarity  become s strong enough , it’s like an entity 
in itself  – a kind of force , strength , or capacity tha t’s 
there . One advantage of this clarity  – one of the 
opportunities in it  – is that it can begin shifting where we 
think it’s valuable to keep our attention , or to focus our 
life on . For many peopl e, their attention, focus, and 
preoccupation is with their identity issues : what they’re 
trying to do in life, what they’re trying to accomplish, 
what they’re run ning away from . There’s all this stuff in their life that they’re caught up in . When this sense of 
clarity becomes stronger , it starts feeling very valuable . 
Maybe it’s similar to the clear sky . If you don’t see very 
far across the bay , local things become  important . 
You’re focusing on the cars , the people , and the things 
around you . Even though a clear sky is not a thing , you 
say, “Wow. This is quite something !” And then you are 
willing to let go of the preoccupation with things 
because there’s this beautiful space all around.  
 
It is the same way with the mind . There is this beautiful 
space or clarity in the mind  – and that has value , 
meaning, satisfaction , and happiness in it . When the 
clarity becomes strong enough , it can create  a dramatic 
shift for those  who are willing to let go of 
preoccupations , and they can take u p residence  – 
abiding in the clarity , rather than in the stuff of life . It 
doesn’t mean that we dismiss our concerns , but we 
have  a very different relationship with them .  
 
What can also shift in that clarity is the recognition that 
ideas, thoughts, and concerns about self are not really 
needed . They are  not part of the clarity , but rather  part 
of the obstructions . Even the sense of separation that 
there’s something out there that  I’m clear about , and I’m 
here and clearly aware of what’s out there  – that’s just 
more extra stuff . There’s just clarity . There doesn’t have 
to be any subject or object , or self or not -self in it . 
There’s just clarity , and it’s a beautiful thing.   
In Engl ish the word ‘clear ’ – clear seeing  – is very rich , 
with many connotations that speak well about aspects 
of this insight practice . Maybe there  are more meanings 
of ‘clear ’ I haven’t covered . But you might think of clarity 
as a closely connected feature of mindfulness practice.
