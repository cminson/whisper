Dharmette: The Lightness of Letting Go

A very central practice in Buddhism  – without which  
there would probably be no Buddhism  – is the practice 
of letting go. It is a practice that can be quite challenging  
– a practice which people can appropriately have 
reservations about.  It can be done poorly. Even so, it is 
one of the great practices in Buddhism, because in 
letting go , we find  our freedom.  
 
Suzuki Roshi is supposed to have said that letting go is 
accepting that things go away. That is one aspect of 
letting go . That's how things are . Some of you are 
already experiencing getting older, and there are 
probably capacities you had w hen you were you were 
younger that are not so prominent any more. They are 
going.  So you can suffer around that by holding on to 
something, but instead of fighting old age, letting go has 
an aspect of accepting the way things are.  
 
One of the things I learned about letting go, is that it is 
healthy when done appropriately.  When you ’ve let go of 
something, there should be some joy.  Maybe ‘joy’ is too 
strong of a word, but perhaps it will feel like lightness  – 
like, “Wow! What a relief to let go. ”   
I did a lot of letting go during my practice, and I thought I 
was really doing it. I thought I was letting go of things, 
when actually what I really was doing ended up being 
neutral.  I was letting go , and I wasn’t suffering anymore, 
so that was is good, but I w asn’t happy . I was  neutral. I 
learned that if I am neutral in letting go, I have not really 
let go. There's still something.  And generally what would 
happen to me was that the something would come back 
and bite me later.  Somehow in the background, it was 
still operating.  So, a nice principle is that if there is no 
joy, you have not really let go.  
 
What can you let go of so that you are not only free from 
what you are clinging to , but there’s  some joy or 
appreciation in that letting go?  One way  this happen s is 
when you understand what the holding on is like  – what 
the gripping is like. You can study and be aware of what 
you are holding onto, but you can also become aware of 
what the gripping is like  – the tightening  of the mind, the  
obsess iveness of the mind , the contraction of attention , 
the fear that might be there.  There  are many  ways  in 
which  holding on  can function . And you begin to feel the 
cost – the texture – of clinging, holding on, grasping , 
resisting.  Then when you do let go, you can feel how 
good it is for that to go away , “Ah! I'm not grasping any 
more.  That feels good.  A little bit of joy.  Nice feelings.  
I'm not so tight anymore.  Not fighting something so 
much anymore. ”  
It is good to know about the thing you are grasping , and 
to have some wisdom about it.  How grasping is not 
really healthy for you or for other people.  If it is just a 
policy  that it’s good to let go and be a card carrying 
Buddhist , then  just let go and perhaps there will be  
limited wisdom.  Without wisdom, l etting go can be 
dangerous.  
 
Some people have to take time to get to know what it is 
that is going on.  What are you holding on to , or are 
attached to?  What is the nature of the attachment ? How 
are you attached?  Can you understand it better?  
 
Some things we must let go of are healthy.  How do you 
feel about letting go of healthy things?  In this society 
many people have  a lot of choice , a lot of options.  We 
probably have more choices in what we do , or buy, or 
the activities we participate in than most  people in 
human history.  A lot of these are good things to do.  You 
can volunteer ; you can exercise ; you can eat healthily, 
and read spiritual books, and meditate, and spend time 
with friends, and come to IMC... The list goes on and on  
– all these great th ings you can do.  But a mature life 
realizes it is not healthy if you do all of them.  So 
sometimes you have to let go even of good things.  Be 
wise about it.  Realize that by doing all these things , you 
are growing thin and exhausting yourself.  There needs 
to be  wisdom about it.  OK, I have got to do less.  One more dharma activity is not healthy. Is not dharmic.  We 
must let go a little bit.   
 
In the letting go d o we feel our betterment ? Is it better 
for me, or better for the others I am with?  Is there some 
appreciation for the value of it?   
 
Letting go is not a good thing to do just as a policy. It 
needs to have wisdom as part of it.  Part of the wisdom I 
would suggest to you – the little protec tion for it all – is 
to pay attention and look for joy.  Are you lighter?  Are 
your days a little easier?  If there some  ease that comes 
from letting go , then it is more likely to serve you well.  If 
you don't feel a t iny bit of joy in letting go , watch out ! 
You probably have not let go . You only think you have , 
but you haven't really . 
 
Those are my thoughts today.
