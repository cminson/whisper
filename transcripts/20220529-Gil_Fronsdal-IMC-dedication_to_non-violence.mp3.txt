The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I'm thinking about how there are two sources within us for how we act in the world,
how we react in the world, respond in the world.
And one is more, what I consider more on the surface, and one is from our depths, some place deep inside.
And the surface, I associate with responding, reacting to the world.
When the events of the world come to us and it meets our fear,
or our anger, or despair, or hopelessness, or greed,
and all those things I think of more surface, partly because they usually involve a lot of thinking,
imagination of ideas and desires, and they also are a more activated state.
The depth within us is to allow something deeper inside of us to respond, to be touched by the world,
that is deeper than whatever fear, despair, anger we might have.
Maybe when those things, fear and anger, despair have settled and quieted, greed has settled away,
enough so that we feel a sense of satisfaction and warmth and pleasure and happiness in life,
in a deeper way, without needing the world to be a certain way, where we feel at ease and feel at home in a deep way.
And so there's a different sensitivity in which we receive the world, the difficulties,
that other things, I think deeper inside and maybe easily eclipsed by the surface, can emerge.
And rather than reacting, we respond, rather than reacting, something emerges from the heart,
emerges from deeper, deeper inside, that where we feel our shared humanity,
where we can feel and see other people for their humanity,
that's very hard to see if we're reacting from the surface, if we're seeing through the fear,
through hate, through greed, through despair, through a sense of hopelessness, helplessness.
And so to be able to kind of cap into some deeper place within is a hugely important part of meditation, Buddhist practice.
And some of the guidelines for how to live a life that the Buddha gives make a lot of sense,
or it resonates much deeper inside of us in touch with this depth inside of us.
So one of the guidelines, one of the kind of precepts of Buddhism, one of the, maybe the first precept, is not to kill.
And the kind of primary principle associated to that, and the principle that underlies all the Buddhism, I believe,
is not to harm, the principle of non-harming, living a life of non-harming.
And I want to talk about this a little bit today because of recent events.
And it seems like two weeks ago we had this horrific shooting in Buffalo,
in a market called Tom's Friendly Market.
And ten black Americans were shot just shopping.
And that was the motivation for the talk last week on hate.
It was a hate crime.
And then just five days ago we had this horrendous, another horrendous shooting of children,
19 children and others were killed in Texas.
And, you know, we've had a lot of shootings, school shootings in this country.
And so what happens when these kinds of events are allowed to touch something deep inside?
Is there a place that's deeper than anger, deeper than fear, deeper than despair, deeper than,
is there someplace deeper, not to dismiss those reactions and those responses because they're so human, so much of how people respond to things.
But what happens, do we have access to someplace deeper?
And I think that's the call, one of the calls of Buddhist practice.
Because of the first precept and this first principle of not killing and not harming,
the call of Buddhists is to see how can we come from that place?
How can we be dedicated and committed to non-harming in a radical way, in a thorough way?
How can we be champions of not killing, not just not killing ourselves?
Because the Buddha also talked that, or encouraged, more than just not harming, not killing,
but advocating for others not to kill as well, or inspiring others not to kill,
to cultivate maybe a culture of not killing.
And so how do we change this tremendous momentum of a culture that has so much momentum in violence, in killing?
After the killings in Texas, there was in the news reports that the manufacturer of the gun that was used,
a company called Daniel Defense, they had an advertisement, which I then found on their website,
you can't see the face, but clearly a young child, my guess is four or five years old,
with a semi-automatic rifle on his lap, and you know, just resting there,
and he has a t-shirt that says a rascal on it that seems to diminish, or kind of make light of,
or kind of suggest something very different about what it means to own or possess a semi-automatic rifle.
But then even more remarkable is the statement that goes along with the advertisement,
train up a child in the way he should go, train up a child in the way he should go,
and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
Start them early with semi-automatic rifles.
So here's a company, a business, trying to promote the sale of their rifles.
So this is not, I don't know if they're operating out of some kind of strange idea of compassion for our society,
but it seems to me like they're operating under wanting to make business, wanting to sell,
and trying to hook people in, and so the momentum of some of the economic forces in the society
that's advertising a culture of violence.
How do we do something different? Where does that come from?
So in the description of the first precept, the kind of the little bit longer description of it,
one abstains from killing, one lays down weapons and swords,
modest, compassionate, dwelling with care for the welfare of all beings.
So it isn't just killing, there's more that's involved, much more that's involved,
and these are beautiful qualities.
I'm inspired by some people who put down their weapons, throw them away.
For me, that creates a different culture.
A culture of people who are not going to succumb to fear, greed, or conceit, or arrogance.
And one of the worst ways I think of responding to the violence in the world
is to allow the fear that it delicits to get the upper hand
in such a way that we go out and buy another gun.
Then we just kind of perpetuate more.
There is a story from Japan, a historical event.
Maybe it's slightly interpretive the way I'm going to present it to you.
But somewhere, I don't know when, in the fifth, sixth century in Japan,
there were in the valley that's surrounded by mountains that's now Kyoto.
They were building Buddhist temples and there was a capital.
And there was this idea that evil spirits, forces,
would be coming out of the northeast corner of that valley down the mountains
and somehow come and harm the capital.
So to protect the capital, they built a Buddhist temple up there in the northeast.
And they would do rituals and practices and somehow have the dharmic protection.
And that monastery grew and developed to be one of the biggest monasteries in Japan
over the centuries.
At some point, it became so big, it became like, I'm going to go,
probably also like a landlord, you know, like a big estate.
And they had some kind of monks, I don't know exactly what kind of monks they were,
who were soldiers.
And at some point, that was the evil force that came out of the northeast
down to Kyoto to attack Kyoto, to take over.
So it was a self-fulfilling prophecy that there's danger, let's protect us,
and let's have monks up there who can arm themselves and be soldiers.
And it became so powerful that that came around.
So it's a kind of, you know, I don't know if we want to take too much of a lesson from that,
but it's certainly an example of sometimes living with fear and kind of in a reactive mode
can elicit the very thing that we're trying to avoid.
A more contemporary statement of this is saying,
what I'm trying to say here today is from Martin Luther King.
The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral,
beginning the very thing it seeks to destroy.
Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it.
Through violence, you murder the hater, but you do not murder hate.
In fact, violence merely increases hate.
Returning violence for violence multiplies violence,
adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.
Only light can do that.
Hate cannot drive out hate.
Only love can do that.
So I don't know, you know, there's all kinds of things being said now
and almost every time there's some mass shooting like this,
many of the same things get said about what should happen
and analysis of our culture and our society.
It's kind of very sad to kind of think that here we're saying the same thing over.
The repetition of this is kind of phenomenal.
So I don't want to repeat some of the cultural ideas,
societal ideas that are so common, they said.
But I do feel inspired to evoke the importance of non-harming
and not killing in a Buddhist life.
And that learning how to do this in a wise way,
learning how to do this so that we can protect ourselves better that way
than we can through violence.
It's not an obvious and easy thing to naively say,
you know, we should be non-violent.
When there are dangers in this world, it doesn't work.
But are there ways, resources that we can do to prepare ourselves
and have other responses that come out of our compassion
that help us be safe, help us live well,
help us not perpetuate fear, not perpetuate despair,
or a sense of hopelessness with all this?
And one of the reasons why to do this
is to radiate from ourselves, hopefully, a cultural change.
So much of what's this, you know, the roots of violence in this country,
as we see, some of it comes from hate,
some of it, like with this last one in the school shooting in Texas,
this 18-year-old who committed this horrendous killings,
he was bullied.
Apparently he had a stutter and a lisp, other things,
and he had a mother who was a drug addict,
and probably had a very difficult life.
You know, bullying is horrible.
Especially if you're already at home,
you've had a difficult life and no place to refuge.
So the movements of bullying is not something to be taken lightly.
I've had parents that tell me that they went to the school
to try to deal with the bullying of their child at school,
and the principals were not that interested in doing anything.
You know, we have to respond, but how do we respond kindly?
What happens, we've had correctional systems that put people in jail,
and they become worse in jail than they were before they went in,
because of how terribly and disrespectfully they're treated.
We don't call it bullying by the guards,
the guards can treat people horrendously.
I met a man when I was in San Quentin,
who had spent 24 years in solitary confinement.
Can you believe that that's possible in California,
in a state prison, 24 years?
And so, you know, to perpetuate in the very system
that's supposed to be a correctional system,
doesn't correct, it makes things worse.
So to...
But what do we do?
And what we do as Buddhists, among the many things you can do,
but it's to really appreciate and find a way to love,
certainly others, but love non-violence,
love not causing harm,
love it because it protects you,
it protects the best that's in you,
that protects something that's wonderful and beautiful and rich
and satisfying and worth coming from,
a way that provides a meaningful life
that doesn't depend on things which are relatively superficial,
but comes in like from a heart that's full and satisfied
or delighted and rich,
to do this practice not just to restrain from love,
restrain from killing,
but as the rest of the teaching goes,
to be certain kind of modesty,
not clear exactly what that is,
but some kind of modesty, compassion and care for the welfare of everyone.
It's interesting that the Buddhas presented kind of an analysis
of how rulers can care for people.
It's an ancient myth that the Buddha kind of maybe he invented it,
he composed it,
but it involved the decay of society when the rulers do not care for everyone equally.
And this is such an important idea that everyone should be treated equally,
everyone should be given the same opportunities,
it's the role of the government to make sure that happens.
And the way that this myth goes is that
there were a whole series of kings,
hereditary kings who were born and ruled for many years,
and the custom was they would always go when they first became king
and get advice from wise people, from wise religious people and others.
And the teachings that they received was to live by the Dharma.
And one of the ways that the Dharma means outside of Buddhism,
which is the meaning here,
is to live to rule justly, to rule fairly,
which I interpret to mean treating everyone equally,
giving everyone equal opportunities,
which is still not the case in this country.
And the passage goes like this.
So these wise people will tell the king,
yourself depending on the Dharma,
honoring it, revering it, cherishing it,
and doing homage to it and venerating it,
have Dharma as your badge and banner,
acknowledging the Dharma as your master,
you should establish, guard, ward, and protect everyone,
your household, your troops, your people.
Everyone was a long list, including animals and birds.
The first task of the rulers is to protect everyone.
But this thing about the Dharma, in this context,
it doesn't mean Buddhism,
but it means kind of a natural law, it means justice,
it means fairness, it means fairness.
And so the king is supposed to rule based on Dharma,
not on their own wishes, their own desires.
You'll see this becomes important later.
Let no nondharma prevail in your kingdom.
Nondharma means injustice here,
in all the different ways that can mean.
Let no injustice prevail in your kingdom,
and to those who have nothing, provide them.
For those who don't have anything, provide for them.
Provide for them property,
probably so that they can take care of themselves.
And whatever religious people there are in your kingdom,
who have renounced the life of sensual infatuation,
and are devoted to forbearance and gentleness,
each one taming themselves,
each one calming themselves,
and each one striving to the end of craving,
if from time to time they should come to you,
and consult you as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome.
Now there was take advice from some of the people
who do a lot of practice and have a whole different set of values.
Don't consult with the people who manufacture assault rifles.
Consult with the Dalai Lama.
And who can teach you those things that will in the long run
lead to welfare and happiness, not to harm and sorrow.
You should listen to them.
So this is the advice that king got,
and so for many generations that's what they did,
until one king kind of forgot to do that,
forgot to consult with when he first became king.
But finally the ministers came and got him and said,
you have to listen to this.
So he heard this advice,
and so he did set up to guard and protect others.
However, he did not care for the people who are in need.
The people who had no property
and did it in a way of taking care of themselves,
he didn't provide them with property so they could.
And as a result, poverty became rife.
With the spread of poverty, a person took what was not given,
thus committing what was called theft.
The king arrested them, the person,
and after a short trial,
the person admitted to having stolen,
the king gave him some property.
Here, take care of yourself and your family this way.
But the other people who were poor,
thought, wow, that's all I have to do is steal,
and then I'll get...
So there's stealing began.
And the king very quickly said, wait a minute,
this doesn't work, the people keep stealing.
So instead he killed them and punished them.
And with punishment like that,
then the people took up weapons themselves.
And with weapons themselves,
they started killing each other and other people.
And so violence spread through the realm.
And things society deteriorated dramatically.
So this is a kind of a mythic story of origin.
But the origin here, the mythic story begins.
That decay of society begins
when those who are ruling
are not treating everyone equally,
not giving everyone equal opportunity through property
and something to live and have a successful life.
And so people become poor.
And of course, when they're starving, they steal.
And when they steal, then it's of course that you...
It sounds like it began with a good idea
to give them something.
But it was already too late.
And it set up a very strange dynamic
where other people started to steal
than violence and all that.
So the spiral of violence,
violence begets violence, as Martin Luther King said.
Non-violence, does it beget non-violence?
Non-harming, does it beget non-harming?
I'm sure you could find situations where that's not the case.
I'm sure you can find examples of where violence does not beget violence.
But the tendency is that non-violence begets non-violence.
That non-violence comes from the steeper place inside,
not from fear.
Non-violence out of fear doesn't really work either.
But can we find a place within?
Can we clarify our hearts enough
so that we're in touch with something that's an inner wealth,
an inner place of peace and satisfaction and inspiration?
Where we feel we've resolved our wounds,
resolved our conflicts, resolved our fears and despairs,
it's possible to resolve them, it's possible to settle.
We should not succumb to the belief
that how we see the world through fear,
how we see the world through despair and anger,
how we see the world through greed,
or hatred gives us an accurate view of what the world is like.
It doesn't.
So if we think that it's accurate,
then we will only perpetuate that very view.
It supports that view, strengthens it, but it's not accurate.
Does the view of the world through love and compassion
set a more accurate view?
It doesn't have to be.
That has its own problems sometimes,
especially if it's enforced like a surface thing,
like I'm supposed to do this.
Where I think it really makes a huge difference
is doing something like meditation
that allows all the shoulds and all the...
even like a lot of the structures of our thinking
to get quiet and peaceful,
to resolve the challenges of our hearts,
to get quiet in the heart, or peaceful in the heart,
so that when we encounter the world,
we're encountering it from this place inside,
where something resonates, something different can happen.
I don't know all the different ways we'll respond from the heart,
but it'll be much healthier than responding from the surface,
the reactive way.
And so this to be inspired
by the horrendous things that go on in our society,
to change society, to find ways to promote
non-harming in our society
is one of the great tasks of a life.
But before we can do that, I think,
to really do the work in ourselves,
to find a way to be an exemplar
of a life that's motivated by non-fear,
by non-hatred, by non-despair,
non-greed,
so that the most wondrous qualities of our heart
have a chance to be shared in the world that we live in.
It's heartbreaking to have all this hatred and despair
and anger and violence that goes on in this country.
But in that heartbreak, don't despair.
Use it as a powerful catalyst, encouragement
to do your work, to do your practice,
to resolve the issues of your heart
so that your heart can come forth
in beautiful response to what this world needs
in a response that's clearly and obviously one
that never will harm anyone.
Let's live in a world where non-harming
is understood to be one of the greatest gifts
we can give.
So thank you.
