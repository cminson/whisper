 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Is your time zone welcome to all lines of latitude and longitude? It's nice to see a lot of familiar names. Welcome to all of you. So, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Opening and settling your body with your breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Just having some sense of intention maybe even. We say, Val. That for this time, the awareness is prioritized over the details of our life. Committing to awareness rather than optimizing the moment, solving the riddle of our life, finding a more direct way to pleasure and more efficient escape from pain. Actually renouncing those agendas for this time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What would we do with the moment if we didn't have to do our life? What would we do with our lives? Maybe we would just rest and look. What would we do with our lives? What would we do with our lives? What would we do with our lives? We're often subtly imaging the outline of our body, imaging the space of the room, keeping track of self and other, me, not me. It's a very innocent impulse of the mind and we can soften. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We keep updating our autobiography. Keep adding senses and paragraphs, chapters to this story of me. In the words we speak to ourselves, these two can be known in awareness, can be known as empty. And so the subtle visual image we have of our self and the narrative of self, all of this can be safely surrendered to awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The urgent energies in the body, just meet those with patience, love. Let them drain right down into the center of the earth. Begin to, we begin to feel a little less confined in self, little less busy with the tasks and duties, the demands of I am this. Space starts to run through us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We don't have to figure out what this moment is good for. How we'll use it. We just surrender to awareness. You you you you
