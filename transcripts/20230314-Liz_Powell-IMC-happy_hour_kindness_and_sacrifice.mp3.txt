 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, good evening. Since the last time I was with you, I noticed that I was reflecting further on one part of what bikubodi, the bikubodi quote that I shared with you last time. And the way I was reflecting on it is I was wondering, is this really true in my experience, which is, you know, a useful thing to do with teaching sometimes. So I'll read the section of the quote that I was sitting with. That's where bikubodi wrote, Only if you've been kind to another person will you accept the idea that others could be kind to you. At the same time, if you've been kind to another person, you know the effort involved. Kind impulses often have to do battle with unkind impulses in the heart, so it's not always easy to be helpful. Sometimes it involves great sacrifice, a sacrifice possible only when you trust the recipient to make good use of your help. So when you're on the receiving end of a sacrifice like that, you realize you've incurred a debt, an obligation to repay the other person's trust. So, you know, sometimes some things land in such a way that I find myself questioning every sentence, you know, and saying, did have I experienced that? Did that, is that really true for me? And I can imagine some here would agree with all these statements or some might wonder about some of them and wonder if they were true. But I thought it would be interesting to take each of these statements in a positive way and explore them as experiences through which we can cultivate more kindness. So with that, I'll offer a guided meditation and reflection time for us this evening, and we'll see how that lands with folks. So we'll plunge right into the meditation, finding a sustainable way of sitting or lying down or standing, whichever posture you use, some way that's relatively comfortable for the body and helpful to your level of alertness. Attuning to the body just as it is right now with kindness, whatever that might be for you in your situation. Receiving whatever states of mind and heart are present, whatever mental state is here, and receiving it with some friendliness, whatever it is. Knowing pleasant states and unpleasant states and states that don't feel either pleasant or unpleasant, but taking it all in with some care. Care for yourself. Awareness can receive, allow, and acknowledge whatever it is that arises. This is a form of kindness. There are no good or bad states. If we can treat them all as simply information about what we're experiencing in this moment. You and if and when you're ready, perhaps recalling a time today or in the past when you were kind to another person. It could be have been something big, even life changing or seemingly very small. Simply listening to what another person has to say is a kindness. Smiling at a clerk in a store can be a kindness. Caregiving for others in our lives is a kindness. Preparing a meal for someone. It can be very everyday, simply appreciated as a kindness. Perhaps a single act of kindness is present for you right now or there may be a number of times you were kind that are springing to mind. Letting a moment of kindness or moments fill your mind and heart in whatever way that they do. It could be as a quiet recognition, a kind of contentment, could be a good feeling, an appreciative thought. Whatever way this comes in for you, really allow that, give it time. Perhaps whispering a wish quietly in the mind or simply continuing with the feeling this present in the heart, mind and silence. But for those for whom phrases are useful, perhaps inclining the mind towards may acts of kindness continue to arise. May I appreciate kindness in all the forms it takes. May kindness help lead me to more and more freedom from stress, dissatisfaction. You could continue repeating these kinds of phrases or invent your own or simply feel a sit with the memories, the feeling in the heart, the feeling in the mind, allowing it, allowing whatever is rising, recognizing it and perhaps feeling some ease around whatever it is or softening around whatever it is. And if a feeling arises that you'd like to send these feelings of kindness towards someone in your life, allowing the heart to radiate kindness to that person, kind wishes, whether that person is you or someone else. Thank you. Perhaps recognizing acts of kindness that you've offered or received that did involve some sacrifice. Perhaps knowing that in some cases it was hard to give kindness, appreciating that you still offered it or that it was offered to you. Maybe when you weren't at your best or you offered it when someone else was having a hard time and it wasn't pretty. Appreciating that you or the other person who offered a kindness perhaps gave something up either willingly or with difficulty. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Perhaps noticing when some kindness didn't even feel like a sacrifice, even though you gave something valuable of yourself to someone else or how someone else gave to you so freely. Thank you. Is not allowing any words or images evoked by the experience or experiences to fill your heart mind? Perhaps offering some appreciation quietly in the mind. May I appreciate that sacrifice or that offering. May I feel the kindness in it. May that offering or sacrifice bring more care and kindness between us, allowing it to grow. Considering whether or how a kindness may have placed you and another person in one another's debt. If there is such a thing, may we repay that debt by cultivating kindness in this life. May we spread kindness to others in this world from what we've been given. Not allowing yourself to continue letting these images of how kindness flows and grows to continue to fill your heart and mind and radiating that kindness out to others around you. As we continue in silence. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And in the final moments of this meditation, may from all the kindness we've received, small kindnesses, large kindnesses. May we spread kindness together in this world. May all beings experience kindness. May kindness bring more freedom to each heart, each life. May all beings experience kindness. May all beings experience kindness. I found it really fascinating the way it opened my heart in different ways. And it struck me that loving kindness or Metta practice can be done in so many different ways. You know, it can serve as a form of settling the mind, returning to the same person to whom we're sending Metta again and again for each person. It can be a reflective practice or a form of contemplation as we just did where we allow ourselves to recollect some of the qualities or some of the memories of loving kindness and extend appreciation to ourselves and others for it as we've done a bit. And interestingly from that, more wholesome qualities can come into the heart or it can show us where some difficulties have occurred. And that's precious as well, being aware of difficulty. So I'm just struck by how much this can be a joy in daily life practice. You know, we can silently send wishes of kindness to people we encounter. We can do acts of kindness. But just the breadth or the different ways we can practice with it develops the heart, cultivates good qualities. And I was just appreciating it. So with that, we do have time to reflect or share in small groups whatever your experience is with practice today, whatever came up for you. And as always in these groups, what we do is perhaps each person just shares one thing at a time and then listens very carefully to what others are sharing with an open heart and without commentary, without advice giving. Just this process of exchange. So with that, I'll send everybody to breakout groups for about nine minutes. I'm just trying to adjust the quantity of rooms here. Keep pace with what's going on. So enjoy your 10 minutes together. Thank you. Thank you.
