 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning, good day everyone. And here to continue this story of the Dharma, Dharma practice. And I would like to begin with a very short story from the, also from the suttas, the ancient teachings. And it's a little bit, maybe it's just paraphrased, slightly maybe idealized. But it's often told this way that the Buddha had a challenger. A challenger was called Mara. And Mara is somewhat of a mythic figure that sometimes he's translated into English as the evil one. A little bit devilish person, but a little bit kind of a cross between a devil and a trickster, maybe. There's no records in the suttas of him doing what we would call evil deeds. However, one of us, he has two primary things that he seems to do. He's kind of a half god kind of mythic being. And that is, he really, he's kind of like the king of the world of sensuality. And so he just wants people to be lost in sensual addictions. So he's the tempter. And the last thing he wants is someone to become free of the temptations of the sensual world we live in. And for someone to do this practice and become awake, then they become free. And so the Buddha, in the night of his enlightenment, was going to set himself free, but setting the stage to free many other people from addiction to the sensual world, to sensuality. And so he attacked the Buddha. The Buddha, this image on the statue is related to the story of being attacked by Mara. The Buddha was enlightened. But then after he was enlightened, Mara would still come and try to challenge the Buddha. And if this mythic figure is really a projection of inner psychological forces that we have, then after he was enlightened, the Buddha still had some temptations. But it isn't that the issue. The issue as a Buddha is how he responds to that. So in the stories, Mara will come to the enlightened Buddha. And each time Mara comes, all the Buddha does is say, Mara, I see you. And as soon as the Buddha says that, Mara runs away, exclaiming, I've been seen, I've been seen, or something, and disappears. And so this freedom, this is a story of freedom, a story of release, release from addiction, release from craving, release from temptations, and whatever comes our way. And this powerful teaching, or pointing this powerful idea or fact, that clearly seeing, directly, looking directly and seeing what is happening in our minds, that's desire, that's addiction, that's hatred, that's confusion. Something very powerful about admitting it, the truth telling of it, and seeing I see you. And there's an emphatic, Mara, I see you. We might know that we have attachments and desires, but to say there's an attachment, I see you, that emphasis, that clarity, not aggressively, not to make it go away, that Buddha's not trying to make Mara go away, he's just saying, I see you and I'm free of you. I'm free, I'm not caught in your spell. So that's a story that brings release, a story that points to how we can release ourselves. And with the clarity of seeing, really seeing, really being honest, truthful, I think sometimes that mindfulness is honesty to ourselves. Just really be present, this is what's going on. And in that, finding our freedom, in that honesty, that clear seeing. So we will, maybe Mara will visit one or two of us during this meditation, and if that's the case, you might say, I see you and see what happens. So meditating in the meditation posture, and you might take a posture that is stable enough, strong enough, confident enough to withstand the onslaught of Mara and Mara's armies, just like the Buddha did at Night of His Awakening, to really take time to find stability in the posture. And if you have any strength available, to sit in such a way that some of, a little bit of that strength, physical strength of your torso, your chest, maybe your neck, a little bit of is activated. Not so much that you get tired, but so you, just enough so you know that you're sitting here, strong and ready for, ready to wake up, to be honest with whatever comes. To lower your gaze, and see with the lowered gaze, if you can soften your gaze, relax the eyesight. If it's comfortable to gently close your eyes, and to approach the next couple of minutes with gentleness, maybe even tenderness, as you gently take a few long, slow, deep breaths, as a ritual of showing up here, and now, this is the place to wake up in this body, this place, this time. Relaxing on the exhale. Gently letting your breathing return to normal. And if it is easy enough, let there be a gentleness in your breathing. And if it's not easy, don't bother. Breathe as you do. And gently, whatever agitation there might be in the thinking mind, pressure, constriction, as you exhale, relax the thinking mind. Maybe with an image of the mind spreading wide, like a wide, calm lake. And then settling into the lake, into the bottom of the lake, in the torso breathing. Noticing how the inhale is experienced differently than the exhale. And as you sit here this morning, in whatever way the mind wanders off in thought, whatever way you get involved in discursive thoughts and desires and fears, resentments, be honest about it. Truth telling, I see you. This is what the mind is doing. I see it. And perhaps in that very clear honest seeing, it's easier to settle back to just being here, free, a little freer, the mind's preoccupations. Having a meditation with life there's a train Toyo Usually spare. For this meditation, don't succumb to the unconscious belief that you have to think what you're thinking. Instead see it. You might even say to yourself, I see you. I see that which gets tempted and pulled into this world of thoughts. Gently say it. Maybe even lovingly. But say it clearly so there can be a bit of freedom. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. Gently say it. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, to appreciate, to reflect on the idea that if we are free, spiritually free, psychologically free, that we will not assert ourselves onto others, will not push ourselves aggressively. And if we're free, there's no inner forces compelling us to withdraw or close down. Rather we can be in the middle of this world of ours, seeing it. I see you. I see whatever it is. And then being in the middle, non-assertive and not pulling away. This is a opportunity for love, for kindness, for heartfulness in our connections to others and to ourselves. It's not possible if we assert or pull away. May our ability to appreciate our capacity to be present honestly, clearly. Give us the possibility of acting in the world kindly, caring with friendship, with warm heartedness, even if it's just in small ways that others cannot perceive. May this practice that we do help us to live with a natural warmth. May all beings be happier with our goodwill. May all beings be safer as we live with goodwill. May all beings be more peaceful as we live with goodwill. And may all beings be free when we live with goodwill. Thank you.
