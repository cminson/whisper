The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Yeah, welcome again and it's lovely to be here with all of you and another happy hour.
Also welcome if there's new people, of course.
Really nice song that is so feel welcomed.
Yeah, great. Thank you, Jamie. Welcome also.
And yeah, today I was thinking of reading a poem that I came across.
And the poem is by poet and teacher, Kavari Patel.
And the poem is called New and Deeper Truth and goes like this.
The old truth made you run a thousand miles inside an arid desert, desperate for an oasis.
Sit and close your eyes, inhale the breeze of kindness, exhale the toxic judgments, dehydrating you like a prune.
Feel the pain of old patterns trapped in tense muscles.
It's okay to cry, to taste the salt of possibility.
Just be, just breathe, let waves break against the silence, returning you to a new and deeper truth.
So maybe today you can sit together and inhale the breeze of kindness
and exhale the toxic judgments.
Or maybe it's okay to feel the pain of old patterns and to cry, to taste the salt of possibility.
We can just sit together and breathe, just breathe, letting the waves break against the silence and returning to a newer and deeper truth.
So with that, I thought we can start our meditation for tonight.
So let's settle into our posture.
And in the spirit of kindness, we can have a posture that feels comfortable and that is relaxing for the body.
We don't always have to have a perfect posture for the meditation.
Sometimes it's okay to also be kind to our bodies in that regard.
If you want to sit on a couch or lay down on the floor, whatever feels comfortable for you right now.
And then we can tune into the body.
Feeling the body in its posture, sitting, laying down.
Take a moment to relax the body.
Again, direct our attention to our head.
Starting with the forehead, relaxing the muscles as far as possible right now.
Relaxing the little muscles around the eyes.
Relaxing the jaw.
The head, the whole head.
Going down to the throat, the neck, shoulders.
Just a gentle invitation to relax a little bit more or as far as possible.
Arms and hands.
Just the upper back.
Belly in the lower back.
Pelvic area.
May all the muscles relax.
As far as possible.
Upper legs.
Knees.
Lower legs.
Ankles.
Feet.
Feel the feet on the surface.
Touching contact right there, the feet with the surface.
And then make sure your attention on the breath.
We can inhale the breeze of kindness.
Exhale the toxic judgments.
Breathing in and breathing out.
Breathing in and breathing out.
Breathing in and breathing out.
Maybe we can be kind towards ourselves.
Towards the old patterns.
Maybe we can breathe out the judgments and the patterns with kindness.
Trying to serve us.
Trying to do something for us.
Even if it's not so skillful, not so helpful.
Maybe we can be a little bit kinder towards these judgments and patterns.
Maybe we can be kinder towards ourselves.
Maybe we can be kinder towards ourselves.
Maybe we can be kinder towards ourselves.
Maybe we can be kinder towards ourselves.
Maybe we can be kinder towards ourselves.
Thank you.

And then we can expand it to all beings everywhere, maybe we can permeate all beings everywhere
with kindness for the beautiful and the difficult parts of every being, may all beings be well.
Very good.
We have some time for reflections, questions, comments,
to unmute yourself or put something in the chat.
Elaine writes, I really like the way you incorporated the poetry with your teaching.
May all beings be transformed by the power of kindness, yeah, that would be really nice.
Ah, done, good.
Yeah, thank you so much. It's been really challenging for me to meditate,
and I'm not sure why, but I really, at one point you said just breathe,
and there's very simple instructions like, okay, I can do that, so thank you.
Yeah, thanks for sharing, yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, Trudy, yeah, are you raising your hand? Thank you, I am particularly
profited from the exhaling toxic judgments. It was a very appropriate and a good look at myself,
so thank you so much. Yeah, that's wonderful, thank you Trudy.
I see some comments coming into the chat as well.
Eileen says, sometimes when I do meta-practice, suddenly anger comes up.
Yeah, that does happen, you know, Guy Armstrong, for example, I heard him say that
the meta-heart is like a magnet, it will attract everything that's not in alignment with it yet.
So if we practice meta-kindness, then yeah, all sorts of things can come up that are difficult,
that are not yet in alignment, and it's actually a purification practice. So if we do meta-practice,
then we purify our hearts of these kind of things like anger. So it's actually a good sign,
it's a sign of purification. And sometimes when it gets too much, we can always do something else,
like only pay attention to the breath, for example, or start just V-pass and mindfulness practice,
for example. You says, could you expound on return to a deeper truth?
Yeah, sometimes when we, how I interpret the poem, my way of interpreting the poem,
if returning to a deeper truth, is that when we open to painfulness, we can start to
transform it, and in that way come to a deeper truth, and a deeper understanding of our own
hearts and mind. So that's how I see it. Christine says, I like the image of the waves of the mind
breaking on the piece of the heart. Yeah, that's beautiful. And Faisal, how do you get meditation
to help you break bad habits, develop good habits, and improve in different aspects of daily life?
Wow, that's a question that I've given whole Dharma talks on.
A very short answer before we go to the breakout groups would be
that if we develop mindfulness, so the quality of knowing what's happening in the present moment,
then we start to see these patterns and habits. That's the first step. We need to know and see them.
And then what can happen is that our mind starts to learn from seeing all these things that are not
so helpful in our minds and hearts, all these patterns and habits. And it starts to see how
painful it is, for example. And once we see the painfulness, the mind sometimes just starts to
let go. So sometimes we need to see the painfulness like over and over and over again, like 100,000
times. But at some point, especially when we have the intention to learn from the painfulness,
and from everything, also the beautiful aspects. And at some point, the mind can let go.
So intention is also important in that regard. I hope that helps a little bit.
There's much more to say about it, but this is a short version. So we'll go to the
breakout groups and then there will be a few minutes left for some more reflection after that as well.
So welcome back. We do have a few minutes before it's seven, so we can
share some more reflections or comments or questions.
And I was also thinking maybe other people have another idea of the deeper truth,
new truths, what that means. But feel free to comment on anything you feel like.
Amy. Hello. Maybe I just comment quickly that this is my first time to this group on
live Zoom. And I just want to thank everyone. This has been really, really, really amazing.
And I want to thank the two people that I got to spend a little time with in the breakout room.
That was a really wonderful experience. Thank you so much.
Great. Good to hear, Amy. Wonderful. Yeah.
Yeah, this whole week there's all guest teachers. I don't know, maybe you know.
And normally Diana Clark and Nikki Megafory give this class. So next week they'll be back.
So you can experience them as well next week. Yeah, feel free. I don't know. Neil, there's also a
Google group. Maybe at some point he'll put that in the chat. Sometimes he puts it in the chat.
Yeah. So you can take a look there too if you're interested, of course.
So yeah, great. Oh, Gene, yeah. I was just thinking, and we talked a little bit in our small group,
like the idea of toxic judgments, I think. I'm just guessing normally you'd think that's
a person judging others. And we talked a little in our small group about
feeling bad about ourselves and feeling ourselves we're a burden, or thinking other people don't
like us, or think we're a burden. And so it was a little inverted. But yeah, just tell us that.
Yeah. That's a very interesting point. It's common for us to judge ourselves and be afraid of
other people's judgments. Yeah, there's a lot of that, that we internalize actually. So it's,
this comment about toxic judgments is, in all ways, I guess, but toxic judgments towards
ourselves, towards others, is being afraid of other people's judgments. Yeah. Thanks for sharing that.
Yeah. Well, we're at seven. So at least in the Pacific time, maybe some of you are somewhere else.
Thank you all for joining. I really enjoyed it. And yeah, feel free to say goodbye and
