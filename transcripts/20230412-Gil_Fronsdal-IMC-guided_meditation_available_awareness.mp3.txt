Hello and greetings from Insight Retreat Center. And I feel kind of
delighted to be here with you today and being here in this room. So thank you
for being here. And so in doing mindfulness practice, one of the simple
ways of describing it is that we are recognizing what's happening in the
moment as it's happening. And there are two general ways that maybe people can
approach this recognition in the present moment, being aware of the present
moment. One is to see things as they are, where how they are is a is a
conclusion. So when we're mindful, we're concluding something, this is what's
happening. So if we're mindful of the breathing, say we're mindful of the
in-breath, the recognition of the in-breath is kind of like the end of
the story, like breathing in and then, you know, breathing out and that's the
end of the story. Or you hear a sound, the recognition, the sound is the
recognition of that brief event through the sound and I recognize it. Even the
sound might go on, but it's kind of like the recognition is a conclusion or is
a thing in itself that's has recognized what has just happened. The
other way of doing it is not to be aware of things as they are, but be aware of
things as they are occurring, things as they are becoming. And so there, now
mindfulness is not a conclusion, but rather it's a beginning. And so to be
aware of a sound, it's kind of like you're in maybe if you use mental noting
or something, you know, quiet or quieter, where there's a decision to then turn
your attention to feet. You're not just recognizing the sound, but it's kind of
like you're making yourself available to experience it as it's occurring. If
you're recognizing breathing, the mindfulness of breathing is not a
conclusion about yes now I'm breathing, but rather is it's a beginning of the
experience of being available to no-feel experience breathing as it's
occurring. And if there's a brief sound, the recognition can still be that way.
So it's kind of like you're opening the door. Say you're in a in a stuffy room
and you open the door to the outside and it becomes a beautiful wonderful fresh
breeze coming in, and you just make yourself available for feeling that
fresh breeze. And so the idea is to always kind of use the mindfulness to
help you be available for the fullness of the experience as it's
occurring. And it might just be momentary, so being available for the in-breath,
breathing in, but then there's a kind of opening to that the very
recognition is a opening the door to be aware of the full inhale. Or if you
in the exhale be aware of the exhale to be aware really aware of it as it's
occurring, letting it register as it's occurring, the ongoing experience of it.
And if you get to the end of the exhale and that being available door being
open is still there, that spills over into being aware of that transition from
breathing out to breathing in. If you're thinking, it's useful to note that. Be
really clearly aware that you're thinking, but not as a conclusion, but as a
beginning of making yourself available to register, to feel, to experience, to know
what this is like. Even if the thinking stops, the particular thoughts you have,
they're still lingering, kind of, what's that lingering effect? And what's the
effect of being available? So you're also letting yourself be available to the
experience of being available. So things as they're occurring. So assuming a
meditation posture, and gently closing, closing your eyes,
and just checking in with yourself. If you are mindful at this moment, if you
open your awareness at this moment, what do you become aware of?
What is occurring within you?
And what would it be like to open yourself to experience what is occurring as an
ongoing event where the mindfulness is making ourselves available for the
occurring, to feel it, to know it, to be aware of it?
And then to do this with a breathing, and taking a gentle, long, deep inhale, and
exhale. Being available in your body, in your mind, to know, to experience the
full occurring of breathing in.
Being available to experience the full occurring of breathing out.
And letting your breathing return to normal.
And the inhale is a process. It takes a little bit of time, however short or long
it might be. In a relaxed, easy way. Open the door of awareness to let the
breeze of breathing come in. If something else is happening that you've become
aware of, open your awareness to register, to feel how that is occurring.
Mindfulness as a particular continuing action of opening to things as they
occur.
We're each moment of allowing, being available. Might be quite brief before
you open the door again.
For mindfulness to be an availability and opening to experience. It's important
that we're not crowded with thoughts and agendas and wants. Desires and thoughts,
agendas become quiet. So when we open the door of awareness, what we're mindful
of, can flow through it, whatever is occurring, is allowed to pass through for
however long awareness is open. And then we do it again.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
When awareness is an opening to experience as it's occurring, when we're allowing
something to register or be felt or known, there can be a subtle joy or pleasure
in the allowing. Even when the experience might be unpleasant,
it's the allowing the experience to be registered, allowing it to arise and flow
in awareness, however brief it is, can have a feeling of freedom, pleasure, joy
in the openness, in the allowing, in the feeling of being available to know and to feel.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
And then we open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in.
Putting aside what you want to have happen. Putting aside what you expect to have happen.
So that you can better be available for the next moment as it's occurring.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And then as we come to the end of this sitting,
if you're able to have a sense of this opening awareness to what's available
or to what's happening, to what's occurring, and availability,
and allowing of things to register to be felt.
And if that could be a light feeling, happy feeling, or some pleasure in that availability,
then maybe you can also do the same for opening to experience the suffering of others,
the challenges they have, or your own suffering, where oddly enough,
opening to be aware of it this way. There's a good feeling, a rightness,
a kind of subtle pleasure, or even joy, not in the suffering,
but in our wonderful capacity to be open to it,
to allow ourselves to feel it as it's occurring, lightly, calmly,
openly, opening to the suffering of the world.
Being available, enjoying the sense of availability
as it's occurring,
where there's no conclusions,
there's no fixed ideas, just a continual opening
to things as they are coming to be, things as they are occurring,
and being aware of others and their suffering,
the door of availability, that open door, can then be the door out of which our care and love
and goodwill flow, an open door for what comes in,
and an open door for what goes out,
an open door for breathing in, an open door for breathing out,
and on the exhale,
let the last words of these phrases
flow out of you into the world.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
Thank you.
