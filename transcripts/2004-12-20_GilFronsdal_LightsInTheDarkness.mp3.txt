 Thinking about this evening and giving a talk this evening, I was thinking about how close it is to solstice. This is kind of the darkest time of the year and it's kind of dark in here this evening. I mean that's good, we should turn it down even more. And I meant to bring a candle, I had a candle. What I'd like to do or try to do for you is to give you some thoughts I have about associations I have with this particular time of the year in Buddhism, Buddhist practice. For many cultures, the darkest time of the year is a time to celebrate light, light festivals. You go around the city, you see all these people have lights on their houses, they don't usually have. And some people have lights on their Christmas trees and have candles and Hanukkah is a candle celebration. They have celebrating light, dividing the light back, being reminded now things will start getting lighter again, opening up. There was a choice made, I don't know when, 200 years ago, to translate the Buddhist word bodhi by the English term enlightenment. Scholars had tended to pull their hair out, talking about what a terrible choice that was. Partly because enlightenment dissociations that 200 years ago when they plucked this word out of the English language was with the enlightenment period of European history and philosophy. Buddhism has nothing to do with that, so it's kind of a strange association. The word bodhi literally means awake, to be awakened. It has different associations than enlightenment. Sometimes when you have the idea of enlightenment as a point, some people have the idea of this light bulb going off in their head, like this great aha, this big bang theory of enlightenment, that the lights go off or on or something. Even though scholars sometimes feel a little bit off to chosen this word enlightenment, there certainly are references in Buddhism to light. I want to touch on a few of them. One of the more famous ones is the idea that each practitioner is to be a light unto him or herself, refuge unto him or herself. That somehow we can be our own light. Light can find our way in the darkness, that we can be our own inspiration, we can be our own source of awakening. One image in Buddhism is that of a dark room. As soon as you turn on a light in the room, the darkness vanishes or a single candle can kind of dispel a lot of the darkness in the room. To be our own light is to turn on or arouse something which casts clarity or casts a certain level of freedom or ease or peace onto what our experience is. When the Buddha said, be a light unto yourself, he was saying that you should be the source of finding this kind of peace. You should find within yourself the resources for bringing clarity, bringing peacefulness, bringing freedom to your own heart and to your own mind. That's somewhat different from religious traditions that look outside of oneself for inspiration, for refuge, for guidance, for what's sacred or something. In Buddhism, the focus is to look within. There's a contrast that's sometimes made between the beginning of the Old Testament, the Bible, and the beginning of the Buddhist canon, the Buddhist Bible. There's no beginning of Buddhist Bible. It doesn't have a clear beginning like it does in Christianity or Judaism. But the beginning of the Buddhist canon, if there is one, is sometimes attributed to the first verses of the Dhammapada. There it says, the mind is the forerunner of all things, forerunner of all experience. Our experience, our quality of our mind, things are led by mind, made by mind. The importance of the mind comes first and foremost in the Buddhist tradition. This stands quite in contrast to, for example, the Bible, where the opening verses or lines have to do with the importance of God as the creator. In a sense, Buddhism looks at the mind as being the creator of all things, in a Buddhist way of understanding that, whereas the Bible understands that God is the creator of all things. When the Buddhist says, be a light unto yourself, it's a very strong statement. That which is most important in Buddhism is not to be found outside, but somehow to be found in our own hearts, in our own minds. So to be a light unto oneself. I want to tell a couple of stories that come from the Mahayana tradition from a text called the Lotus Sutra. And the first is a story of a wayward son. There was his father and son who were wondering around the world. And at some point they got separated, or maybe they went through different paths. They reached a finding, started looking for their fortune, perhaps. And the father settled down in a town and became a merchant, I think, and became very successful and eventually became quite wealthy and had a big mansion or house or state. And continued with his affairs. And the son wandered around the world for a long time, ending up being quite destitute and homeless without any money, a ragged beggar. And in his poor state he became quite, I don't know if delirious or very worried, crazed or kind of lost himself or felt very unworthy, very inadequate. And then one day in the sons wandering around the world he came to the town where his father lived. And his father saw his son, recognized him even though he was in rags and looked disheveled, but the son didn't recognize the father. So the son ran out first and said, oh, hello, wait. And when the father came running out the son got frightened. Who's this guy running after me? So the father realized what was going on, so he didn't introduce himself as the father. He said, oh. And somebody did. His father went back into his grounds and he sent out one of his servants to ask the son if he would be willing to do some menial work to shovel manure in the stables. And the son said, oh, I'm so lucky because I have no money and I have no food and certainly I can do that. I can shovel shit. And so he comes in and spends the day shoveling in the stables. And he's complimented for how well he did the job and he's asked if he wants a steady job doing this and perhaps a little room in the side of the stable. He's very grateful for this and he stays and he works hard for quite a long time. And then he gets promoted at some point to be a gardener. He gets to be closer to the house and comes to head gardener and has a lot to do with the father who kind of directs the garden and what's to be done. And they develop quite a good rapport. And then eventually the father says, oh, won't you come in and help us in the house here. I need someone to help me, a secretary, someone to help me with my affairs much more closely. And the son does that and the father trusts him with the keys of the vault and all the secrets of the business and everything. And at some point, you know, all the father knows has been entrusted to the son, even though the son doesn't know who he is yet. And then at some point when the trust is there and everything, the son has a lot of confidence in himself. He's nowhere destitute and disheveled. The father says, oh, and by the way, we tell you something, you are my son. And it turns out this all this is yours. And so that goes together with another story in the same sutra. What happened? That's it. Isn't that a good story? The point of the story is that each of us has in some ways forgotten who we are. And spiritual practice and from this point of view is remembering who we are. But the unfortunate thing is that for most of us, we won't believe it. We'll go running away or something. And so it takes a long time. Sometimes you have to shovel a shit for a while. And you have to get some confidence there. And slowly you can kind of find out. And finally, finally, when you have a lot of confidence and self assurance, finally you get the point, you find out who you are. The second story, a little bit similar to this, is a story of two men who I think are also traveling. I don't remember all the details of the story. And while one of the men is sleeping, the second one sneaks over to him to his coat. And into the lining of his coat someplace, he so's or hides in a precious jewel, an expensive jewel. He doesn't tell him he's soaded in. And then they part ways for a long time. And the one that has this hidden jewel in his coat ends up having a hard time and destitute and poor and all these terrible things. And he wanders around and eventually they hook up again. And the man with the jewel says, you know, I've had a hard life. And the second was, oh, but you know, you should look in your coat. You have it right there. You know, he looks, opens up, tears up his coat and there he has his jewel. He carried with him all the time. All the, you know, it was worth all, you know, he could have been a wealthy man. So here's the same kind of idea that there's a, each of us has this jewel inside of ourselves that we don't know is there. And because we don't know it's there, we wander around and kind of lost and poor, spiritually poor. Some Buddhists love the story and some Buddhists don't like it at all. And the ones that don't like it, the ones who like it, like it, a variety of reasons why. But one reason is they almost see it as a metaphysical principle that somehow innately we are a Buddha. And so, innately there's some kind of wonderful purity or innate perfection or something within us. The people who don't like it don't like it because it's a metaphysical principle. And how are you going to know that for sure? Is it just an act of faith or how are you going to believe that? Or is it really true? How can it be? Is it really true? Is there such a thing inside of us? We'd like to believe it's kind of inspiring, isn't it? If we believe it's true, we probably act differently. And then it becomes true after a while. If we don't believe it's true, then I don't know. Maybe we practice and practice and then we discover something comparable to it. I think that the inner life is a kind of, there's a lot of ambiguity in the inner life. And we use it in the sense of how to describe it, how to talk about it. And so it's very easy to kind of use different kinds of languages. Some people work for some people, some people don't work for others. And to talk about what's innate is part of that. So is there some innate Buddhahood or innate perfection within us in and of itself? Or is there innate potential within us? And that potential is only actualized if we act on it. Is there a difference between the two? Could these be seen as the same thing? Certainly there's an innate potential. And that potential is what certainly most of Buddhism is pointing towards. An innate potential to wake up. Whether that awakening is somehow in there deep inside, and you just have to kind of clear all the gunk away from it. It's like a mirror, it's dusty. And so you kind of clean up the mirror and then you see how beautiful the mirror is. Or whether you have to get the glass and the silver, whatever it is, and kind of make the mirror. And then you have this beautiful mirror. Who knows what it is? It turns out that your practice is basically the same either way. However, the people who think that there's an innate mirror or innate perfection here, sometimes have an easier time. Because they have this confidence then that there's something really beautiful that's right here. As opposed to something that has to be worked for and attained and struggled for. So to be a light unto oneself, is it to be one's own light? Is it to make a light, to create a light, to create clarity, to create computing in our minds? Or is it really to recognize what's already there? To recognize the innate purity of our awareness, the innate purity of our heart or something? I don't know. Some days I fall on one side, and some days I fall on the other side, that divide. So I was at Spirit Rock the last few days, and I was quite inspired by one of the caretakers up there. The caretaker is someone who cares for things. And he cares for the land, the building, all the retreats that come there. He is basically a service job. He gets a small stipend, he gets room and board, room and a small little trailer. He gets a small stipend, and he works part time. And his inspiration is to be of service. He's done this at IMS and other places, and there's one of them. This is what he loves to do with his life. I found out this weekend that he is one of the... Probably the number is a little bit higher now. This was a video came some years ago. But a couple of years ago, he was one of 239 people in the United States who donated one of their kidneys to perfect strangers. Isn't that something? It's one thing to offer it to your relatives, someone you know or a friend. He went to someplace, a hospital, and said, I would like to donate my kidney. And I think they first said, you can't do that. Someone wants you, someone needs to want your kidney. And so he went and talked to his sister about that. And his sister was part of a church, and in the church they knew there was a woman there who was going to die if she didn't get a kidney soon. So through that connection then. And then before the transplant happened, his sister died. And so then he was even more inspired to give the kidney because it was partly in memory of her sister. And so then this person had... I don't know how they met each other or not, but he was one of the 239 people who had the kind of generosity of heart, I would think, care to offer this very precious part of our body to someone else, a perfect stranger. In order to save someone else's lives. It's a beautiful thing when you do that because there's this really long list of people on the kidney transplant waiting list. And some of those people, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands, and some of those people are never going to get to the top. So if you donate a kidney to someone near the top, it allows someone below them to move up. So you might want to save the life of the person you gave a kidney to, but maybe the person just takes down the list, their life was saved. Or maybe a lot of them were saved depending on how far up they got the list. So I say this story because when I think about this man now at Spirit Rock, he kind of represents a shining light for me. And it kind of brightened my day. I felt a lightened up by it. And there are people that I know who stand out as lights for me, beacons for me, as inspirations for me. Their behavior, their practice, their generosity, their compassion, somehow really brightens my day, inspires me tremendously. In the teachings of the Buddha, he said, even a new practitioner who practices sincerely is a bright light in the world that's stronger, a stronger light than the light of the stars, something like that is a quote. That even someone who's a new practitioner, if their practice is sincere, is a bright light. So to be a light for oneself, to be a light unto oneself, then allows one to be a light unto others. It's a wonderful kind of reciprocity in that kind of approach. I think that learning to be a light unto oneself is a really crucial issue for a lot of people I've been talking to in recent months, especially after the election. There's a lot of despair and a lot of fear in a lot of people right now, among some people, not everyone, but among a lot of people about what's going on, what they perceive is going on in this country. There may be good reasons to feel aroused and feel very concerned about many things going on, but to the degree of fear that exists, I wonder sometimes whether the fear arises because we're looking too much externally for our own well-being and not taking enough responsibility for our well-being from the inside out. To be a light unto oneself and then let the light shine from within outwards is to take responsibility for the way that we get contracted, the way that we get afraid, the way that we get angry, to take responsibility for ourselves, such a degree that it said that someone who takes refuge in their own light has no reason anymore to complain about the world. Now, you might still feel that things are not right in the world, you might act to change things in the world, it doesn't mean that you accept things as they are, but to complain, to blame the world, to wail against the world, for our individual condition, how we are. Is that a sign of... anyway, the point being that someone who's taking refuge in this light within oneself has no reason to complain anymore, partly because they begin understanding where the dynamic is, where the causality, causal connections are to their own suffering. It's in our own contractions, our own tightening, our own clinging, our own resistance, our own greed, that we suffer, that we, in a sense, we become our own enemy. If we get angry, the Buddha said, we do our enemies a favour and cause damage to ourselves our enemy could never have done, on his or her own. The enemy doesn't make us angry, it's the way we choose to respond to the situation. So the possibility of settling back and being a light onto oneself and out of oneself is a message of, I would say, tremendous hope and inspiration that Buddhism is pointing to. It's also a tremendous challenge. It's also sometimes a tremendous insult, as Jung Jung K Jung Kung-bakkal said, that many of the things, the cherished things we hold onto, we have to question and maybe be challenged very deeply if we're going to start taking responsibility here. So in the darkest times, we light a candle, and a single candle can dispel all, most of lots of the darkness. So each of us, I'm sure sooner or later, has or will experience darkness. And we'll come to a situation that's very personally challenging on many different levels, in many different ways. It said, some people believe that, I don't know if it's universally true, but certainly often true, that many people who are on a spiritual quest, spiritual life, sooner or later will encounter what can be called the dark night of a soul. And some people encounter it before they even know they're on a spiritual path. I think it was Carl Jung who said, by the time a person is middle age, 40 or 45 or something, all their issues are spiritual. That's approximately the quote. So then the question is, in the periods of darkness, do we light the candle? Do we realize that we have a candle to light? Do we have the courage or the strength or the tenacity in order to light it? Do we begin practicing using our awareness? Awareness is the candle, is one of the candles, certainly, the key candle. To use our awareness, someone dedicated to the path of mindfulness will fall back on or rely on being mindful, first and foremost, in any challenging situation they find themselves in. So no matter what's going on, how difficult it is, what's going on here? Can I be present for this? Can I try to understand what's happening right now? Can I understand myself in the relationship to what's happening right now? Can I bring light and clarity to all the different reactive forces within me, my beliefs, my assumptions, my feelings, my emotions? Can I shine lights on that? Begin shining the light of awareness on what's happening. The ability to shine light on awareness is the refuge in Buddhism, using our awareness and to fall back on that first and foremost, to use that light of awareness to bring clarity to what's happening. And then to begin to do that in a persistent way, to follow through on that intention, to follow through on that, not just once or twice, but to maintain it and continue it so that our ability to be clear and awake and present becomes a stronger and stronger force within us. Part of the advantage of doing that is that that allows us then to follow through on other intentions that we might want to live our lives by. And one of the things people do in America is right after it starts getting more and more light, in this kind of mythical non-reality of New Year's Eve, we've decided in this arbitrary time to make New Year's Eve resolutions. And I've been told, I have a friend who runs a health club in Menlo Park, and he says it's the best time of year for him, January. If he has a poor January, he's in trouble for the rest of the year. So time for making resolutions and intentions. And what I'd like to end by saying is that one of the lights within us that Buddhism focuses on is awareness itself, is mindfulness. The other light is the goodness of our intentions, of our motivations. And to fall back and take refuge on our good intentions, our good motivations, our skillful, healthy motivations, is a really beautiful thing that shines light and brings clarity to this world. So rather than complaining about the world, do something about the world. Rather than complaining about the world, follow through on the best that's within you, rather than feeling paralyzed by what's happening around us. Be empowered by what's within you. And let's what's within you, your good intentions, your good heart, manifest itself in the world so that you can be a light for the world. So you can be a light for yourself and a light for the world. So as you go into this new part of the year where things get lighter, maybe reflect a little bit about your intentions, your resolves, and then exercise them, develop them, cultivate them, work on them. And I'm not suggesting that you should all go out and give your kidneys away. But that little story of my friend at Spirit Rock, I think it's so inspiring, someone would do that. And that was his intention, that was his compassion and motivation. And he was a light in the world. So my hope is that each of you can be a light unto yourself and a light in the world. Okay? Thank you so much.
