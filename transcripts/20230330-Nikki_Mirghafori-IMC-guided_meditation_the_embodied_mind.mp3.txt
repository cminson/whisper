 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Greetings, friends. Greetings from Mountain View, California, on Seated Oloniland, where I am in this moment in time. And it's lovely to be with you. It's lovely to sense your presence from around the world, this blue planet of ours, joining each other in this moment and practicing together. So this week we've been exploring the Dharma of improv, or the improv of Dharma. There's so many relationships. And today, we in the meditation, we will explore something that is both very important in our practice and in our lives, as well as its key in improv, absolutely key. And that is embodiment. We need to be embodied in our bodies, not in our heads, to be present, to be present with whatever is arising in the present moment. And the idea of embodiment, really feeling the body, sensing the body, not being the head, not doing mindfulness from the mind, assuming that it's somewhere up in our heads, but actually bodyfulness, bodyfulness, be present with whatever is arising without judgment, without fighting against it. Need for embodiment. Similarly, need to be embodied when you're improvising. Really think about what you're going to do or say, but really allow your body to sense and lead and meet the moment. I'll say more about it, or some of the Dharma, but to plant the seed for really bringing attention to how embodiment can support us to meet this moment, sort of jumping forward or being in a reverie of the past. And there's more that I would add to it. So with that set up, let's begin. Let's begin and arrive, arrive in our bodies, sensing, sensing our bodies, breathing our bodies. Hello, body. Good morning. Good afternoon. Whatever the time is. Good moment. Hello, dear body. How are you? Thank you. I'm shaking in, shaking in with your toes. How are your toes this morning? This moment in time? How are you feeling? How are you at the bottom of the feed? What are you sensing? Hmm. What is being sensed by you right now? Not from the control tower of the head, but what's being felt, sensed in the feet, in the toes, contact points, touch points, curious with lightness, as if your awareness was the king of this, this town was going around and meeting and greeting, looking after all the residents of this village that is your body, this community that's your body. Sense of care. Imagine the benevolent king going around on low feet. Awareness, awareness, shaking in with the ankles. With the lower legs, awareness filling, filling out, touching internally. And as awareness is filling the senses in your lower legs, maybe you notice more sensations as if you're becoming more filled out. If you were a pop-up balloon or pop-up doll, oh, feeling more air, more awareness, oh yeah, feeling more filled out, this leg, that was just an idea. So many sensations moving up to the knees, the upper legs and sit bones. How many sensations of contact here? Getting your awareness rest here for a little while. Moving up your awareness, your knowing from your lower abdomen. Also so many sensations, breath, expansion, contraction, maybe a release is needed here to make more space. Maybe a release at the out breath. Letting go with this, letting go with this sigh. Moving awareness up, brushing the upper abdomen, lower diaphragm. Awareness of the sensations, your chest, this chest. And your back, lower back. How many sensations? Mid back. Upper back. Lower back, lower back. Wanted to help you focuss your eating resources. Nailing the sensations and if there's any release needed, allow it to happen, the out breath. Let them relax, feel the sensations rushing. Elbows. Lower arms. So much sensation in the front, the back of the hands, your palm, your back, your back, your palm. Let yourself enjoy. Not a grim duty but with lightness, curiosity, interest, enjoy the sensations. As long as we don't get attached and cause more suffering, there is no problem with enjoying what is. It feeds the heart to become calmer, more settled as part of the path of practice. Gently moving up. Neck, shoulders, shoulders and neck. Up to the head and face. Softening, relaxing, releasing the tightness and sensing so many sensations. Feel the whole body, the entire body. This body here sitting, breathing. A live pulsating filled with sensations, touch, heaviness, lightness, cold and warmth. Fingling movement. Blow. Let the awareness be content and happy, enjoying. Resting in the body, nowhere to go. No need to go into the future or past. Right here, meeting this moment. It's so rich. I have the refuge of the body. Coming home, resting in the body. Joyfully resting. All saving sensations of the body. Thank you. Thank you. Can there be a smile? Give it a try. Greeting this body. This living, breathing, amazing anchor. Meeting, meeting our bodies with a smile. Lightness. Thank you. Thank you. Let the body breathe. Simply be. Be with the breath, be with the sensations. There is such contentment and happiness unleashed. Just this breath in breath in the body. And the abdomen, this out breath. And the stomach, the stomach, the stomach, the stomach. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The mind is racing towards the future planning. Or reaching out into the past, can we release, smilingly, release? Let awareness rest. Know the sensations of the body breathing. Meeting this moment.
