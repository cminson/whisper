 It's nice for me to be back after being gone for a month. Seems that you all have been talking about the precepts last month. At least some of you, those of you who have been coming. I thought I would just say a few things about them and then hear from you. And then we'll have kind of a discussion until about 8.15 and then we could end the evening with 15 minutes more of sitting. Is there anything that before I start, is there anything that's pressing or that needs to be brought up that you want to ask at this point or give you a chance? I would just like to say that even though our speakers spoke in your place, we're very marvelous. But there is that the empty part of me that's only maybe pleading, missed you. The other part, that means definitely to an independent cell. I'm not sure, but I just want to welcome that. Thank you. Thank you. What I thought of doing was just maybe talk a little more generally about precepts. In particular, since this is really a beginning class in meditation, beginning kind of supposed to be at least. See all these old timers here. I thought of just saying a few things about the connection between meditation practice, mindfulness practice and the precepts. I'll say some things kind of as an introduction, but what I would like to ask you when I finish my introduction is to ask you all what you think very personally, aside from what you may be here for me, but what you feel is a connection between your own meditation practice, your own mindfulness practice and ethical life, living a virtuous life. In Buddhism we talk about the five precepts, not to kill and not to steal and not to lie, not to misuse sexuality and not to misuse intoxicants. There is a tradition in Buddhism that the precepts are a very joyful thing in people's lives. There are Buddhists who love the precepts. Take delight in not only the idea of the precepts, but delight in their own embodiment of the universe and of ethical virtue, virtuous conduct. For me this was kind of a surprise when I first was studying Buddhism because for me, growing up in the West at the time that I did, there was a kind of a version to a precepts, anything that talks about precepts, anything that looks like shoulds, anything that you should be doing with your life, it felt like an external imposition, something that was limited your life rather than kind of expressed the freedom of your life. Sometimes there was an abhorrence among my friends for such things as precepts. So to come across these Buddhists who really delighted in it and they would rejoice in precepts and were very happy in their own, as I said, embodiment of the precepts was a surprise for me. And I think there is a joyful connection between mindfulness practice and the precepts. Someone pointed out to me recently for a long time I'd heard about you shouldn't should your life. You can't really say it even. But there's a difference between shoulds and coulds. And there's the things we could do and there's the things we should do. And sometimes we confuse the two. But what things we could do are things that are within our potential or possibility that maybe we want to do, maybe it kind of expresses some deeper potential for who we are and it can be healthy and wholesome to try to align yourself or to grow into that could, that possibility. And I think the precepts are one of those. They're not shoulds but they're certainly coulds. And part of the rejoicing, part of the joy that some people feel about the precepts is that when you live a life according to the precepts, an ethical life, it allows you to walk through life without having to be ashamed, without feeling any shame. You can be kind of independent and open and receptive and vulnerable to the world and not have to worry about someone thinking bad about you or attacking you or feeling your own shame. You don't have to turn your eyes away from anybody. You can be equal to anybody that you meet. You don't have to kind of look down or kind of crawl around the sides and avoid people and all the kind of ways in which we might do that. You can actually meet someone directly and you have nothing to hide and you have nothing, you can just be there. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to be brilliant or anything. You are complete and you have nothing. You have made yourself incomplete by breaking precepts. And that's a wonderful thing, to be able to go through life with this kind of openness of a clear conscience. I talked this week with a woman who's been practicing mindfulness practice for about a year now, fairly intensively for the last six months, not necessarily every day for about 45 minutes every day, very, very, very girly. And she's taken real delight in the practice, in the mindfulness practice. And she says in the last month or two she's found that she's becoming really open hearted. And she's never been so open hearted before. And all these people like her friends, the relationships are working so much nicer. And strangers she meets and somehow it resonates. Her open hearted is kind of contagious, I guess. So life's been very nice. She doesn't know hardly anything about Buddhism and just came to one retreat. And then I kind of knew almost what she was going to say next. She had all this open heartedness and feelings of intimacy with one of her old friends who wasn't her husband. And the passion, sexual passion, rose dramatically. And her husband had been out of town for that week. So what do you know what to do? Because she was kind of beside herself. What to do with all this energy and all this open heartedness. And luckily she didn't do anything, except try to cope the best she could. And then she called me and I explained to her well. I said, this is a very important lesson that Buddhist practice, the mindfulness practice, and in Buddhist context, is always held in the container of the precepts. And one of the ways that makes the practice safe to open up to all the stuff that can arise in the course of the practice is you're gently being held within this wonderful container, this bowl of the precepts. So it's safe to let things come up, energies and feelings and fantasies and all. But you can explore them and deepen your connection with yourself by holding them in the precepts so that it means not acting on them. So she could feel that open heartedness and explore it and get to know it. If she'd act on it, it would have been a disaster in her situation. She was completely happy with her husband. It wasn't like she was looking for someone else. And often what happens in spiritual life is there is a kind of open heartedness that happens. And it's very easy, that open heartedness, to fall in love with people. I don't know if it's just our culture, maybe it's universal, but there's a close connection between open heartedness and feelings of intimacy and sexuality. And a lot of people confuse the two. So expressions of intimacy, kind of open heartedness, can be confused as being sexual interest or sexual kind of thing going on. And then you follow the wrong route. The wrong fork. You take it into a kind of a detour for a while, rather than following the increasing opening of the heart, increasing deepening into our own integrity and deeper sincerity. So I think it's important to say that the precepts are a very important container for the practice. Well, I was going to tell you, maybe I won't say what I think the joy of, or the connection to meditation, mindfulness practice and precepts is any more than what I've said. It'll be interesting to hear from you, what you guys think. What do you think the connection is between them? In a personal way, if you've ever reflected on it. And some of you have been talking about it for the last month, so you might have some thoughts. You have to be mindful. Even be aware of the precepts. Is it mindful? Mindful. Like a precept I work with, some of my colleagues at work, constantly work with, this is about five precepts, it's part of the ten mayana precepts of not talking about other people and elevating yourself. And you'd be carrying on a conversation with one of us, we'll say, well, we're doing, you know, and then we'll capture ourselves. But you really have to be mindful. It's so ingrained in our behavior, it's part of the pyramid of mindfulness. Yeah. And where you're doing it. Well, there's a couple of things about that. One is, it's really great to have a group of people who are doing it together with you. Because they can help you catch it and it becomes kind of a fun thing. Because rather than, you know, moralistic, say, look what you did. It's like, they wink at you and say, oh yeah, hell yeah. And then the next thing, we're having so much fun doing it. And then I think about mindfulness. You need to be mindful. Sure, you need to be mindful. But taking on the precepts as a voluntary thing to take on is also then an aid to become mindful. And one of the monastic delights, if you ever, if you ever, anything you ever want to tie Buddhist monasticism for a while, it's a temporary thing. You can do it just for a few months. You don't have to do a lifetime commitment. So you can try it out for size. It's kind of fun. But one of the delights of being a monk or a nun is, which surprised me also, I thought, you know, when I became a monk was, what surprised me was that the, as a monk, you have to follow 227 precepts, not just 10 or five. But in order to follow them, you have to be really mindful. And so it really sharpened my mindfulness. But not simply in being mindful. Well, I don't want to give away too much. But anyway, so taking on the precepts helps you become mindful and becoming mindful can help you live a more ethical life. Yeah. I feel like my greatest struggle is self judgment. And I really have struggled with mindfulness. I've become more mindful of judgment. The precepts I really have trouble with. Because like, if I worse, I start feeling the anti-Christ or something. I break them all the time. And I feel uncomfortable even more. Oh, the more mindful you are, the more you're mindful is mature, the more you realize you're breaking them all the time. But you don't, you don't. But now I feel guilty about killing snails and doing white lies and, you know, just, it's on a scale of things that all kind of harm was in a way. It's, well, in taking on the precepts, this is, this is one of the things that it does. It helps you see your tendencies. So a tendency towards guilt is a tendency towards aversion to hate. And so, see, learning to have that potential within that possibility, that trait, you can begin exploring what are the dynamics around guilt? No, no, guilt is kind of, is a form of aversion or a form of hate. And so you get to explore that and try to work with it to, in a skillful way, to try to make it less of a, of a painful thing for you. So it doesn't torment you so much. And that's considered a healthy move. I mean, we could get you, we can put you someplace where you're not going to break any precepts at all, you know. And you'll never, you never learn anything about yourself. And we're trying to wake up to some real deeper potential of who we are, of what reality is. And, and of course, at times what it means is meeting, confronting the places where we hold ourselves in. So, so then mindfulness practices are working with that in this skillful and compassionate and friendly way. That's the hard part. Yeah, it's not easy. It's easy to talk about up here, you know. It's not, you know. And so you, so. So then we do loving kindness practice. Get the habit of it. Get the hang of it. And it is hard. And so mindfulness practice, if you allow the mindfulness practice to really, if you really apply yourself in mindfulness practice and this, and really be able to go deeply into those tendencies, you'll see something deeper behind it. And, and that'll, that'll help loosen, it'll help loosen that entanglement that you find yourself in when you're in the middle of it. So there's usually, simplistically, there's kind of two general ways to work with some of the things you're trying to deal with. And it's not easy. And one is to try to cultivate an attitude of friendliness and compassion for yourself and to see yourself as worthy, as being as worthy of friendship, friendliness, as the, all those other people outside of you are. Because we're not any different. So you realize that and then direct that towards yourself. The other way is to bring this very clear and consistent mindfulness to what's going on. What is, what is happening when you're guilty? What are the feelings? How do you feel it in your body? What happens there? What is the movement there? What is that, where that movement of aversion arise out of? What is the judgment that is happening at that time? What is this, below that, maybe there's a sense of, almost any kind of self-loathing, self-aversion, guilt, arises out of a sense of hurt. And often that hurt is buried underneath a lot of guilt. And the guilt can be so strong you don't see the hurt. So if you can really learn the ability and mindfulness to be there with the guilt without pushing it away or holding onto it or judging it any more than you are, then at some point you might see where the guilt is arising out of. And if you can see that, then there may be a chance of healing that. So, but it's a slow process and it takes, it takes time. And, but I think bringing it up and being willing to talk about it in a group like this, I think is actually a very healthy and healing part of the whole process because you're being honest about it. A lot of people, most of us aren't that honest. So if you're not honest, you can't be free. Yeah. I was listening to the precepts last week. I had the feeling that it gave me a much better, a trustful confidence, much better confidence in, in what was happening in sitting. The stuff that would come up in my sitting sometimes were pretty bizarre. And somehow the precepts was like a little kind of like a loosely woven net that I could fall into, but it only has fives. I'll give you more. So I was thinking about you 220, but I found that the meditations were, were safer. They allowed me to go a little deeper so that the next time, well, in fact, they allowed me a little more, a little more realization as well. And so the cycle kind of gets better. That's how I think. It's beautiful. That's kind of what I was saying before about container, but you said it so well. So, so that it's more trust. You feel it's maybe it's more trust. You can trust yourself more to open up to what's going on because you're not, you don't have to worry about, well, am I going to punch out my neighbor or am I going to act on it or something? You know that you can, it's okay to experience all that and all those motivations and feelings because you know you have, you have the precepts which are going to hold you. Is that, I think it's fantastic. Anybody else feel that way? Anybody thought about that way or feel that way in the bottom? No? Yes. A year ago I was made aware of a fly and I took four of them actually and I left the one about drinking out. And I didn't get one of them, I didn't even share any of them. And, but one of them that I didn't expect to make a lot of difference was the killing one and I stopped killing a lot of insects that I used to kill as well as sales. And I felt kind of glad that I was leaving and then I felt kind of proud for it. And then I went all the way around. I didn't think I was supposed to kill them. And then recently I was made aware of twelve and they were rather complicated and they're very overwhelming. I think they're taking out Han precepts? Twelve? I don't know if it's twelve. I don't know if it's twelve. One of them was thinking about watching what you say and how you say it. Whatever I say will be helpful, will be kind, will be useful for me. So usually you have your mouth and how can you honor the subject of kindness and health? So then the suggestion was made to just take one piece of heart of one precept. Or just work on that. Or be aware of that. Another one was never trying to wake from suffering. Always look at an EI and there's something like two things to do then. One was not for your wealth. You have to pay for it in my wealth. I mean, you can retire. So it's really tricky. And you feel, I kind of feel that. Yeah. The thing about pride is interesting because pride is a feeling and an attitude which tends to... Certainly it creates division between people. And that's part of the danger of it. It's a being against the rest. But in Buddhism, it's considered to be a virtue to delight and rejoice in your ability to follow the precepts. So you can give up the pride, but not the joy in the fact that you're doing it. Isn't that kind of nice? It is if you can separate it too. And also, Buddhism doesn't have this God that's watching you. So it's okay to have some guilt and some pride and all these things. We're human beings and we're just kind of working with what stuff we have the best we can. Don't make it worse than it is. And the thing about the precepts, there are a lot of precepts actually. There's the five precepts and the eight precepts and the ten precepts. I guess the twelve precepts and there's twenty-seven precepts and there's more. And there's all these different precepts. And again, rather than taking them on as a should, as we feel what our intention is in our practice, the possibility in the practice, what we're working with, your practice should always come from you in a sense. You feel this is something that your spiritual practice is being motivated from and personal intention and not some kind of abstract ideal or status quo or peer pressure or whatever. So as you're doing that, as you're finding ways, so what you do is you find your deep intention and then you try to bring your mindfulness practice to bear on that deep intention. And then you might go to, sometimes on a retreat, you might go to a teacher and talk to the teacher about how the teacher can help you do the thing you're trying to do for yourself. So the teacher is not imposing it, the teacher is an aide. Everything is aiding his deep intention. So in relation to the precepts, there are all these precepts. And the thing is to see what is the connection between whatever is different precepts and your own natural desire to wake up and be present and be compassionate. And you might see for yourself, ah, if I try out this one particular precept, that actually rather than being assured that I'm imposed and be guilty, this actually might help me become more awake. So I'll try it on for a while. And you try another one, one week and another week another one. So it becomes an easy thing rather than trying to remember all these lists. So your way was great. It was very nice. Yes? I have a question about not killing. Yeah. Ironically, things we never hear discussed by various people, it deals with mainly with insects. For American Buddhists, that's the thing that seems to be most closely at hand. I was wondering if it has to do with also things like killing another person with health-esteem or killing their own. Or killing your own. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking that probably whenever. Yeah. So what you're pointing out is something that is very important, is that the literal meaning of the precepts are easy to understand for sure. And it's relatively easy to kind of in the most direct, obvious way for most people to follow them. Most of us aren't going out killing other people, killing animals, other people kill animals for us. You know, it's pretty obvious things. It's pretty easy. But as you become more sensitive, more mindful and also start thinking about reflecting on it, you begin seeing that these also apply to other areas that are more metaphoric or more analogies. I don't know what the right word is. And that's a beautiful example because you can kill someone else's intention or kill someone else's joy or kill someone else's goodwill or generosity or many things on your own. So then you become sensitive to a whole different level. So the deeper level of working with the precept is working with that. If you interrupt someone in a conversation, you've stolen something. Maybe. That's one way of seeing it. So there's that level. And that's where I kind of said earlier that the more mindful you are, the more you realize you're always breaking them. Because you start seeing there's deeper and deeper, kind of more and more subtle levels. And until finally, you know, it's... Yes? At that level of subtlety, the bitter connections between the precepts become quite evident. Well, they do on a grosser level too. I mean, if you cloud your mind in one way, you're clouding in another. And if you break a precept and are aware of the breaking of it, I think it reflects in the other precepts as well. I'm not explaining this very well. But my question is, since there are written in more precepts than in the five that lay in the ball, does that interconnection continue on down the line and does the net that you were speaking of become more filled in? I'm not sure that's sleeping on a hive yet, or handling money of the same degree of subtlety as the first thought. For a monk or a nun, some of the precepts are what we in English would call the ethical. But a lot of them are simply training rules. So you do this because it's the training. And... or back in ancient India, there was some association, for example, in ancient India, if you... I read today, for example, this is one of them, is you're not allowed to give a Dharma talk to someone who's holding an umbrella. That's one of the rules. And the reason, the explanation, the commentary is that in ancient India, 2,500 years ago, that holding... having an umbrella was a status symbol. And so if you're holding the umbrella, you're holding your status symbol, and you shouldn't speak to someone who is flaunting their status. So they should at least not hold it. They can put it in their lap or something. They'll put it down. And so that has more to do with customs of the times rather than, you know, any... Or there's a kind of... But I think that's a separation. A lot of them are not ethical. They have to do with customs of the time, and they have to do with training precepts to help you with your training. When I was ordained as a monk, I hadn't been ordained more than maybe five or six hours since a senior monk came to me and said, you have to confess for making the precepts. And this guy was a trip. He was here. I got a Calvinistic maybe mentality maybe. And the reason I had to confess was one of the rules is your robes have to always be lined up, kind of neat. And my robes were little... These robes aren't... You're wearing bedsheets, right? And so you're constantly kind of falling off and getting loose. And so of course they're going to get a little bit crooked and kind of... And so it's one of the rules. You have to keep them always straight. He wanted me to confess. But the connection between them, I think they overlap. I've been documenting recently on ethics. And I said in it that the precept of not lying is particularly important because if you maintain... Often when you break the other precepts, you're also breaking that one. So if you just maintain that one, you're less likely to break the others. Yes? I've got a question that sort of goes to how we could practice or should practice. And when you were speaking earlier to her about self-loathing, for example, and maybe we could use that to deepen our practice and go in and maybe follow the threads of that and under something. But I think a question that I have has to say anger. And the question more specifically, if I'm feeling angry, in terms of what we're doing here, is it a good idea to just sit down and meditate on it and really try to get in touch with the anger and what's there, or to write about it, or talk about it, or follow me above? I think each situation has to be taken in its own terms. So in terms of the meditation practice, the meditation practice is to simply sit with the anger, allow it to be there, not to repress it or push it away, but don't act on it either. There's a wonderful balance between the two. So you really get to know it really well without adding complications to it. But it's really strong or very repetitive, kind of like a thing that comes up and over and over again. Sometimes that's enough. You can go really deep and clarify it. Sometimes it doesn't seem to be enough for some people. It still causes so much pain and suffering that you just don't want to continue with so much pain. Sometimes writing is a great way. Writing is kind of like, or speaking to a friend is a wonderful way of kind of doing mindfulness out loud, which is very powerful. Part of mindfulness is acknowledging what we're experiencing, what's going on for us. Acknowledgement has a way of both clarifying and settling things, taking care of them, taking some of the strength away from them maybe. And talking out loud to a friend can be a very powerful way of acknowledging something fully. And some things seem to be really best acknowledged if you do it to someone else. That's why in Buddhism, in ancient Buddhism, there was a whole tradition of what's been translated into English as confession. And I think part of the value of that was not because you have to go and confess your sins, because there's no sins in Buddhism. But some things are best taken care of by verbally acknowledging someone else. I think a lot of the benefit of therapy is, aside from whatever skills a therapist has in terms of working with you, is simply that therapy is a place where you can actually vocalize and acknowledge out loud what's going on. So all of the above, I think, depending on the situation. And then also to be discerning about the anger, because the Buddhist tendency, because we're focusing so much on practice, and practice is a big part of practice, so internal, the tendency for Buddhists is always to say, well, what is my role in this? How did I respond in acting this situation? So it's like I've had encounters with other Buddhists where we kind of had kind of this little difficulty. And then I go home and I thought about it for a while, and I said, gee, I really, I was really made a mistake there, didn't I? And then I called up and said, I really want to apologize for what I did. I was going to call you and apologize for what I did. I felt so responsible. And because Buddhists, to trade this, it's a beautiful trade, I think, of Buddhists, to always go see what was my responsibility in this thing. But you can go too far. And that's the danger in Buddhism also. It's a beauty, but also a danger among some Buddhists. There's a hesitation among true blue Buddhists. I don't know. To see clearly what's happening outside of your responsibility sometimes. Sometimes it's too much internal. And sometimes you need to act in a situation and say something to someone else and say no, or say let's talk about it, or let's have a mediator or something has to happen besides just your own stuff. And is that enough, you think? Within the next two months, I plan on giving a talk, I think probably Monday night, on anger. It seems like it's time. It's been long enough now. It's one of the most popular topics. And someone who always disagrees with me. I've been trying for years to give a talk on anger that Brigette doesn't take exception to. And I hope I never succeed. So, yes? Could be. Yes. Oh, that is interesting. Excuse me. If I may say, I was going to use a random thought footnote to that. I live up on Skyline, 2000 feet, so I kind of live above the smog, I think. So I was driving down today and I was looking down in the fog across the street. It was very foggy today. It's one of the thick, let me go on. And it was kind of trapped in the bay. And I was thinking about it and I said, and I was thinking about the precepts, and especially second precepts about not stealing. And I thought there was a connection and I said, well, well, we're generating all this smog and staying here where we're generating it. And for once, in the rare time, we're not ascending into Fresno. And if you ever go down to Central Valley and up against the foothills there in Sierras, all the bay area fog goes down there and it lingers down there. And out of mind, out of sight, out of mind, right? So we're generating all the time. And so, I don't know, is it breaking a precept to create all the smog and send it to Fresno? I'm sorry, go ahead. I have both comments and a question about things that have been touched on by all the other things. When you talk about how the precepts and meditation and mindfulness are related, it came to my mind that there's, I'm just new to this and I don't really know the precepts, except that they're pretty common in all religions. And sometimes it's very easy to see what the right thing is to do. And other times it's not so easy. And I have found at the time that in meditating and going inner, not so much with mindfulness and other techniques, that it becomes clearer to me what is the right thing. That's my comment. Now my question is, I'm in a particular situation in my life now that things aren't very clear to me at all, as to what's the right thing. And a particular piece is that what seems right to another person, I have compassion and I can see their viewpoint and I actually have more of a tendency to, oh yes, of course. And then sometimes forget that, well wait, this is my viewpoint, which is equally balanced and have compassion for that. So my question is, are there any thoughts, techniques, whatever that you might have that mindfulness might help? I mean I find talking to people sometimes gets clearer, but nobody knows the best thing is what I can touch into something inside of myself at most. Yes, yes. So I think that's beautiful, he said. And that's one very dramatic connection between precepts and mindfulness is if you can become aware enough of your own deeper integrity, which often surfaces when you're quiet enough, it's a lot clearer, not only what you should do, but what you want to do. And what you don't want to do. And when you're not in touch with that integrity and you're in your surface mind, you think that's what you want to do. You think, well it's my freedom, I want to express myself. And you think that person's self-expression is the right thing to do. But it's just that surface mind which is running around like a monkey and you end up in trouble. It's not what you really want to do. So simply practicing, having some kind of practice that helps you in as many ways. In Buddhism, one of the guidelines to help us with this kind of things is to pay a lot of attention to our intention. And the ultimate criteria in Buddhism is the intention behind the act. So is the intention wholesome? If there's unwholesome aspect to the intention, then maybe you shouldn't act on it. Or then you should spend more time clarifying it. But if your intention is wholesome, then you're in a safer area. And sometimes you have to be very quiet or pay very careful attention to discover what your intention is. But that has a lot to do with it. And that will help in a lot of situations because sometimes our intention is tinged by aversion or hate or greed or fear. And when you see that, you say, oh, wait a minute, maybe I better take it a little bit slow here and look more carefully. Or you might find after a while it's not. So maybe it's now I can state it or say it or explore it some more. And one of the value of meditation practice is that it gives us a taste, maybe not immediately, but it starts giving us a taste of feeling or at least a hint of what it's like to be in a mind and a body without fear, without hate, without aversion, without greed, without confusion. And if you can get that taste, that taste, that feeling of what that is, you can recognize much more clearly and then your mind-body experience is tinged by those things. And if you have more of a reference, and if you can see that, then maybe you can notice when you're acting out of fear. You notice when you're acting out of aversion much more earlier. And you appreciate what it feels like to be in a place that's not acting out of fear or aversion or confusion. So one of the connections between mindfulness practice and precepts is that the precepts are a definition, kind of, of how you would act if you're acting from a place without any fear or aversion. And so if you find yourself breaking a precept, it isn't that you're breaking some moral code that's bad to break. It's showing you that you've lost touch with some part of yourself, which maybe, hopefully, you value very much yourself. And so the meditation practice is about learning some part of yourself that you really value. And as you value it more and more, the precepts become a wonderful guideline for how to stay in touch with what you love. So that's why the joy or the love or the joy of the precepts is because you found something you love and enjoy within yourself. And at some point, it isn't just personal, because at some point in the mindfulness practice, meditation practice, some of the harder boundaries we have between self and other break down. And you feel that your own, what's most of the value inside of you, resonates with what's most of the value in someone else. So you also want to honor that valuable essence of others. So you're not only living in precepts because it's good for your own essence, you're living in precepts because of that resonance between your own and that of other people.
