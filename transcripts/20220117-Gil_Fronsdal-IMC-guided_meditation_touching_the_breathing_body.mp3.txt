 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning, good day, here in the United States for this Martin Luther King holiday. A holiday which I associate with love because Martin Luther King himself placed love at the foundation of his work. His work for civil rights, for voting rights was an expression of love and he kept that in the forefront or the heart front for himself and the challenges he faced. And I like to think of that when we sit and meditate that it is a form of love, it is a form of care, kindness, a powerful kindness, a strong kindness to sit quietly and tune in and be present. The Satipatanasuta, this practice, is kind of all-encompassing in a certain way. And an interesting way to see that is that in this section on mindfulness of breathing, which we've been doing these last couple of weeks, there's a simile at the end that often gets overlooked. And the simile is borrowing an image from a crafts person and someone who works a craft with their body. It's a very physical engagement. And that is someone who's, it's called a turner. I think it's someone who uses a lathe and a knife or a chisel in order to shape wood. And so the wood is turning and they bring the knife to bear on it and it carves it into poles or whatever they might want to do. And it says that just as a turner knows when they're doing a long turn, long cut, and knows when they're doing a short turn, a short cut, that they're engaged and they know the difference in what's happening. And so in the same way, and there's this rhythm, there's a cycle, the lathe is turning and turning or throwing pots on a wheel. It's turning around and someone who's a potter has their hands on the pot holding it and not leaving it and just sensing and feeling. And you can feel when the walls are thick and thin. So the lathe turner kind of knows, feels the turning and holds the knife just right up touching, just the right amount of pressure, not too much and not too little. And so this simile for breathing does a few things. It's engaging the imagination. And within reason, in a very, very modest way, not elaborate imagination, but we can evoke the imagination slightly to help us stay connected to the breathing. And here the imagination of a craftsperson keeping contact with the wood as it turns and turns. So we keep contact with the breathing as the cycles of in-breath and out-breath occur. And that we know when it's long turns and short turns, we know kind of as things get more and more subtle, the breathing becomes quieter, stiller, sometimes shorter in a certain way. And so we're tracking that. We're staying there, staying in touch as a craftsperson, physically in contact, physically the whole body kind of with the experience, the cycle of breathing, breathing, feeling, sensing, staying in touch so we can really track what's going on. The one ancient analogy is that the breath is a little bit like, the breathing is a little bit like hitting a bell. And as the bell gets hit softer and softer, or as the ringing quiets down, it gets softer, quieter and quieter, quieter, ring to it. And so the same thing as we settle into the breathing over time, over maybe weeks, days, sometimes minutes, the breathing sometimes gets quieter and quieter, more subtle. And we want to stay in touch with it, in contact with it. The staying in contact with the breathing physically, feeling it, sensing it, knowing it. So assuming a upright or appropriate meditation posture, and it helps if it's a posture that frees up the chests and the diaphragm, so there's a kind of freedom in the breathing, so we're not caved in, but anything slightly open, if it's easy enough to pull in your spine between your shoulder blades so that the chest gets pushed out a little bit, just gently, just a little bit. And then gently closing the eyes. And maybe as you put a piece of wood on your lathe, and you start being with the turning of it, or lump of clay on your wheel, it's coarse, and you feel the coarseness of it. So you can start coarsely with your breathing by breathing in deeply, but appreciating the cycle of breathing in and breathing out as you do so. And then you feel the rhythm. And as you exhale to relax in your body, you feel the feeling of relaxing your body around your breathing, around the exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And now as the your wood becomes more refined, your clay pot becomes into shape. Feel the rhythm of breathing now, feel the circles, breathing in and breathing out. And continue to do a few little bit of relaxation on the exhale. This time maybe relaxing deep within. Relaxing the impulse to wonder off in thought. And then as a crafts person, carefully feeling the craft physically connected with the body. Stay in contact with a full turning of breathing, breathing in and breathing out. So that there's a physical contact. You feel the physicality of breathing. And you maintain contact with that physicality. Where awareness is kind of like the hands on the pot. Awareness is kind of like the chisel on the wood turning on a lathe. Not too hard, not too soft, gently, but persistently working your craft. The craft of staying in contact, loving contact with breathing, breathing in and breathing out. Everything changed. And as you breathe in and out with physical contact, with that experience, when it seems appropriate, let there be more relaxation in your body, softening, opening. With the relaxation comes a smoothing of the wood, smoothing of the clay pot, allowing it to turn more quietly, slowly. Breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, breathing in and out with physical contact, The more the attention can be on breathing, the less it is in thinking. And the more awareness opens up to the rest of the body. Almost naturally, without the distractions of thoughts, the body is felt more fully. And as you exhale, see if you can relax your body more, or perhaps bring up tranquility, or letting there be a tranquil space in your body. A tranquil space within which the turning of breath, the turning of breath of breathing can come and go. Perhaps a relaxation that gently touches into the embodied experience of kindness, of tenderness, where that can be a channel for our goodwill, or well-wishing for others. And as we come to the end of this sitting, perhaps you can see if your body, your chest, your heart, can be a tranquil conduit for the wishes of well-being. May it be that as we end this sitting, that we wish well for others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May it be that all beings are peaceful. May it be that all beings are free. And on this day of Martin Luther King's holiday, holy day, may our well-wishing or goodwill go to those people who are oppressed, discriminated against, who live in poverty, who are sick, who are afraid, who see no way out of their challenges. May we indeed live for the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy. Amen.
