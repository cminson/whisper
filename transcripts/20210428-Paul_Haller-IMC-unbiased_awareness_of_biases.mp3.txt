Sometimes it seems so simple, just noticing and not grasping in having a feeling of liberation.
Just in that moment, wow, that experience illustrating and instructing us on the wisdom
of liberation, the compassion of liberation, and how both are intertwined with how consciousness
is being attended to.
A great gift of having a meditation practice is that each meditation session will invite
us to rediscover, to dwell in that practice of unbiased awareness, and to see what comes
forth.
It creates a version of reality, and it creates a version of reality that's initiated by our
conditioned version of reality.
Usually if we wanted to be smart, we could say it's an unconditioned response to a conditioned
experience.
But usually in the process of practice, it's more helpful to be naive, and then there's
a saying that says not knowing creates the intimate experience, the intimacy, and yet
for us simply not knowing can leave us with some way of connecting, of acknowledging,
of allowing it to be, to register.
Once when I was a monk, I went to visit another monk, and in his little hut, his kuthi as
it's called in Thailand, he had on the wall a picture of a baby, and I was a little surprised
in that setting to see a picture of a baby, and he said to me, I want that mind, that's
the mind that I aspire to, I don't think he said I want, I think more aspiration.
We come into this world with the capacity to pay attention, and one of the enchanting
things to my mind and heart about babies is they engage it completely, each experience
they give themselves to it completely.
But we all grow up, we all create a much more complex version of reality, and noticing and
acknowledging, the ingenuity of it is that it can shift, the noticing and acknowledging
can shift dependent upon the state of consciousness, the circumstances, the stimulation.
When we ask what's happening now, it's like, what's the dominant experience now?
Is it a quality of mind that's turbulent, or a quality of mind that's deeply settled?
Is it a version of reality that has great authority within our being?
Can we invite any and every experience that happens for us into a state of awareness that
sees it for what it is?
In some ways we could say, the process is panya, is prajna, the very process of unbiased
seeing, of the biases of being, unconditioned response to conditioned being, the very process
is wisdom.
And then we could say, what's illuminated by the process, all the particular details
and ways that consciousness picks shape.
And then the way me, the unique expression of those biases that arise in our individual
being.
And the inquiry of how to learn, how to work with our own being in a way that will enable
that unbiased attention.
In out of that, the many practices that arise, the practice of compassion, the practice of
patience, the practice of accepting what is the disciplines of not corrupting or undermining
the capacity for awareness.
My experience of Zen practice is that staying close to this unbiased attention to the biases
of being, staying close to that, exploring that, is an important aspect of our practice.
It's like listening to the bell ring.
And as we listen to it, the sound of the bell opens to all the sounds.
So we attend with precision to the experience of unbiased awareness.
And as we do it, it opens up to everything, all the ways we be.
And often in our dedication, the complexity of being is deemed to be inappropriate.
Oh, it shouldn't be like this.
It should be a different way.
So what if we think of this moment as a momentary culmination of not just our life, but of our
parents' lives too, and their parents, and their parents, and their parents.
What if we think, this is not just opening to the experience of me.
This is opening to the experience of this vast web of being.
And here we are, dipping our finger in the ocean of being with this momentary awareness.
And in doing so, appreciating the uniqueness of the moment, and in an utterly mysterious
way, connecting to all being.
How do we do that?
Is there still a singular self in that experience?
So this dance between acknowledging, okay, in this moment, this thought is present.
And it describes, it implicates, it has inferred within it a version of reality, me, my life,
this place, this time.
And yet, it touches all being.
So in the language of Zen, we say, this is the great, mysterious inquiry into being.
This is the coin of being alive.
Like it, dislike it, love it, hate it, be grateful for it, despise it, you know.
Feel deeply connected, feel isolated, yeah.
Can we sit down in the middle of that?
And then can we stand up and open to all of it?
The deliberateness of practice can steady our heart and our mind, and not just support
us to enter into all of it, but also invite a kind of joy in doing so, now what?
So please, enjoy yourselves.
