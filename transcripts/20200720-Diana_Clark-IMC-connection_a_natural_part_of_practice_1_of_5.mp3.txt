The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So good morning. For those of you who don't know, that Gail is on vacation this
week and if you've just tuned into the YouTube channel, I had a little
adventure this morning. The computer fell from a stand. I had moved it a
little bit and it turned out to be precarious. And there's a certain irony
to this. Maybe I should introduce myself before I start speaking more. I'm Diana
Clarke. And the irony is that what I want to talk about with you this morning
and this week is about connections. And it seems that some of the connections
got broken here this morning between the computer and I don't know exactly what
I tightened everything and restarted. I'm sure there's a lesson in there, right?
Let's restart. Begin again. So connection is so important, of course, not only for
putting on a YouTube streaming broadcast but in our lives. We can understand
connection in so many different ways but this recognition that all of us want to
feel connected in some kind of way, maybe different degrees of connection or
different ways of connection but all of us would like to feel connected. And for
you who participated in this retreat that just ended and part of the design of
the retreat was to help enable this connection. Having this recognition that
it can be nice to talk with others. It can be nice to connect on the chat here.
I felt supported by you all while I was trying to figure this out. And some
researchers would say that having some connections with others, connections
with ourselves is part of a fundamental human need. It's a basic part of how
we're wired. And certainly having connections and I'm using this word
connection really broadly and my intention is to unpack it through the
upcoming days. So for now maybe you can interpret it in a way that makes sense
for you. In a way that you can connect with, if you will. But having a
connection or relationship and intimacy with, a familiarity with, a touching
with, onto or with can be tied with a sense of meaning to our lives. And also
the fear of disconnection can also have a big impact on our lives. Not to
mention some disconnections we might have already had experienced the impact
that those might have on our lives. So perhaps I don't have to convince you that
connection is a big part of the human experience and something that's important.
And then when we think about Buddhist practice, it might seem sometimes there
can be the impression, if you just read books about the philosophy of Buddhism
or read books on how to meditate or somehow maybe just listen to podcasts
or something, there can be, there might be an impression that it's a solitary
affair. After all we have so often the Buddha is depicted as being by
himself sitting upright with his eyes closed. It doesn't give the impression
about being connected to other people. But Buddhism definitely grew out of a
sense of community and connection. It wouldn't exist today if that weren't
the case. Maybe it's not as evident in the iconography that we use or the
statues that we use or some of the ways that we talk about it. But at the time
of the Buddha, of course there weren't YouTube with chat boxes and audio recordings,
there weren't books. The only way, the only way that people had access to the
Dharma, to the teachings of the Buddha was through other people, was through
their relationships with other people, either hearing other people speak or
hearing the Buddha himself give talks. And the Buddha recognized the importance
of this and we don't hear about it so much perhaps in Dharma talks but there's
a tremendous amount of teachings and maybe I'll just leave the teachings about
creating a monastic order that is a community of practitioners with this
recognition that it's within community that we can really learn about the Dharma,
we can learn from each other, we can learn about ourselves, the way in which
we get reflected back from others or the way we respond to others or whatever it
might be. So inherent in this Buddhism that we have inherited is the sense of
community and connecting to others. For me I feel it's touching to think about
this that it wasn't these cold isolated teachings but it was people getting
together, talking, sharing, listening that helped preserve Buddhism and the
monastic order for thousands of years. And we are part of this as we sit here
today, you're not here in the room with me but somehow we're connected in such
a different way of course from the Buddha's time but it doesn't mean it's
not there, I put things in the chat box here to stay connected even though you
can see or hear. So of course connection is part of how Buddhism comes to us but
it's also inherent in the practice and what we actually do with these
teachings. Some of you may be familiar that the Buddha placed a tremendous
emphasis on the company we keep, on who, with whom we associate and recognizing
the importance of our relationships and the communities and to quote something
attributed to the Buddha says, I do not see even a single thing that so causes
wholesome qualities to arise as good friendship. So recognizing the role of
friendship and then there's lots of other teachings that explore, well what does
that mean, good friendship? I won't go into this now, I'll unpack that a little
bit in the ensuing days. The Buddha recognizing how much we need one
another and for the importance of wholesome qualities I think but we're
all trying to develop here wholesome qualities including connection to
ourselves, connection to others. So also preserved in the teachings the Buddha
saying, just as the dawn is the precursor for the arising of the sun, so too.
Having a good friend is the precursor for developing the noble eightfold path.
Some of you may recognize that the noble eightfold path is one of the primary
teachings that the Buddha offered as the path to liberation. So having connections
with others and all its myriad of forms and all of its degree of intensities
and intimacies, whether it's physical or whether it's through words that we read
or YouTube thinks that we watch is a precursor and is really a tremendous
support for cultivating and developing these qualities that help us for
liberation. But of course it's not only connection with other people that is a
big support for practice, it's a connection to ourselves that's a big part
of practice. In fact we might even say that mindfulness practice in some ways
could be understood as a way of connecting to ourselves, connecting to
our experience, whether that's our mental experience or our physical
experience. For those of you who are familiar with some of the teachings
you'll know that there is emphasis on mindfulness in general including
mindfulness of the body. Feeling here the felt experience here in the present
moment, of course the body is always in the present moment. So connecting to the
body is a way in which we can be here for what's actually happening. We can be
aligned with the reality of the moment. The reality of the moment always includes
having a body.
So maybe I will end here this morning with an invitation. As you go
throughout the day just to notice how things that you're connected to and
again you can interpret this word connected but maybe there's a certain
type of touching or allowing in whether that's thoughts or ideas through
reading or through the news or maybe it's also physical experience, feeling
connected to when you're, where you're sitting and what you're sitting and
sensations in the body, emotions or thoughts. But just that invitation, what
are the things that you're connected to? How does that support you or maybe it
doesn't support you some of the things? And not only that maybe there's a
different degree of connection, maybe there's some, sometimes you feel really
connected to and maybe something's not so much. And with a recognition that all of
us have different needs, different preferences and the ways in which we
connect to others, connect to ourselves, there doesn't have to be one right way.
But the encouragement here is to just be curious about the things that you
connect to and to have a warm hearted curiosity without a sense that things
should be different or have to be different or just an exploration of
curiosity. And then may our practice the way that we connect to ourselves,
connect to others, may it be a support, may it benefit not only ourselves but
others. And may our practice together, our explorations together, I'm smiling
because I'm thinking about earlier all the support I was feeling by feeling
connected via the chat. So may our, what we are connected to and our exploration
of connection, may it be for the benefit of all beings everywhere, all beings
without exception. Thank you.
