 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So continuing from that, Earth element. And hopefully you felt as you were sitting, one of the ways that we can contact the Earth element. This way of sensing the stability. I mentioned the word contactfulness a lot. It's like we all want contact. And we might look to other people for contact or to situations, but the contact is built right into us. We're right here in contact with ground, with Earth, with the Earth in us all the time. And in that contact with the Earth, with this Earth element, we're also in contact with a very, this groundedness, a deep equanimity, a right here-ness. So this is one of the aspects of the Earth element that we can take into our practice. And we can do it, practice it as we did here. You can practice it when you're walking. If you're doing walking meditation, you can feel the contactfulness with the ground. And let yourself touch and let the roots of your feet go down into the ground. As if when you were walking, you had your plant moving, walking. Another aspect of the Earth element that's very important, and this is true of all the elements, is a very fundamental teaching of the Buddha around nazal. And here's what he says about practicing with the Earth element, internal and external. He said, internal and external are simply Earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is, with proper wisdom thus, this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. This is a very important aspect of the elements. And you heard me just touching on this in the guided meditation. This recognition that Earth element is flowing through us, that we eat and we digest and it becomes part of us and then it flows out. We either shed it off our skin or we leave it in the toilet, or ultimately it all goes from our bodies when we pass. That all of the Earth element that is here is only temporarily borrowed. And we can recognize, oh, look, this is just flowing through. This is not mine. This is not me. There is no inside outside. It's simply Earth element moving around. And I'm part of the place it moves to. And when I go for a walk, it's Earth element going for a walk. And in this we can sense that we're part of a flow, a continuity that we are Earth come alive, but we haven't separated. And this is so important. We live in a world that is in the trauma of separation. And how do we release that belief, that idea that somehow we're separate, that nature is outside, Earth is outside, other people are outside. Because when we think we're separate, that sets us up, of course, to abuse the Earth, to view the Earth as somehow something to be extracted from, to like separate. And this also leads to separation of other people, of other creatures, of otherness. And so this, oh, look, we're all made of the same thing. It's all just Earth element moving around, dropping the ownership, the colonial mindset that makes us think we can own a piece of land. Actually, the land owns us. We belong to it. Another aspect, so we are working on this journey towards dropping the separation. And one of the doorways to that is recognizing the generosity, the exchange is not just, there's not just a mechanical, there's a generosity of exchange happening here. When we eat, we're eating this incredible abundance of the Earth. I love walking through my garden, and right now there's strawberries out there. And there's not so many that I can pick a big basket of them, but there's just the right number that every time I walk by, I can lean down and pick one and be reminded of the abundance of the Earth. And I noticed that this is one of the things I love walking around in the world, in the natural world, it's like when there's berries and you pick a raspberry or a huckleberry, or perhaps the mountains near here got a lot of rain this summer. And it's to go and look at the mushrooms and to pick the few mushrooms that are actually edible and to just be amazed at these things, come up out of the ground, and then they come into this body. And we're involved in this generous exchange. And then there's simpler ways. I was just out leading a river retreat out on the river, and it was hot, and the simplicity of sitting beside a boulder in the shade of it. The generosity of the boulder's shade, the generosity of a tree and sitting under it, the generosity of the breeze moving the leaves, the leaves or earth element being flicked in the breeze. We can receive the generosity and the abundance of the Earth in so many ways. And as we do that, we naturally have this desire to want to give back to it, to realize we're in this flow, and this leads to another way that we can recognize and participate in our earthiness, that we are the...that we can take care of the Earth. And everybody's felt that, like when you go out and you... the simplest way is out in a garden or with plants. But when you make compost, if you've ever done that, it's quite miraculous that you can take all these different things and you put them in a pile and they get all hot, and then they turn into the soil and earth ready to grow again. The reciprocity of taking care of places that we know. Simple things, picking up trash that isn't there, or perhaps you write letters or are actively defend places. Edward Abbey, a person from here, from this area that I live in, Moab, Utah, once said, the wilderness needs no defense, just more defenders. And we all can participate, the generosity flowing in and flowing out. It's a reciprocal relationship. I'm going to end by reading you a short poem from Rabidranath Tagore. The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day, runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures. It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers. It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean cradle of birth and of death, in ebb and in flow. I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life and my pride is from the life throb of ages, dancing in my blood this moment. So I invite you on this day to feel your earthiness, feel your contact with the ground, feel the abundance and aliveness of being earth walking on earth, of earth breathing, of belonging, of you are earth belonging to earth. Thank you for coming this morning. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow if you'd like to join again. Thank you.
