The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay.
One of the ways I think about meditation is
making space for
our experience to be the way it is.
I think in so much of our
usual life, we are
very actively controlling
and shaping experience.
And
making efforts to change
what we don't want into what we want.
There's some way that in meditation practice, we can discover
that
these efforts
are useful and helpful in many ways.
But
there are aspects to the mind, to the heart
and maybe to our lives that we can't control.
They're out of our control.
And meditation practice
can help us to make sense
of this element of experience, this dimension of
maybe of human life that is
not controllable.
That's not within our realm of
agency.
And
I think each of us is faced with this
dilemma. And then how
do we respond to that?
So often what I say
is that in meditation practice, we are
experiencing
an unedited version of ourselves.
If usually
we are somehow
editing experience and
fixing the mistakes and crossing this out and putting
them in, that's good. It can make something nice and presentable.
But there can be a tremendous amount of freedom that comes
in meditation from allowing ourselves to have
an uncensored, unedited experience.
Just to see where does the mind go? What are the thoughts that
arise? What's happening in the body?
And to bring an attentiveness,
to the various
sensations in the body,
the various images and
thoughts and feelings that pass through the heart, pass through the mind.
And one of the things we can sometimes
discover is that
various emotions arise
in meditation. And
it can be very valuable to learn to
in some way welcome,
tune in to what emotions may be present, to welcome emotions,
and to really meet them
with respect, with care, with kindness.
First of all, because they're there.
They either notice them or we don't, but they're there.
And secondly,
one of the principles of Dharma practice
is that
our experience, our perception, is colored,
is influenced by whatever emotions
are present.
And I think we all know this in the
basic sense of
if I'm feeling rushed
and stressed and tired and
irritated,
a person can
say something to me.
It will be perceived one way.
There can be a reaction.
If the feeling in the mind and the heart is open,
is calm, is relaxed, that same
whatever comment or piece of bad news or something
may land in a totally different way.
So our emotions have a big impact
on how we experience our life.
But it turns out that most of us
speak for myself,
don't have so much skill in
really attuning to and identifying
what are the emotions that are here right now.
I was thinking about when I first began
meditation practice and it was in the context of having a physical
illness when I was in college.
And I learned to do body scan
meditation and
mindful yoga and that kind of thing through John Kabat-Sin, one of his early books.
It was tremendously helpful.
So for a couple of hours each day I would follow along
these cassettes, if you remember cassettes.
And it was like
learning to have a different experience of myself,
of this kind of moment-to-moment awareness of sensations
in stretching or in just kind of scanning through the body.
And if you haven't done this practice, it's very,
very wonderful because if you're caught
in thoughts or you're caught in emotions
that you're likely not aware of, this practice
is a,
we learn a way of just immersing into the moment-to-moment
experience of body,
of breath. And in doing that
it's almost like there's no space for this thinking,
this worrying, these fears, this whatever, to get in.
Because we're just attending to the sensation of lifting,
of stretching, of scanning, of feeling the body
in a such wonderful practice. And this is kind of our
foundational practice of mindfulness of breath and body.
But what I didn't really
learn in that practice or what I didn't really pick up was
that there were whole big areas of my
emotional life that
could be attended to in the same way,
could be met with mindfulness, could be noticed.
It never occurred to me to notice what emotion might be
present right now.
And being young and a student and on my own
for the first time and being sick, I'm sure there were a lot of emotions that were
present. But, you know,
that wasn't part of my conception
of what was possible,
what was practice or something. And it was only
years later that I realized that there
was a huge aspect of experience, of my own experience
that was sort of outside of the spotlight.
You know, if you have a spotlight on something that's illuminated
but then everything else is dark. And it turns
out that what was not being illuminated, what
was dark, was pretty important.
And so it was when I was
on a longer retreat
a couple of years into my practice
at Tasahara, some of you might know Tasahara,
the Zen wonderful Zen mountain center
near Big Sur. And I had the
sort of insight or the
light bulb moment that, wait a second,
there's a lot of fear present right now.
And then in noticing
this kind of, why? Why would I be afraid? Or why is there fear here?
And kind of sensing into the felt
body experience of that emotion, that
fear, began to have this sense
of, wow, maybe there's kind of this
low level fear that has been present
from, that maybe it's always
seems like it's always here, or maybe it's been present for
so much of my experience. And I wasn't aware of it. I didn't notice it.
And it was like
there was sort of a great feeling in noticing
that because it's sort of like, if you sort of have
an inkling that something's there, or something's a little
bit off or something, but you don't know what it is. And then to find
and say, aha, that's what it is. And it was like, oh great,
I can, now I have some
sort of like there's a handle on it. I could
learn how to meet it, and to understand it,
breathe with it, and maybe
let it go, and be free from it, or learn to harmonize
with it. And this
realization that if an emotion like
fear, or a mind state like fear is present,
and I'm not aware of it, then it's much more likely
that I'm going to
act out of it in unconscious ways.
It's like, if I don't bring it into awareness
it's going to be acting
in the background, and fueling certain kinds
of thoughts, fueling certain kinds of decisions.
But when I notice it, when I say, okay, fear
is present, and invited in
without judgment, without thinking that
it shouldn't be here, or it should be some different way, just
to welcome it, and to, okay,
where is it manifesting
in this energetic being?
Where is it manifesting physically?
What kind of mood
is this fear creating? Just noticing, just making
space for this emotion
to be there, then it's much less likely
that I'll be acting
unconsciously out of it.
In any case
it gives more choice, you know. Maybe I do act
out of it, or maybe I do
allow it to
inform
actions, but at least there's some awareness, there's some
consciousness to it.
So over time in my own practice
I've come to have a lot of respect for the power
and the beauty, and almost the sacredness
of our emotional life, that this is a very important
aspect of being human
and what is it to
care for it, to welcome emotions, to learn
how to recognize them,
to name them.
This is really a skill, if it's like
how precise can I be
in naming the emotion
that may be present right now, rather than just saying
this is
there's anger present.
What's the difference between irritation
and frustration and annoyance
and
impatience, and these have a different
quality. And it may not
matter so much to get the exact word, right?
But in the process of doing that
it sort of
opens the door for a certain kind of investigation
to look at this feeling of stress, of frustration
or whatever might be there, and to investigate
to examine it, to
meet it with a certain kind of
it's almost like a clinical
awareness. What is this? What's happening
right now? Then we're less likely to
identify with that emotion and say well that's really
me, that's mine, I own it. And so there's
a little bit of an impersonal distance
that we can get.
And from the point of view of the Dharma
whatever emotion is present, whatever emotion is passing
through is not me, is not mine.
It's just, you know, it's
as impermanent as the sounds of the cars, it's as
impermanent as the sensations of the body passing through.
But for emotions
it's easy to say okay, the sound of the truck is not me.
Even maybe this sensation
of coolness
cold air in the room is not me, or
maybe even this sensation of
that I associate with the knee or the back, okay that's not me.
But this emotion that's connected to this
memory and these thoughts, that's really
me. That's part of my
biography, it's part of my history, or it's part of my
thoughts about the future, my fears, my hopes.
So we identify
with emotions so easily as part of
our
as part of who we really are.
And so to say check that out, what are the emotions that
feel like oh that's really me. And for
many of us it's not so much, we can let go
of the positive emotions and the sense of joy and calm and
but shame, guilt,
fear, that's me, that's really me.
And so to check that out, you know, what is there some way
that I'm sort of
hooking onto emotions or emotion, certain emotion
has a hook for me.
And so emotions
have this sort of, there's something compelling about them, they seduce
us, they have a certain kind of, can have a certain
kind of power over us and we believe them.
We believe the various thoughts
and
stories that are connected to emotions.
So to just take a look at that.
Some of you might have heard this acronym called
RAIN. You know, it's
often a
mnemonic that is one
approach in vipassana and insight meditation
for working with emotions. And it stands for
recognize, accept,
investigate, and name.
It's a nice word to remember.
I would respectfully offer that maybe a more
helpful order would be
let's see.
Recognize, you know, to first just recognize
a strong emotion is present. And
this is a very useful approach
when we need it. You know, not necessarily to go
looking for some strong emotion, but there will be times when we sit
that, you know,
wow, there's a lot of fear coming up.
There's a lot of
sadness present.
Or maybe there's just a lot of joy and a lot of
excitement and happiness, but to just recognize
okay, there's a strong emotion here.
And then
to
accept,
you know, okay, this
emotion is present.
Rather than
thinking it shouldn't be there, or there's something wrong, or there's
some mistake, to really, as much as possible,
cultivate
a quality of
welcoming, of openness.
And then, you know, so as
this acronym goes, it's
investigate.
Where is this emotion present?
How is it being expressed right now? How is it
being manifest? What are the thoughts connected to this emotion?
What's the energetic quality?
And this is very, very useful. Is it possible to drop out of the
story of the emotion and find it in the body somewhere?
And the benefit of doing this is that often
with strong emotions, they're fed
by a certain kind of thinking.
If there's a feeling of regret, or
anger, or something, there's probably a story connected to that.
It can go over the story again and again and again, or this conversation.
And to actually
drop into the body, sort of short circuits
of that loop of repetitive thinking.
Find it in the body.
What are the sensations in the body that are connected to this feeling, this emotion?
Breathe with it, be with it, meet it with
some care, some kindness.
And then to name, you know, is it possible
to put a word onto this experience, this emotion?
And in doing that, in naming something,
we get a little bit of distance from it.
It's not just me, me, me, my problems, my experience.
It's, oh, this is grief,
this is sadness, this is fear.
We have a name for it. It's not
so unique and personal.
There are details and aspects that are unique,
but there's an aspect that is so universal
that every human being
has experienced these kinds of emotions.
And how
I relate to these emotions
will determine whether
there's suffering and more pain, or whether they bring freedom.
Whether there's a way to, even in the midst
of my emotional life, can I be free?
Can I be happy?
Can I make peace with these emotions?
Is there some way that the mind can be safe
for these emotions to be there?
So it takes a certain kind of softness.
It takes a certain kind of willingness
to open to the experience that we're having.
And for some emotions,
maybe they only appear when there's a certain
degree of quiet.
And, you know,
the kind of doing mind has relaxed enough
that something more tender,
something more subtle,
can arise.
One of the images I have is sort of like the shy
puppy that maybe hasn't been treated so
well, or maybe it's a rescue dog.
And it takes a lot of trust,
a lot of stillness and silence and trust for that
puppy to be willing to come over to us
and eat from our hand,
and trust that we're not going to
be violent, we're not going to attack,
we're not going to, you know,
be meeting with an open hand.
And so that's in some way an image for meditation
to meet experience with an open hand.
And let go of all the ways
that we, maybe violence is a strong word,
but I think we can be violent with ourselves.
We can be so critical
and so forceful
that maybe these emotions
there's no chance for these feelings to be listened to.
You know, it takes a lot of trust.
So...
Maybe I'll end with this poem.
Yes, sure.
Yeah.
That's the acronym.
So the question is, would it be more appropriate
to investigate before we accept?
You know, I was going there a little bit with
what's the order of these
and I think it's
for each of us to sort of sense into what
happens. So as the acronym goes,
recognize, accept, investigate,
name.
Totally fine to investigate
first. Totally fine to, I mean,
maybe investigation is what comes first. And then, through our investigation,
through what's going on right now. You know, investigation,
we always think of it's like the question, what is it? What is this?
We invest from our investigation,
maybe then we start to recognize, oh, there's an emotion here.
And maybe from recognizing
there's emotion, a name, a label,
or something arises, oh, okay, I can identify this.
This is fear. And then
through this process, we come to acceptance.
We come to, you know, so there's different ways of, you know,
it can unfold in so many different ways.
But hopefully it has, you know,
each of these elements somewhere in there that
figure out what's going on, take a closer look, investigate,
begin to
name it,
and accept it and welcome it, that it's happening.
So yeah, if that makes more sense to you, that's totally, that's really
great.
What I think is not so helpful, and I've noticed
this in my own experience, is just to very quickly try to
short circuit something and go to
naming it and accepting it
and hoping it goes away.
You know, I like, okay, fear.
Fear, you know.
And one of the good
litmus tests for acceptance
that I learned from one of my teachers is that
he was puzzled because
he was with some strong emotion.
I think it was fear, and
you know, naming it, naming it, watching the sensations,
accepting, accepting, and
at some point he realized
that his
the way he was
meeting it was sort of like as a
strategy to get it to go away as soon as possible.
And so he asked himself this question, if this
fear is here for the rest of my life,
is this okay? You know, just ask that question
and then from deep in his being the answer
was, no!
And in that moment he realized that
there wasn't a sense of genuine acceptance present.
There was this kind of acceptance that was a strategy
to get it to quickly go away.
And so what would it look like
to be so
at peace with whatever, you know, however this emotion is
that it's okay if it's here for
forever. You know, and most of us, if we ask that question, we may not be there.
You know, but it sort of opens the door
to sort of see what does a full
and genuine acceptance look like, and what is
acceptance as a sort of
you know, strategy
for getting what I want. And so okay,
can I get a little bit closer to this genuine acceptance?
So that's
you know, help, that's always been helpful
for me to just check out
what would it
be like to really be okay with this
feeling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. So
example being if you have cancer
and
yeah, and it's very interesting that
sometimes
it's like
the very resistance to what we don't want keeps something locked
in and keeps something negative, you know, locked in that
when there can be a full acceptance of something, even if it's something
that's terrible or something that's painful,
then
an incredible lightness of being can come, you know, when I think that's
one of the stages of
grief, you know, is acceptance.
The final stage, I think, but I have known people
who in having
a terminal diagnosis and when they
got to this place of acceptance, they became so
happy. It was like, you know, the happiest
and saying, I have never felt more happy and more
alive than I do right now. And even if their time
wasn't so long after that, they were just these radiant
beings, you know, and
it was quite a
lesson for me that there is something in that letting go
and so fully embracing how things are
that they became so happy, so free
and maybe in a way that
time
sort of lost its power, you know, they were almost in this
timeless dimension and didn't live
for so much longer after that, but how they were,
the quality of their life, their being, it was quite a
it was a powerful teaching for me
in the power of acceptance and the power of
when there's no resistance, when there's nothing
to fear anymore, you know, all that energy that was going
into fear, into resistance, into trying to sort of
fight, they were freed from that.
And I don't know if that is
appropriate in every circumstance, if that's true, you know,
if that's the right thing for every
situation, but for that particular person, it seemed
to unlock something just magical.
And
so there's going to be tremendous power, you know, in each of these
pieces of recognizing
you know, if we don't recognize what's happening
we are at its mercy, you know.
It's more likely or not it's going to control us,
especially strong emotions, will control us in ways we're completely
unaware of, but we act out of it.
So tremendous power in just recognizing what's happening, in accepting,
in developing a kind of curiosity, an interest
of investigation.
So thank you.
Maybe I'll read this and then there will be more time for questions.
This is from William Stafford who is the same poet that
I quoted last week.
And I think he has this wonderful, I think
through his poems he evokes this kind
of quality of
openness, of investigation, of willingness to
make space for things, make space for
ourselves. And what I think goes along with that, a willingness to
make mistakes, you know, and what is a mistake anyway,
you know. So this is called You
and Art. Your exact
errors make a music that nobody hears.
Your straying feet find the great dance
walking alone. And you live on a world
where stumbling always leads you home.
Year after year fits over your face.
When there was youth, your talent was youth.
Later you find your way by touch
thus redeems the stone.
And you discover where music begins before
it makes any sound. Far in the mountains
where canyons go, still as the always
falling, ever new flakes of snow.
So, you know, if there's anything
that I take away from
this exploration
of emotions is that
as much as possible
to, you know,
like you say,
your exact errors make a music.
Emotions
aren't a mistake. There's no
correct emotion or incorrect emotion. And to
really make the space for allowing
you know, make the safety for allowing whatever emotions are present
to express themselves. And to
trust that there's tremendous value in bringing
more and more of our emotional
being into awareness, into mindfulness.
And
I love this image of tracing
the music back. You know, tracing
the movement, the emotion, the movements of mind, movements of
heart. If we patiently follow them and trace them
back, maybe we come to this place of stillness.
You know, and this place of peacefulness
that is, that's,
maybe that's always been there. And that's not in conflict
with, with, you know,
the
ups and downs and the, you know, the
various melodies
of our emotional life.
But the more
the more we can meet it, meet this aspect with
kindness, with softness. We tremendous,
tremendous benefit from this.
Thank you very much.
Any more questions, comments?
I
was wondering if
you could explore the issue of
antidotes a minute. A bit
because the rain
process of recognize,
investigate, accept it, name it.
Not me.
It doesn't include a, any
aspect of overcoming it, except
by accepting it, recognizing this is part of life.
This is maybe my
lot, or this is the way things are
in the moment, or
future moments, as opposed to strategies
that are, that may antidote this
afflictive emotion. So say there's
an emotion of fear, anxiety, which is pushing something
away. If you
haven't antidote to that, like
loving kindness, for example, has been suggested
to me, in various contexts, as
a solution to anxiety.
A way to actually transform
anxiety. Or say there's a, someone, some
doctor gives you a diagnosis from their perspective
that you have cancer, which is terminal,
and there's nothing we can do, and so we can apply palliative
efforts, or whatever. And then, of course
there are many case examples
of people who have lived for many, many years after that
with various kinds of strategies. And in studies
one strategy that seems to work really well is denial.
So people who,
they've done studies in people who have kind of an accepting or
hopeless attitude, well this is the way things are, tend to
do worse, have worse outcomes, than
people who say, no, that's not true.
I don't, that's what you think, but I don't
think that's happening. And
so these are, to me, different kinds of
reactions or antidotes that are more active
than this process of just accepting
things the way they are. So it seems like
different kinds of strategies that
maybe you have some ideas about that.
Yeah, thank you. It's a great, it's a great question and comment
and
what I would say to that
is, I guess the way I think about it is that
almost in a way mindfulness itself is the best antidote.
You know, if
not that mindfulness can sort of dissolve any emotion
or solve any emotion or something like that, but the more
we're aware of, you know, mindfulness is like
we get the terrain, we sort of know, okay this is
what's going on right now. And
what it does is then it gives us
maybe some choice where we
might not have felt choice before. If I'm just, you know, really
stressed and really pissed off and really, or in a lot of fear
or just had a really unpleasant
disrespectful exchange with a doctor who gave bad
news and I'm just, you know,
and then I get in my car and start going somewhere,
it would be tremendously helpful to
take a moment and check in and bring
some mindfulness to, you know, just what's going on and the emotions that are present.
And then that gives some choice
and it may be that
the choice is to apply
a wise and skillful antidote. You know, so maybe, so if there's a lot of
anxiety, let's say I'm going to give a talk
somewhere or work or something and there's a lot of anxiety that's
coming up and I'm about to, and I say, well wait a second,
you know, okay check in, okay
this is mindfulness, right? Okay, there's fear, there's anxiety present.
So wait a second, it feels like I'm about to go into this really life
threatening, dangerous situation. Is that true? You know, is that really
what's happening here? Well, no, it's just I'm just going
to give a presentation. I've done this, you know, 100
times before, 100 times it's always been okay.
I'm familiar with this anxiety.
What's the skillful, you know, wise response here?
The acceptance piece is accepting that it's here.
But as you say, there may be a place for an antidote.
It may be like, it may be loving kindness,
it may be remembering my intention.
Why am I doing this? What is this about? You know,
oh yeah, this is to help people and give them information that they really need.
Or this is, you know,
these are all people who
like me and want me to succeed.
So whatever it is in cultivating some feelings of love
or goodwill or whatever, then you kind of feel like the system
sort of calming down.
So I think there are many times
that an antidote can be helpful. I think the thing to be
helpful with antidotes is
that to rush into an antidote
before I fully feel what's going on.
You know, it's like, because it can be used
as a sort of, you know, I'm going to spray
this, you know, just, you know,
there's a pest here, which is my fear,
my anger, my uncomfortableness, and I'm going to just spray it
with loving kindness, with
concentration, with, you know, any of these things, and just
eradicate this unpleasant emotion.
Then, you know, it's like, you often say, the problem is not that it doesn't
work, but it almost works.
So we get to a place, and that's the name for that
in meditative circles, or one of the names for that is this bypass.
You know, the spiritual bypass, just in the way that
like a surgical bypass,
bypasses the blockage with some new, you know, just pull some
veins out of the leg or whatever, and you know, and it's
amazing, right? It's great. We can do bypass.
You know, what is it to emotionally bypass? It's like to say,
well, there's this blockage here, there's this unpleasant
uncomfortable feeling, and I'm going to just go around it
with, you know, concentration
or loving kindness, or
you know, and
sometimes that will be skillful, and then sometimes that will actually
I mean, the classic
cautionary tale is that it can be so effective
that it produces teachers who
have tremendous
meditative skill in certain areas,
but also have tremendous blind spots, and tremendous
areas where there's not
that the light of awareness hasn't fully
shined and metabolized that.
So when, you know, I don't know if it's always the
case, but when teachers
you know, act out and there's a kind of
misconduct, I mean, you know, there's one Tibetan teacher who has like
been called out for not only sexual, but also just like very violent
acts towards his close students. It's like, how is
this possible? This person who has tremendous
wisdom in certain area, but
there's some aspect of their emotional life maybe that has not
been included. It's not been fully processed and
metabolized and met with mindfulness. So
that's why
I'm a little bit cautious of, you know, I think antidotes
are wonderful and very powerful, you know, so it's antidote
as like bringing the opposite in or bringing some skillful way of working with it
and I think for sure there's a place for that. But even before
that, there's something about really meeting
it as it is and that willingness to meet
it as it is. And so
that's one perspective, you know, and different people fall different
places on that. And thank you.
Wait, I just want to give her a chance.
I think it's on. Boy, the antidote question
is absolutely fascinating. I really love that you ask this question, so I'm just going to
throw my two cents just because I want to partake in the discussion.
So my take on it is that
in your example, which was absolutely fabulous, like what if doctor gives cancer
diagnosis and there are studies that absolutely show that people
who are in denial do better, like they live for longer.
But I think when we talk about acceptance, we talk about
accepting our own experience, not that somebody else says you
because if like a doctor in position of authority has an opinion, it's
still an opinion like it might be right, might be wrong, whatever.
So that's totally my take. And
I think the reason why I'm so agitated about this antidote
things because it has been incredibly helpful to me personally.
I would for a long time try just to
accept things and I would be wallowing in my own things, but then
I sort of separated for me in terms of timeline. It's acceptance
of what's happening, but then it doesn't preclude what you do in the future.
So like acceptance of your experience in this particular
moment and then applying the antidote. And I'm absolutely pumped
about the fact that I always was doing the antidote
of aversion and loving kindness, but I would
still do stupid things that I am very much prone to do in health
regard. And then I learned it about, and I heard it many
many times, but it never actually sink into my mind.
The antidote about wanting something of greed and impermanence
that stuff works. It's really, really awesome.
So sorry for my agitated rumble. I just really like this topic.
Yeah, great, great. Thank you.
I like that.
I have known
a friend who is very interested in mind-body healing
and she was given a diagnosis
that was challenging
and she said, no thank you.
She actually
had the, I think it was a kind of
wrist surgery or something, that she had the surgery
and it was a success. And then she, they had the follow-up appointment
and the doctor said, okay, it was a success, but listen
you should know that it's never going to be the same as your other wrist.
It's never going to fully heal strongly. It's going to hurt when
it rains. She's just looking at him like, are you
crazy? And she said, no thank you. No, not me.
Not me. And she felt that
she was not,
she was, so in her philosophy, accept the
diagnosis, but not the prognosis. So she said,
that's right. I diagnosed it, he did what he could,
but why should I believe what his opinion of what he thinks
is going to, you know, it's my body, my mind.
And she said whatever my, you know, and so she had this attitude
and then she did, found a different doctor
who said, no, yeah, you should fully heal and did the physical therapy and
you know, it's one example, but what I loved is that she didn't
fully just take on what the other person said.
She didn't say, I'm just, I'm never going to,
she did physical therapy, she did what she thought
would be helpful, but she reserved the right
way to have her own opinions about it.
And so, yeah, you know, maybe there's some combination of that
that could, well, in healing.
Thank you.
So I too also really appreciate
what you said about spiritual blind spots and that
teachers who've advanced that sometimes you hear about
just ways that they've really faltered
and ended up hurting people. It's just a huge lesson for me
because I've, I always have this kind of skepticism
when someone's a little too charismatic or too
kind of too spiritually perfect and so it's just, it's
interesting to hear that and someone else told me in a different tradition
just a few weeks ago that the medicine wheel and the west
traditionally is the dark spot in that tradition like the things that are difficult
to face and, you know, and she was saying how some
people overlook that. They just want to go right to the
place of spiritual awareness and beauty and
that we need to pass through that. We need to be aware of our, so
the one thing is it makes me want to start talking to a teacher more to find
my own blind spots, which I have some ideas, but that would be
a long to go into here. My original question I wanted to
ask was when you mentioned noticing
your emotions and also the nuances like how
irritation, frustration, anxiety, whatever, how they
all have a little different flavor or nuance.
So when I notice them, whatever, all
these emotions and I try to do that, right? I remember what
you and countless other teachers say, so I'm trying to notice, be
aware, but what happens is my brain kind of gets involved
with thinking what to label this, what's different, so I'm not
quite sure how to do it and just be aware
without that brain activity coming in a lot. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, thank you for all
of that and
just a comment of what you said earlier, I think
it's very hard for us to see our own blind spots
and that's where there's tremendous value in community,
in being with others who are mirrors for us
in talking to a teacher or spiritual friend or something, if that
seems appropriate at the time, because, you know,
I want to check this out with you or this happened or this or
because it's, the mind is so
persuasive and is so, we can really
rationalize anything, justify anything, we have our habits,
we have our conditioning, so, you know, even for teachers
that's, I think, a lot of teachers run into problems because
they don't have peers, you know, and they're kind of isolated
and they're, you know, kind of, there's all this projection to one
local point and so one of the things, not that our scene is perfect
by any stretch of the imagination, but we do
a lot of team teaching, especially on retreats and it's very, I think it's
very healthy, you know, to have that kind of, you know,
it's not a guru model and, you know, you know that you're, if you're giving a
talk and the other teachers are sitting there listening to you, you kind of say something,
you'll probably hear about it that night.
So it sort of gives this check of things.
So that and
then about, yeah, about this noting or labeling or
naming,
the way I think about it is to allow it to be
a natural outcome from
a sort of open, non-verbal
investigation. So if there's a way of sort of
investigation is sort of like looking close, more closely,
getting closer to what's happening, attending to the
sensations, the different thoughts, feelings, and then there may
arise of, oh, okay, this is, this is anxiety
or this is fear or this is, but if it feels like we're getting too
much caught in the weeds or too much into a cognitive thing,
it's really fine to just let it go instead of come back to the
feeling of it in the body, you know, return to the investigation
because at the end of the day, it's not that important to get
you know, whatever the precise word. It's more
about that helps us to just
unhook a little. If we can put a name to it,
then we're not, maybe we're not so
identified and hooked in and
so, but anyway, it's a great question.
Okay, thanks.
So I love the rain idea.
I feel like in this conversation, we've
used the word acceptance to be like acceptance of a diagnosis
to me is a different thing than acceptance
of the emotion around the diagnosis.
So I'll use fear and I, because we're talking about
fear, there's so many other emotions one could do and I'd like, if you
could help clarify a little bit, where I see if you get a diagnosis,
let's say it's something extreme,
I would hope that you would do your due diligence
for yourself on the appropriate approach
to getting second opinions, figuring out what
you believe, what you don't believe. There's so much around that
void of emotion, then there's the whole
emotional side which here, there's so much fear
and so much forward thinking that goes on around
a health issue, whether it's yours or someone you care about
or others. So I think when you talked
about rain, you specifically talked about using it
for emotions and there I feel like this idea
gives perspective of not making your emotion
consume you in a situation that's
extreme like a health situation.
So if you could talk a little about the separation of accepting
the world as it is, as we do in mindfulness,
sometimes it's not just emotions, it's stuff.
And sometimes it's good stuff, but a lot of times it's crappy stuff.
But specifically on rain, how we,
the kind of perspective it might give and that it feels to me, the way
you described it, more your emotional,
additional exercise versus or practice versus a
fact based
practice. Yeah, yeah, no thank you. I appreciate
that and I think that's, that, you know, when I told the story of
when I was sick and was doing this kind of mindfulness practice
but had no idea that I could also include emotions
and that there was a value in doing that. And that
I mean, I think that's really where
we tend to look through emotions into the world.
So it's like this filter, right? It's this, it colors
experience and there's tremendous value, tremendous power
to cultivating the
ability to turn and look directly at the emotion itself.
And that, like you said, so if we have a difficult conversation
or bad news or something
you know, acceptance
may come in in the sense of if we've done our
due diligence and there's, you know, okay, yeah, you have a broken bone or you have this
or you have that. You know, I could, I could just be like, no I
don't, you know, and, you know, just whatever. And maybe there's
wisdom in saying, okay, this is, seems to be what's going on here
and now I have some choices around what to do with that and
or to do due diligence about figuring out if this is something to be accepted
if this is really true, if this is, but regardless
of that, there's this whole sphere of emotions that have been
very likely sparked and
triggered by this and are very likely present and
very strong. And so to take some time and really
meet that with care and with respect and to say, what's going
on here? Okay, what a, wow, there's a lot of fear. There's a lot
of anger. There's a lot of, you know, whatever. And
and yeah, and that's really where
this rain approach is relevant.
And to be able to just acknowledge it and name it
it doesn't like make it
go away necessarily. It doesn't, but it sort of gives us
some healthy way, maybe healthy way of relating to it
and then we can sort of say or
acknowledge I have too much anger towards
this doctor to, I don't think there can be a healthy healing
relationship here because I'm realizing that these emotions are so strong
and then it can inform some decisions that we make or
there's so much fear. I don't want to, I don't want to make a decision
out of this right now. I want to take some time and just really be with this
and process it and talk to someone. I can process it on the level
of emotion. So, yeah.
Does that, does that speak to
Yeah, I just, I think in a different kind of, I felt like we were coming to like
the word acceptance. And I found
dealing with the emotion, the other side
with the emotional side extremely helpful to create
some space away from it so you could have
that and accept it and be happy
once in a while too. And you can kind of coexist with
different emotional states. Nice. Yeah,
absolutely. And you know
the emotion is there whether we accept it or not.
So there's tremendous, when we can
bring acceptance into it, we're aligning
ourselves with what's true. And there's a tremendous
power in that even if it's not the truth that we would
choose or the truth that we want, you know, and often it isn't. But
when we're not resisting, it frees
up a lot of, a lot of energy. So
yeah, thank you. Okay, well thank you very
much. A really nice discussion and
be well. Thank you.
