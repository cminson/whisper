One of the primary tasks of mindfulness meditation is 
to arrive in the present moment. And so what does it 
take to arrive here? It ’s often like a journey to get 
where you are, because the mind is somewhere else, 
or involved in other things, or reacting to what ’s here; 
it doesn ’t want to be here.  
 
There are many approaches, many practices to help 
us arrive here.  One interesting one that I offer you 
today is to ask yourself the question, “What needs to 
be accepted so that you can be more fully here? ”  
 
So, for example, there might be a distracted mind . 
Your mind ’s wandering off a lot, and you think, “Well 
that’s not really the practice; the practice is to not to 
be distracted; it ’s to be here. Keep coming back to the 
breath; keep coming back to the breath. ” And what 
needs to be accepted is in fact that the  mind is 
distracted. Once you  see that  and accept it – you 
don’t accept it like you just agree that you can just 
continue being distracted – but you don ’t struggle 
against it. You don ’t fight it; you don ’t oppose it; you 
don’t ignore it.  2  
And then in that acceptance there can be a clear, 
stronger pre sence of mindfulness recognizing , “This is 
what ’s happening now. ” There might be strong 
feelings; there migh t be a lot of sound in the room  and 
you think,  “If onl y those sounds weren ’t there , then I 
could really be present. ” And so what needs to be 
accepted is the sound. The sound is happening in the 
present moment.  
 
So it’s an interesting question to ask yourself, and to 
help you arrive and to be more fully here, to be 
attentive: What is it that needs acceptance, right now, 
so I can be present?
