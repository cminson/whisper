The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So over the last few weeks, we've been exploring bringing practice,
talking about how we might bring practice into the midst of daily life.
And we've talked about a lot of different things over the last few weeks.
One of the main pieces, I'm just going to recap a little bit here at the beginning.
One of the main pieces we've explored is recognizing or noticing in that moment when mindfulness returns.
That moment in sitting practice, we often think of as kind of a throwaway moment or something.
It's like, oh, I haven't been mindful.
And yet that recognition of mindfulness returning in that moment,
the noticing, getting familiar with that moment.
And we can do this in our sitting practice.
Just get really curious about what does it feel like for mindfulness to be realizing.
Because that moment in daily life is so helpful to just notice mindfulness returns in the midst of all kinds of things.
Opening the refrigerator door, taking a bite of food, walking out the door, getting into the car,
going through the grocery store at various places, reaching and picking something off a shelf.
Mindfulness can return.
And the feeling, the recognition of it, cultivates the capacity for it.
There's one teaching that's something like, the proximate cause for mindfulness is mindfulness.
And like, you might think that's hopeless, but because mindfulness returns spontaneously,
and if we can recognize that or kind of get interested in that moment, get interested in that experience,
then we can get interested in that.
The recognition of it, we begin to see it happens a lot more than we thought.
And then we can begin to get familiar with the experience of mindfulness as it's continuing.
Just in the midst of ordinary experience, I think too with our sitting practice,
we think of cultivating mindfulness with some ordinary experience such as the breathing.
But we're not usually aware so much of the level of experience that we attend to
in our sitting meditation in our daily life.
And so there's another shift around mindfulness, awareness in our daily life
that we just become of ordinary things.
We know we're walking while we're walking.
We know we're reaching and touching things while we're reaching and touching them.
We know we're washing the dishes while we're washing the dishes.
This is a form of mindfulness, and the Buddha actually pointed to it in the Satipatanasuta,
mindfulness of the body.
He says, one acts with full awareness while walking, standing, sitting, while reaching,
while bending one's limbs, while eating and speaking and keeping silent,
while doing everything that we do.
Just the ordinariness of experience, we can know that.
And the familiarity with what it's like to be mindful helps us to connect with this ordinary level of experience.
And then as we connect with that ordinary level of experience,
as there's a little bit more possibility to be present for stretches of time.
And we talked a little bit about this in one week, kind of the attempting to,
or the exploration of carrying a mindfulness through activities.
We use the exploration around neither tarrying nor hurrying,
just doing things at a pace that supports our ability to be mindful.
And we can be mindful in an ordinary way, around chores or things that are simple,
that don't require a lot of mental activity.
Just that recognition of, oh, I'm washing my dishes while I'm washing my dishes,
or chopping vegetables, or reading an email while I'm reading an email.
And as the mindfulness begins to have a little bit more continuity while we're doing ordinary things,
it's like the mindfulness begins to spread through that ordinary stuff
and reveal some of the things that are a little more subtle below it.
How we feel about it, what our moods, our thoughts, our ideas, our beliefs are about it.
And this too, at a slightly, it's not at the deepest level at first,
but at a level that really supports our capacity to recognize
whether we are suffering around something or at ease around something.
How are we washing the dishes? Are we all tight and constricted, or is there ease?
So a simple, we may move into an ability to recognize when there's constriction
and when there's ease throughout our day in the ordinariness of our lives.
This whole exploration takes, it takes some resolve, I would say.
It takes some commitment, it takes some patience, some qualities that really support,
these are qualities that are listed in one of the Buddhas,
or one of the, actually it's more in the commentaries, a list of the Paramis,
a list of qualities that are supportive for our practice.
Resolve and patience are two of the qualities that are listed in this,
a list of wholesome qualities that are cultivated as we practice.
I think of these two as being some of the foundational qualities for daily life practice.
Because there's so many things in daily life that we have habits about not being mindful.
And it is just simply habit. It is the way we've lived our lives.
We've lived our lives getting involved in various worries, concerns, plans,
thinking that the involvement is the way through them.
And not so aware, not having really learned the possibility of being aware with them.
I think sometimes we think that living our lives, if we live our lives and try to be mindful,
it's like carrying something extra with us.
And it is a process by which the mindfulness begins to grow,
but with, it takes some resolve, this quality I just mentioned,
it takes some resolve, it takes some commitment to,
I want to develop this quality of mindfulness.
Now that resolve doesn't have to be like forcing ourselves to be mindful every moment of the day,
but to recognize, to have a commitment, to recognize when mindfulness returns,
to recognize when we are mindful, to be curious about experience.
That will begin to grow and develop that capacity, which then further strengthens it.
So it does take some commitment.
And I think some of that commitment is when we recognize the return of mindfulness,
when we recognize that we've been lost,
when we recognize that we've been engaged in things that are not helpful,
that we simply start again.
In that moment we don't like tell ourselves that it's hopeless,
or I guess this doesn't work for me, or you know, I'll never figure this out.
The commitment or the resolve is to at that moment understand, pick up,
I guess I keep trying.
And to really, a piece there that's useful to reflect on is,
the deep habits we have around not being mindful.
And it is a habit.
It's not me.
It's not me saying, I don't want to be mindful.
It's more that it's just the habit.
And so to just kind of honor and respect that, wow, those habits are strong.
And it does take some commitment to keep it in our minds,
to hold it in our minds, that this is something that's worth cultivating,
that's worth exploring.
So that commitment, that resolve is such an important part of the daily life practice.
And then the patience, because it is so challenging.
Those habits are so strong.
And so I think the resolve and patience really work together,
at least in my own practice, have really supported me in my daily life.
That patience, like when that mindfulness returns and I see, yep, it's been that way.
You know, it's like the patience with the mind that keeps getting caught,
getting lost, and the resolve to just keep trying.
With that kind of commitment, there is a movement in the direction of more and more mindfulness
in our daily lives, and the value of that becomes clear.
The value of recognizing when there's constriction and when there's openness,
when the mind is tight, when it's caught in beliefs and views,
when it's engaged in skillful, wholesome action, when it's engaged in skillful, unwholesome action.
And so we've talked about some of those areas too, how to work with challenging habits of mind,
how to work with difficult content, particularly in the news.
And last week, talking about working with speech, how to work with being aware while speaking.
And woven through all of this in our daily lives is, because our daily lives are so relational,
we're engaged with being with other people, acting with other people.
A lot of our exploration in daily life has to do with recognizing,
is what I'm going to do, supportive of connection, care, concern, love?
Is it not harmful?
And so that exploration around ethics, around engaging in ways in relationship that are not harmful.
Noticing when we are acting in a way that might cause harm, and pausing, looking at what's happening internally.
The Buddha offered us these teachings on ethics in our daily lives for kind of a little like mindfulness bell.
It's a training to recognize, oh, this action might cause harm, reflect.
Perhaps there can be a reflection before we act.
If it's going to cause harm, refraining from that action.
Or in the speech, as we talked about last time, if what we're going to say is going to be spoken in a way that is harsh or divisive.
Maybe there's a way to say what we're going to say that's not harsh or divisive.
So the ethics is also a big piece of how we engage.
Looking at, are we going to be causing harm in our actions?
So mostly today I wanted to give an opportunity for checking in and seeing, asking questions.
So I just did a little bit of a recap to kind of spur a recollection and then just to see what is up for you in your daily lives and in the practice.
Perhaps where are there areas of challenge or struggle that we could explore a little bit?
And where perhaps are there areas where it's a little bit more useful?
Where are you noticing mindfulness help you?
Because that's also useful.
Now in having this kind of a conversation in a group form like this, it's really useful in terms of the description to, you know, it's like, you don't need to share a lot of details about your personal life.
In fact, it's better not to because that's often where, you know, we'll go into a lot of story in the personal details.
And so it might be useful to understand just a little bit of context, of having a conversation with somebody I didn't know very well.
And they said something that really triggered me about some current news.
You don't need to go into what the current news is.
You don't need to describe all of the situation who it was.
But then start exploring how was it for you?
What did you explore?
What did you experience?
Where did you get caught?
Get caught in certain emotions or get caught in ideas or beliefs?
And perhaps there can be a little bit of an exploration of it at that level.
We actually don't need to go into content as much as we think we do to really kind of explore the underlying habits, patterns, tendencies of what's going on for us in our daily lives.
So anybody willing to share or ask a question, it could just simply be a question also.
Kelly.
Hi.
Well, you know, it seems to me I'm here right now listening to you.
So I'm mindful.
I think that's mindfulness, right?
Yes.
It's simple.
It's actually really simple sometimes.
We make it more complicated than it needs to be in daily life sometimes.
So if you're aware that you're listening, that you're in the space that you are.
Now with that, can you also, so there's that piece of it, can you also have a sense of, so that is mindfulness.
And then can you have a sense of kind of your state?
Are you at ease?
Or is there some kind of tension happening?
It's just neutral.
It's neutral?
Neutral.
Yeah, right.
Okay.
So does that feel easy?
Just listening.
Just listening.
Yeah.
Okay.
And it seems like a mind planet is always here.
It seems to me, you know, everything I do.
There's a form of awareness, there's a form of knowing that's always here, but the mindfulness itself sometimes will get lost.
You know, sometimes we'll get absorbed into something and then we'll kind of come out of it.
And it's like we remember potentially what we were doing in that place.
But we know there's a different quality in the mind when we come out of being absorbed in something, maybe in reading something or doing something, having a conversation with somebody.
We kind of get lost in the world of our thoughts and ideas and aren't so clearly knowing that we're knowing in the moment.
And so that, that's the piece I was pointing to around noticing that difference.
You know, when that shift happens, that's really important.
And then getting familiar too with what you're saying, like you're aware now that you're hearing me, that you're, you know, that that quality of mindfulness being a little more available and continuous.
You know, that that piece also is worth getting familiar with.
That we can know, oh yeah, I am, I am aware kind of a little more continuously, but then being curious about, well, how, how do I feel?
So right now you say it feels kind of neutral.
Is there a quality of kind of relaxation that's with that?
That neutralness?
Yes.
Yeah, so that's worth noticing.
That's worth kind of knowing that I'm here, I'm listening, and there's a kind of a sense of ease that's with that.
And what's the difference between that and when I'm having a conversation, a kind of charged conversation with somebody, you know, there's probably not that ease.
There's probably a little bit more bumpiness or agitation of some kind.
And then we can also know that, like, oh, I'm aware right now.
And wow, it feels a little bit jangly.
And that's that we can also know.
So mindfulness is kind of a, you know, you get into detail.
Well, mindfulness, I would say that as mindfulness gets more continuous, it can show us some of the detail.
But it takes some time for that mindfulness to get more continuous.
But then when there is a little bit more continuity of mindfulness, elevating the interest, being curious about what else can be known here.
So that's a useful question maybe in daily life.
What else can be known right now?
Not trying to find something in particular, not necessarily digging or looking for something.
But here I am.
So right now that this may be a good question for you right now, you're aware as you're sitting here listening and sometimes talking.
And then just dropping in that question, what else is here right now?
Is there something that kind of shows up? You smiled.
Well, what else? It's just understanding what you're saying.
Try to understand what you're saying.
That's what's here right now.
Beautiful.
So it can be so simple sometimes. It can be so simple.
It seems to me, mindfulness is always here.
It seems that way.
Well, as I said sometimes, the way mindfulness is defined in the Buddhist terms, mindfulness is that capacity to be aware that we're aware.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So there is a kind of consciousness is another aspect of our mind and body.
Consciousness is going on all the time or the kind of just the knowing.
There's some part of us that knows even when we're asleep, you know, there's a kind of knowing that's going on all the time.
That's right. That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, whether we know it or not is a different thing.
That's right.
And so the mindfulness is that whether we know it and when we know it, that's that kind of curiosity.
So it's not even just simply being about being aware that we know.
It's about it having having that awareness with a particular kind of interest and exploration of curiosity around.
What is it like to be a human being?
What is this experience like that kind of exploration?
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Kelly.
Kate.
Well, I can tell as you brought this up that I'm guarding against the judgment of like, oh my God, you haven't been aware at all.
You took a bike ride, you know, that kind of thing.
But I can recount in the mind a couple of conversations in the last couple of days where mindfulness seems to arise pretty naturally when something's not quite feeling right.
And that in both cases, I'm happy to...
That's really great.
Well, I always figure, you know, if when the shit hits the fan, mindfulness is there.
More important than that, it's with me when I'm riding my bicycle around and enjoying the beauty.
But, you know, I do notice that there aren't very many moments in the day when I just go, oh, I'm aware of reaching.
I'm aware, you know, that has not been with me so much in the last couple of days.
Anyway, when these occasions happened in one of them, someone wasn't asking me about something that I kind of wanted them to.
And there was just this, you know, kind of hurt and blah, blah, blah.
And I just kind of watched it and just like, you know, I didn't do something obnoxious about it.
And then another one was in a conversation where people were talking about, they were talking about memories and things.
And I was kind of like, I had been working a little bit with this whole concept regarding impermanence.
And so there were things that I wanted to like say, and I realized that it was like a desire to say something that was somewhat contrary to what they were saying.
Coming from some sort of Buddha wisdom that was not clear enough in me to be able to do that.
And I stopped myself and just sat and just listened and let the conversation go and didn't do that.
And I was very happy about that.
That was a very important arising of awareness for me.
Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. And it sounds like what you're saying is that, you know, mindfulness is arising when even little like threads of suffering are coming up.
And in daily life, that is fantastic.
I mean, that's, I think that's a big place where mindfulness can be a big support for us.
Like, like, yeah, like, I find that too, that if there's any kind of suffering or struggle, it's like, it's like a mindfulness bell, you know, the mindfulness will be right there.
And thank you for that. You know, that is so, it's so wonderful that then there can be that curiosity.
I think a piece there, just like you're saying is to just take it in, take in what's available.
And it sounds like there's quite a bit available in that moment.
You know, mindfulness was pretty strong given given what you described was, was, was seen, you know, that's pretty subtle things going on in your mind.
And so that's, that's encouraging to me that, you know, that when the suffering happens, that the mindfulness is available at a pretty, you know, subtle level, even in daily life.
So take, take appreciation with that, you know, you know, that's, that's, that's really useful.
And then, you know, in terms of the other pieces around, you know, the bike, you know, the bike, not riding the bike, you know, you could just do a little bit of an inventory.
I sometimes talk about this on retreat, like, where, where do we tend to lose mindfulness? Where are we not aware in our day?
And so you, you recognize not while riding your bike. And so this is actually, it's, it's, I wouldn't say it's not as important, you know, in a way, because in some of those times, there are wholesome qualities present.
And mindfulness will support those wholesome qualities. So, you know, it's like, yeah, I mean, it's wonderful that it's coming up with suffering.
That's, that's fantastic. But there's another big opportunity for it to come up when, you know, there's delight and joy present and letting yourself really feel that.
It's like, oh yeah, riding my bike, I'm appreciating this, I'm enjoying the beauty, you know, and don't get into your mind about it being greed, you know, just, just notice.
What's there, there may be some greed there, but there's probably also quite a bit of just being present and the appreciation of having a body that can do this.
And, you know, so, so yeah, I mean, take in, take in that wholesomeness. That's such, that's also a beautiful place to, to cultivate the awareness.
Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Kate.
And then Olga. So yeah, I have a question. It's about when something painful happens emotionally. And it's usually like a memory, or in the moment itself, you know, someone says something that that feels hurtful.
But often it also comes up as a memory later. And the question is, the mind is these days seems really interested in kind of gleaning all the information it can about, you know, what happened, why was it perceived as hurtful, what was really going on.
And to some degree that feels useful, you know, and in terms of relationships, like if there's something to address with the other person.
But I'm just finding my mind is really interested in a deeper way in the possibility of not spending so much time and not suffering so much sort of with those thoughts.
And, and there's some intuition that, like, what's really a value isn't the thoughts about it, but, you know, something more on the emotional level. So just any suggestions you have around that, I'd appreciate.
Yeah, so I think it's very human to kind of want to understand the situation, the wise and all of that. And sometimes, sometimes the touching into when you're feeling that, you know, when you're in that space of in the wise to sit down in that,
if you have space to do this, I mean, sometimes I will, I will be in a place like that and have some time and if I just sit down for like 10 minutes.
And in that, in that time just really let myself feel like that honest feeling of what's here, like I was describing in the guided meditation, you know, not, not in a specific way, not in a conceptual way.
But just and the broader sense to, you know, of, of the feeling of that being hurt, you know, what, what is that feeling of being hurt. And then when you can kind of land with that, and really settle with that, okay, this is that feeling.
And often it's not a stable thing, you know, there's a lot of pieces to a lot of threads to it. It's, it's not one thing, there's a lot of like fluctuation around various pieces and we don't have to like name them or figure them out.
But just like feel, land with that, land with that experience at a, you know, non non conceptual level as much as possible, just like the broader sense of how you are, and often in the visceral area of the body.
What it's, it's, it's, it's kind of somewhere between body and mind or something, you know, it's, it's this area of the, in the body, I think is so connected to what's going on in our mind that the feeling it often, it is often felt in the, you know, the throat, the heart, the stomach, the intestines, all of that area, if we can just touch into it, not in specifics, but just the broader sense.
And then when there's a little bit of ability to connect with that, sometimes I find it useful then to drop in a question again, like I said, I suggested earlier, what else is happening here?
What else is available to be known here? And that might be some thought or belief or view or, or something, there could be something else bubbling there.
But often what I feel or find in those situations when I'm able to land with that, the feeling of the hurt at a deeper level, and then drop in that question of like, what else is going on here?
Not all of the ideas and thoughts about, it's kind of like it's, it's the ideas and thoughts about what happened and why they said it and what should I do differently?
All of that's at this level. The feeling seems to be at a middle level, and then sometimes there's, there's some kind of often it seems, some kind of idea or belief that's, that's kind of underneath, out of which the whole thing is really spreading from.
And sometimes when we can land with that feeling for a while, you know, maybe, you know, a few minutes to hang out with that feeling, then kind of curiosity about what else is here.
It could be a more specific, like what, what is being believed here or what is this about, you know, not, not at a conceptual level, but what else is going on with this somehow?
Then sometimes there will be a little bit of something that kind of bubbles through that emotional level and points out the deeper underlying view or belief that's connected.
And often, at least in this, this kind of expression, maybe from the perspective I have through Buddhist practice, you know, I've been shaped so fully by Buddhist practice that, you know,
it does tend to come back to some of those core delusions that we share, you know, the feeling of wanting things to be permanent and reliable, wanting things to, they're not to be vulnerability, you know,
so there's some deeper kind of things. And when we can see where it's bubbling up from, you know, sometimes it creates a different container for which, in which we can understand what's happening at the surface level when we see the deeper set of beliefs and views that are underneath.
So that's, that's, those are my thoughts. Yeah, thank you. That's great. Really helpful.
Yeah, thanks Gabe.
Oka.
Good morning.
Hi.
So, I've been aware for a long time of a pattern in the mind around discontent and around.
It's, it's on a visceral level, it's on a very much of a body level. So, and this is in daily life on the cushion, off the cushion. I feel in the body, this sort of, what is that?
What is that, you know, slight discomfort, it's very subtle, and it's very, it's, it's, and it crops up all the time. And I know what it has to do with, I've looked at it quite a bit, and it, and it's around
always this feeling of always needing to tweak something to make it just a little better, just a little better, just a little better.
And I have gone back and forth between paying attention to what it is I'm wanting to tweak the object.
So, oh, I got to get to work in that garden. It's just not to my satisfaction. Or, you know, that was, that's a simple explanation.
Oh, and I fluctuate between that going to the object and, and then going to the discontent and sitting with the discontent. What is this discontent?
And it has been very productive.
And I also see that sometimes I have confusion. Sometimes there's confusion in the mind around discerning.
I think I always should be with the discontent. I mean, that is like, that's, that seems very sort of root to me.
But the tweaking, the tweaking, I'm trying to discern why is tweaking from unwise tweaking.
If you understand my drift here, like, Oh, is there any greed in here? You know, or, or aversion?
Like, am I reacting to aversion in sort of a benign way that, you know, that that maybe I should be backing off and dealing with some version instead of tweaking?
Does this make sense? Yeah, I mean, I think basically I'm hearing a kind of a little the confusion piece around.
That's the biggest piece. Is it okay? I mean, like, is it okay to do, to do something when I know there's discontent there?
You know, or should I not do something? Do you have that kind of question?
Yes. And, and, and sometimes the mind throws up the thought, just leave this alone and look at the discontent.
Sometimes it's like, no, it is harmless for me to step in here and do something.
Right.
But there's confusion.
Yeah. Well, I think, I think noticing the confusion. I mean, in daily life.
Yeah, I mean, I think look at the Buddha offered teaching to his own son on this, right? It's kind of like, before you act notice, is this going to cause harm?
Is this going to cause affliction is the word. So it's a little bit less than harm, you know, it's like, is it going to cause affliction for yourself, or for another?
Or for both. And so the ethical piece there, you know, is, if this is, if this is going to cause harm, you know, don't do it, you know, so, so look at it, you can look at it from that perspective a little bit.
If it's not going to cause harm, like going out into your garden, you know, it's not going to cause harm to yourself or other or both, you know, then go ahead and do it, but then notice what happens.
I mean, if you are acting out of greed there, you know, there will be some, some, you know, like, you may start to notice attention or tightness in your mind around, oh, that's not the way I want it or anger or frustration.
You know, so you'll notice some of that stuff in your mind. And, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's a smaller kind of greed there of just wanting it to just be so.
And, you know, so playing with that, noticing what happens while you do the action. So that's the next piece that the Buddha said to his son.
So, like, before you act, is this going to cause affliction? Don't, if you don't see that, then step into the action and, and see what's going on in your mind.
You know, what's happening there is the mind getting more and more tight. Maybe this is not so helpful.
Or is it actually that the mind is feeling easeful and delighted being out in the garden. There's going to be mixed motivations.
There are going to be mixed motivations. It's like, until we're fully awakened, there's going to be greed in, in our actions.
There's going to be aversion in our actions. And so that I think this teaching that he offers to his son is really useful to us in daily life.
You know, it's like, check, check the ethical side of it. And, and then be curious about what happens as you step into actions.
And if there are times too, when we think something's not going to cause harm to somebody else, and then we do it, or we say it, and like, wow, I had no idea.
You know, something was like, either I didn't know something, or I was not seeing something, and, and there was harm caused.
And in those kind of situations, that's an opportunity for learning too.
So we don't have to like beat ourselves up about it. It's like, Oh, I didn't, I didn't see something, or I didn't know something.
What can I learn? What can I understand about the whole situation?
And then the Buddha points to after also after we act, you know, did it cause harm?
Yeah, there's a famous story about a naturalist who, you know, when he was young, like 11 years old, had this butterfly farm.
I guess he had this collection of chrysalids. And he watched the first time when opened and a butterfly was emerging.
He watched the butterfly like, like really have to work really hard to like open up that crack in the chrysalid and, and worked really hard to open, open the chrysalid up.
And then, you know, the abdomen extended and like all of this work to like get out of the chrysalid.
And then, and then, you know, as the other started to open this young, you know, 11 year old thought he would save these butterflies the suffering of that.
And he cracked open the chrysalids a little bit more so that they wouldn't have to work so hard to get out.
And what happened is that they slid out and then walked around for a little while and died.
Because there's something of the struggle of opening that chrysalid that is going to like help them to it's like there's a fluid apparently that pumps out over their bodies and their wings that gives them the capacity to stretch their wings and to fly.
And so he learned as a young naturalist, you know, that doing something like he didn't know, right, he didn't know.
He thought he was, he was averting suffering and he was doing the opposite.
You know, he was, he was actually killing them to do this.
And, and he said it was a lesson that he carried with him through his life that, that, you know, things we don't know what we don't know, you know, that we may be doing the very opposite.
And so this is a, this is a way to learn.
So when we see, you know, we may not be, we may be acting with compassion in our hearts and doing something very unhelpful, but we don't know until we see what happens.
So, you know, so that's, that's something not to beat ourselves up for.
There is, there is the sense of ache, of pain, of having caused that harm, you know, of, of like, yeah, that doesn't feel good to have, have done that.
But that doesn't, that that pain of having caused harm, we think of that, that feeling is kind of like an unwholesome feeling.
It's like guilt or shame or something like that.
But there's a flavor of that quality of, oh, it feels like this to have done something that caused harm, that is, is a wholesome quality.
It doesn't have to have a constriction around it.
It doesn't have to have a judgment or beating up around it.
It's, it's the feeling of, of that.
We are, we are responsive beings.
We are empathetic beings. And when something happens that we do that creates harm, we feel that.
And that's a good thing that we feel that.
Like a wholesome remorse.
That's right. It's a wholesome remorse.
And so that's what we learn from.
And so, you know, to, to think of the whole process as learning that there's, I think the piece of confusion is that there's got to be,
I've got, it's almost like we think we need to know something that we don't know yet.
You know, it's like we should, we should have more wisdom that we have in order to be able to discern is this something I should do or shouldn't do.
And we don't know necessarily.
So there's a learning process.
And so, you know, it's kind of like, look as best you can at the situation from the perspective of is there, is there greed there?
You're noticing the discontent.
Oh, it's been, because it's a very, it's a very pervasive pattern in a lot of areas.
And so, you know, notice, and I think that notice to whether there's any kind of so noticing the discontent notice to if there's any, like potentially like going out into the garden.
Is there a sense of delight and joy and thinking about going into the garden?
You know, so know that they're both there.
Just because there's discontent there, you don't have to not act on the delight and joy.
It's like they're both going to be there.
Notice both honestly, honestly recognize yes, both are there and then see what happens as you step into that action.
Yeah, I think there's a little bit of doubt around that there's doubt around acting out of a pattern that is so pervasive.
Right.
And sometimes the mind doubts the action and feet and thinks, oh, better to sit with this discontent than yet again act out of it.
Right.
It's a pattern piece.
So when you notice it, like see if you can connect with another intention that's there at the same time.
Yeah, I get it.
And connect with that one and then let the mindfulness know the discontent as you step into it, but also connect with the other action.
I mean, with the other intentions that are there.
Yeah, it's a balance.
Exactly.
