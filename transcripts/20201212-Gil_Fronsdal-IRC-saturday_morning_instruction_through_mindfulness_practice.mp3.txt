For this morning's guided instruction, I would like to guide you through the simple or basic
instruction for mindfulness meditation that's kind of at the foundation of how I like to teach.
And it involves beginning with the breathing and becoming inclusive then of body and then of emotions
and then thinking and then how we are in relationship to things so we learn how not just to cling
so much to hold on to strain and then to appreciate soft rich stillness silence absence that can
support further letting go it points to non clinging so to begin by gently tenderly bringing
your attention to your body and see if there are subtle adjustments you can make to the
body to so it's more bodies more ready for meditation maybe the spine can be a little bit
more erect maybe between the shoulder blades maybe gently the kind of lifting or rising
movement at the crown of your head creating little bit more space between the last vertebrae
of the spine and the skull by tipping ever so slightly the head down but the crown of the
head same time goes a little bit up there's a little preparation exercise sometimes done
which is to gently slowly kind of flap your elbows so that the elbows are not for hell tight
but they're loose and your arms are kind of loose from the shoulders you might also drop your
mouth open and then to keep the jaw a little bit relaxed let the teeth the mouth float together
touching or almost touching and as a way of establishing your attention more fully here
and now in your body you might take some long slow deep breaths as you breathe in to feel the
expansion of the rib cage the torso feeling the torso maybe more closely than you normally would
in the course of a day and then as you exhale letting the whole torso the rib cage relax and
settle back all as a way of centering yourself here and now and this time this place breathing
in deeply as you exhale you might also quiet your thinking mind as if you can turn the volume
down in your thoughts mostly so that there's more space in the mind for mindfulness for
awareness and then letting your breathing return to normal and again with a normal breathing to
become aware of how the body experiences breathing how the body experiences an inhale and how the
body experiences an exhale perhaps as you exhale to again let help the have the exhale help you
center yourself here in this place this time in the body as you exhale maybe letting go of your
concerns your thoughts so that awareness can settle further into just breathing letting go
into the body breathing as you inhale maybe imagine your
you're receiving all the sensations of inhaling the whole body is a sponge that receives those
sensations as they appear and as you exhale maybe it's nice to give yourself an allowing
attitude allow the exhale to release receiving and allowing
and then become aware of whatever sensation is strongest in your body that that is not the
breathing doesn't have to be too strong whatever is the strongest and bring your attention there
the way that we brought the attention to the right hand a few days ago and not so much to
focus directly and only on the strong sensation but to become aware and mindful of that location
however small and be receptive and allowing of the sensations there if it helps you stay with
those sensations you can have your breathing imagine your breathing breeze breeze through
that location but mostly feel the sensations there and get to know them all the different
kinds of sensations that might be there however subtle and the body is a valuable part of
mindfulness there's a kind of body fullness that we practice then you can come back again to your
breathing and maybe you can allow for a body fullness a fullness of a body that within which
there is breathing maybe breathing is at the center but if any sensations in your body are
stronger than the breathing you can always bring in awareness to those strong sensations but see
if you can do it like we were aware of the hand and so the how you're aware as important as what
you're aware of and then you might notice with calm relaxed attention
not straining or trying and also not hesitating or reluctant to notice how you're feeling now
what emotions or mood it might be present and allow how you're feeling to be there as if it
has your you have complete permission to feel as you are however subtle it is and how does your
feelings how do your feeling show itself in your body what part of your body seems to manifest
or express your mood your mental state your emotional state and to feel if that if you find a place
in your body where it seems to be centered to feel that maybe a little bit like you felt the
right hand and the exercise some days ago simply receptively feeling more fully the
physicality of how you're feeling the embodiment of emotion and if you if you do find a place
in your body where you can be with your emotion if it helps you can also breathe through that part
breathe through your emotion your state gently and after you've acknowledged your emotional state
you can return to your breathing more fully and if there's a supportive emotion some calm or some
sense of well-being as you begin again with your breathing maybe that supportive state can be there
in the background or around enveloping the breath to support you in being with the breathing
letting go of your thoughts as you exhale letting go into the body breathing
and then gently without any kind of
strain or even moving the mind too much can you be aware of your mind thinking however subtle the
thinking is and for now if you're thinking allow yourself to think it's okay for these moments
you're going to be mindful of thinking the kind of awareness of thinking that's relaxed and open
receptive as if awareness is a bigger container a wide space of clarity that's steps has stepped
back and is looking at observing the mind thinking noticing if you're involved in your thinking or
interested in your thinking pulled into its orbit and you can you take a couple of steps back with
awareness to observe thinking without being in it sometimes thinking exists in the control tower
trying to control things sometimes the watch tower trying to be safe can you feel any of the
physical tension pressure contraction tightening or narrowing that might be connected to thinking and
if you do you might relax the thinking mind the thinking muscle can soften and as you observe
your thinking can you experiment a little bit to see if you can be just observe without being
bothered by your thinking and without being involved in it you might very very gently note
thinking thinking is a way of being free of the thinking and then maybe with an imaginary bow to
your thinking saying that's enough begin again with your breathing maybe so embodied and close to
your breathing the breathing is experiencing itself breathing breathes itself
and then can you notice if there's any feel the space around your body just be on the
edges of your body is there space is there stillness sometimes being aware of space around the
body the boundaries of the body seem diffuse maybe almost like the space and the stillness
around you kind of penetrates into you around the edges of the body and then within the body
is there any place of stillness relative stillness or spaciousness that you can feel in the body
and maybe you can breathe through the stillness breathe through the spaciousness maybe there's
even an inner silence quiet calm place calm quiet quietness that you can also be aware of
perhaps there's even a place of stillness quiet that you might associate with the mind
maybe a mind which is softly still place in the mind that's quiet spacious
and the spaciousness within and this spacious spaciousness without outside you is one large
spaciousness and in the spaciousness there's no clinging in spaciousness there's no tension
but within the spaciousness within the stillness of the moment you might be aware of a place
with the end of tension some place where there's still a little bit of tightening or pressure
and to be aware of that as if it's not a problem tension highlights spaciousness and
spaciousness highlights tension and if it's easy enough as you exhale relax the tension
soften places of holding if you find yourself bracing yourself against anything
maybe lovingly let go release
if you find yourself thinking let go of your thoughts
but more deeply let go of the inclination to think the pressure to think
with your breathing as your companion let go
with breathing as your support let go
let go of your body release the mind
from whatever grip there is really open the fist of the mind release the fist of the heart
let go let go let go until all there's left is just to let be
let be let all things be here now
letting go of any way that you seem to be involved what's happening involved in your thoughts your
feelings when you're simply aware aware in the wide field of stillness peace finally finally
there's no need to be involved in anything it's enough just to be in the awareness
there's no need to be involved in anything it's enough just to be in the awareness
