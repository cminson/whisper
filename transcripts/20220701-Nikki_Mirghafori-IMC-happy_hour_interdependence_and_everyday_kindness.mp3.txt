Oh.
Okay.
Great.
Great.
Wow.
Someone on YouTube joining from Kuala Lumpur.
Good morning.
We are definitely very international and happy hour. So hi. Hi, everyone. Hi. Welcome.
Welcome. Welcome. I've missed you.
The past couple of happy hours been traveling. So happy to join you. See you.
So I was thinking for today. It's Friday, July 1st, 2022. It's officially summer. And for those in the United States, it's the beginning of the fourth of July weekend, though, which is a long weekend, Mondays, holidays, Independence Day.
And I thought maybe given that it's both a Friday and also the theme of this weekend or the celebration anyway, and any excuse to bring some interdependence in.
So I wanted to give some guidance with META, with both finding refuge. META as refuge, because kind of the end, well, it's the end of the long week, or maybe it's Saturday morning already for those of you joining from the international time zones.
Both sense of quieting META as refuge, and also as a refuge and this acknowledgement of sense of interdependence. META as an acknowledgement of our interdependence that our lives depend on each other, on kindness of strangers.
Our lives depend on kindness of strangers and everybody else's life depends on that too. So there's a sense of, say, if you're walking down the street, you know, you smile at your neighbors, perhaps, or maybe you walk out of the way, or you're kind, or when you're driving.
We are depending on the other drivers, we're trusting that they're not going to veer into our lane. So there's all this trust, you can think of it as kindness, you can think of it as META, you can think of it as just general decency, general goodness.
Our lives are really interdependent every single moment in so many ways. So, and also META as refuge is taking refuge. So we'll start tonight with quieting the heart, quieting the mind, coming to center, taking refuge in the body with the breath.
And then I'd like to make some invitations about exploring the sense of interdependence.
Yeah, as META is an appreciation of interdependence of what we receive and what we give, this web, this web of kindness, that we are a part of, whether or not we acknowledge it, we are a part of it, so let's acknowledge it.
Alright, so let's begin, let's settle in our seats, begin meditating together, see what your body needs to be comfortable for the next 30 minutes, you can lie down and be standing or sitting, any posture that works for you.
Ah, and arriving, arriving in your seat.
And just acknowledging whatever is here in this moment, greeting, greeting whatever is present, opening, opening the door of your heart, the home of your heart to whatever is present.
Just be fatigued, maybe tired at the end of a long week or maybe you're excited, opening up to that too.
Whatever is present, it's relaxing, relaxing, softening.
Imagine you're sitting in the middle of a cottage with lots of doors and windows.
You're sitting in an easy chair in the middle of this cottage, the most comfortable chair you can imagine.
Ah, relaxing, allowing all the visitors who are here to come and be here. You don't get up from your comfortable seat and walk away with them, not distracted, but you let them be.
You don't close, shut the door or the windows, it's okay, they can be. You're already here knocking on the door, fatigued, maybe restlessness, sadness, joy, excitement, whatever there is, whatever there is, gratitude, delight.
Ah, resting more deeply in your easy chair, turning now, turning the attention to the body, letting all the guests be.
No need to spend energy to keep the doors shut or to kick them out, it can be and you can be at ease.
Even if there is lack of ease, we can still be at ease with lack of ease, it is possible.
So, let there be ease. Let there be ease.
Letting the breath move through your body.
And releasing, releasing, the breath helps release all the tightness, the shoulders, neck, forehead, jaw, face, chest.
Set bones, legs, arms, hands.
The breath moving through with each outrun.
Releasing, sinking more deeply into your easy chair.
The thoughts arise in this moment, ah, softly, gently let them be released.
As you take refuge, enjoying, just being here in your easy chair.
Taking comfort, in rest, stillness of the body that invites the mind to be still.
So, let the body be at rest, not moving.
Let the body be still.
Fighting the mind to be still.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Letting the breath, in breath and out breath.
Massage, comfort, the body, the heart, soothing, stilling.
This breath, this precious breath.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
As we rest in this proverbial, this imaginal, easy chair, taking refuge in the stillness of this moment.
Also, consider that we're taking refuge in kindness that has supported us, kindness of friends, family, strangers,
teachers, so many people.
Especially when times are hard, when it appreciates kindness, compassion, a lending hand, even more.
So, in this moment, as if you're easy chair, there is this blanket that's holding you.
As if you've been, as if collectively, you're the history of how you've got here to this point in your life.
This imaginal blanket has been touched by so many, it's holding you now.
It's not a time to think about all the ways that people are not kind, we have choices to what we turn our attention to.
And in this moment, for the benefit of our own heart and mind and cultivation, let us turn, let us open our heart to appreciating the goodness in our life.
Metta, kindness, goodwill as refuge, as solace.
You might even remember an occasion recently where you felt supported, you are feeling supported.
Maybe by just someone's presence in the world, their kindness, their care for you, you feel supported.
Or you have felt supported in the past.
Metta, kindness, goodwill as refuge, for the heart soothing balm.
Maybe feel yourself held, so you are resting in your easy chair.
Maybe there is circle of benefactors.
Circle of benefactors, friends, family, loved ones, past, present.
Mind, you are resting, just holding you with your gaze or however ways are comfortable for you to imagine.
People who have touched your life, maybe transformed your life.
Either kindness or support, maybe what they have written or what they have said, what they have taught, what they have symbolized for you.
What they have done.
And consider that by acknowledging all the gifts of Metta, kindness that you have received and keep receiving,
it actually makes you stronger.
It makes your heart more full.
It's not a sign of weakness to receive kindness.
It actually makes your heart full.
It charges your energy, it charges your battery, so that you can give to others, as you have given to others.
So let yourself enjoy receiving, acknowledging the receiving of Metta with each breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now if you like, can also consider that in this circle of benefactors, friends, loved ones, teachers, etc.
But actually, just as you've received gifts of kindness, care from them, they too have received gifts from you.
That they are grateful for, grateful for your presence in the world.
You may be bringing a few people to mind where it's easy and let yourself feel their appreciation.
Just giving and receiving of care, goodness, Metta.
Oh, you have impacted their lives.
Let yourself appreciate or be appreciated through their eyes.
Let yourself feel your own goodness, unabashedly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And also, maybe allowing yourself to feel, maybe you've had simple interactions today, yesterday, past week, or month.
With near strangers, maybe they've been courteous, kind, friendly. Maybe so have you, given them a compliment or you've been patient.
You gave someone the right of way. A simple act of kindness, just simple, doesn't have to be grand.
You didn't honk, say, would it be easy for you to do so?
I'm appreciating these simple, simple acts of kindness exchanged, goodwill exchanged.
Little acts of service.
Allowing yourself to appreciate the magnitude of so many small interactions that have friendliness.
Friendliness, goodwill in them. So many. Metta is not that complicated.
As many of you have said, here is a happy hour.
Simple goodwill, kindness, friendliness.
So much that we can easily miss it, the water we swim in.
Thank you.
This web of interconnection that we are a part of.
So many little acts of kindness throughout the day, throughout life, our lives and everyone's.
Deep sense of interdependence at the core of our being, core of our existence.
And we can play our part with grace in this web of kindness.
As our battery, the battery of our heart gets charged through kindness of others.
We can charge the battery of others, self-generating.
Let yourself take the next few minutes to appreciate.
Kindness coming and going in this web.
You as the recipient, as the giver.
The agency in this network of interdependence.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We are so deeply interconnected, interdependent with one another.
In ways we can't even conceive.
Let us be a node in this web that spreads kindness.
Let it spread through the web as we receive it.
Let's appreciate the goodness and share our goodness.
The whole world as we bring this practice session to a close.
Imagining that we share with this connected, deeply interconnected web graph.
We send out our kindness, our goodness, our friendliness.
In our heart, in our minds, in our speech, in our actions as much as possible.
May our intentions, actions, words serve our own awakening, our own freedom, our own happiness.
And those of all beings everywhere, to whom we are deeply interconnected.
May all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you all. Thank you friends for your practice.
So we have few minutes for reflections, questions, comments.
I change the chat settings.
You can share your reflections in chat if you like.
If it's sent to everyone, I'll read your name.
If it's just sent to me privately, I won't read your name, just your reflection.
You can also raise your hand if you like.
And the invitation is to share your reflection.
What came up for you was an aha moment or a challenge.
Anything is fine as a gift to others.
May it serve, may your aha moment or question be of service to others.
So that's the spirit in which you're invited, if you wish to share.
As I wait for your reflections, I see reflections from Linnea on YouTube.
She says hi from Spokane.
She's happy to be here and just learned that she doesn't have cancer.
She was told by a radiologist three months ago, yay.
Linnea is a regular part of happy hour.
Sometimes she jumps here, sometimes on YouTube, sometimes on Zoom, yay.
And these weekly meditations helped as did Nikki's course on death and dying.
So much gratitude to you.
You're so welcome Linnea, yay.
And Patinya also says hi from Thailand.
With gratitude for happy hour, yay.
So much interdependence.
Thank you both for sharing your happiness and joy.
It makes me happy, yeah.
Any reflections from tonight's meditation on the themes of metas, refuge,
and then interdependence, anything that came up for you, anything that opened up.
Somebody's trying to raise their hand, but I see it's the clapping.
Oh, there.
Susan, is that you?
There you go.
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, as you invited us to think of all the acts of kindness that were just so many,
so many interactions.
It's really remarkable.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then I was happy that I was kind back to, you know,
how was I and I was kind back,
but really lots and lots of kindness and support.
So many levels.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Thank you for, yeah, for sharing that.
Yeah.
A sense of awe arises, right?
When we notice when we pay attention.
Wow.
So much.
Yeah.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Thanks, Susan.
Armando.
Hi.
We're happy to be here.
My, what I'd like to share is that, I mean,
I got COVID like two days ago.
I am in the needs of recovery from it,
not fully recovered all the time.
And I'm here because I took something to reduce the fever.
And I've been trying to use that as opportunity to like,
you know, do a lot of meditation on, on just the body and what's
happening to the body.
And I mean, especially being very thankful to like the wonderful
thing that, you know, my, our bodies doing, you know,
trying to sort of figure out how to, you know, fight COVID,
you know, and end up being fine.
So I wonder if you have some, some tips on how to use this
opportunity to, I mean, to practice, you know,
to benefit from that opportunity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you, Armando.
Thank you for that question.
Cause there's already so much wisdom in that question itself using
this period as an opportunity because you're sick anyway.
And I'm so sorry to hear that.
And glad that your body is, is dealing with it and yet it is
challenging as you were saying, taking, I mean, taking some
medication and now, but, but with the wisdom in the question
that, oh, how can I actually see this not just as a bummer and
I'm sick and why did this happen?
But actually to see it as an opportunity, how can I practice
with this?
So I'm turning this back to at you to see the wisdom in that
question, actually just the way you're approaching this period,
that, that way of seeing already opens you up to, to, to
various ways.
So, so, um, so the first thing I, as I've been saying is keep
seeing it as an opportunity, not necessarily as a bummer or as
a pain and like, ah, you know, beating yourself up or other
people like why did this happen?
So, so, um, so that's the first thing.
And then, um, practice kindness.
Being sick is a fantastic opportunity for practicing kindness
towards yourself completely, unabashedly, especially for
those for whom, for many of us, it's hard to be kind to us.
It's easier to be kind to others and take care of them, sort
of being kind to yourself.
When you are sick yourself, you're like a sick child, you
know, when children are sick, they're so vulnerable to seeing
holding yourself like a sick child.
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh, dear.
Have a fever.
No feeling well.
You don't, you don't push yourself.
You're completely kind to yourself.
So learning how to be very, very kind.
Uh, and in fact, um, and then one can also learn not to
over-effort because the body can't over-effort when you're sick.
Um, so learning that balance of how can, can you be just the
symptoms?
What's arising with the suffering, the pain, the discomfort?
How can you, um, open in the midst of it and have ease with
lack of ease?
So that's the koan I'm going to give you to work with.
How can you have ease with lack of ease?
Is that enough for now, Armando?
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
Very helpful.
Great.
Great.
Thank you.
Thanks for the question.
Um, a couple of reflections and we, and we go into groups.
Uh, Aurora says, I just really saw how easily I overlook all the
kind sweetness in a day.
I focus on self-meta and don't see, wow, I'm being blessed.
Oh, that's so beautiful.
Thank you, Aurora.
Wow, I'm being blessed.
That, that moves me.
Your words are beautiful.
Thank you.
And Adam says, grateful for all the kindness I'm perceiving during
the last few weeks, during which I've been going through some
medical issues, people at work, people in the hospital.
My family, my wife, especially.
Yeah.
Thank you, Adam.
Thanks for sharing that.
Yeah.
All the kindness, so much kindness.
So much kindness.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And another question from EC.
How soon I can try to meditate without using any guidance.
I've been meditating for the past six months.
Thanks, Nikki.
Oh, you can, you can try, you know, you can, it's not how soon
or how late you can just try, you know, to have some guidance
for a while or maybe some sessions not have guidance.
There's no, and some people use guidance all the time and some
people don't use guidance at all.
So to see what works or there's no right or wrong to see what,
what, what's supportive to you.
You will know, you will know when the time is right and your,
your heart and mind would want some silence or quiet,
EC.
So there's no right or wrong.
Just listen to your inner wisdom on that.
So dear friends, let's turn to practicing together in small
groups and I'll make groups of roughly size three and in the
invitation as always is to share from your own experience as
little or as much as you like.
And, and, and you can say pass, you can hold silence,
kind silence.
Just appreciate the kindness, the simple, the simplest,
simple kindness in the group.
So, so I'm going to create the rooms.
See your message and when you send me, yes, we'll talk.
Let's see doing so many things at the same time here.
Okay.
So I'm going to create the rooms.
And I'm going to, so I'm going to do something different here.
Let's see.
Return to my session at any time automatically.
Okay, so you're going to actually go into a room.
So you, you'll have from now on, you'll actually choose to go
into rooms that are automatically being sucked into a room.
So that's going to change a little bit of the way you've been
doing things.
Oops, wait, I need to recreate the rooms all along taking a while.
All right, here we go.
The rooms created and I'm going to open the rooms here we go.
Okay.
Hi everyone.
I think everyone does some groups aren't back yet.
I think I closed the rooms a little too late.
It's already seven.
Oh, well, things happen.
So let's, let's wait for a moment for everyone to get back.
I gave the warning there are the alert that group rooms are closing
and then didn't actually close them.
But another 15 seconds and everybody will be back so that
we'll have closure together.
So.
Okay.
Now I think everybody's back.
Yes.
Everybody's back now.
Okay.
Welcome back everyone.
Thank you for your practice for supporting each other, supporting
yourself and this cultivation.
It's just so beautiful.
Ah, really a sense of interdependence and cultivating kindness
together is so present for me right now, even though I was not in
groups with you, but I see your smiles as you come out of the
groups or sense of presence.
And so, so thank you.
Thank you all for your practice.
And let's dedicate the merit, the goodness of our practice
together to all beings, including ourselves.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be free.
Thank you, friends.
Now I stop there.
