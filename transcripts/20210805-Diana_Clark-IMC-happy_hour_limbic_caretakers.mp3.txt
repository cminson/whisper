 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome everybody. Really warm welcome. So when we do loving kindness practice, right, of course we include ourselves. Of course we do, even though sometimes we need to be reminded, and we're not in formal meditation practice, sometimes we have to be reminded to bring some warm heartedness, some goodwill to ourselves. Sometimes we find ourselves it's just easier to let that inner critic voice be loud and to believe it. But part of loving kindness is to extend some of this goodwill towards ourselves, which means a number of things. And one is to have a certain amount of acceptance. Like, instead of trying to, like, often we're trying to like shove away those little parts of ourselves that we don't like, or kind of hoping maybe nobody notices, or if we don't pay attention to them, they'll go away, or malnutrition, because we haven't been paying attention to them. But if that worked, probably none of you would be coming to a happy hour of meditation. You would just have done it, right? But it doesn't work. It doesn't work. Even though we might have tried a lifetime of trying to, I don't know, bully parts of ourselves into shape, or to behave in a way that we think it should, or something like this. So today I'd like to share something that's from Tara Brock's new book. She has a new book that's called, Trusting the Gold, Uncovering Your Natural Goodness. So this just came out in June. I haven't read the book. I've only read little excerpts from it, so I can't say whether it's a great book or not, but I would like to share a part of this excerpt, which I think is great. And see how it's, why I think it's great is because she's a little bit different language that helps us to maybe like reframe, to kind of look at things from a different way in which we might be able to, this acceptance might become, it becomes a little bit easier and more, it's just a different thought pattern that helps us in and helps us to land to like, oh, yeah, of course. So here's what Tara Brock writes. When emotions are strong, my first step toward kindness is usually pausing, opening to the feelings, and telling myself this belongs. It helps remind myself that there is nothing wrong with the arising of irritability, anxiety, or aggression. They are our limbic caretakers. Our survival brings primitive way of trying to protect and promote our well-being. Seeing those feelings as primitive forms of self-love helped me accept them as part of my human experience. End quote. So Tara Brock is using this idea of limbic caretakers, saying that we have these parts of our brain that may just like respond with maybe a little bit of aggression or anxiety or some of these things. And she's kind of like tying it toward, I mean, we've probably all have heard like this fight or flight, like these natural responses that we have. So these limbic caretakers, part of the limbic brain, which is kind of the primitive brain, the lizard brain. And it's just trying to take care, trying to take care of us. So I appreciate this idea of instead of like, oh, I'm a bad person because sometimes this arises as anxiety, this aggression, or whatever it might be, irritability. Instead of thinking like I'm a bad person, instead of saying like, oh, thank you. Okay, that's a part that's trying to take care of me. Maybe I don't need to express it right now. I don't even need to do anything with it, really. But can I accept it? Like, I don't have to make it go away. I don't have to make it be different. But it has arisen. It's already there. So it's more like, can we just allow it with what's already there? Can we align with the reality of the moment? The reality of the moment is anxiety, irritability, aggression has arisen. So these limbic caretakers as part of a way of taking care of ourselves and can we appreciate them? So one is to, as Tert Brock was talking about or writing about, is to pause open to the feelings and telling myself, this belongs. But it might be before we can pause open to the feelings and tell ourselves this belongs, there needs to be a certain amount of warmth, a certain amount of care, a certain amount of stillness. And this is where loving kindness practice can help. Mindfulness practice can absolutely help also. But loving kindness practice is this way in which we can allow ourselves to be nourished and supported by goodwill, warm heartedness. And when the mind and the body have these repeated experiences of goodwill and warm heartedness becomes easier and easier to pause open to the feelings and tell ourselves this belongs, like Tert Brock is suggesting. So self love shows up in all kinds of different ways. So maybe this is one way in which we can reframe our experience. Maybe with a bow of appreciation for our limbic caretakers. Okay, so with that as an introduction, let's, let's do some loving kindness practice and we'll start with a little bit of mindfulness to help us get settled and help us arrive and then we'll do some loving kindness. So taking an alert upright posture. And feeling into the moment arriving resting the attention on the felt experience feeling embodied. And then a little bit of a body scan around the head and neck. Just noticing any areas of tightness or attention. And hopefully this belongs to this physical experience. So we're going to go into the shoulders, the upper back, lower back, the chest and belly. Whatever sensations, there be a sense of this belongs. The pressure of the chair, pushing against the body. Feeling the upper legs. Lower legs. And feet. The arms. And then resting the attention on the sensations of breathing. Just feeling that chest or abdomen moving with the rhythm of the breath. And then the mind wanders as it's apt to do. Just very simply, gently begin again. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Starting where it's easy, the lovable being. Bringing to mind somebody you have an uncomplicated relationship with that there's just a sense of warmth, care, love, kindness. Maybe a sense of an inner smile. Maybe it's somebody that has inspired you or supported you, a coach and mentor. Maybe somebody you haven't interacted with directly, a teacher, a father, a leader. Maybe it's imaginary. Kitten, puppies, babies, maybe it's your pet, your furry family member. Whoever you connect with the warmth you have for this lovable being. And if it's helpful, you can say phrases to support our cultivating this warm feeling. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be happy. Connecting, reconnecting, the lovable being. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be safe. Connecting, the lovable being. May you be healthy. And then to extend our loving kindness for a good friend. Being a good friend to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May we expand our circle of loving kindness, of the lovable being and a dear friend. May we be safe. May we be healthy. May we be healthy. It might be that you don't feel anything in particular and that's perfectly fine. It might be that you don't feel anything in particular. Connecting with our dear friend, extending goodwill. Creating an ecosystem, so to speak, in the mind and heart of care and warmth and spaciousness. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. To extend loving kindness to ourselves. Of course, we have loving kindness for ourselves. Sometimes we feel like we need to practice or to develop and cultivate it. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. Connect with ease. Connect with ease. May I be safe. May I be happy. Connect with ease. Part of extending loving kindness to ourselves. So that we can integrate all these perhaps parts of ourselves, some of the parts that maybe we wish weren't there or somehow we wish they were otherwise. But loving kindness practice we accept all of our sounds, the wholeness of our sounds. And as Tara Brock wrote, maybe when we notice that there's irritability, anxiety, aggression coming up in our experience. Is there a way that we can bow to that experience and say, oh yes, this belongs to. These are our limbic caretakers. Not that we have to act on them, not that it's okay for us to be aggressive and disrespectful or anything like that. But to consider that there's something to learn that our limbic system our survival brain is trying to protect and promote our well being. The same way, this loving kindness practice is trying to protect and promote your well being. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. With ease. With ease. With ease. With ease. With ease. To somebody we don't know a neutral person. It's not that we're against them or for them. We just don't know them. Maybe it's somebody in this zoom call. Somebody that you see on occasion in your neighborhood. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Just extending goodwill. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. And then to end this meditation, feel your feet on the ground. Feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. And you can see the idea of the reframing of our experiences. And appreciate when we're noticing that their emotions are arising. And so, yeah, this belongs. It's part of my experience also. And to appreciate some of those ones that Tara Brok is writing, she calls them their limbic caretakers. I like this expression, limbic caretakers. So now I'd like to have an opportunity for you to talk with your, amongst your sounds. This idea of limbic caretakers and sometimes our anxiety or irritability or something may be a message that's being told to us about how to put the is a message of trying to take care of us so it's feeling threatened or there's maybe a little bit of fear or something involved. So be in groups of three or four. When you're in the groups, there's just, you can say not everything you know about this topic, but just maybe one thing and then let it go to the next person and they say one thing and then it goes to the next person they say one thing. So in this way, it's not like a normal conversation, but it's an opportunity for everybody to have a chance to share and making room for the introverts. And if it's helpful, you can go in order of the number of characters in your screen name. So the shorter characters go first. You can talk about this idea of reframing our experience of our limbic caretakers and or the idea about this two belongs, and or you could just talk about how that meditation is for you, and you have 14 minutes. Here we go. Welcome back. Welcome back. Okay, so does anybody have a comment or questions something they'd like to share. I see some of you are smiling. This is a good sign. Yes, yes. So, you know, I had a strange. I don't know, whatever during their meditation, where, you know, I started thinking about how hard this all is, you know that I know this. I mean, you know you would mention something like if it was easy you know we wouldn't be here. Somebody had occurred to me that you know as hard as I am wrestling with it, you know, so is everyone else. You know, and that's not everyone else in this room that's everyone else, everywhere. You know, and, you know, I mean, I don't know how it is for like a dog, but you know when you start talking limbic system they got them to, you know, so they got something going on there as well. I mean it's I'm sure it's different but you know I just found myself overwhelmed with compassion. Oh, compassion. It was it was, it was a lovely experience, you know, and, you know, I don't know how much of it will stick, but I'm sure some will and I will be a little more understanding, you know, as other people, you know, wrestle with, you know, their limbic, whatever. I forget the word. Defenders and protectors are, you know, they're demons. Thank you. You want to say a little bit more like what did that what did that when that compassion arose what did it feel like. I don't know. I mean I suddenly knew I had to give meta to everyone, everywhere. Right. I felt like a radiant star shooting love. It was really it was really quite strong. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that that's fantastic. Thank you. And maybe I'll say that you know in the classic teachings of those that are preserved in the suit does that word is radiate that we translate is this kind of radiation of love and kindness or compassion or something like this. Thank you. Fred. Hi, I just want to maybe restate the obvious for all of us who are here, and just how how terrific it is to be in the little breakout groups and to meet some of the same people over time and to feel a kinship and intimacy and friendship together and just to, you know, penetrate whatever little veils of aloneness we're experiencing and don't be be more satisfied with the, but with the daily life of this spring. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Fred. Often people have hesitation maybe some of you notice right zoom, a lot of people leave that that breakout room, but there's a real sweetness there. And intimacy right surprising right sometimes that intimacy that can be there. So, we're one minute after but Brad, but do you have something you'd like to share. I just that it's my first time joining it was a, I definitely understand the surviving experience and, you know, thank you, Jerry and Betsy for the small group. But, yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brad. Thank you, Brad. We hope to see you back again. So, maybe we can unmute ourselves and say goodbye and really ruckus way. So, goodbye and thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. I don't know how to be ruckus. Bye bye.
