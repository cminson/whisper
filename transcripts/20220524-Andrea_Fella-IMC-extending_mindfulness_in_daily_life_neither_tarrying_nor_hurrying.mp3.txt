The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Over the last few times I was here I was starting an exploration of
supports for practicing in daily life, how to bring our mindfulness practice
right into the midst of our activity. And I want to say, you know, first it is
really important to cultivate the sitting practice, you know, so that is a
support for our capacity to bring our practice into daily life and yet the
kind of the container that we have in our sitting practice, the stillness of
body, eyes closed often, we may isolate ourselves from activity around us, and so
it's a simpler environment and the exploration is perhaps more internal,
just what's going on inside and not so much about the relationship with the
world. And so it's a simpler exploration and we even know how hard it is then,
right? I mean, in that situation how easy it is for the mind to get caught by
some thought that arises in our mind or some sound that happens, that our mind
gets pulled out. And so we do have in our sitting practice the reminder that
we're sitting still, eyes closed, you know, and we will eventually remember,
oh, this is not what I'm doing, you know, thinking about this thing lost in that
world, I'm not actually there, I'm sitting and the intention is to cultivate
mindfulness. And so we remember perhaps a little more easily in the sitting
practice to cultivate this capacity for mindfulness. And it is a lot harder in
daily life. It's quite a bit harder and so over the last few weeks, exploring
ways to support that. And one of the main things that I've mentioned is
this simple recognition of mindfulness returning. So that's a key, a key practice,
a key tool. And I've explored, I've expressed that it's useful just simply to
get to know that moment, kind of like the moment in sitting meditation when we
remember that we're here sitting, you know, that mindfulness returns in that
moment, that that recognition of that returning of mindfulness, when we get
familiar with it, it supports us to recognize when it happens more and that
supports us in the sitting practice to kind of get familiar with that moment
of mindfulness returning and not to judge ourselves for it. So that's a lot of
what we do in the sitting practice to let go of judging ourselves for that
having been lost and just wake up with what's here in this moment. And so that
in the sitting practice, we then, with that recognition of, oh, I'm aware again,
we then explore the possibility of cultivating a little bit more continuity
of the mindfulness because that's all that we have to do in those moments.
That's our main, our main focus, let's say, for what we're doing in the sitting
practice is cultivating this capacity to remember that we're aware. And so in our,
in our sitting practice, when we recognize that we've been lost, we can
either come back and connect to a particular object or just keep reminding
ourselves, yes, I'm here. This is what am I noticing? What's here? What's here?
Moment after moment. And so there's a little bit of, of inclining towards
remembering mindfulness moment to moment in the sitting practice. In daily life,
the last few weeks, I've been talking about just that recognition of the moment
of mindfulness returning and then often because we're in the midst of a lot of
other things. We're in the midst of a conversation. We're in the midst of doing
something with some focus. If we try to hold on to being mindful in that moment,
often we basically give it up because the, the mindfulness, the activity of doing
mindfulness when we're also doing something else, doing our taxes or focusing
on the content of writing something or something, if we're, if we're, if we're
trying to remember mindfulness while we're engaged in an activity, often we,
we give it up because it kind of gets in the way sometimes of the flow of what
we're doing. Sometimes what we're doing needs a little bit more concentration to
focus on the content of what we're doing. And so over the past few weeks, I talked
about when you notice mindfulness returning, kind of take that in, notice how
you are in that moment, what's here in that moment, and then get on with your day.
You know, you don't have to try to hold on to mindfulness every time that
mindfulness returns. That at least has been supported for me to not, to not try
to think about, you know, okay, mindfulness is returned, how can I, you know, be, be
mindful of this thing like computer programming or whatever. You know, it's,
it's a challenge to do mindfulness, to remember, to connect with that remembering
of mindfulness moment to moment when we're engaged in certain daily activities.
It's not to say that mindfulness cannot arise in those activities. That the, the
the momentum of mindfulness can actually infuse anything that we're doing. And
that's something I've seen in exploring this moment of mindfulness returning.
Sometimes I've seen it return in the midst of computer programming. And then
I'm aware for a few moments of, of how that whole experience is, is unfolding. So
it, it can come into whatever we're doing, but the activity of bringing
mindfulness in moment to moment, that, that can get in the way. It can, it can
make, basically it gets in the way so that we don't want to do it. I think that's,
that's what, that's what happens, happened to me. So I explored just this
remembering of this moment of mindfulness over and over again. And I began to see
that that began to pull a little bit more continuity of mindfulness through my
day. And that said, you know, the, the, you know, just notice those moments of
mindfulness returning and get on with your day. There's a lot of times in our
day where we don't have a lot of intensive content happening. You know, it's
like we're walking down the street or we're doing dishes or making our bed or
brushing our teeth. And in those moments, in those times, when we recognize, oh, I'm
aware, there can be an opportunity for connecting for longer stretches of time.
And so this is another side of the daily life practice is working with those
times when you can cultivate a little bit more continuity of mindfulness in the
midst of activity. And so I'd like to suggest that, you know, chores are a great
opportunity for this. The, the, the times that you're, you know, just doing
something really simple. And I sometimes encourage people to pick a couple of
chores, things that take anywhere from three to ten minutes to do, and use those
as times to practice remembering to be mindful in your daily life. So if you pick
washing dishes or loading or unloading the dishwasher, if you happen to have a
dishwasher, so something simple like that, to remember to be mindful in that
time, it's kind of like you might create some reminders for yourself, you know, put
some signs up in that area, you know, wait on the dishwasher, a big sign, remember
mindfulness, or in front of the sink, or in the bathroom mirror, wherever you, you
are doing, you know, some kind of a chore, you know, just, just some kind of a
reminder so that it's not, you know, you finish the activity, it's like, oh, that
was my opportunity to be mindful. And I forgot, so that it's fine to use some,
some reminders, some, some gentle little reminders to help you connect with that.
And then in that time, just really, it's encouragement to keep it simple. So for
that, you know, five minute, ten minute time of loading the dishwasher, there's
the activity that you're doing. So you're engaged in some kind of simple content, a
lot of, possibly some physical movement, and just in a simple way, connect with
knowing that you're doing that while you're doing that. This is the simplest
instruction in the Buddha's instructions on clear comprehension. He said, you know,
when you're walking, when you're walking, know that you're walking, clearly
comprehend that you're walking while you're walking, clearly comprehend that
you're standing while you're standing, clearly comprehend that you're reaching
while you're reaching, clearly comprehend that you're going and coming while you're
going and coming, clearly comprehend that you're eating while you're eating. And
so there's, there's some very general instructions there. He's not, at least in
my understanding of this, he's not saying we have to dive in and know every
single detail. It's clearly comprehend what you're doing while you're doing it.
So at a broad level, that can be really simple. Just in the kitchen, know what
you're doing while you're doing it, and possibly connect to some of the, the
physical experience of it. You don't have to aim to there, but I find that
connecting to body in daily life is a really useful tool, especially when
we're doing chores, you know, making our bed or brushing our teeth or washing the,
washing the dishes. You're just, what is this, this experience of being in this
situation? Saida Utegenia uses a, a phrase, a kind of an encouragement for us
when we're engaged in everyday activities to be aware of what we're doing so that
there's some amount of awareness on the activity itself and some amount of
awareness on how we are internally. He calls this 50-50 mindfulness and he says,
you know, 50% of the, 50% of the attention on the what we're doing, the
activity of loading the dishwasher, the activity of brushing our teeth, whatever
it is, so 50% of the attention with the activity. I mean, it's useful, it's useful
to be aware of what we're doing so that we, you know, put things in the right
place or don't do that, do things quickly, don't chip the dishes or drop
things. I mean, so it's, there's a little bit of just connecting to the simple task,
aware of the task that we're doing and then aware of how we are. So aware of
the physicality of the body, aware of any emotions or feelings or thoughts that
are happening. You know, with, with washing dishes or, or, or loading or
unloading the dishwasher, there may be thoughts, feelings and emotions that are
not necessarily connected with what we're doing and that's okay. I mean, it's,
it's like the, what we've carried with us for the day may be there. Any frustration
from prior in the day, any, any delight or joy from prior in the day, any thoughts
about what we've been doing, all of that may be happening while we're loading the
dishwasher. We don't have to force our mind to stay with, like to, like with
daily life practice, really useful to keep a very broad kind of awareness. Not
like, how am I in this moment with touching the dish? But what's the whole
experience like? The content, the experience of the act, the activity that
we're doing, plus how we are in the moment. This 50-50 mindfulness, for me, that
language has been useful. And I may have talked about this some weeks ago in
this particular class. I don't remember the, when I've shared this. I've shared
it some quite a bit recently. So I, you know, I don't remember how much I've said
about this, but the, so that 50-50 mindfulness, for me, that's useful. And,
and, you know, I don't try to divide it half and half. It's like, you know, 50% of
my attention. How do I know what 50% is? Somebody asks I it on that. And he said,
you don't have to divide it even. It's just an analogy. It's just kind of like,
let some of your attention be with what you're doing and some of your attention
be with how you are. It may be that the activity needs a little bit more of the
attention. You know, something like writing an email, the content of what
you're doing may take a little bit more of your attention. But some of the
attention can still be with how you are. At other times, you know, washing the
dishes, it may be that, you know, 20% or some, you know, less amount is needed to
connect with the content of what we're doing. And more can be available for how
we are. And so it's just a rough kind of, you know, exploration around awareness
with content and with how we are. So both holding both at the same time. Know
what you're doing and how you are with what you're doing. Another teacher has
said that that 50-50 mindfulness makes it feel like a splitting of mindfulness
and that that language didn't work for her. And so she, she uses this notion of
360-degree mindfulness. So mindfulness with everything at the same time. So 360
degrees. That language may work more for you. A kind of a spreading of mindfulness
in a broad container. That might be a more easy way to think about it. That it
holds everything. Mindfulness holds everything. And what's here in what
mindfulness is holding. So the other piece in that checking in how you are
with what's happening. You know, the kind of the question how am I is useful. You
know, how am I while I'm doing this? So this is what I'm doing and how am I. There
may be, you know, that kind of question of how am I or what else is here. Can
begin to expose things that may be hidden. Things that may not be quite so easy to
see. Our relationship to the experience or our relationship to something that
had been happening earlier in the day that wasn't quite revealed. That we
weren't quite consciously aware of. So that checking in it's very broad. It's
like, again, it's not just about the activity necessarily. It may be more
generally about how you are in the arc of your day in this moment. If you're doing
this in the evening, it might be, wow, I'm really tired. I don't want to be doing
this right now. I want to, I want to rest and here's all of these dishes I have
to take care of. Can you know that? Can you know that that's the state of your
mind? So there's something that, a teaching from the Buddha that I just, I
offered in the guided meditation a little bit, this teaching of neither
tarrying or hurrying. To me, I actually gave this teaching at the end of the
two-week retreat that Gil and I taught and, you know, it was a, it was kind of the
transition point in the retreat where it's useful for, you know, the kind of
settledness of mind to think about neither tarrying or hurrying. I love that
image and it, it actually initially came to me on a, I think it was a month-long
retreat. The, the image of the crossing the flood by neither tarrying or
hurrying just each moment, just each moment. And the mind was fairly settled as
it came up with this image and it was, it just really supported the mind to meet
each moment but not like get hooked to it. Just like this, this experience and then
the next experience and then the next experience and then also not rushing on
to how can I get more concentrated. So it was really supportive in a very deeply
a state where I was practicing quite in a concentrated way. And I've seen it also
be really useful in daily life. So yesterday I was taking a walk and I was
noticing this little bit of tension in my mind while I was taking the walk. A
little bit of pushing or something and, you know, exploring it. It felt like
rushing. It felt like hurrying. It felt like I want to get this walk over with. I
want to get this done with. And so, you know, having just explored this teaching
is like, oh, well, what's here? This feels like hurrying. So what is this
hurrying and what's happening here? And what was happening was that I was, I was
pretty tired. You know, that it was, you know, coming back from the teaching the
two-week retreat. I often am pretty tired and so I was pretty low energy. And I
knew I had to take a walk partly to elevate the energy but partly just to
take care of the body. But the mind was resisting the low energy. So I was
pushing it away and it wanted to get on with things so that I could rest
basically. And when I noticed this, it's like, oh, well, what's happening is that
I'm tired and there's a rushing to get over with it. And I could see that the
rushing was actually stressful. It created more tension. It made me more
tired to rush. And in that seeing, the mind kind of landed a little bit more
with, well, what's actually happening here is that I'm tired and I'm trying to
rush past it. So not tarrying with tiredness or hurrying past it.
Tarrying with tiredness might feel like getting sunk into it, like just like, oh,
I gotta stop. I just can't do this. The hurrying with tiredness felt like just,
okay, just push through this, you know, kind of this tension to push through it.
And so I found that exploration around tarrying and hurrying while I was
walking and noticing, oh, I'm hurrying here. What does that mean? And the
hurrying had nothing to do. I mean, so the notion of hurrying, we might think
about fast physical movement. I was walking pretty quickly but the hurrying
wasn't about the quick walking. The hurrying was about the mind's relationship
to wanting to get over this. And so this is another kind of curious thing I found
really interesting in the last couple days around, particularly in these areas
of exploring a little bit more extended mindfulness, where we do have the
opportunity to have a little more chance to cultivate noticing things over a
longer stretch of time. So during the walk was an ideal time for that. I
didn't have other things I needed to be doing. I needed to be walking. And so I
could explore for that 20 minutes. It was like, it was one of my practice
periods during the day to notice how I was while I was walking. And so noticing
this tarrying or hurrying in our more extended, our commitments to more
extended periods of practice can be really useful. And I also see that as I
explore that kind of simple dynamic, it's not too complicated to
know to recognize I'm kind of stuck with something or I'm rushing past it. It's
a kind of a simple refinement of just noticing the mind's a little bit
agitated. It notices it's agitated either by kind of being stuck to
something or by like wanting to get over it. And so that kind of reflection or
that kind of checking in, am I tarrying or hurrying? I began to see it just
popping in at various times of the day. And just noticing, oh, I'm hurrying right
now. Oh, I'm kind of stuck to this thing right now. So I found that to be a really
useful, almost like a little reminder or what's the right word? Mantra almost.
Not a mantra in that just right remembering, you know, just saying it, am I
tarrying or hurrying, but just something that comes back through the day,
kind of connecting to that intention of recognizing tarrying or hurrying,
recognizing when that's happening. So a little bit about tarrying and hurrying,
just from my own practice with it, exploring with it. Well, actually, I'll
say a little bit about this, the Suta, the Buddha, just because there's
something really interesting in the Suta, I think. The Suta that describes this,
neither tarrying nor hurrying, it's a story of the Buddha who's visited by, it
said he's visited by a deva, a heavenly being, who asks him how he crossed the
flood, how he crossed the flood of greed, aversion, and delusion. And the Buddha
responded, by neither tarrying nor hurrying, I crossed the flood. The deva
responded, so what does that mean? How did you do that? And the Buddha said,
well, when I tarried, I sank. And when I hurried, I got swept away. And so by
neither tarrying nor hurrying, I crossed the flood. And so that gave me
the image of like, you know, just almost walking on water, the image of just, you
know, being, you know, kind of like the movement of not tarrying doesn't let you
sink and not hurrying doesn't let you get swept away, you just can stay with
each in this stream, this flow of experience. If you get stuck on
something, you'll sink into it. If you try to go past it, you'll get
swept away, maybe into thoughts. And so he just repeated that, you know, when I
tarried, I sank. When I hurried, I got swept away. And so by neither tarrying or
hurrying, I crossed the flood. So something interesting about that story to me is
that the Buddha is talking about his own practice before he became awakened. And
he said, when I tarried, I sank. You know, he sank. He sank. He got swept away in
his practice. And so this is a little bit of an inspiration for me. When I tarry
and when I sink, when I get swept away, it's like, well, the Buddha also sank and
got swept away in his practice. So it's just a little bit of a reminder that we
all go through this process. It's not like anybody can do it perfectly. But what
the Buddha is pointing to is noticing when I tarried, I sank, that's not so useful.
So noticing tarrying and how that affects us. It creates this contraction. It
creates this stickiness. Noticing the hurrying and how that affects us. It
creates a feeling of being swept away, of not able to be here, to be with
experience. And that kind of exploration of noticing what is tarrying, what is
hurrying, the feeling of that. When we know the feeling of tarrying, we begin
to experience how we lose mindfulness there. When we notice the feeling of
hurrying, we notice how we lose mindfulness there. And then we can start to
be aware of the experience of the tarrying, of the hurrying, and not get
swept away or sinking in those experiences themselves. It's a little
bit of a paradox. And also recognize how it creates tension in our system to
tarry and hurry. The feeling of grabbing to the next thing, the feeling of
constricting around something. We feel the tension there. And that feeling of
that tension, the dukkha of that, the constriction of that kind of chaos of
the hurrying, the constriction of the tarrying. The system begins to recognize
that it is not so helpful. And our system begins to understand how to let it go.
And sometimes we can consciously let it go. When we notice, oh, I'm hurrying. Do I
need to hurry? Can I let that go? Sometimes we can let it go. Sometimes we
can just come back and say, yeah, I don't need to be going there right now. I can
just be with what's here while I'm doing the dishes. I don't need to be swept
away in those thoughts about the 10 things I need to do later. I can just be
here with doing the dishes. And so we can we can let go of the tarrying and the
hurrying at times. And at other times, if we try to let go, we might see, yeah, not
possible. And in that case, useful to just really get familiar. This is what it
feels like to be tarrying, to be constricted, to be stuck to something.
This is what it feels like to be rushing past it. So I'd like to encourage in
this exploration of daily life practice that you do explore our times and maybe
times of the day where it's simple. Chores or taking a walk or going to the
grocery store even, that's a little more complicated going to the grocery store.
But still, it's not it's not it's maybe a good a good practice to extend the 50-50
mindfulness, a little bit more of the awareness on the content of what we're
doing in the store, navigating the people, navigating, you know, what you need to
find where. So knowing that all of that is happening and how you are staying
somewhat here with yourself, so that that can stretch the capacity of our
mindfulness to take in a little bit more complex content and still be with
ourselves. So I'd like to encourage, you know, sometimes through the day where you
explore this possibility of a little more extended period of mindfulness, perhaps
noticing this 50-50 mindfulness and perhaps noticing the the tarrying and
hurrying aspect and perhaps coming back to neither tarrying nor hurrying while
being present with this exploration of this activity. So that's enough thoughts
from me, I think, and I'm curious about have you been exploring these practices
in daily life? I think many of you have been following on, following along, or any
questions or comments about this particular exploration today. Anything
that you'd like to share? Let me check in about.
Joanne. I just like to say I used to when mindfulness would come back, I used to be
very judging and, you know, hanging on and and, you know, having that mindset and I
just wanted to say now, very often the way you put it, mindfulness is back. It goes
through my mind and I just have to chuckle. It's like mindfulness is back and
it's, you know, it's so joyous now. It's, yeah, thank you. Oh, that's wonderful. I'm
so happy to hear that. It's, it's, it's, it's really, it's not tarrying with what
was happening before right there in that moment. You know, it's like, oh, it's back.
What's here? What's here? Well, thanks. Thank you. Thanks, Joanne. Andrea. Oh, I saw
Neil's hand and then, then Lydia. Okay, sorry. So, Neil. Sorry, Lydia. I'm just
noticing, he's been noticing how the ease is there and just noticing just being
present in a simple way with whatever I'm doing or going on in the moment. It's
just, yeah, ease and another word that's coming up is sweetness. Lovely. And that,
I think, is the flavor when we are neither tearing or hurrying, you know,
that the mind is just here with what's happening. It's not like stuck to
something or moving on and that quality of ease and that's really useful to
notice too, when that is there. That's essentially noticing the mind that is
okay with what's happening in that moment and that, that really encourages us to
keep practicing. We begin to experience the value of the practice itself. Yeah,
thanks, Neil. Lydia. Yes, I noticed a lot of time and I don't recall what I do a
day people would ask me, what did you do today? You know, things like things all
run together and when, if that's the case, that means I was not mindfulness for
the moment during the day? Well, you know, it's interesting. It's quite
possible that you were not mindful during the day but sometimes there
are, there is an experience with mindfulness. It's a little bit odd at
times. It's like when, when there's the real clear kind of knowing moment to
moment, sometimes the mind is not tearing or hurrying so thoroughly that it
doesn't remember the moments before. And so there are, it is possible that, that
there can be mindfulness but, but usually and not a sense of, you know, like
knowing what happened the whole day. But, but I think most of the time when
we're not aware of what's been going on or it feels kind of muddled, probably
there isn't a lot of mindfulness. But do you have a sense of what it means to be
mindful? I mean this is part of what that noticing the return of mindfulness. What
do you have a sense of what it means to be mindful in the day, in your daily
activities? That's an important kind of recognition to begin to recognize. This
is what it means to be mindful. And there if you, if you begin to recognize that
and that's why I encourage noticing the moment of mindfulness returning. That's
probably the easiest place to know. Oh yes, this is what it's like to be mindful.
Mindfulness is back. I'm aware here with what I'm doing and, and so that begins
to cultivate the capacity for us to recognize. Oh, this is what it feels
like to be mindful in the midst of activity. At first when we're cultivating
mindfulness, often we begin with sitting practice and so we get familiar with it.
It's like what it's like to be mindful in the sitting practice and it's harder
perhaps to carry that into recognizing what it's like to be mindful in the
midst of activity. In retreat we encourage this in, you know, being mindful
with walking practice and the movement there, mindful in your yogi jobs, you know,
things like that, mindful in your movement practice. And so we encourage that in
retreat, but often the busyness of our lives, it's much harder to recognize or
know when we're mindful. And so that moment of mindfulness returning, you
might notice that it returns in, in the midst of a fast movement, like, you know,
walking quickly across the parking lot to the grocery store. You just notice, oh,
I'm here, I know that this is what I'm doing, or getting out of the car. Oh, here
I am, getting out of the car and, and recognize, I know that I'm aware here. And
so that, that's really a place to begin, to begin to recognize what does it feel
like to be mindful in the midst of a lot of activity. And then you won't have the
question of, was I mindful or not? So much. So the, the, when we are clearly
mindful, and don't remember what has happened, usually we know that we've been
clearly mindful, and it's this kind of mindfulness that isn't sticking to
anything. It isn't kind of like, it's almost like certain kinds of mindfulness
don't allow the creation of memory or something weird. It's a little bit
strange. Yeah, so anyway, the, the, the, the, the, the recognition of what it feels
like to be mindful in daily life is, is, will help you to answer that question, I
think. I, what I really appreciate, just you keep on emphasizing the light touch
of the return of the mindfulness. Yes. Because sometimes someone mind will play
the tricks on me. Okay, Lydia, be mindful, be mindful, kind of like a little cat and
the, you know, the whole of the mouse waiting for the mouse to come out. Yes. Yeah.
Yeah. And in daily life, I mean, that kind of like leaping on, you know, trying to be
mindful. There's usually some tension in that, whether we're doing that in
sitting practice or in daily life. And in daily life, it, that can kind of get in
the way. And I think in sitting practice, it gets in the way too. So yeah, to just
really the light touch, just this moment. And I think the neither tearing nor
hurrying speaks to that too. It's like not like gripping on to this moment of
experience and diving, like, what is this thing? And not rushing to the next thing,
you know, like, oh, I really need to get concentrated. I need to pile up these
moments of mindfulness to get concentrated. But just light touch, meet this
moment, this moment, this moment, this moment, not tearing or hurrying with any
experience. So that light touches kind of embedded in that, in that teaching of
neither tearing or hurrying. And will you be able to share with us what is the
Suta? Oh, yeah, the Suta is, it's the first one in the Samyuta Nikaya. Very
first Suta in the Samyuta Nikaya. Thank you. Thank you, Lydia. Olivia. Hi. Well, first
I'll thank you so much for all of this knowledge. It's so helpful. And my
question is, I'm having a hard time understanding tabooing. Would you be able
to understand a little, I mean, explain a little bit more about that? About
tearing? Yes. Yeah, so tearing is kind of lingering with stuck to something. So, you
know, tearing could be connected to a kind of a movement of greed, of wanting
to like, you know, hold on to something that's pleasant. So, yeah, like, oh, this
feels really good. I want to stay with this, you know, and so there's the
movement of needing to hold on to it in order to feel good. And the tearing, I
think, has that quality of sticking to something because we think that the
sticking with it is what's going to make us feel better. Whether it's sticking to
something that's pleasant, often that's a way it might be felt. We tear it when
there's something pleasant. We stay with that pleasant thing. And it could be any
pleasant thing. It could be a pleasant sense experience, like, you know, a piece
of chocolate, or it could be a pleasant meditative experience. It could be, oh,
this feels really good. I want to hold on to this. This is really nice, this state
of ease and peace. I mean, we can cling to anything. Ease and peace feels good.
Let's stay with that. So that's the kind of tearing with something pleasant. We
can also tarry with unpleasant, though, which is another interesting experience,
and is an aversive type of person who has really observed how a version works in
experience. I've seen that sometimes I get stuck to something unpleasant to try
to fix it, to try to get rid of it, or to control it in some way. So, you know, like,
if there's something happening and I feel like it's a problem, sometimes I will
just, like, stick to that problem, like, trying to work it out, figure it out. Once
I figure out how this problem is solved, then I'll be okay. So, again, it's stuck
to something because we think that sticking with that thing is what's going
to make us feel better. Now, some people might, with something unpleasant, might
hurry past it. You know, it's like, oh, here's a unpleasant thing. Let me get on
to the pleasant thing. So that would be hurrying around something unpleasant. The
tearing with something unpleasant is kind of more like stuck to it in order to
get rid of it. You know, it's instead of going to something pleasant to get rid
of it, we stuck to it until, you know, it's like, if I work this out, if I get
rid of this unpleasant thing, then I'll be okay. We can also hurry to pleasantness.
You know, so the sense of some pleasant experience in the future, you know, it's
like that was what I was hurrying around with the, you know, with the walking. It
wasn't like I was stuck to the tiredness of, you know, the walking in that
moment. I was hurrying to get past the walking to get to a place where I could
rest. So that there was like the wanting to get to something pleasant. That was
the kind of feeling around hurrying. And so sometimes with tearing and hurrying,
we can be curious about the feeling tone that's connected. Like, am I tearing
with something pleasant or unpleasant? Am I hurrying to something pleasant or
unpleasant? You know, the hurrying to something unpleasant, that sounds kind
of odd, but sometimes we know we might have to do something unpleasant. And so
we hurry to get through it, kind of that kind of thing, hurrying past that
experience. So does that, does that clarify a little bit? Yes, that does. Thank you so
much. Yeah, thanks, Olivia.
Twi. You're still muted, Twi. I'm so glad that you, you know, you, you, you talk
again today about tearing and hurrying, because I am experiencing before, before
and now, you know, this morning, I had experienced some agitation and some
sadness. And I could feel the pool to stay with it. But, but then I was wondering,
do I want to stay with it in order to get better, to feel better? And I said,
and I remember Sadie, I said, no, you can, you don't observe an experience to
get to make it better, right? And I said, well, on one hand, I feel like the mind,
the heart was to, to be felt, to be with it. But on the other hand, I was
worrying that if I, like you said, if I spend time with it, I might sink into
it. And there's more wrong views, more identification with it. So I said, okay,
but then I'm so glad you mentioned, you know, at the retreat about the 360
degrees awareness, I always say, so much more helpful than the 50 50. I've also
I don't get involved, you know, I just, okay, 360. And I could feel all this
space around it. So I, so I said, okay, why don't I just, I have to, I have to
experiment with it. And I said, I want to see if I just, you know, like you said,
I don't know if it's there, but also, is there anything else besides that? And
yeah, and I could see that, you know, the awareness all around. And yeah, it
felt, of course, you know, the agitation is still there. Yes. But there's also
other things. And, and I feel that the awareness just lift everything together,
you know, together. I don't sink into it. I don't, but I don't avoid it. Yes. And
that that that experience of what it feels like not to sink into it and not
avoid the quality of the mind there, the kind of the ease there, the, the
okayness with what's here. That's our guide in a way, you know, that helps us
to recognize this, this kind of a mindfulness is supportive. Yeah. And you
know, it is possible. There are times when what feels like the the least
stressful thing, like with the tiredness, it was interesting. I was rushing
past the tiredness and the walking. But when I actually allowed the attention
to be with the tiredness while I was walking. So it was like, it was like, I
was rushing past the tiredness. And so it's a little bit more being with the
tiredness was helpful. And so that that like, it just let me land with that to
know that was there with the whole experience. And so sometimes it does feel
like we, we land with an experience, but it's the ease that really helps us, you
know, not the feeling of, Oh, I'm pushing in, I need to be with this, or I need to
get past this. And so sometimes, you know, sometimes you might notice that what
feels most useful is really allowing yourself to be with the sadness. And
sometimes what feels most useful is creating the space that the sadness can
be there with a lot of things. And so it's the it's the ease that really gives
us the the guide of whether we're tearing or hurrying. Yeah, yeah. I'm so glad
because I, you know, because I was thinking that maybe I should also just open
up and not just be with just the sadness agitation. And then I was thinking
also I say, I remember what you said, the instruction, I heard a long time ago
when I first started to, to study with you, you see something like you just
follow it and see what comes out at the other end. So I said, I really want to
know if I stay with the agitation, the sadness, I want to know what's going to
come out at the other end. So yeah, I'm so glad because you're right. So that's
my question. And yeah, you're right. I think I just, I just explore both. Yes,
yes. And sometimes open up. Right. Yeah. And that's the Buddha's exploration,
tearing what happens, hurrying what happens. Yeah. Yeah. And then the place in
the middle, what is that? What is that experience?
