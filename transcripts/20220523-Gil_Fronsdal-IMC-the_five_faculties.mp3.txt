The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, good evening. And what I'd like to talk about is one of the foundational
teachings in our in-trouble hearing. You will turn it up a little bit louder. So
let's see now. Is that going to be loud enough? We also have hearing system
devices that might help. So, good now? Okay. So, I'd like to talk about one of the
foundational, you can call it teachings of our insight tradition, but I want to
teach about one of the fundamental set of qualities that we activate when we do
mindfulness practice. There are qualities that get activated in anything we do in
our lives, just that many things get activated, but these are kind of
universal in some way. And so, they're useful both for our practice that we do,
meditation or mindfulness in life. And they're also useful for any activity that
we do to try to figure out a wiser way or a more satisfying way to do it, to
engage in them. And these are five kind of inner, gets activated, which comes
alive, and they come alive in different proportions, different levels of
proportions to each other. And depending on how they come into balance and what
is strong and what is weak, they can affect how we do things or how we engage
in what we do in our life and how the meditation unfolds. So, these are five
qualities that are quite useful, I think, to memorize for yourself, learn what
they are, and then have them as a reference point. So that after what, at
first, it might feel somewhat artificial to memorize this and think about them. But
over time, it becomes kind of second nature to do it. It's kind of like
riding a bicycle. If you're the first time you ride a bicycle as a kid,
perhaps, it's awkward. And, you know, so many things to take care of, you
know, you have to handle bars in one way and the pedal at the same time and keep
your balance and figure out where the brakes are. And, you know, it's a lot to
figure out. But after you do it a few times, at some point, maybe it's
really second nature to do it and all the little things that seem so
complicated at first, begin working together in harmony, and at some point
you take your hands off the handlebar and say, hey, look, you know, hands-free
pedaling, because you have everything lined up just right and the speed and
everything. So, these five qualities, then, that we want to learn and make them
second nature or is tracking them, is what's called the five faculties. It's
five. And they are faith, and there's other English words to use for that,
engagement, the effort we put into what we're doing, attention or mindfulness
itself, concentration, the real ability to really focus on what we're aware of.
And then insight or discernment, the ability to be wise about what we see
and what our experience is, to be discerning about the experience. So, you
know, I think that if you ride a bicycle, for example, if you know how to ride a
bike and you're going to ride a bicycle from here to Monterey, you would, without
even thinking about it, these five faculties would come into play for you.
You first, you probably wouldn't take that trip that far unless you had some
faith that you can do it, some confidence you can do it. And that confidence is
probably necessary, because if you don't have the confidence, the doubting of your
ability to get down there is probably going to undermine you. Sometimes doubt
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I can't do it. It's too hard. And the very,
that very mindset drains us and interferes with us. And it sometimes
becomes true almost because of that mindset. But there has to be some
confidence. And maybe the confidence is not very strong at first, but then after
you've gone 20 miles or so far, say, oh, I can do this. So you make it up over the
Santa Cruz Mountains, down to their side, and then you have a lot of confidence.
Then it's like, okay, now I think I can do it. And then it's a whole different
feeling to go biking if you're confident. And then you have to engage. And you
have to figure out how to engage, depending on the slope and the terrain
that you're in. You see the hill coming up in front of you, and you realize, okay,
I need to kind of maybe pedal a bit harder now and get some momentum going up
the hill. Or I need to slow down because I have to kind of catch my breath to
really be ready for going up that hill. And you get to the top of the hill and
you coast down hill. Then you don't need to apply any effort anymore.
And then you naturally know, okay, now all I have to do is use gravity and I'll
coast down, just make sure I don't go too fast. So you kind of are moderating and
monitoring your energy levels as you go. And then you've got to be mindful when
you're biking like this. There's a lot of traffic and cars and dangers on the
road and potholes and dogs come running out and whatever goes on. And you can't
really slip up. In fact, some people are probably have a higher level of mindfulness
biking a trip like that than they do when they meditate. Because the
consequences are so serious if you don't pay attention. And the feedback is very
quick. And like I did when I was 14 and I was biking along and I was just
biking, mining my own business until I ran smack into the back of a parked car
with people inside the car. I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing.
Just biking along. Look, I don't know where I was looking yet. Boom. And so there has to be
some mindfulness, some attention. And then sometimes you're biking, you need to
stay focused, really focused, not just mindful, but focussely mindful. Sometimes
you really need to pay attention carefully to the terrain, the potholes and
the bumps and the rocks. Sometimes you have to stay focused on the traffic and
what's going on. And you have to really kind of zero in on what you're doing and
how you're doing it in a kind of very kind of sometimes detailed, focused,
concentrated way. If there's a lot of traffic that's going on, you have to
really navigate it carefully, you're probably not going to think about how
you, you know, what was that problem I had in my taxes in April? You know, you're
probably not going to think about, you know, what am I going to have for dinner
today or whatever it is. Those things fall away because of the need to stay
focused here. And then sometimes you get up to a wide open road where there's no
cars and it feels very relaxed. And there you might let your mind roam a little
bit and you're not so focused. And then you have to have a lot of discernment
when you ride the bike. You have to kind of know, make all kinds of micro
decisions as you go along about exactly where the tires go in the road and how
fast and slow you go and where you fit on the road and when to slow down and
when to go speed up. And there's a lot of little decisions made, some of them
which are about sustaining your effort for the long trip. Using and not
exhausting yourself, but to going, you know, figuring out how to go in a slow
and steady pace so you get to the end on a long trip. So this is
to suggest that this comes into play in something as mundane as riding a bicycle.
You can do the exercise. It's almost anything you do. If you decide to bake
bread or cook something at home in the kitchen, those five in some degree come
into play. They come into play when we meditate. And so to be able to recognize
them, their presence in us when we meditate allows us to be discerning
and to adjust and adjust what's happening to create the conditions that
are optimal for us to, for the mind to be able to stay present and grounded
here and now and not wondering off a lot. So confidence that needs to be
faith in what we're doing. There are confidence in our ability to do it. And
that's the, the faith that paying attention to the present moment is
valuable. It's not automatic as many people discover when they sit down to
meditate, when they realize their mind has all kinds of other things in mind to
do. And there is a certain compulsion to think all kinds of thoughts, to be
preoccupied with all kinds of emotions and feelings. And the pull into that
world is so strong that sometimes people never knew that that was the case when
they just went about their ordinary life. It's only when doing something like
meditation, we try to try to not be lost in thought and preoccupation, we can
realize the strength of it. And I think it's probably fair to say that it
represents that something, not you consciously, but something in your
system has a lot of faith in reviewing the past, in planning the future. Faith in
the value of going off into fantasies of all kinds. It has a lot of faith in
churning resentments and bitterness. A lot of faith in kind of churning and
staying kind of connected and kind of feeding anxiety. We wouldn't normally
think we have faith in those, but if an anthropologist from Mars came and studied
human beings and they were able to kind of see what goes on in their minds, they
say, wow, these people worship anxiety, you know, wow. You know, there's no
requirement to be anxious all the time, but they just like love it. They must
have this wonderful thing about anxiety and it's amazing. And then there's
those people here, but there's also those people that have a lot of anger in it.
They must have like, you know, and they have this altar, you know, they have this
monitor that's like the altar for anger. They listen to politicians, you know,
they really believe in its value. And what we're doing in Buddhist
practice is as we do it over time, our value system begins to shift. And our
value system tends to shift to being more ethical, more honest, more kind, more
compassionate, and more, not because we have to, but because we start feeling and
recognizing within us that these things are just feel better. These things feel
right. These feel less stressful. They feel more productive of having a good
heart. And so it just kind of becomes of a natural thing over time. The
meditators tend to become more ethical. Their values change. But that change of
value represents a change of where our faith is, faith of where our trust or
confidence is. At some point, we start getting more and more confident in the
value of being present, being attentive to what's happening in the present
moment. It's not obvious to a lot of people. It wasn't to me when my mother
told me repeatedly growing up, Gil, pay attention. I mean, I became a meditation
teacher because partly it was a karma of not listening to my mother. And, you know,
I didn't hardly knew what she was talking about. There was, I certainly wasn't
interested in her instructions to me as I walked might across the carpet or
something. And so the, so to begin valuing the beauty, the wonder, the
richness of height and sense of attentiveness to what's happening here
now, it becomes so marvelous, this confidence in attention that it becomes
more wondrous, more valuable to feel connected to awareness than it is to
anything that awareness knows. So if I, you know, if I look at the bell, I can
get preoccupied with the bell and think about it and all kinds of things, but
it's actually quite wondrous that I have the ability to see the bell, to
understand this is a bell, to reckon it. And that the very fact of being
conscious is a miracle. It's amazing that we should, you know, end up in the
universe where, where the recipients of this very rich capacity for
consciousness. And it's a point to have, to value staying in this close
connected to present moment consciousness because of how rich and
wonderful and what emerges from that world. So over time, having confidence in
the practice like this is valuable to do. So when you sit down to meditate,
you're less likely to wonder off in thought. You're less likely to doubt
yourself and your abilities and the value of what you're doing. And then
meditation does involve engagement, putting an effort of some kind. Even if
the effort is a dedicated, ardent effort to stay relaxed. And I say it that way
because many people, as soon as you talk about effort, people kind of feel
discouraged or feel upset or feel like, oh no, this meditation is a lot of work.
But it's, it's a lot of play. It's a lot of, it should be delightful. And to learn
how to engage with our attention, with the present moment in a way that does
not feel like work, that feels enlivening, that feels kind of like this, oh,
this is, this is a good effort to make. I feel clearer in the process. I feel more
relaxed in the process. I feel more refreshed from it all. So what kind of
effort, what kind of engagement allows us to feel that? One of the ways is to
engage with a certain kind of wholeheartedness in the practice where
there is no complacency and no resistance. No kind of, yeah, no
resistance to it. And not, not easy to do, but when the mind wants to do so many
other things besides being present and we come back to the present moment, come
back to the breath, over and over again, there can be discouragement. Wow, this is
hard. I can't do it. Not realizing that it's the very effort, very effort we
make to come back and wake up again. And again, that begins lighting a spark
inside, allows something to grow and develop. Ten thousand times we have to
bring our mind back and wake up again. And then slowly something begins to shift
and change. To make an effort which the effort does not feel stressful, it
doesn't feel punitive. Some people, when the mind wanders off in thought,
pounce back, jerk their mind back. Some people, it's like they're playing a
whack-a-mole with their mind, you know, to come back and there's like, it's almost,
you know, it's really harsh the way people practice. That kind of effort is not
helpful. But to make an effort that is, an effort that, like if you're biking all
the way to Monterey, you want to take your time and create a, ride the bike in a
way that sustains your effort over time. So with meditation, how do you engage
that's not too hard, not too forceful, not too complacent, but something that has
the spark of clarity in it. A clarity which doesn't feel like it's work, but
feels like it's almost the natural expression of our capacity to be present.
And then mindfulness is the key of this. This is the capacity not just to be
aware and attentive to the present moment, but to have heightened clarity of the
present moment so we can recognize in some kind of detail or some greater
clarity what is actually happening here. Some people meditate doing mindfulness
practice and they're kind of soothing them, soothing themselves into kind of a
complacent, relaxed, calm, but dull, calm, but cloudy state. And it might be
improved. It might feel good because it's more relaxed in how they were in a
stressed life, but in the long term that doesn't really sustain the practice. It
doesn't lead to the greater benefits of this mindfulness practice. We're
looking for how to bring some clarity to the present moment. And I love the
expression to wake up. We're waking up to experience, to be awake to what is
happening. Now one of the reasons I like the word awake is that awake is
kind of like opening the windows of attention and then allowing the sights
and sounds and smells to come in. Being mindful for some people, that's
work where you have to now stare at things and kind of try to pierce what's
going on. To be awake is just to be available with clarity and attention. And
so to start cultivating a capacity for attentiveness to the present moment in
a way that feels nourishing, feels supportive. Then there's concentration,
unification of the mind. It kind of means that now you're focused on what
you're doing in the moment. And so for meditation maybe you start organizing
yourself to be really focused on being present for the breath, being present
with your whole body. And so to really begin zeroing in, kind of focusing, but
not like a laser, but rather as someone who's gathering together everything and
bringing it all together, all of who you are. It's more like this too is
included as I be with the breath. This too, this too is part of it. There's no
outside, but everything that is included for the purposes of kind of holding the
breathing, whatever you're focusing on. So to really stay and then part of
concentration is sustaining the attention continuously through time, the
continuity of attention. Just stay here, stay here, stay here. All these first four
qualities then support our capacity to be discerning, to become wise about what's
happening, to recognize that when we're, how we're practicing is creating too much
stress, too much strain. That doesn't work. To recognize when we're being too
complacent and letting our mind drift off into thought too much and just, you
know, you know, just, you know, just comforting ourselves with fantasies
about food or something. To be discerning about what we do with our
discomforts in the body, rather than struggling when we're sitting, maybe not
used to sitting in meditation posture, how parts of your body might start aching
and hurting. And what is it useful to do? People who know how to do it might find
it useful to bring their mindfulness to the pain, as opposed to ignoring it. Other
people might say, given how discomfort I have, I think it's better if I
mindfully move and change my posture and not continue with the pain. Or some
people say, I move every time I'm uncomfortable. That's what I do my whole
life. I think what would be wise is to learn what's going on for me when I'm
always moving at every discomfort. Let me see if I can develop some patience.
Let me try to understand myself better. What's operating when I move and shift
every little discomfort I have? You might discover you have a lot of aversion or a
lot of fear that's operating. And so the discernment part is to understand what's
going on, to know how to make adjustments in the meditation, so you're more
likely to wake, be awake, more likely to be present in a useful way. It's looking
at the other four qualities and saying, do I need to call upon my faith in this
practice? Do I need to engage a little bit more wholeheartedly here? Is more
attentiveness needed? Is more focus and continuity of attention what's needed
here? And by asking those questions and being wise, then with time you become
your own teacher. Just like if you bike from here to Monterey and you do that
regularly, after a while you become your own coach. You know what you need to do
in order to sustain the journey, the trip. So over time you begin becoming
wiser and wiser about what's needed any given time you sit down to meditate.
Every day you're going to be a little bit different. Every day your life
experiences are going to affect you in different ways. And sometimes you're
going to sit down and be agitated. Sometimes you're going to be sit down and be
tired. Sometimes you're going to be sit down and be overwhelmed by things. All
kinds of things will come along in this human life of ours. And as you start
having a sense of how to check in with yourself around these five qualities,
you can kind of begin understanding how to shift and change these qualities and
adjust them to match the circumstance you're in. If you are really tired, you
might say, I need to put more energy in here, the second quality. If you feel
overwhelmed, maybe the concentration factor is the most helpful thing because
it kind of settles things down to just keep your focus on a simple thing like
breathing. It's a classic thing to do when people are anxious is to take deep
breaths. There's something about being massaged by the rhythm of breathing in
and out that can be very calming. So when you're overwhelmed, maybe calm is
what's needed. If you're really discouraged, maybe trying to remind
yourself of the faith, your faith, or think about what's inspiring that might
inspire your meditation practice. So a life of discernment that we engage in
this process ourselves. And then the wonderful result of that is that at
some point in meditation, you become your own teacher. And that's kind of the
goal to get to learn how to be so you can you can use meditation as a
support for no matter what happens in your life. And if you engage in this
process of meditation, now you'll be ready for a time when there's a crisis.
To be able to the meditation can help you in a time of great challenge. If you
wait until the crisis to meditate, you won't get as much benefit. So what I
talked about today, these five qualities might seem a lot of work. But if you
just practice sincerely your meditation, I'm guaranteed that over a year or two
or something, this will become second nature without knowing what they are.
However, knowing what these are, these five qualities, is not meant to make you
busy now. You know, every time you go, you go and measuring sticks and seeing how
am I doing here. But rather it's a little reference point that's there in the
back of your mind. And so you kind of, from time to time, know more likely you
notice how this is working. And just kind of let it be a gentle support, a
periodic support, to find your way as you go about meditating in a calm,
relaxed way. You can consider, okay, I'm a little bit imbalanced this way and
we'll balance this way. Let me make a small adjustment here. More energy here,
more calm here, more concentration. Maybe I should be more discerning. Maybe I'm
sitting here a little bit too passive, not really engaged with what's going on.
Let me see if I can try to understand a little bit better what I'm feeling and
what's needed here in this situation. So five faculties. Faith, engagement,
mindfulness, concentration, or calm, and discernment. Sometimes they call it, it's
called wisdom. So those are my thoughts this evening. Do you have any, do you want
to ask any questions or clarifications or about these five?
So I think, now I hear it, so I think of myself as a beginning meditator and I'm
happy with that. One of the teachers I listened to described, I don't know if
you'd say consciousness or whatever's happening when you're meditating, but as
kind of like a puppy, and I like that imagery. So I kind of just watch my
puppy do its thing and just, you know, come back to the breath in the present
moment, but I feel a little, I don't know the right words for it, just kind of a
lightness to, a playfulness to, a exploratory attitude towards it.
Nice. Beautiful. The way I've heard the puppy analogy is, is you're training the
puppy, but you're not punitive to the puppy for not listening. You have to be
very patient and over and over the repetition, and you do it in a kind way
and maybe playful way, and so, you know, just take your, be very patient, do it
over and over again and, and have a kind of a, yeah, and I guess I feel I'm not
trying to train my puppy. I'm just watching at this point. Yeah, that's fine,
and then the training part comes when you feel that you spend enough time
drifting off, and maybe, maybe there's a way of having a little bit more ability
to stay grounded in the present moment. So at some point, it's not just
appreciating the play of the puppy, but it's also trying to help the puppy not
to always poop in the house.
I like, I like the analogy of seeing your mind as a puppy.
Okay, well, thank you, and if you have any, if you do have questions you don't
ask publicly, you're welcome. I'll be here a little bit, and wonderful to be here
with you, and thank you.
