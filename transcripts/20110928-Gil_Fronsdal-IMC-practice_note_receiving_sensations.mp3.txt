Practice Note : Receiving Sensations  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil Fronsdal on September 28 , 2011  
 
 
If you read the instructions the Buddha  gave for meditation practice, he uses two sets of verbs for what you 
actually do  when you meditate . One set includes  synonyms in th e category of seeing, observing  and watching. 
Another set of verbs has to do with touching, feeling  and experiencing. There’s  quite a difference between 
touching and seeing. Seeing is usually more removed , and touching  is something you do quite intimately. At 
different times in meditation, one or the other of those two approaches is appropriate. But the Buddha often used 
verbs h aving to do with touching, feeling and  experiencing directly in the beginning when the meditator  gets 
settled down, focused, and arrives in the present moment. There is something about experiencing what’s going 
on via tactile sensations  that helps ground u s in the present moment.  
 
Watching can sometimes encourage thinking about things and being a little bit removed. So don’t  just watch the 
breathing , but actually be in your body and feel it, experience it , from the inside . Be embodied as you do it. Also, 
when you do walking meditation, don’t watch the sensations of the feet , but almost be in the feet to  experience  
walking . 
 
There are two ways you could say that we feel, sense or are touched by something. One is more active and the 
other  is more receptive. The active mode is like reaching  out to touch something , whereas  the receptive mode is 
being touched. I find in meditation that it is often useful to take a receptive approach . So for whatever is  
happening  in the present moment , you can explore how it actually feel s in a tactile, physical  and embodied way , 
for example receiving the sensations of  thinking a lot or of feeling whatever you’re  feeling. Whatever is  going on , 
refer it back.  
 
If there is a really loud sound outside you can do listening, but you c ould also ask, “How does that feel?”  When 
big bass music com es by in another  car, you kind of vibrate  – you can feel the sensations almost  tactually . Or 
when you’re outside on a cool day, i f you can feel what’s happening in a receptive mode, you can take i n and 
receive the sunrays coming to warm you. Or on a warm day, y ou don’t go out to grab onto the nice cool breeze 
against your cheek , but you  receive it. Likewise,  when you experience what’s going on with your breathing , can 
you somehow  receive it into the body , almost  like it’s going to nourish or comfort you ? You open yourself to feel 
and receive it.  
 
In walking meditation , don’t lean into it and reach down to watch the experience of the steps, but rather settle 
back and let yourself receive the sensa tions that come into play as your feet do the stepping. This receptive 
mode of feeling and sensing  helps  us to ground  and arrive  in the present moment.  
 
If these  kinds of ideas are somehow interesting for you , you might experiment with them today in your practice. 
Thank you.
