 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay. So just that deep breath in followed by the exhale. And this idea of resting our awareness on this experience we're having. But of letting the awareness of what's happening just kind of follow and be with whatever is most clear in your experience. To me this feels a little bit like one of the things I love to do, which is in a warm ocean on a beautiful day is to float on a raft. Like one of those air mattresses where the water is warm enough, but cool enough, where you can just let your body rest on the raft. And just float there, being supported by the ocean, feeling the subtle movement in the water usually in that situation. Small waves, maybe receiving the sounds of the water. In a way we're resting our body on the ocean, letting our body just follow the flow of the water. In the same way we can let our awareness rest on our experience here, the breath or the sensations in the body. There's a certain surrender or letting go into the experience. Like letting the experience be what it is. We can't really control the ocean, right? We can give ourselves to the intimacy of that experience. Working with an anchor in our practice, like the breath, can be this feeling of just feeling that resting on the exhale, resting on the inhale. Breath after breath. And it also can be resting on a sound we're hearing. We're like, oh yeah, that truck, you could hear the car, and then the sound fades away and you can kind of rest into that space too. So again this idea that we don't need to struggle. If we get caught in thinking, at some point when we realize what's happening, we're already back. We're resting again right there, right here, into whatever you can sense in your present experience. Sometimes if we have minds that are active for some reason at the moment, there's two things we might try for having a hard time settling, resting on that raft. One is that three breath journey, just following intimately an inhale followed by the exhale, three breaths in a row, just that's it, a small short little period of being very connected. And then we can just do another three breath journey after that. After taking one of these three breath journeys, you might just notice what that felt like. What's the impact of just that one little intimate connection to three breaths? And if it's a one breath journey instead of three, no problem. Every moment matters. You know that feeling you have when you're really relaxed. And you can hear people talking or maybe the phone, and you just don't really care. So you're just so content, resting, relaxing, that things can be going on around you and you can hear them and they come and go and you just, it's okay, you can wait. Imagine having that feeling right now, that being with your experience, however it is right now, it's just good enough, content enough, giving into it, resting in it. So whatever those thoughts that come up in your mind or plans or remembering, it's like, oh yeah, okay. Breathing in and breathing out. And with whatever else you're aware of, it can just be going on together. Is it possible to just have the breathing be in the forefront and the other things happening in the background or to have the breath just breathe in and through the sounds or the sensations or the thoughts? Okay. Practicing in this way doesn't mean we're suppressing or rejecting anything. Instead, we're just simply prioritizing being aware. Being with... It can be helpful to ask yourself, what can I notice that's different between the inhale and the exhale? Do they feel the same, different? Does the breath feel the same on the way in and the nose as it does on the way out? Just getting a little closer, a little more connected. Noticing the temperature of the breath. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Sometimes with each exhale, I can just feel a little more letting go again. Deep in my back, my shoulders. The end of that exhale, there can be this little feeling of letting go, dropping. Maybe the breath gets a little slower. Maybe there's a pause between the exhale and the inhale and maybe not. Just being close, resting on whatever you're aware of. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. In a moment, I'm going to ring the bell. I want to invite you to stay in your meditation for a moment. Let the sound of the bell be part of what you're aware of. See if you can just hold your awareness until the sound is fully gone while staying in your meditation posture. The bell is ringing. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. In a minute, Diana will talk a little bit about concentration. Is it okay if we ask, are there any comments and reflections about your experience with this meditation? What did you notice? How was it for you? Thank you, Anne Rose, please. Well, I was uncomfortable in the city. You know, I try, when I'm ambitious, I try to sit on the floor because normally I'm sitting in a chair. And then I was like, oh, I'm concentrating on trying to get too comfortable. And then my leg was falling asleep. And then I'm like, oh, this is not what I wanted. I'm like, wait, just get up and move. And I did. And it was cool. I just was, I really liked the sensation of focusing on what the breath felt like going in. And now I never thought of it like that because sometimes when I'm focusing on the breath, I'm like, okay, I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out. But what does that feel like? I like that. It was nice. Thank you. Thank you. I thought I was doing a good job concentrating. And then all of a sudden I just faded out and I found myself leaning over one way or another. And I thought, well, that's not so good. And then I write myself up and said, okay, I'm going to stay in a balanced focus position. And they say, I know I'm leaning over to sigh again. Yeah. It's a little difficult for me to do two things at the same time, I think. So my mom just tries to go to a place where it's quiet. And then it's hard for me to start counting breathing or I'm not familiar with that. In fact, I don't even know why we have to do it three times rather than two or one. So I was just struggling with that because I was pretty comfortable with my mind work. But then I had difficulties in following what you were saying, something about breathing, which at some point I just stopped listening, I guess, with a lot of respect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that worked for me because I'm not really familiar with that three times or two times. Great. Thank you. I think earlier in the meditation, you said something about imagining like a lazy Sunday where you don't have to do anything or you don't care. That was really helpful because I think I realized that with thinking, I naturally kind of try to resist or judge or change it. So that was really helpful. And then I think I noticed that as my thoughts kind of went away, weirdly enough, I get I guess it's like I have a lot of thinking energy and when you remove the thoughts, the energy just kind of comes out, which is a very interesting experience. So, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe I'll just add the Tony when you said like floating on a raft. I had that before. It was fantastic. Also, I was like, I just felt really great, like this relax floating. It was very nice. So thank you. So is concentration practice not really what we kind of normally associate concentration with? Okay. It's more like a I'll talk about a little bit. I'm going to talk. Yeah, I'm going to talk about this. Okay. So I think it was very helpful, Tonya, that you asked us what associations do we have with this word concentration and Iris, you had said, well, I think I kind of there's a little bit stressed or I don't know. Exactly what word you said. But for me, my ear, my shoulders go up towards my ears like, oh, I'm supposed to focus. So because of that, I'd like to suggest that we use another word just because concentration, it has this baggage that goes along with it. We have this big association of whether it's supposed to be. So the poly word is Samadhi. And I like this Samadhi. Samadhi has this kind of like this relaxed feeling about it. And it turns out that that is really important. In fact, integral to concentration, we would might say. So Samadhi, if I were to define it, I would say it's probably not what we often think about this word concentration. But instead, it's like the mind and the body feeling unified, kind of like feeling collected, feeling in harmony and with a sense of well being. So the sense of well being is integral as well as one way we might think about Samadhi is like non distraction. So just kind of like collect this sense of collectedness. But we often think of it as something that the mind is doing, that the mind is right on the object. And it's very common that we use the breath as objects. We don't have to, but that's very common. So but but I want to highlight that not only is well being really important, but the body is really important to this for kind of like this collectedness, this wellness. And then I maybe also mentioned that so often it's we have this idea, okay, I need to be concentrated or I am concentrated or I'm not concentrated. But I think it's much more helpful to think of it as a spectrum. Like sometimes we're really, really distracted, just can't keep things straight at all. And sometimes there's this sense of settledness. And in this tradition, there can be an extreme sense of settledness can go really far on the spectrum. So instead of having this idea, I'm concentrated or I'm not concentrated, because sometimes when we have this idea, I'm not concentrated, then there's like, and I should be raised this little beating ourselves up or, or then I have to try harder and then we kind of get tight and strain and strive. And that's not the direction to strain and strive or beat ourselves up does not help. Absolutely. It doesn't help. In fact, it goes the opposite direction. It's a form of distraction. So it's really helpful. And because this is how it actually is. It's just a spectrum. So just to notice, am I moving towards more settledness and well being or am I moving away, settledness and well being. I think that's a really helpful way to consider this, as opposed to this binary yes, no, am I this way or not. So, how, maybe I'll add one more thing about some concentration or samadhi here is it's not only about collectedness and well being. And I'm using this word well being purposely to be very vague, because we find it, we find our way into that in different ways. For some people, it's just a kind of a quiet sense of contentment, drinking hot chocolate for me when I was a kid, that was like something that I loved, you know, so that kind of a feeling. And for some other people, it's really a big giant like, wahoo, it's my birthday, you know, that kind of a feeling. So just well being wherever, however you experience that. So, not only is it well being, then this collectedness, but the third element is that when this happens, the mind is able to see things that are a little bit more subtle than we can see in our regular way in which we're practicing. We can start to see things that aren't so obvious when we're in our regular, I sometimes call it like street consciousness, when we're just going down the street type of thing. And one way to think about it is if mindfulness is like awareness, and we can think of awareness as like a flashlight, or maybe even a telescope that looks at something that brings attention to something and highlights it so that we can see it. And Samadhi is, we can think of it as like the tripod that's underneath it. So then this beam, whether it's a telescope or flashlight, is then steady, steady on whatever it is it's seeing. And because it's steady, it can see things that otherwise you can't see, for example, if it's a telescope, right, you can't see things so well in a telescope if it's jittery, so this allows it to be steady. So, an obvious question is, well, what is the difference between mindfulness and the Samadhi thing? Like, how is the meditation different? What's the relationship between them? Well, one way is that mindfulness, which I kind of think we know we have this object, which is very often the breath, pay attention to the breath, the mind wanders, the mind wanders, it's planning, it's dreaming, it's doing whatever it is, and then it comes back to the breath. The mind wanders and it comes back to the breath. With mindfulness practice, we're holding everything in kind regard. So, if there's an uncomfortable body sensation, we could just put the flashlight of awareness, mindfulness onto that uncomfortable body sensation, hold that with kind regard until it's no longer compelling and then come back to the breath. With concentration practice, we have this object, the breath, we just stay with the breath, stay with the breath, one breath, two breaths, three breaths, ten bazillion breaths, however many. And then we have a kind disregard for the other things. We just stay with the breath. And it's not that we're shoving things away, it's not that we're insisting that they be different, but we just kind of like this kind disregard. Maybe it's like, okay, I hear that sound, but I'm just going to let it go, I'm not going to get tangled up with it and get mad at it or anything, I'm just going to, there's a sound, but just stay with the breath, stay with the breath. That's one way we might understand the difference between mindfulness and concentration, whereas mindfulness may have the breath and then the sound and then bodily sensation and then come back to the breath with a concentration, it's more just breath, breath, breath, breath. That's where I kind of, yeah, so. I can maybe say with John's question, he's asking like, why the breath and why not something else? Can you focus on maybe a positive image, a positive sensation, something else, you know, why the breath? Yeah, this is a good question, like why the breath. So it doesn't have to be the breath. We, this is the most common for some people that just doesn't work. Maybe they have, you know, trauma, or they have asthma or something like this and just to think about the breath is really uncomfortable. But there's a few things that's helpful about the breath. One is that you can tune into the sensations to the experience of it, because I was mentioning earlier how the body is involved. So it's not just mental, even though we use this word mindfulness, it feels like a misnomer. It's really like bodyfulness or so. So the breath is something that the body is doing. And because the breath has this movement, it's a little bit easier to pay attention to you because it's harder to pay attention to something that's static. If something is a little bit moving, then the mind is a little bit more interested in it. For example, Tanya in her guided meditation could have said, pay attention to the beginning, middle, and end of an exhale. And that's a way of kind of like getting a little bit more intimate with the experience. Or what's the, what does it feel like to have the gap between an inhale and an exhale? So these are ways in which the mind can tune in and maybe touch the experience more closely. But, Joanna, as well, why not a positive image or something like this? Like we, absolutely, you could do like a candle flickering or some people do loving kindness practice. We're not going to talk about that much today, which is about phrases and like sending well-wishing to other people and to ourselves. So it definitely can be that, but I would say for concentration can be like the candle flame or loving kindness phrases or all kinds of things probably. Yeah, visualizations and all these types of things. And mindfulness practice is more just about the bodily experience, the actual what's happening. And I don't, I don't have experience doing mindfulness with like imagining something. But the problem is that we're trying to stay in the present moment and the body is in the present moment. Like, of course it is. Where else could it be? But the mind, not so often is it in the present moment. It's always planning or remembering or fantasizing or rehashing a conversation or, you know, something like this. So our life is actually happening in the present moment. And this practice is that really helps support our life. So to be in the present moment is mindfulness. So one way to think about this is that concentration naturally arises if we do a lot of mindfulness, if we just start doing mindfulness and we do it a lot, concentration naturally arises. What does that mean? To do it a lot? Well, there's two ways we can think about that. One is for longer durations, that when we sit and we just sit for longer durations. And of course, right, we just start to get settled. Eventually it happens, provided you don't have like body bodily pain, because that's distracting and you often won't get settled or provided that the environment supports you. That if the neighbor's dog gets joined, the whole chorus of something else, or, you know, provided the environment supports you and your body supports you, just sitting longer, settledness and well-being just start to happen. So it goes towards concentration. So that's one way to be like, sit more, you have some concentration. A second way is just to be regular with practice, you know, to meditate every day, meditate daily, even if it's just for five minutes, you know, meditate longer, you'll have more concentration, more samadhi. But this kind of regularity of practice is really helpful, really can make a difference. So that's the second way you could do it longer. And then the third way you can do more mindfulness is to do a day long retreat or a week long retreat or something like this. So that is to meditate for a number of hours in one day. And of course, because the body cannot do that, cannot just sit still for so long, then you do sitting meditation. And when we do it here at IMC, we do this on Wednesday mornings, it's sitting meditation and then walking meditation. So you can move the body and maybe bring the energy up or bring the energy down. And then go do sitting meditation again. And then on retreats, you can do like then walking and then sitting. So sit, walk, sit, walk. So this alternation, just to help take care of the body. Otherwise, it's too hard to just sit for that long. But you can do walking meditation in a way that really can support this collectiveness and this sense of well-being and the sense of harmony or unification that can happen. So it doesn't have to be in the seated posture. For some people, they do lying down. But then meditation practice soon turns into sleeping practice, which is fine, right? Because it makes perfect sense. This is what our minds and bodies are used to. You get horizontal, you close your eyes, you go to sleep. Those are the only times in your life that you're horizontal with your eyes closed usually. So it's definitely something that has to be practiced to be able to do mindfulness laying down. So what are some other things to think about if we want to have this sense of unification and well-being? There's a number of ways that we can do to really support this. And it encourages that things that we're doing off the cushion, off the cushion when we're not meditating, do you have an impact on the mind? Of course, right? There's only one mind. So the same thing that is maybe watching TikTok videos where I don't know how long they are, but they're short, right? And so one after the other after the other after the other and the mind's like stimulated like, okay, so doing a lot of that, you know, the mind, of course, is going to have a hard time settling down. Or maybe there's a way in which there's a part of like this kind disregard that I talked about. So we're with our anchor. I could use this word anchor. So I'm suggesting it's the breath, but as John pointed out, it can be other things doesn't have to be the breath. We can use this word anchor that while we're with the anchor, we can have this kind disregard for other whatever else is happening. But that this kind disregard requires a little bit of like this letting go of like, okay, I'm not going to get tangled up with that sound. I like to use the neighbors dog barking because that's part of my life experiences. I have a neighbor whose dog barks on occasion. So there's one way in which we could just sit there and be fuming rights like I can't believe it. Why don't they let the dog out this poor dog and then they always do this and you know, maybe the dog needs some blah, blah, blah, right? We can just really get tangled up with the, when I say tangled up, I mean like lost in thoughts, but there's a way in which we can let go of this stories we have about it. Like, yep, we could follow that thought train and think for 20 minutes about how the dog should be otherwise, or we cannot just kind of let go like, oh, I'm lost in thought. Okay, I'm just going to let go of that. So this idea of letting go, it's not so easy initially might be something that we need to kind of like cultivate and practice. So this is something that we can do when we're not in the meditation posture. It's just practice letting go. And so what does that mean? It means there's a number of different ways of letting go of insisting that we have to be right. You know, letting somebody else like they may be saying something and we don't agree. Maybe we don't correct them or maybe we don't insist that they have to know what we're doing. Right. We do this in a in the settings that are appropriate, or maybe we let go of wanting to have our preferences. For example, you and your partner want to do something and your partner wants to do something different. Maybe just kind of let go of your preference at that time. So just these things that we do in our daily life really help settle the mind and the heart instead of always trying to get one more thing. So this practice is not about acquiring. It turns out by letting go of these beautiful things naturally arise. We do not have to go chase after them. We do not have to make them happen. But they're just happening with this letting go, including this samadhi, this concentration, letting go of the things that are that are distractions or insisting that things are different. So that was a kind of a little bit about samadhi. We have time maybe just for a few questions, but I kind of threw a lot of information out that way. Are there some questions or comments? Does this mean you don't explicitly practice concentration or like if you naturally do a lot of mindfulness meditation eventually as you're doing a meditation, you reach concentration? Is that kind of how it works or do you like explicitly do like concentration practice as well? Yeah, thank you Iris. This is great. Both. Sometimes you can say specifically I'm going to do concentration practice and that would mean just like staying with the anchor. And I would say you talked about you do like open awareness practice and you can definitely have concentration with open awareness. It takes a little bit longer. Sometimes I practice this way. It takes a little bit longer to settle, but the settledness tends to have a little bit more stability when the mind settles if you're doing open awareness practice. So yeah, and sometimes it is true, right? If you just do a lot of mindfulness, it'll just start happening that concentration. Okay, thanks. Just quickly. So you start with mindful concentration and eventually that will take you to the, I guess, mindful meditation and then that takes you to concentration. Yeah, so that's one way and that's a very common way, but you can intentionally do some concentration also. And that is to just really stay with the anchor, stay with the anchor, stay with the anchor and have this sense of collectedness and well-being. So this allowing the sense of well-being to arise while staying with the anchor, with the anchor, with the anchor or it's a lot of letting go, I have to say, too. I don't know, Chani, do you have something that you'd like to add here? I think, to me, I really resonate with that idea of letting go. And I kind of mentioned it in the meditation, sort of that feeling of being so relaxed that it's sort of like it doesn't matter anymore what's happening around you. You just don't have, you don't care enough. You said the kind disregard, which is a really fun way of naming it. Another way is, it's almost like also this idea of letting go. There is a phase in which it is a very active process where we have to try and help ourselves let go of something. No, let go of the ice cream. No, let go of worrying about later. But the more we let go, the less it's actually, the more automatic it becomes. The more it becomes like instead of having to let go of something, it's more like, I don't want to pick up anything. It's just like, it's okay, it doesn't matter. It's just too much work to pick up something else. You're too relaxed to want to get up. So I think that it changes. And I think there's, in the beginning, there is this, you know, anytime we start to sit, there's more of this active energy to helping ourselves stay with a breath, helping ourselves let go of the thinking, to come back, to hold the posture. But after a while, it's like things like the, in a snow globe, right? If you shake it up, all the little snowflakes are swirling around and you set it down, and slowly the snowflakes come to the rest, come to rest at the bottom of the snow globe, right? And there's almost a similar process that starts to happen for us. That things just start to come, I like the word resting, to a place of resting. Where we're just sort of intimate with whatever settled, intimate resting. And then what will happen is, like picking up the snow globe, you know, we move, the snowflakes get stirred around, and maybe it's a thought or a pain that comes up, and it does the same thing. It stirs the mind again. And, you know, sometimes that might be a lot, but sometimes it might just be, oh, and then it's, oh, it just comes back to rest again. And I'd say, you don't have to worry about concentration at all. You don't have to, you can just do mindfulness. And there's some people, maybe I'll just add this last thing, some people have a propensity for concentration, and some people have a propensity more for mindfulness. Just different minds are different. So this isn't necessarily something everybody has to do, or everybody wants to do, or something like this. It's just a recognition of something that will happen if you do a lot of mindfulness practice. There's one other word that I've used that I like, which is, there's intimacy. A sense of connection, intimacy with your experience, and that happens in mindfulness too, when there isn't contention with what's happening. And there also isn't engagement with what's happening, right, entanglement with it. There can just be like walking with your good friend, and there's this sense of connection and intimacy between you. And I think that there's a way in which our mindfulness can grow in this intimacy, when there's this lack of contention, and this lack of engagement, but not meaning disconnected. Makes sense? Yeah, okay. Yeah, Iris. If you kind of have a hard time letting go, is that where kind of like the mindfulness developing that early should first kind of help you let go easier? Or how do you kind of help let go easier? This is a great question. And you know, we're saying, oh, just let go. No problem. Definitely, this is like a skill, I would say. It's something that people definitely have to develop. So there are a few things. And one is maybe like in our daily life, to recognize when there are moments of contentment. And so we tend to be dismissive of when everything's okay. We just don't even ignore them. But there might be times when you're sitting in your car and like, everything's fine. You're just, it's fine. Or you just finished a meal, everything's fine. You know, this sense of everything's fine. So this cultivating a sense of contentment allows the mind and the body and the heart to recognize, oh, there is, it's, there is possible to have this sense of okayness without always looking for the next thing. So sometimes we just have to reassure this mind and heart that, yeah, there are these times during the day when things are okay. And again, this is not necessarily easy because, you know, our habit is to notice, oh, that's a problem. I have to fix it. Oh, that's a problem. I have to fix that. And we get rewarded for fixing problems. And you know, in our professional life, our family life, this is what we do. So this is kind of a radical thing that we're suggesting here. So I offered one thing. Do you want to offer something for? Yeah. I like the idea of let be. Another approach to letting go is just letting it be. I don't have to do anything about this. I don't have to change it. I could just let it be. And everything is gonna, the itch is gonna go away. You know, the irritating sound is gonna happen and then not happen and then happen again. Sort of, again, it's a non contention. A little bit to me, not having that sort of just willingness to let things be the way they are, you know, in meditation, is a letting go. And it's easier than this. To me, letting go has a very active feeling to it, which there are times we might need to kind of make a decision. That might be another way to put it. I need to make a decision to stop arguing with this. And then we decide that and then we have to remind ourselves and remind ourselves. And then slowly, as we keep remembering that we're not gonna argue with this anymore, it just fades because we're not engaging it anymore. It fades away. And that's kind of one way that we let go. So letting go, sometimes very active, but it also can just be very allowing letting be. Thank you. Both ideas are very pretty new to me. But great, seem very helpful. Great. Your questions were awesome. To me, the idea of letting go is to actually end up winning. So I let go because even though in my mind, I'm losing because well, you know, the person who wants to upset me, it's gonna seem that upset me because I'm not reacting to that in my mind is I'm winning because I can continue doing something different. Yeah, absolutely. I guess there is not a lot of altruism. I'm seeing things from that perspective, but it works for me because I'm willing to lose because I'm actually winning. Yeah. So that simplifies the things, which is really there's so much wisdom in that to me, that's when I think about the first noble truth, right, which is that they're suffering. To me, this is a way I would talk about what you're saying, which is I'm going to suffer if I keep fighting with this person. I don't want to suffer. So I don't care. Let them let them win because I don't want to keep suffering in that way. And so I win that way. I win because I'm not going to add to my suffering. They can think whatever they want. That's right. That's right. That's right. I agree. And maybe if this is okay, I'll say some other things that are support for letting go or for concentration. And that is just simplicity. And in all the different ways that it can show up in our lives, just not being too busy, not being in a place that's too cluttered, not, you know, just simplicity. Of course, that just helps things to settle, right, when there's a certain amount of simplicity. And I talked about also kind of like Samadhi having this sense of well-being, but just some kindness, right, just in our daily life, just practicing kindness towards ourselves and towards other people. That feels good. Of course it does. So these are some of the things that can help support to meditation practice in general and maybe a Samadhi practice in particular. Can you use the mic for the recording? Thank you so much. I think of meditations as sort of like a mental massage. You know, if I'm physically tired after exercise, I could get a massage and basically the masseur will unknot all my muscles, you know, and boy, that's really relaxing. And I noticed that when I had meditate, I had the same kind of feeling. It feels like your mind is just tangled up with worries, planning and all this other stuff. And meditation is just simply taking those tangles away, just like the tangles in your muscle. And it's very relaxing. Yeah, relaxing. And this word, tangles are great word, and this is a word that shows up a lot is like to untangle the tangle. Like the Buddhist literature has this expression to untangle the tangle. I think one other thing that might be worth talking about is just to maybe invite you to think about moments in your life, right? It doesn't have to be formal meditation, where you felt that sense of contentment, ease, the untangling, the resting, just whatever you were doing, you know, with the Buddha, it was under a memory of being under an apple tree as a child, while his father was working in the field. It inspired him to practice and brought him to liberation, remembering that experience of sitting on a summer day under an apple tree, watching his father working in the field, relaxing, that was very pleasant, you know, collected feeling of well being at ease contented. For me, that memory is of times on boats and floats in the water with the water with the sun with the warmth of the sound of chess, I could spend hours laying on the bench in my father's boat, or floating on a raft in the lake, just I was so content and comfortable. And so I wondered if you have memories, experiences that you could describe and that can help you connect with that feeling, if you'd be willing to share. Thank you. Well, to keep in mind with simplicity, as Diana put, like washing the dishes and the song starts playing, and then I'm like, not that I want to wash the dishes, but then it's, you know, just if I'm going to wash the dishes, I should wash the dishes like Taknakkand would say. And it's just like, even if I'm feeling really bad about something, like I have been recently, I just, this feels nice, this is a nice, I'm like, it doesn't, you don't have to go on a spa day to feel content, man, it doesn't have to be so big, it could just be so, something like that. Beautiful. Thank you. Give that an experience. I like the idea of simplicity. And I think your instructions really remind me of like Sunday afternoons when I don't really have anything on an agenda. It was really nice. I have great memories of. I like cooking and I have learned how to cook, you know, basically things from South America so I usually get together with friends, family and just spend time cooking and enjoying life. So those are moments that yes, you know, connect me with. The positive part of so everything. Beautiful. Yeah, so with cooking, you know, you have to pay attention to how you're holding the knife and the vegetables and the pressure. There's so much mindfulness happening, you know, and the smells and the colors to look in. And that's very present moment, right? Very present moment, not having to head off and do a bunch of things on your Sunday, you know, you just there's this resting in the experience of the dishwashing. And that's there's something really we're intimate, we're connected, or, you know, sort of open to being with this moment in this way that is so nice, so nourishing brings the well being. Yeah, maybe I'll share something to you is that my mom and I used to make like greeting cards together, and it was just something very sweet we would just be sitting at the kitchen table you know, cutting or I don't know stamping doing all kind of stuff, but it was just very nice like we had this little project that together we were doing and this very sweet so this idea of kind of like doing some activity that requires attention but it's enjoyable and nothing else needs to happen. Yeah. So, are there any other comments or questions any other curiosities and Richard maybe you could check and see if there's anything on YouTube a question or comment. Welcome to happy happy to hear from anybody on YouTube and I hope the idea here is to invite you to not get tangled up with the idea of concentration that tangling up around it will lead to the opposite of concentration or some ID. And maybe I'll just share that for me it was a turning point in my practice. When I realized, oh well being is a key here. Somehow I felt like, strive and just said really strain and huff and puff and it turns out that a certain amount of for me, I wasn't feeling well actually and during a retreat and so I was lying down in my room and meditating. I was just having a little bit of knee issues I just had to give my knees and rest. And it was something about just being horizontal that was just a little bit more little bit less efforting a little bit more comfortable at that time and allowed like, oh, some concentration to happen and like, oh, this is what they've been talking about. Oh, I see. So maybe I'll say this that some of these deep concentration states when they arise, it will be a surprise. It will always be a surprise because if you're really really really striving and strain, you're not going to get there. So it just arises as a surprise just at that. So you don't have to be trying super super hard, but at the same time, we have been talking about letting go and contentment and simplicity and kindness and well being. It is a skill in terms of it is something that we can have to train the mind and the body to do to, you know, keep on coming back. Don't follow the destruction. Just keep on coming back to the anchor for the breath or whatever the anchor is that you're using. And we've learned lots of skills in our lives. We learned to tie our shoes, most likely drive a car or ride a bike or right. We've learned lots of things. So this is just one more thing that we can learn. Yes, Iris. Yeah. Thank you. Have there been times where you've kind of like lost a bit of motivation or like interest in practice and like if you're like motivation kind of ebbs and flows and you've reached a point where you're like, not really feeling that motivated. If that happened to you and like how do you work with that? Great question, Iris. Great question. Do you want to go first or no you unless you want me to. Yes. Yes. We're all the human right. Of course this happens and I've gone through phases like this is crazy. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm never going to do this again. Like, then, you know, then I do. So what helps having friends who meditate and sometimes I'm using this word friends really lightly. Maybe it could just be associates or colleagues or so it makes a huge difference to be with a group. So whether it's online or in person. So that takes a little bit of effort right to log on or to go to a place, but that can really make a big difference to as a support. And there's often sometimes maybe I'll offer this and maybe some other people have some ideas to a second thing is it can be helpful to check in with where we connect with why we started meditation in the beginning. And I was having these difficulties or I wanted to do something and it might be that what was initially motivating us as as lessons of some of the difficulties or something like this. But it's not uncommon for why we're like maybe to start because we're having some degree of suffering in our lives. And I'm using this word suffering to go just like stress all the way to, you know, this just receiving a very scary diagnosis and you have limited time to live, you know, the whole range from just mildly stressful and irritated to you're going to die unexpectedly and you know it. That it could be that when we begin practice, then it's not uncommon that we catch a glimpse of something and it points to maybe we're not even sure what it points to but it touches the heart or touches the mind in some way like, Whoa, what was that? And it kind of like, I feel like we want to want to touch it again or understand that better or something like that. So that's not uncommon. So just maybe if that has happened to connect to that, like what whatever that was, even if you don't know what it was that kind of something. Maybe you have some things on the hour. I was thinking, I was thinking about that feeling of, you know, not being very motivated and how when I think about any time that I still got myself to sit down, even if it was for five minutes. I don't think it ever made me feel worse. And I can pretty confidently say I always felt better. And so maybe it's getting disenchanted with the discontent or the doubt and being sort of like, well, okay, but I'm gonna I mean, literally for me for a long time, it was really only five minutes. But I kept that five I kept sitting for that five minutes. If that's all I could do, that's all I could do. But that five minutes for there was about a year where it was a lot of five minutes. But boy, did that that year of five minutes it's leave an impression on me really impacted me. So I think maybe even if you took two minutes when your mind says, why am I doing this and saying, well, let me sit for two minutes and see why am I doing this and discover a new each time. Because that two minutes will make a difference. Any other, maybe one, one more comment or question or we can just move to dedication of merit at this point but I guess I'll just say I really appreciate the questions the reflections the engagements. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I have, I'm very grateful for IMC and for Tanya and you Diana and the Monday sittings and these Thursdays have been have been revolutionary for my mind that's been kind of in its own battlefield. Yeah. And so, um, the yesterday in terms of concentration and the surprise element I realized, I, I came to sit be to meditate because of my anxious and, you know, overthinking and all those things. And just stuck very stuck. And then I then I came to this conclusion when I was on the phone with my sister like oh wait, I noticed what I'm doing when I'm feeling really anxious. And it's just either with my speech or what I'm saying and whether gossiping too much and like, and I never would have. I never would have been aware of that. And I just taken the time to just be still. And it was really surprising and those. That was last night and I'm like, oh my goodness. And even if I received bad news, and I want to hold on to that forever. I don't have to. And if I'm like striving to change it or fix it and that's usually it usually doesn't work for me. I was doing something differently. And I was just so I'm just very very very grateful, truly so much. There's, I have a long way to go but yeah, a five or a 10 minutes it in the morning and in the evening for me has been, I, I can't imagine not doing it anymore because it's to not take that time for myself. So I could be better for others, at least more mindful in what I do is just, I think you. Thank you. And thank you for highlighting that we don't just practice for ourselves, we practice for others. This is how the world becomes a better place right when people are more tuned into what's happening with them and sensitive to what's happening with others. Thank you. And a beautiful segue to dedication of merit. So we don't just practice for ourselves. We practice for really ideally the benefit of all beings, without exception. And so one of the things I've been doing on Thursday nights is to help us, you know, all beings is a concept and idea. We have certain beings in mind that we know are suffering or could use the benefit of our practice and so I want to invite anyone to share. Anyone you want to name to be part of this dedication of merit, any group, any person, any being, any animals, whatever, whatever you want us to bring to mind. So, is there anything you would like to specify? From my perspective, I just wish all of you, everybody here. Everybody here. Lots of happiness and I'm very happy that I'm here too. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for being willing to use the microphone even though it stresses you out because it's amazing. People do listen to these talks. And we hear about it. I remember when I was a student too, hearing other people, oh my gosh, what's this life saver like, oh, they're just like me. They have the same questions I do. Makes a big difference. Yeah. So I know it's weird to hold the mic, but it is speaking up for the benefit of all beings. It really, it's amazing what happens when you hear people talking about what they heard and it's really a gift. So, so may this practice, our time together, the things that you've shared, that we've shared, may it be a benefit to each other, to all of our others and our lives and to all beings everywhere. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all.
