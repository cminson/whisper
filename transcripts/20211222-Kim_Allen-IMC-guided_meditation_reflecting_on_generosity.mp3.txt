The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, so we'll go ahead and get started. Nice to see everyone there. Welcome. So
just settling in for today's meditation. Yesterday we talked about four qualities
that are the basis of spiritual friendship and are also forms of inner
wealth. And so I'm gonna pick out one of those today to kind of provide some of
the background for our meditation at the beginning and then we'll settle in
again with a period of silence. So we're gonna focus on generosity. But first
let's just begin by settling in, closing the eyes, allowing the attention to come
inward, sensing the posture that you're sitting in, or maybe lying down in, and
just checking in that you're in a balanced posture. If you're sitting up
right, it's one where you don't have to exert a lot of effort. The body feels
naturally upright and straight, relaxed. If you're lying down, you can still have a
sense of straightness in the body, balancing whatever posture you're lying
down in. It can help to sense where you're sitting, what's supporting you and
just even rocking back and forth a little bit or forward and back, just to
find that middle point where you're the most balanced that you can be in this
posture.
You can even think of resting in your sitting spot as a way of giving yourself
to the support. Instead of trying somehow to do it all ourselves, hold
ourselves up, give your weight to what you're sitting on and ultimately to the
earth, let it support you. And then softening into this balanced posture,
softening the eyes and the eye sockets, often looking at a screen, you can get a
little tense in the eyes.
Even softening behind the eyes as if we could relax a muscle in the head, relax
the brain, softening the neck and letting the shoulders drop.
Releasing down the arms and hands.
And just inviting some openness through the chest and the belly area. Checking in
while you're there, if you have any sense of tension, any background emotions, just
to know how you are.
Inviting some ease.
Releasing any bracing in the legs.
Just letting the legs be natural, the muscles soft.
Letting the in-breath encourage a straightening of the central part of the
body and letting the out-breath encourage a softening and falling away
around that straight center, just in a gentle way.
So I'm going to drop in a short quote from the suttas, from Buddhist
teachings. And the invitation is just to let it resonate inside like ripples in
water or like an echo. And there will be some ripple and then you can just let it
fade out naturally and go back to the the breath or the body.
So the Buddha said, if beings knew, as I know, the results of giving and sharing,
they would not eat without having given. Even if it were their last morsel, their
last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared it, if there were
someone to share it with.
So
And as it fades out, just turning your mindfulness back to the breath.
The body.
So we'll have two more brief connections with generosity.
And the second one is just a simple reflection in the mind.
So I'll ask you to recall a time of simple, unentangled giving.
When you were able to give something just simply, it was easy, it was natural, it flowed.
Just remember that time and how it was.
You could let images arise in your mind or a recollection of the feeling you had
or how the person looked when you gave something.
And maybe notice how it brings some joy into the mind.
And you can also let that fade away, let the mind settle back into your usual mindfulness.
And now the invitation is to feel directly and deeply in your mind.
And deeply into the body how it is when the mind is imputed with the quality of generosity.
So you can re-evoke the memory or you can recall the quote
that beings would not eat their last morsel without giving
if there were someone to share it with.
And really take that feeling deeply into the body where we have the direct experience
of a body and mind imputed with generosity and rest in that feeling.
What is the energy of generosity like?
Does it move?
Does it have lightness, heaviness, a certain location?
Does it extend outside the body?
There are no expected answers to this, just getting to know that quality through our own experience.
So we've encountered this quality of generosity through hearing and teaching on it.
Through reflecting, thinking about how that matches our own experience.
And through directly sensing that quality in the mind, the experience of it.
These are different ways to encounter a quality like generosity.
So now we'll have a period of silent sitting for a little while
just allowing it to resonate, settle out, move into your usual mindfulness practice.

So our direct experience can also help us throughout the day to do things from the most wholesome
way.
So this might be an interesting thing to remember as you go forward today is how wholesomeness feels
can help others through the way that you talk and speak and hear and act.
It's always helpful to include that internal dimension when we can.
Thank you.
Thank you.
