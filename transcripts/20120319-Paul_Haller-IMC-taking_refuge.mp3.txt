The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, good evening.
It's long enough since I came here to give a talk. I have given talks here in the past,
but it's long enough since I've done that, that it has a quality of
newness to it. And I was enjoying, you know, watching, you know,
what happens here? Where do people sit? What's the disposition?
And part of my mind was then comparing it to the San Francisco Zen Center.
Well, we do this. We bring the battle at the start.
Last fall I led a retreat with Gil, and he didn't ring the bell at the start,
and I did. But we still managed to lead the retreat together.
One of the central themes, maybe arguably the central theme that ties
different Buddhist traditions together, despite the way they present,
the teaching may vary, the practices they do may vary, how they dress may vary.
It's the notion of taking refuge.
So that's what I'd like to talk about this evening.
I was inspired to talk about it by someone coming to talk to me, you know,
in the Zen tradition we have periodic interviews or exchanges around the Dharma.
One-on-one. And this person came to me, and she's been coming to the Zen Center
for a couple of years, you know, taking classes, meditating regularly,
doing some more intensive sitting retreats, or as we call them, sushis.
And she came to talk to me, and she said, looking a little bit sheepish,
she said, I've sort of fallen in love with practice.
You know, a sophisticated woman, you know, being a psychotherapist,
actually a psychoanalyst for over 20 years,
and somewhere, I don't know, mid-40s, mid-50s, somewhere in that range, I think.
But somehow when she made this statement, this proclamation,
there was this kind of look of innocence, joy, trust.
And it set me thinking, you know, what is the alchemy that occurs for us
that brings us into that state, that way of being,
that just our involvement, our commitment, our trust,
our wish to immerse in just sort of flows, you know?
And how that, to my mind, and it would be lovely to hear how it is for you,
to my mind, that's very close to taking refuge.
There are many reasons we can take up practice, you know,
in everything from a response to the ways in which our life feels out of balance
or afflictive, you know, to the way in which there's some resonant sense of integrity
or virtue or morality that arises for us in relationship to the Buddhist teachings
we've been exposed to, or something in the process of sitting,
some way in which consciousness settles, attunes, you know, all of these things,
or one of these things, you know?
And I would say each one of us has our own path through these, you know?
Maybe for one person, one is paramount, you know,
and provides the influence, the motivation to engage practice.
And then maybe for another person, it's quite different.
And one of the things you learn as a teacher is that very thing, you know?
There's a whole variety of ways in which people come to practice.
There's a whole variety of ways in which people sustain their practice.
But in the midst of that, those variety of ways, there's also some kind of constant theme.
Some way in which involvement becomes attractive.
And in some ways, the very process of meditating, the very process of mindfulness is just this.
Engaging in a way where involvement in the moment becomes attractive.
You know, to the degree that it's not so much a determined effort or a disciplined effort,
it becomes more of a giving over.
In the Buddhist teachings, you know, as attention ripens into concentration,
there's a steady attention.
There's a good translation for the word samadhi.
It's a steady or continuous attention.
And then it ripens into an immersion.
The same way our involvement can come from intention.
Oh, this is a good thing to do.
And what comes with that intention is a resolve, a discipline, a commitment.
And then as you engage it and it ripens, something is experienced.
And in that experiencing, rather than being drawn forth through discipline,
it's more opening to something more akin to devotion.
Or is this person so wonderfully put like falling in love?
There's an attractive proposition that's deeply appealing.
We're drawn in for whatever set of reasons, the alchemy of our own being,
in combination with the practice, with the dharma, with the sangha, bring something forth.
In Japanese, the term refuge is translated as kie.
And the kie translates as fully committing, or giving over to, or fully investing in.
And the ea at the end is that which can be relied upon or trusted.
So giving over to that which can be trusted.
And how is that established?
I would say in endless ways.
But I would say something in the process of practice is asking us to discover that.
Not so much as some dogmatic principle that we think we should adhere to.
Not so much some discipline that if we're a good person doing the right thing for the right reasons,
this is how it'll be.
But more getting in touch with the nobility of our own spirit,
getting in touch with what brought us into the proximity of practice.
You know, one proposition I...
So in this end process, taking refuge, you're so a garment like this.
And then you have a ceremony.
Ceremonies are wonderful.
They're a crystallization of a process.
You crystallize it into a moment of symbolic expression.
You have a relationship with someone and you decide to get married.
And then you have these little symbolic gestures.
Yes, I do.
Okay, we'll put the ring on that finger.
We just made that up.
Well, we were in the midst of that.
That moment, that very symbolic gesture reverberates through your whole being.
Because I would say it involves us.
It draws us in and we give ourselves to it.
That this is the process of love.
And there's romantic love and there's spiritual love.
And some part of the alchemy is similar and then some part of it is just quite different.
Although sometimes part of the vehicle of your spiritual love may be a living teacher,
or some Shakyamuni Buddha, or some principle of practice.
So in the Zen tradition, we've crafted a process.
And one part of the process is honoring the teachers.
So often I would say to people, think of when you were a child.
Think of the people who made a big impression on you.
What was the quality, the character of their being that impressed you?
And what was the teaching that you got from it?
Because usually that's where something very fundamental, that's where someone demonstrated to us kindness.
That's where someone demonstrated to us acceptance.
And there's other simple but profound qualities that nurture the nobility of our spirit.
And that set the stage as we become more thoughtful and thinking and rational.
Set the stage for how we consider the path of practice,
whether we consider it primarily a religious activity or a humanistic activity,
or however we consider it.
And the style of Buddhism that we practice, I would say, you don't have to agree with this,
I would say it's an attempt to get at something fundamental
that we adapt various ways of being, the very process of meditating together,
having Dharma talks and having Dharma, Espanyol and all these in social engagement,
all these events that we craft together in our shared commitment to practice.
They rest on something.
In the traditional language of Buddhism we'd say they rest on taking refuge.
And then in the Vipassana there's not much ritual,
in a formal, traditional or classic sense, Buddhist sense.
Then in the Zen school we have more.
And Gil and I, one of the things we have in common, we've both practiced in both schools.
And I have found in myself that taking refuge is the common thread.
And that there's no way you can say, and this is it,
this ceremony or this convention of practicing together,
is it in contrast to some other way?
It's more something within our being.
And when I read this poem, that's what came up for me.
This is a poem by William Stafford that he calls, The Way It Is.
There's a thread you follow.
It goes among things that change.
But it doesn't change.
People wonder about what you're pursuing.
You have to explain about the thread.
But it's hard for others to see.
When you stay close to it, you can't get lost.
Tragedies happen.
People get hurt or die and you suffer and get old.
Nothing you can do can stop times unfolding.
You don't ever let go of the thread.
The word sutra and the word sutra,
and their core of both is thread.
The sutra, the thread that flows through the dharma.
I don't know if that's what inspired the poem,
but it is indeed the word sutra, the word sutra, the thread.
So how to attend to that within ourselves?
To remember something of that quality when we come to practice.
That this is the aspiration and the expression of the nobility of our spirit.
That when we come to sit, it's not some imposition on our being.
It's the recollection.
It's the recollecting of that which moves and motivates and guides our life.
It's not that there isn't discipline and commitment.
Just the same way when we relate to each other with some warm and generous feeling.
It's not that we're always going to agree,
but when that connectedness is there,
the vicissitudes, the afflictions, the tragedies of our human life
don't become sharp edges that cut us and wound us and separate us
and leave us feeling like, well, I'm never going to talk to that person again.
Or I'm never even going to talk to myself.
One of the things I do as a teacher is sometimes mediate in interpersonal difficulties.
We actually teach each other conflict resolution.
I don't know if Gil has taught it here or brought in people.
One of the things you do in conflict resolution,
is very simply, you get this person to speak the truth
and you get this person to listen deeply.
In one style of process, you get them to repeat back.
Could you tell them what they just said?
Did I get it right?
Yeah, well, I missed this.
And then you reverse it.
Recently, I was going through this process
and watching, initially, the two people were charged.
They had issues with each other.
This was not a celebration of love.
We were brought together by conflict.
So they had a charge.
It was hard to listen.
There were emotions fueling that charge, negative emotions.
But as they took on the listening,
they discovered, I was going to use the word realized,
maybe realized, they realized they were bearing witness to another human being
who had experiences different from theirs,
who had ideas and emotions different from theirs.
And as they bore witness for each other,
that which separated them seemed to dissipate in its conviction.
Some kind of mutual appreciation.
And in the very process of doing that,
they were both settling.
They were both less caught up in the affliction of their difficult emotions.
They were less committed to the process of staying separate,
of staying antagonistic.
And it set me thinking, in a way,
meditation is doing that with ourselves.
You bear witness to what comes up.
You listen deeply and intently.
And something in the very process of doing that is reconciliation.
Why do our stories repeat themselves?
Because in a way they haven't been fully listened to.
Like when we fully listen and take in and feel the suffering
that goes with that story that's repeating itself.
That quality of unfinished business starts to dissipate.
So this is mine from this.
And engaging in the process
nurtures the trust, facilitates the connectedness,
and helps bring about the quality of subtleness.
So be it.
I had thought of doing an exercise,
honestly, I think it would be a little chaotic in the limited period of time we have.
But I'll tell you the exercise.
Maybe we could do it like this.
Here's what the exercise is.
I don't know if you've ever done repeated questions.
Is it familiar process with any of you?
Repeated questions are very interesting.
The same question.
And you answer, then you set aside that answer, then the question,
and then you answer, and then you set aside.
So maybe you could just repeat this question silently to yourselves.
You just close your eyes.
And then the knack of it is you want a concise answer.
Don't go off into a long anecdote or narrative about your life.
Well, it all started when I was...
Well, in a way it did.
But the sake of the exercise, come to the conclusion.
There's something akin to that process of mediating,
of listening deeply to who you are, to what you are, to what?
What comes up?
And the question is this.
The question is, how do you suffer?
We all want to love.
We all want to be loved.
We all want the feeling of intimacy and connectedness,
the communion of shared values and commitments.
None of us came here this evening, I think,
looking for separation or conflict.
It doesn't resonate with this nobility of spirit that we aspire to.
And yet something interrupts.
Something pulls us into conflict anyway.
In a very broad sense, this is the realm of dukkha.
This is the realm of suffering.
And it brings up in us the impulse to separate,
the impulse to pull back, to compare, to criticize,
to push against.
So let's try this.
We'll try this for a couple of minutes and I'll ring the bell at the end.
And don't worry, usually I will offer you more sort of intro and path,
psychological path into it.
Ask yourself silently, how do I suffer?
And then a word, a phrase.
As best you can, this crystallization, this conciseness.
How do I suffer?
I feel sad.
How do I suffer?
I get frustrated.
How do I suffer?
I worry about difficulties.
For a couple of minutes, just let that question rattle around
and see what answers appear.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
I have to say, I think that was way too short of time
and way too abrupt in introduction, but I hope it offered you something.
To come into this bearing witness relationship with how we suffer.
I would say it's not for nothing that it's the first noble truth.
That in our suffering there is the quickening of that which stands in contrast
to the deep wish within us to open, to connect, to be intimate,
to allow the ready expression of the nobility of our spirit
to see and accept and take in the nobility of the spirit of others.
And our suffering gets entangled with that, inhibits it,
preoccupies us in a way that that is quite literally forgotten,
disturbs us, agitates us, that stimulates a contraction, a separation.
And Hoover's doesn't know that in long-term relationships
these two get intertwined, sometimes in disappointing and or perplexing
and frustrating ways.
And in the realm of practice, can this vow, this engagement of taking refuge,
can it uphold not only the virtuous conduct of our noble spirit,
but also uphold a patient and kind relationship to our suffering?
Can that be, you know,
can the very vulnerability and humanness of our being in its limitations,
in its contracted response to suffering, can that be held to?
And I would say that meditation is putting these two together.
Can we sit with a trust in being what we are, who we are, how we are?
Can we sit and let something ripen and settle and open?
Can we sit and hold the agitation, distress, affliction, disappointment, frustration
of a suffering life?
And can we sit with them both, which either one appears?
So weird.
Each time we come to sit, can we bring that kind of involvement?
This period of meditation will be whatever it will be.
Maybe it will be serene.
Maybe it will be tumultuous.
Maybe it will be about bearing witness.
Recently I was doing a guided meditation with someone.
And I was guiding them into settling.
And in the settling, deep sadness.
And in the deep sadness, a sense of release.
And as the person came out of the meditation, there were tears flowing down their face,
and they were smiling.
Meeting our suffering is a path to releasing our suffering.
It's a path to supporting and sustaining the vow of taking refuge.
And this is the subtle play of meditation.
This is the involvement of mindfulness.
How it arises is how it arises.
It's the product of endless karmic conditions.
But as William Stafford, the poet says, some thread of continuity.
And each time we come to sit, each time we return to mindfulness,
to remind ourselves, you know, the word sati,
part of the root of the word sati, is to remember.
To remind ourselves soviet.
Soviet is what is happening now.
Whether it's sweet or afflicted, soviet.
I'll read this poem again.
The way it is, there's a thread you follow.
It goes among things that change, but it doesn't change.
People wonder about what you're pursuing.
You have to explain about the thread, or not.
But it's hard for others to see.
When you get close to it, you can't get lost.
Tragedies happen. People get hurt or die, and you suffer and get old.
Nothing you can do can stop times unfolding.
You don't ever let go of the thread.
So taking refuge.
Tender, careful attention to your own being.
What helps you? What inspires you?
What draws and quickens your involvement?
Are you inclined towards a more religious perspective, a more humanistic perspective?
The literal integrity of the Buddhist message and principles that appeals to you?
Is it some quality of presence that you've tasted, that you've grown to trust and appreciate,
and like to return to that quality and re-engage it?
Whatever your dharma gait, whatever your dharma path, soviet,
to return to the intimacy of meeting the moment
and letting that intimacy support the frailty and difficulties of human life.
This is the common thread of the Buddhist, the many, many Buddhist sects. We take refuge.
And on that note,
we end at nine, right?
I don't know.
How about two questions, if there is such an interest?
Anyone have a question about anything I said?
Are you satisfied with it just as it is?
Okay, soviet, thank you for coming.
