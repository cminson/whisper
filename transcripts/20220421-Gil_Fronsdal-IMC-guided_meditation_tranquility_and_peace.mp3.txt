 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So assuming an upright, alert posture and even though later there will be a process of relaxing, relaxing can begin right at the beginning. And to take a few deep breaths on the exhale let your body settle in to the spot in which you're sitting. Taking a deep breath and relaxing, releasing the whole body as if there's a big ah as you exhale. Here, now and then let your breathing return to normal. And part of the function of relaxing at the beginning is to awaken a certain kind of healthy awareness in your body, healthy sensitivity, that works best when the body is relaxed. And so to relax and feel if there's a shift in sensitivity, sense of awareness in the parts of the body that you relax. So in the exhale softening the muscles of the face and as they soften, different sensations are there than if the face is tense. And if in receptivity as you exhale softening, relaxing the shoulders. And feeling with whatever softening, relaxing, releasing of the shoulders you have. If there's now a little bit more awareness in your shoulders, more ability to sense and feel in a certain way. Perhaps on the exhale you can soften the chest and awaken a certain kind of attentiveness, awareness, sensitivity to certain kinds of feelings that come with the relaxation. And then the same thing with the belly, relaxing, softening. And even if the relaxation brings sensations that are not so comfortable, maybe appreciate the heightened sensitivity. And then using the same process in the mind, as you exhale relaxing the mind, the thinking energy. And if you're thinking quiet, the mind settles a bit. Is there some kind of shift in how the sensitivity, the awareness of the mind is present for you? And then now for a little while connecting to your breathing. Maybe relaxing on the exhale. And with whatever heightened sensitivity that the relaxation provides, receive the sensations of breathing in. Breathing in and breathing out. On the exhale, letting go of your thoughts as if your thoughts can drift away. And with whatever degree of calm you have, let your awareness be sensitive to the contrast of any tension that your whole body-mind system might have. And almost like there's a conversation between the calm and the tension, the subtleness and the agitation. And to whatever degree you can, choose the calm way of going. Choose being quiet and peaceful, non-reactive. Instead of letting your mind choose agitated thoughts or stress, tension, follow the trail of peace and relaxation. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. And if you can see the difference between being caught in thoughts and not caught, between following a path of stress and agitation versus following a path of calm and stability, peace, you see that difference. That can be a source of joy, of delight, that you see the possibility of following a trail towards peace. The joy that you know an alternative to being stressed or preoccupied caught up. And while it's not always easy to follow the alternative path of peace, it's an inspiration to know it exists, that you can see the difference. And if you do feel some inspiration, some joy, hit this difference. Maybe allow yourself to have a little quarter smile with the corners of your lips move up a little bit. To share in the delight and the joy of having this practice to practice. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. And then see if you can now relax your body even more. As if before you're relaxing the surface parts. Now something deeper, deeper in the face, relaxing and softening. Deeper in the shoulders. Deeper in the chest. Deep in the belly. Relaxing of the whole body that is also letting go into a kind of contentment. Simply being here, present, connected with a sensitivity that comes from being relaxed. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. With each exhale. Letting the body and mind become more tranquil, even if it's infinitesimal movements. When the inhale, you're present for any of the non-tranquil ways you are in the body and mind, however subtle. And on the exhale, you relax, soften, let go into whatever piece that's here. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to feel or imagine any degree of peace that's present for you. Or with imagining, remembering a feeling of peace that you've had sometime in your life. That deep tranquility and imagine that your calm and your peacefulness can be felt by others. That it is a gift that spreads from you into the world. And may it be that in known and unknown ways, your experience of peace supports others to also know peace. Or to feel less anxious. May it be that our peace and our contact with peace and deep tranquility is shared with the whole world. May it be that it spreads from us for the welfare and happiness of others. May we be a source of peace for this world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings experience freedom. And may we contribute to that possibility. Amen.
