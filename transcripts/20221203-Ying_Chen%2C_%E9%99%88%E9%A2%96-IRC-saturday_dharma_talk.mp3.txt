 So up to this point of the retreat, we've offered a set of teachings that take us from meeting Dukkha to having new perspectives or new relationships with Dukkha and seeing and knowing maybe the arriving, arising of the Dukkha and passing away and also began to know that there is a way that allows this to happen. Gil spoke about the Noble Eightfold Path. This is the path that we walk and that allows us to begin to tune in and see the arising and passing of the Dukkha. So we've been calling what we have been teaching on this retreat a journey and it's a practice journey and it's a journey that also unfolds as we practice. And this is a journey that has effect on our body and mind and heart. And so today I wanted to offer a summary review of this journey and this review is using a metaphor, a metaphor of a mountain hike. Kind of like, you know, we're on a journey of a hike, you know, going up on the mountain and leaving behind maybe the busyness of the work and things that outside. And then at this juncture we're also entering into a returning. And you can see this metaphor might work for the arc of the retreat. It could also be something of an arc of a sitting, you know, we're entering into a sitting. And there are different phases that unfolds in a sitting and there is a returning from the sitting to something else. And could be also, you know, arc of the day. So however this might be taken, that the teachings that we offered on this retreat might in some way fit into this metaphor. And this journey, discovering the mountain path, begins by meeting Dukkha. And some may come to this hike because of profound kind of Dukkha, kind of a Dukkha that may even be felt like being backed into a corner that don't know a way out. And somehow someone pointed to, you know, there is this path that leads to something new that, you know, may be a possibility for you. And I'm reminded of the story of a Patucara. Some of you may have been doing your walking meditation in the walking hall and there is a statue here, a female disciple of the Buddha. And her name is Patucara. And there is a story of Patucara's life and how she met Buddha Dharma. And for those who are online, you may notice that the manager's profile photo is the photo of this statue. So even if you're not seeing it, you're seeing the photo of a Patucara statue that we have here in the walking hall. And her story of loss and Dukkha was profound. Within kind of a two-day span of time, she first lost her husband to a snake bite and then taking her newborn and a toddler trying to cross over to go home to see her family in the village across the river. She lost her both sons, the newborn and the toddler while crossing the river. And in the midst of extreme despair already at that point, she headed towards the village where her family lived and only to find out that her house had been burned down and she lost all of her family. She just, she was mad, crazy. Even just as I'm speaking about this, telling the story, I feel the heartache. But she happened to see the Buddha. She happened to meet the Buddha and the Buddha taught her the Dharma and pointed the way, pointed a way that lead to awakening, freedom from Dukkha. And she walked this path diligently, sincerely and eventually she became an awakened individual, awakened being. And she's known as one of the foremost female disciples that also taught Dharma to others. And so if you happen to walk in the walking hall next to the statue, may you be inspired and uplifted by her story. And there is also a modern day version of this story and that is the story of Deepa Ma. Deepa Ma was an Indian lay householder who lived in Burma for many years and she too lost two children and lost her husband when she was a middle aged woman. And then also in the despair, she went to visit the Buddhist Meditation Center in Burma and there she began the Dharma life and Dharma path. And her Dharma life flourished and she was known to be one of lay householder teacher who taught a lot of householders, wives, working individuals. And she also has been the teacher of some of the most senior Western Theravada teachers in our lineage, including Sharon Sosberg, Joseph Ghosting and Jack Kornfield, seeing a way that we are beneficiaries of her teaching in maybe direct, indirect ways. So it's possible that one began this path maybe through meeting quite profound kind of a dukkha. And it's also possible that one meets, come to this path through just mild discontentment. We're just bored with what we're doing, we're always doing the same thing. And someone pointed out, hey, maybe try something new, maybe meditation and try take this hike. And see climb up the mountain and see something new. And that's another possibility. And maybe a lot of things in between all of this. But no matter which way and where we met the dukkha that led us to discover this path and now here we are. And let's retreat, having, undertaking this journey. And so add to the beginning of our walking this path when it's first discovered. And there may be a sense of renewal, a sense of freshness. And for some people might be very profound when you felt like there was absolutely no other way. Just may feel like a profound opportunity. And this is aware on the sense of a trust and faith confidence coming. That there's something new, we're uplifted, we feel like we want to give this a try. We're going to take a step at a time and see where this goes. And so as we begin this hike, one step at a time, one breath at a time, what also happens at the same time is that we're leaving behind maybe the busyness of work, life, many other things that we can get preoccupied with. And as Gail was mentioning this ritual of leaving behind and entering into the liminal space. And we are here in this liminal space. And add to the beginning, it may feel like we still have a lot of things that are preoccupying our mind. You know, the things that we may be buried away kind of pop up in our mind and we can get quite busy. But as we continue kind of one breath at a time, one step at a time, as we alternating, sitting, walking, sitting, walking, chopping veggie, cleaning dishes, and there's all this simplicity of life here, little by little, the preoccupations began to fade. We may begin to tune in to the environment that we're in. And we may begin to tune in to our own body and mind. We begin to immerse into the atmosphere that we have. And in this mountain hike, maybe we're tuning in to the forest, the switch and turns of the path. And there can be a kind of bubbly joy coming up. I remember one time on a retreat in IRC, just walking down the trail around the whole peripheral, I just felt this surge of a delight and almost felt like I was going to galloping like a five-year-old down the path. And so it could just be with our steps and the forest and the air, the rain, the raindrops. Today I've heard some of you reporting how happy, just feeling the rain on the face. And so that's the arising of a pomodia and pity and joy. And also here I deliberately didn't kind of try to delineate what is pomodia, what is pity. I'm really kind of offering a field here. It doesn't have to be black and white, but you can feel some sense of joy and delight as we're engaging this path. And as we continue, and some of the initial excitement may settle, and maybe we can begin to tune in to maybe subtler elements that may be otherwise that are ignored. For example, as we do a long hike, sometimes you may begin to notice not just the sound, but also the vast silence all around. Maybe not just the trees, but all the space in between. And so there can be a sense of a quieting, settling, stilling coming in. As we continue to engage in this path, while a lot of distractions begin to fade away. And so that's the arising of a tranquility. And tranquility can lead to certain kind of contentment. Oh, just here is enough. Just this fresh air. Just this rain. Just this space. And that real poem from the beginning of the time. Just this. Just this. So there can be that kind of happiness coming in. Nothing more is needed. And as we continue, continue on this path, and the deeper sense of composure can sink in. And maybe in this mountain path metaphor, come to a point that the whole sky, earth, mountain and you kind of completely coming together. And you're just not disturbed by anything. Right there. And things feel clear. The sound all around feels clear. And your mind feels clear. And so there's a sense of some body can come in. And then from there, a sense of clarity also come in. And the sense of stealing can be maybe even at the point you feel like you don't need to go anywhere anymore. Maybe you just come to a point where there's a big piece of a rock next to a clear lake. You just sit down. You don't need to go anywhere. You're just there sitting on the rock next to the lake. In the sutta, there is this passage that describes this kind of a clear seeing. It goes to something like this. It's also using a mountain lake as a simile right here. And so it says, practitioners, it is like a lake in a mountain range, transparent, clear and undisturbed. Standing on the shore, a person with eyes could see oysters, shells, stones, pebbles and fish moving about and holding still. That person would think this is a transparent, clear and undisturbed lake. Here there are oysters, shells, stones, pebbles and fish moving about and holding still. Practitioner in the same way, a practitioner understands dukkha as it is. The arising of a dukkha as it is. The seizing of a dukkha as it is. And the way that leads to the seizing of the dukkha as it is. So sitting or standing by the clear mountain lake. We can begin to see things clearly and the truth of dukkha, the Four Noble Truth, the arising and passing of it. And so this is also where we may begin to realize. When the strategies that we use to keep us okay may not be actually okay. The strategies of trying to get something, getting rid of something, achieve something, gaining something, push away something. They don't work, they really don't work. But when we get to this clarity of a being, we begin to be able to see some of these kind of patterns. Can you imagine climbing, hiking this mountain as yet another achievement to have? Or yet another escape from life? I bet you can imagine that property will miss everything along the way. Because what arises comes as we walk. It's not where we get to. It's not another destination to get to. And so when we come with that mentality and the movements of achieving, often it's this sense of something, whatever we have here is not enough. And so when we have that kind of mentality, going around walking this path and doing this hike, you may finish the hike, you may rush down all the way, but maybe you would just say, know what? So what? Just another check mark to leave behind. And so I knew this very well for myself because I know that I used to think that if I had just tried harder, then I'll get ahead and then I'll be okay. But when one thing kind of failed, I try harder next time. There's still another dead end and then I try yet another thing, even harder. After a while, still yet another dead end. So it can keep us trapped into kind of endless cycles. And sometimes our thinking mind can feel like they're pretty smart in coming up with new strategies. You know, let's just try this, try that. I haven't tried this. I haven't tried that. Let's try that one. But what we don't realize when we don't see it carefully, each new endeavor that we engage in is based on the same basic patterns of a wanting and not wanting. And when we don't see this, we're mostly spinning at the surface level. And when we think this is kind of brand new, but it's really the same strategy. So it's really worthwhile to slow down and quiet down to begin to allow these patterns, the rooted patterns to be seen. And so this path, this path is a path of a quieting down and becoming still and clear. And I like to share this few lines in the poem from Mary Oliver, and it's a poem of my work is loving the world. Let me keep my mind on what matters, which is my work, which is mostly standing still and learning to be astonished. So in a way, we're learning to be still and being all with what we see. Whether it's dukkha or sukha, maybe become clear. Wow, this moment of enjoying the sound of the rain, riding the backdrop. So at this juncture of the retreat, we did take some walks, hikes. We got to a point, not necessarily what we think is a destination, but we did calm down. We saw something, maybe some new perspective that we did not know, did not see before. And it touched our heart and mind in various ways. Many of you have shared that in your practice discussions. And some of us may not even be able to articulate just yet how our hearts and minds are touched. And so maybe it's just a sip of a high mountain stream, high mountain water. And let it nourish us, let it nourish our heart and mind. And the art of the retreat for us right now is that now we're at the juncture of returning in some way. Kind of like standing on this mountain range and began to look at the villages that we came from, the towns we came from. And maybe some thoughts come about the life that we left behind for a while. And so it's very natural in some way that often at this juncture of the retreat, the habitual forces might come back. Be aware of this. And notice sometimes the habit forces would like to propel, kind of like run back as quickly as we can, you know, as planned the next thing, next retreat. But this one hasn't finished yet. I've done plenty of that myself, I confess. And maybe some preoccupations about, you know, your way back home and lots of emails to check and news to catch up on. And I didn't learn this until after sitting retreats, my relationship with the emails. You know, it's not until I sat retreats I realized by the time I get back home, I can delete about 90% of my emails without having to read them at all. And most of them got just self resolved without me kind of in the midst of tinkering with it and, you know, I used to think that I had to be in the midst of all of this, you know, fixing this, fixing that. But after retreat, checking email has taught me something. First of all, I don't have to rush into trying to get all of them. And knowing that a lot of them just get resolved on their own. Like I think Kim one day mentioned, you don't have to solve the problem, they dissolve because a lot of this, whatever needs to be fixed or solved, they just got dissolved while I was away. And the other thing that's really cool is discovering that I'm not as important as I thought, which was a big relief. And already kind of freeing, you know. And so we're aware that this would come at this juncture of the retreat. And I see being very patient, kind and gentle with this process. And the analogy of this returning is it's best to return as if we're walking downhill like a stroll, like a little quiet, clear mountain stream flowing down. Not a big rapid, you know, flowing downhill. And we know what happens when the big rapid flooding down, right at the bottom, it begins to spin and spin into eddies. And so let this whatever has been nourishing for you, gently flow flowing, flowing down. And so one recommendation I have is to slow down the process. And maybe catching up when you're rushing and we're feeling propelled, noticing or being aware, oh, this is happening and this is happening. And like that poison oak, and maybe you can put it down for now. Or noticing this is coming, but we don't have to pick it up. And here you have all touched something quiet and deep inside of you. No rush, no rush. And I also wanted to say that this is also an important juncture, maybe a prime place for us to begin to observe and learn what is skillful and unskillful. Yes, there are some aspects of, can begin to have this fist fight, you know, kind of like, you shouldn't be doing this and you must do that. And there can be a lot of, you know, blaming, criticizing coming up as well. And we can't really notice all of this because this is something we will have to learn anyway, whether it's here or outside. I remember for myself, at the beginning of my retreat practice, I'd have a very sharp division or kind of like almost like a mode switch between the retreat and the rest of my life. You know, retreat is one kind of life and the rest is a different thing. And so I would come out of a retreat, often feeling some form of refreshment, even if it's a very difficult retreat because we always touch something inside of us. But then, you know, as soon as I get out of the retreat, I have a lot to catch up. And so I'd get immediately switched into the business as usual kind of mode. And I would feel a sense of jerkiness, like just kind of feeling in me and it didn't feel right and also didn't feel good. It just feels that something was off. But for a while, I ignored the sense of jerkiness that was happening, a sense of offness that was happening. I just kind of pressed on as usual. And then, but at some point I began to pay attention to this phenomenon. I was like, oh, what is this? What is happening here for me? And I noticed that I had a certain kind of idea and a sense that it's the next retreat that's going to do it for me. So I'm just going to be longing for the next retreat to be a month away. And or just kind of having this hidden belief that retreat is where things happen, practice happens and the rest of the things don't count. And that took me some time to really pay attention to begin to see, oh, that was what was operating inside of me. And when we do that, what happens is we're letting kind of this old pattern or old self around the show. But yet, you know, each time as we, whether it's in the retreat practice or in our daily life practice, when we touch something deeper inside of us, they already have an impact on us. They already have an effect on us. We're just not quite aware, are not quite noticing what is happening. And so when we begin to notice this, then one note that the usual way of operating no longer makes sense. It doesn't align. It kind of cause this jerkiness and disharmony between different parts of us. And so this is when we began to invite deeper looking inside of us and allow us to bring certain signs as kind of a harmony together within us. I remember shortly after I give birth to my son, I went to see Gil for practice discussion. And this was a period of my life where there was a lot of spiritual urgency in me, kind of like, you know, kind of fire burning on my hair kind of feeling. But I had just given birth, I have a newborn. And for those who have children, you know what it feels like when you have a newborn, your life feels like upside down all together. I just have so much going on. And so I went to see Gil and asked him and talked to him. At some point I remember he looked at me and he said, oh, I think you're ready for a month long retreat. My heart just sank. What? What? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Um, yet miraculously, and this was a moment of a powerful teaching for me. It's like an ultimatum. I knew that I wasn't going to wait decades and decades. But I also knew that I can't go on a month long retreat anytime soon, maybe decades. And so I said, well, I have to practice where I am. There is no other way. And it has to happen right here. So that was a powerful moment, maybe a powerful moment for shifting my own practice. And so my practice expanded. You know, initially I included rocking the baby, cleaning the house, feeding the baby. And just gradually, little by little, it expanded. And I was so grateful for this ultimatum. And really allowed me to practice in ways that I had never imagined. And my practice deepened and enriched in the ways that I never had imagined either. So over time, this had given me a lot of confidence and opened me up to the bondlessness of the Dharma. And then later on, when the retreat practice became available, I embraced it wholeheartedly as well. But what I also noticed is that the kind of a sharp divides are no longer there. And I realized that there is one Dharma life and we can engage in different forms to practice. A form of taking care of the family, a form of sitting, a form of engaging in various ways that we engage in life. These are just different forms. Each offers many different kinds of gifts to us to practice. And there's no limit. And this was the teachings of the Deepa Ma. I wanted to read you something about this profound householder Dharma teacher and her way of teaching the Dharma and what she was pointing to. Deepa Ma's path wasn't attached to a particular place, teacher, lifestyle, or the monastic model. The world was her monastery. Mothering and teaching were her practice. She embraced the family and meditation as one. Being a heart that steadfastly refused to make divisions in life. She taught me being a wife, being a mother. This were my first teachers, recalls Sharon Crater, a mother who studied with Deepa Ma. She taught me that whatever we do, whether one is a teacher, a wife, a mother, they are all noble, they are all equal. Deepa Ma became not only the patron saint of a householder, as one student called her, but also the embodiment of being the practice rather than doing the practice. For Deepa Ma, that was simply the practice of being present, being fully awake all the time in every situation. She was a living demonstration that the real nature of a mind is presence. Joseph Goldstein said that with Deepa Ma, there was no sense of someone trying to be mindful. There was just mindfulness doing itself. Her mind didn't make distinctions, said meditation teacher Jacqueline Mandel. Meditation, mothering, and practicing all flowed into each other in an effortless way. They were all the same. They were one whole. There were no special places to practice, no special circumstances, no special anything. Everything was Dharma. She urged her students to make every moment count and emphasized bringing mindfulness to cooking, ironing, talking, or any other daily activity. She often said that the whole path of mindfulness is simply awareness of whatever you're doing. Always know what you're doing, she would say. This is the teachings of the Deepa Ma. We may feel that we're returning, but this returning is to here and now. This is the home. I started out on the talk by sharing the story of Pata Chara and the Deepa Ma. Now I want to also end. I spoke about Deepa Ma's teaching, but now I want to end with a poem, awakening poem of a Pata Chara. This awakening poem speaks about her awakening and started with Pata Chara having a moment of frustration about her own practice. It was very human, humbling, but she didn't dwell just in that. Instead, she turned into the simplicity of a being and it's in the simplicity of a being that Dukkha ended. So here is the poem. Plowing fields with plows, sowing seeds in the ground, caring for children and wife, young man gain wealth. Why is it that I, thorough in virtuous conduct, doing the Buddha's instruction, not lazy or proud have not attained release? Having washed my feet, I watch the water, the foot washing water, flow from high ground to low. With this, the mind concentrated like a thoroughbred horse. Taking an oil lamp, I entered my hut. Looking over the bed, I sat down on the bed. Taking a needle, I pulled out the wick. As the flame went out, the mind was freed. When we're here, present and awake, freedom is possible right here. Thank you everyone. Good night everybody..
