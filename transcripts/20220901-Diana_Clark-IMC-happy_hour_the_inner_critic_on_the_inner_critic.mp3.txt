 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome. Welcome to Happy Hour. Again, it's nice to see you all and to be practicing together. And here I am. I'm going to continue on this theme of the intergritic one. Like I said, I'm not exactly sure when this will end, but I am going to be out for a little bit. I'm doing some teaching that requires me to travel. So there'll be some guest teachers coming up. So they probably won't be doing the intercritics. So you'll give it a chance for you guys to do something different. So maybe I'll start with the obvious. There are reasons why we have an intercritic, right? There's reasons for everything. Nothing just happens spontaneously for no reason, right? That doesn't exist. But it might, you know, some of these reasons might have an impact on us in particular. It might be that there was someone in our life that was critical of us and they either criticized us directly, don't do that, you're good for nothing. I don't know. I'm exaggerating. All these terrible things people can say to each other. Or maybe it wasn't ever explicit yelling at us or anything like this. Maybe it was more just like ignoring us or just looking disapprovingly or something like that or feeling like, oh, we just didn't fit in. And so we kind of internalized that as that intercritic. So there's reasons why it happened. We probably can't point to exclusively one, but maybe there is one event or one individual or something that had a really big impact on us. But the point is that it's difficult to stop this intercritic. You know, the origin may be from all these different places, but no matter where the origin is, it's, you know, if it were easy to let go of or to stop, right? We wouldn't be doing this series on loving kindness or this business on the intercritic. So why is it? Why is it so hard or not so straightforward or easy? There's probably a number of reasons and I'd like to just briefly touch on a few of them. One, it's a mental habit, but, you know, it served us at some time in our life and we just kept on doing it. It's remarkable how powerful habits can be, right? I think all of us know this. Just it's really remarkable. We should not underestimate what an impact habits can have. Somehow when we use this word habits, we tend to think like, oh, that's just, we should ignore them, but I wouldn't agree with that. And if you have a meditation habit, I'm sorry. Well, if you have a meditation habit, but you also see how it gets the habit of the mind to wander away, right? And it just takes time to undo that or to work with that. So that's one reason why it might be difficult to diminish, get rid of, abandon, let go of this intercritic. Two is maybe there's this, you know, not straightforward, not in the front of our minds, but in the back of our minds, maybe it's not even in the conscious mind. It might be that we have this sense, there's a little bit of a sense of loyalty to a person or a group that is a little bit or a lot hesitant to reject the views and values of others. Because it can feel disloyal or disrespectful or it'll mean like we're an outsider if we don't have the same views and values of others or something like this. So we shouldn't underestimate how powerful that is to you. It's a connection to other people. If we inherited it or received it from other people or something like this or, or maybe there's even other people who have the inner critic is really active. I know that I've been in social situations where, you know, it's like the small talk is to complain about oneself like oh I can't believe I did this yesterday. Yeah, I know I did that yesterday I didn't do this, you know, so it might be that too, but that there's this connection to others. And this connection might be really strong or it might not be so strong but often that's something that we don't think about when we're thinking, like some of the difficulties about this, what might be difficult to let go of this inner critic. The third reason is that maybe this criticism that we received earlier time in our life. Either was received in the form of a threat, or it was in the setting of the threat to that maybe somebody was really angry. You could for nothing person or, you know, I don't know what people say this but rather, we might have like heard these messages when somebody's angry. So, we're feeling a little bit threatened. So our system gets activated. And some of the things that we hear when our system is activated that affects us differently than if we were just calm and relax we all know this right that if we have to meditating and somebody yells at us, it has a different impact that if we are afraid they're going to hit us, something like this. So, I just wanted to maybe normalize a that there's inner critic. I'm only listed a few reasons why it might be there. There's many more. And be I talked a little bit about why it might be so sticky and difficult to let go of there's other reasons maybe you don't resonate with any of those reasons maybe resonate with all of them. But, you know, maybe the main thing I'd like to say is, let's not let the inner critic get activated that there is an inner critic. Let's not criticize ourselves for having an inner critic, or, or let's not criticize ourselves from that we haven't sold it made it go away or something like that already. We don't need to do that we don't need to add it on. So, I just wanted to normalize this for those people who have it, and also normalize the difficulty or that. That's not so simple to just undo this, it's not like as soon as we see it, we can let it go. Might have been a part of our life for, you know, the majority of our life. It's familiar. So another reason why this is it's feels like, well, this is what my inner life is like. So, again, I'm going to offer some meditation practices in a way that we might. I don't know like in some in some one of these phrases right even have a dialogue with the same critic I've talked about this before the kind of using this fierce compassion. So you're trying to help, but it's not helpful. Or, with some compassion of like, made this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. So to shift our relationship to this inner critic. These are the ones I'm doing the best I can right now. And I'm in the process of learning new ways, and this takes time. And I just want to dismantle this potential or propensity of having the inner critic activated when we see that there's an inner critic. Okay, so with that as an introduction, let's do some meditation in our meditation posture. Let's begin in maybe taking a few deep breaths to connect the body and the sensations of breathing. Letting the breath return to normal. Letting the attention to stress on the sensations of breathing. When the mind wanders, just very simply, gently. Begin again. The sensations of breathing. When we wake up, after having been lost in thought, that's such a great time to bring in some warmth, some kindness, rather than any criticism, just simply begin again. Okay. Okay. And we're just going to move around it, connected, tuning into what does it feel like to breathe, trusting that the body knows how to breathe, or just noticing how it feels. Okay. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Bring into mind someone, some being for whom it's really easy and complicated straightforward to feel warm hearted towards, to have some care, kindness, love, respect, whichever words resonate with you. This loveable being can be in the human form or maybe it's in a furry form. And connecting with this loveable being, noticing if there's any softening or opening warmth as you bring this loveable being to mind. And then to support the connection and our cultivation of loving kindness. We can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This feeling into connecting with any sense of warm heartedness, love, care, kindness towards this loveable being. Thank you. Can we drink up any sense of well being that's associated with this warm hearted connection? It's perfectly fine if you don't feel anything in particular, but if there is, allow yourself to your experience. Thank you. And then to expand our loving kindness to ourselves. Just making maybe this sphere, a little bit bigger. Include ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Thank you. And then to support our working with the inner critic, taking away some of its authority or believability. We can meet difficulties in a different way. Bring to mind a difficulty in your life. A mild, minor one. On a scale of one to 10, it's like a two or a three. And we can say this phrase. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. I'm doing the best I can right now. I'm in the process of learning new ways and this takes time. I'm in the process of learning new ways and this takes time. And if it's helpful, we can speak directly to the inner critic. I know you're trying to help, but it's not helpful. Don't have to use all of those phrases. Maybe there's one that resonates with you. Stick with those phrases that support a sense of openness or ease or well being. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To this idea that we don't need to activate the inner critic about the inner critic. That's right. It's it's amazing. Like what things that we can do to be critical about that. The mind is very. Agile and capable. And it's just amazing. And really loud and persuasive. It might even. Pretend to be trying to help you by telling you got to get rid of that inner critic. You shouldn't have one. So. I just want to highlight, but you know, it's. We have them for reasons and there's reasons why it's not so easy to get rid of them. And so I'd like to. I'd like to shift our relationship to difficulty so that the inner critic doesn't arise. Or if it does arise, it can shift our relationship to that. To the inner critic itself. So now I'd like to. Create opportunity for you guys to talk to one another about some of these ideas. About not activating the inner critic. And also this is kind of normalizing. You know, that it's not so easy. Each time there's a way of being in the world different thinking about ourselves different. This way we all know this is reasons why we don't always eat the best or go to the gym when we shouldn't. And you know all these things, right? It's not so easy to. Change our habits. So. Being groups of three or four. It's helpful to just say one thing and then let it go to the next person and then they say one thing and let it go to the next person and they say one thing. So it's tempting in these kind of settings to like give a long story or some gory details of terrible things that happen to you when you're younger. This isn't the place to do that. This there is this isn't the setting to do that. So instead this is an opportunity to express some of our care by holding the space for others. And just to talk about this idea or experience of the inner critic being activated about the inner critic. And some ways and maybe working with these phrases that have been helpful for you. Something like this. So just say one point let it go to the next person they say one point let it go to the next person they say one point and let it come back around and maybe you have something new to say. Having been influenced by others. It can be a delight to have a new idea like oh I never thought about it. It can be delightful to do those have those experiences. So to level the playing field. Between the introverts and the extroverts. Let's go in the order of the last digit of your phone number. Okay, here we go. Okay, so welcome back. Somebody have a comment or a question or something they'd like to say, how was that to think about this idea of the inner critic on the inner critic. Might there be a way in which we can not let that go. Yes, Aurora. We didn't really talk about that, but just listening to my group. Just really beautiful, really beautiful. And I've just found these breakout groups like so deep and rich and lovely and you know it's like well why is that like why is this topic, like bringing that up so much. I don't know if there's a question but it kind of struck me that this is sort of like where we are very intimate intimate with ourselves somehow in this relationship. And I think at the end of the critic there's some like real like intimacy with the self that feels different. Yeah, yeah. And I would say something that's kind of supports intimacy to is that vulnerability, right to talk about the inner critic requires a vulnerability when people are vulnerable together, then you feel like there's some authenticity and connection and intimacy. Right. Well because you said last time I think that like there's this shame that comes along with it. Yeah. And this like, like it's connected to like what we don't want to be seen as. Exactly. So I feel like if we're showing up and just be like okay here's everything I don't want you to see, then it becomes this very intimate space. Yeah, yeah. I'm happy to hear this. Of course I have no idea what's going on in those breakout rooms so. I mean my experiences has just been very like, oh, like every time I'm like, whoa, like I feel like this real deep heart connection. So, I just want to thank you and thank my group. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. There's some hearts showing up. Those reactions. That makes me happy when I see these, these little hearts it's such a cute thing. Okay, so here we are at the top of the hour. So, well did you have something that you wanted to say, you know, I wanted to add something. Yeah, remember asking for more intimacy or relationship based in intimacy and I never visualized it to be this sharing the humanity with group of other humans that I never met in person, or deeply but, but yeah, recognizing how equal we are in this experience. And, yeah, I do resonate with that of the vulnerability, regardless of what's going through just sharing in a safe, loving and kind environment it's, it's intimate, and I feel like that's a very powerful medicine to soothe the inner critic itself. Beautiful. Thank you for saying that powerful medicine to suit the inner critic. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so let's say we can unmute and we can all say goodbye together. So, bye bye and thank you. Thank you.
