 Thank you. It's always nice to be here. I'm just coming from a byagiri. I just spent a month up at the monastery and it's a lot cooler down here. So I'm really feeling very comfortable this morning, which is nice. I like to go to the monasteries and spend about two or three months a year at them if I can and really soak up the way of life, the way that the Buddhist monks and nuns live to kind of just settle in and live that life with them for a while. I find it to be incredibly helpful in terms of my own practice and certainly in terms of understanding what the Buddha set up and how it affects a certain waking up to difficulty and how we get out of difficulty. If people find that interesting, I'm always happy to stay and talk a little bit afterwards and talk about the monastic life and what it's like to spend time at the monasteries. I suspect a lot of you do as well, but I'm always available to talk about that if you'd like. So what I wanted to talk about this morning is a topic that I've been reflecting a lot on in my own life and my own practice and talking a lot in groups and circles and that's looking at the stages of enlightenment. It can be tricky because one of the monks was telling me, just even a little bit of thinking about the process and where it's going and how to get there and what I have to do and who I have to become in order to be an enlightened being. It can be very deadly because there's a lot of ways that we hold that and that go completely fly in the face of what the Buddha is teaching. The whole process of waking up, the whole practice is designed to get us out of this tendency to lean into later and lean into what might be and what we might become. One has to take great care when looking at this particular teaching, I think, just because of that tendency in our heart, it's still very strong. So the wanting to be, the wanting to become, you can take that and apply it to all kinds of ideals and when you apply it to these high-minded ideals like enlightenment, it can really throw a real wrench in the works, throw the whole thing off. So just to talk about it a bit and see, encourage people to reflect and consider what is our understanding of the process that we're engaged in and how looking at our own practice and seeing if we actually understand what's going on. So the obvious focus, or place to begin, is to look at this first stage where Buddha talked about certain defilements of mind or distortions of view that are uprooted at the beginning, in the beginning of practice. So presumably this is where we all are, this is what we're working on, this is what we're looking at. So there can be great benefit in considering what he's talking about here. So actually, it's the process that unfolds in four stages and ten particular defilements of mind are uprooted throughout the course of these stages. But in this first stage, there are three that are uprooted and these are self-identification view, skeptical doubt and confusion in the mind, and attachment as he called it, attachment to rights, rituals, precepts and practices. This can be a real, you know, just an intense, you hear those, just those defilements put that way, it can feel like, you know, God, this is so, it can feel so heady and intellectual. So I'd just like to unpack it a little bit and try to make it real for us. What are we looking at and what's happening in our lives? And these are uprooted, he said, in a way that what the practice does is he compared it to like a lamp that is fueled by certain energy, an energy source of some kind, say perhaps oil. And what happens is that through understanding that energy source is dried up and so that the lamp goes out. And so you can feel something in that just in that imagery, he's talking about something that is actually a very organic movement of the mind towards, in a way, cleaning up its own act, you know, losing the fuel of ignorance that is keeping us stuck. So all of these fetters are some form of attachment of mind, some form of false view or identification with something that's a little bit off. And the shedding, he said, takes place here's this wonderful image of a snake that at a certain period has to shed its skin, not because there's something wrong with the skin, you know, but because it has outgrown it in a way through a certain kind of growth that for us that the simile would be that the growth in our understanding, the growth in our wisdom moves us to a place where we can shed ways of being. You know, ways of think, ways of mind that don't serve us. And in this image, he said that the snake will often climb up on a rock or a twig or something like that and use the friction against that object to help it remove its skin. You know, I've never seen this take place, but it must be a fascinating process. But he's using this imagery to convey a sense that we don't really do this alone. You know, we're doing it and the Sangha is huge in the process of waking up. We're doing it, helping each other, whether it's in a community like this or in our own homes or in our workplaces, that they're constant bumping up against each other and learning about what's going on in our minds as a result of that is the means. You know, it's happening all the time. You know, I love that imagery. It's not something that's some lofty ideal that we're trying to become. There's a process that's taking place right here and right now. So let's look at these just a little bit each one. It can be very, very helpful. The first one, the self-view, self-identification of the earth. You know, a lot of people, when they hear this teaching of the Buddha, this teaching of a nātā, non-self, you know, you can get these really fearful and contracted reactions, you know, like somehow meditation practice or living the eightfold path is going to annihilate us, you know, and it can be scary. But I think that overcoming self-view and understanding what the Buddha is talking about with this teaching is a lot easier than we make it. And it's actually a lot easier to do than we imagine it to be. And it has to do with understanding and observing in our own lives and in our own, certainly on the meditation cushion, but also throughout the course of the day, just seeing this uncanny and unbelievable tendency of the mind to form views about what is happening and see the effect of that. It's all tied up with his teaching on the khandhas, the five khandhas, and sannyā in particular, the perception khandha. He says like, notice that this is what the apparatus of the mind does. It takes this moment's experience and then it's like it says something about it. You know, it forms a view or it reiterates it. It kind of turns it back and tells itself what's just happened. You know, have you noticed it's like you might have a chill and there's this moment of the chill. You know, that's very real and that's real, very present. But then in the seconds following that, in the less than seconds, milliseconds following that, there's this little movement in the mind that says, oh, I'm cold. I better get a jacket on. It's like the mind is articulating to itself what just happened. And if we don't notice that, it can also go into all kinds of proliferation. I mean, that's a very simple example, but it will proliferate endlessly about what is happening. Right? Just and so it's like noticing that tendency in the mind and that view making tendency is the exact same thing that we're talking about with self-view. The language here I think is fascinating, his choice of words. Self-view, it's a view of self in relation to what really is not self. It's just experience. It's just phenomenon. You know, so like just get just noticing this through the course of our practice and the effect of that. It's like you don't want to make it something wrong or something that you want to stop doing even. You don't even have to stop doing that, but just noticing the effect of that and the effect is that it's actually, it takes us out of experience. And we so like the experience of being awake and present is very direct. It's very real. It's here. But if you've constantly got this persnickety little tendency in the mind that is saying something about here, doing something with here, doing something with the cold, with the hunger, with the irritation or the thing that somebody said, the thing that somebody did, then what you're going to move into is this constant spinning in the mind and thinking and thinking and thinking about experience. And the effect is that that's where we live. So it's like that experience of being ever so slightly removed from life all of the time. It's so annoying. It's like we're constantly just a little bit off to the left or the right of what's happening and not actually in it. So it's like to me, waking up to this tendency and just you just learn not to do it. You just learn not to, it can happen, but you just notice it and you don't give it any energy. You just keep coming back. This is what the training and the meditation is all about. The coming back to the breath, coming back to now. We're actually training the mind to just relax and be alive, be settled in the experience. I think part of why it's so difficult is that in order to do that, you have to butt up, right smack, dab in front of impermanence, suffering and no self. That's where you have to accept life on its terms. This is the way life is. Good things end. There is difficulty. There's pain and just having a body. There's difficulty in losing things that we have that we don't want to lose associating with things that we don't like, not getting what we want. This is all what one has to realize, what one will realize by staying in the present moment and realizing that we just, no matter how much we manipulate and try to control our world in the end, it's happening according to some other rules. It's not being directed by us. We're aware of it and we're in it and we can experience a lot less suffering and difficulty if we just settle into the actual direct experience of it. This is not outside of what you're working on as meditators and practitioners. So if you can see what he's saying, this is one of the first things that one comes to understand and experience and know and realize within oneself. That deepens, doesn't it, over time. You hear the Buddhist teachings, you hear some of this, you go, that's cool. Okay, I think that might be right. Let me have a look. You look over months, years, perhaps lifetimes and we begin to see it. And then over that process of looking at experience, being with experience in this new way, our lives become happier and happier and happier. A lot less stressed. So this is what he's pointing to, noticing this tendency and really endeavoring to see for ourselves that it's happening, how it's happening and the effect of that in the moment. The effect of being caught in it and the effect of not being caught in it. Just noticing that so that we can figure it out for ourselves, so that we can get this, internalize this wisdom, this understanding, this experience for ourselves. It can't be held as an idea, oh I get an atta, I know that, you know, has to be known directly. Yeah, that's a rich one. And it's what we're all engaged in. Now it leads very naturally into a discussion of the second one that's uprooted at this first stage in practice and that's what he referred to as skeptical doubt. And technically the way that this is defined is having a certain lack of faith in Buddha Dhammasanga, in the Buddha, in his teachings and the fact that one can realize truth for oneself. So, you know, basically what he's saying here is that one has to validate our understanding directly. We, in essence, have to do what the Buddha did. You can't take the Buddha's teachings and just study them and intellectualize about them and think that it's going to bring us to any place of realization. It will help. He never said that the intellect was a bad thing. The intellect is a tremendous support, a great help in practice, but in the end things have to be known in a lot more direct way. And that will bring about a knowing and an understanding that is very solid, you know, is very strong because one has internalized the teachings for oneself. So there's a wonderful sutta where he talks about this very famous sutta, you may have studied it already, called the Kalama Sutta. It's a very interesting little community, one of the places where the Buddha would teach. And it was kind of at a crossroads, this town or village, was at a crossroads, a major crossroads in the area where the Buddha lived. And that meant, if you can just imagine, if you're kind of like the hub of a lot of different roadways coming through your community, then you bring travelers from all different areas who will be passing through your area. Well, at this time of the Buddha, those travelers were often the aesthetics and teachers and philosophers of all different kinds of religious and spiritual teachings, you know. So the Kalamas had this embarrassment of riches, you know, where they had all kinds of teachers coming through and teaching them. And the trouble was, though, the downside of that is, what if they all are saying different things? Then the Kalamas were very confused and they didn't know who to believe or what to believe, what teaching to follow, to take to heart. So then here came the Buddha and they went and asked him. And it was particularly, I think they were exploring a question about karma and rebirth, and they had asked a number of different teachers and they had gotten different answers. And so they said, well, what do we do? Who do we believe? And how do we believe? And it's very interesting, the Buddha's response, because he said that, you know, in essence, he said, well, no wonder you're confused, you know. There's a lot out there and not everybody is speaking the truth. And you need to, you haven't understood the way that you come to realizing the truth for yourselves. And so he said, and this is critical, a critical part of the Buddhist teachings. I know that some something that many people I've talked to, talked to say is actually the reason why they love Buddhism so much is that it doesn't require you to believe anything. In fact, he discourages belief. And he says, take the teachings to heart. So this is what he's told them. He said, well, take the teaching, take what they're saying and apply it, practice it. And if it leads to your welfare and the welfare of other people, if it leads to good, if it's blameless, if it's beneficial, if it leads you to a place of freedom and happiness, you can trust it. It's a very interesting response because basically he's turning this whole thing right around, putting it right back in their lap. Because if he knew, if he tells them and tries to convince them that this is the way that it is, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. We all know that. You can see all kinds of people who have certain religious beliefs who proselytize and go around and try to convince everybody else that they're right. And that's really coming from a place of not knowing that they are, if they are. Once you know, then that whole need to convince internally or externally will completely drop away. You just feel that state. It's like, wow. Imagine that the stillness, the sense of comfort and ease that one has, and I suspect that many of you, all of you in this room, you can feel that increasing through the months and years of practice. That sense of, oh man, yeah, Buddha. This is working. This is working for me. I'm getting free. I'm getting happier. I'm kinder. I understand more. So that's exactly what he's pointing us to. He wants us to have that. He wants us to experience that, to know that feeling of overcoming doubt and confusion in the mind, complete and utter confidence in the Buddha, which means the capacity within us to be awake, the awakening within ourselves. Yes, the Buddha, the historical Buddha, you get in the process, you generate a tremendous amount of appreciation for this person. But taking it to heart is a lot more about going to that knowing, that strengthening within this heart, the knowing of truth, the direct experience of truth. So that one is awake. One has internalized completely that knowing. And what we know, the Dhamma, primarily the Four Noble Truths and the insights that we have into impermanent suffering and no self. Over the months and years of practice, don't you? He's right, man. This guy said it. He's right. It really isn't permanent. It really is suffering and it really is no self. That gets deeper and deeper. And then that sense of ranking oneself among the group of people who are awake, you know, awakening up. And you find yourself gravitating towards more and more towards people who will support and uplift and strengthen your own knowing, right? Not towards the situations and the conditions and the people who keep taking us away. You know, I hear this a lot in Buddhist circles, that one of the wonderful fruits of practice has been just an increased certainty about who you want to be with and how you want to spend your time. That kind of thing. Very important. So it all gets strengthened and purified. It said, in one of the suttas, it says, as this kind of knowing increases in each of us, Mara trembles. You just even take that symbolically as your mind states, you know, hatred will start to tremble because it can't sustain itself in the presence of an awake mind. It just can't be there. It can't coexist. So that the more awake that we become, the less that energy of Mara, the less power that it has in our minds. So that's a beautiful one. I mean, so it's watching it, noticing it throughout the months and years of practice, that indeed one is waking up. Indeed, one is becoming more wise. Indeed, one's understanding is growing. And to say that and to know that with utter conviction, this is not, I think we can shy away from this because it feels like conceit. This is not conceit. This is the way of an awakened mind. We have to know. We have to know beyond any doubt. So to trust our knowing is absolutely critical. So this last one is really interesting. Attachment to rights and rituals, precepts and practices. And there's a lot. I mean, we could go, we could have a whole course for a couple of months on this one, I think. But just to try to tease out the main points that I think are worth looking at in our experience. This has to do with like not thinking that one can simply apply techniques or take certain practices at the level of ideas and try to get good at the practices and something's going to happen. Which I think it's very common. I certainly did it for a very long time. And you know, most people I talk to, it can't be otherwise in a way. When we first come to practice, we have ideas about what it all is. And we're trying to make those ideas, trying to get the ideas right, essentially. So what he's pointing to is basic, basically the several kinds of practice that we do. So we talk about Dhanana as a spiritual practice, Sila, Dhanana is generosity, Sila or living well, good moral conduct as a spiritual practice, and the meditation, the meditation as a spiritual practice. So I think that what he's pointing to here is encouraging us and encouraging an examination of how it is that we are holding these in our hearts and in our minds. What's our understanding and how are we living them? How are we actually practicing them? I asked one of the senior monks about this, like what was his take on this particular thing? Because a lot of people think that the Buddha initially maybe just think that he was just taking pot shots at a lot of the Hindu practices at the time, because you could pay some money to a Brahmin and he would light some incense and burn some candles. It's kind of like voodoo kind of thing where you could get a loved one into the heaven realms or you could divine a winning lottery number or something like this, you know, that there are certain rituals that one can do and that they will affect a certain liberation or have a certain effect. And perhaps he is, because he was trying to get away from this, but my teacher said it's a lot more subtle than that, what he's trying to get at. That really, when you look at our minds and look at the way that we are, that the highly conditioned tendency, the human default, if you will, is to go into automatic pilot, you know, on anything. It's like you take a little bit of something, a little bit of knowledge and then just start living it. And then if it doesn't work, then you can blame the teacher or you can blame Buddhism or you can blame something else because it's like, you know, it's their fault. But really what's actually happening is that we haven't put any effort into it. We haven't really endeavored to take the teaching to heart for ourselves. But it's easier this way because you can live life a lot more superficially, you know. So I think what he's getting at here is to don't settle for superficial understanding of Dana and Sila and Bhavana, but actually work in our practice to take to heart what's going on here. So like say, for example, with Dana, the practice of Dana, you know, we, let's say in Asian countries, they've taken this in a way that says that, they're taking to heart some of the Buddhist teachings where he says that if you give, if you give to support Dhamma centers, temples, the Buddhist monks and nuns and what have you, then that will result in a happy rebirth. You know, that's right there in the suttas. And so people have taken that literally and then they get all focused on giving and giving and giving and supporting. But it's all done within the context of this teaching on merit, where one is making merit so that one will have a happy rebirth. So, you know, and it's not that that isn't true. And it's not that that's, you know, he said this, that that is a fruit. But if you can see the subtlety here, it's like doing it for that purpose distorts it. It's actually completely self-absorbed, which is the opposite of what the practice of Dana is trying to get us to. It's trying to get us to, it's the main antidote we have for self-absorption. Give, give, give, give, not accumulate, get, acquire, you know, all the energy is moving out towards the welfare and concern of other people. So, and maybe that doesn't speak so much to us as Westerners, because we don't particularly hold the practice of generosity in that way. But I think we have our own distortions. You know, we look at our culture and how we hold it. And we have a culture that's really, there's a lot of giving in the culture, but it's all a lot of it is within the context of say, volunteerism and giving to nonprofits and tax deductions and all this kind of thing where it's like it's a, or giving because one of the things the Buddha said that is a distortion of giving is giving because it's a good idea, you know, giving out of a notion. You know, other distortions are like giving to get, you know, giving because it's my turn, you gave last time, so I give this time, you know, that kind of thing. But really trying to point us to the whole purpose of generosity is to purify this heart. It's a purification process. It's like, and so really practicing generosity is about noticing what's going on in the heart, in the giving, and the not giving. And seeing for oneself what it feels like and noticing because man, there is nothing like generosity to give you chill bumps all over your body and to make you really happy. It's like, you know, that experience of being free of the need to hold on. And instead, that realizing that the tremendous happiness of offering, it's almost like it's innate. It's part of our nature, our true nature. And it's like finally we're getting in sync with it, that, whoa, that my, the movement in my heart towards your welfare, concern, and action towards your welfare. That's optimal human beingness. That's what is moving us towards with this. So really reflecting on this, noticing what's going on in our hearts in this experience. And it's okay in the not giving, just noticing that. So it's not like, it's not like if you hold as an idea, you should give. Then when you don't, when we're not being generous, then it's a setup. It's just going to turn around and start beating up on ourselves. And it has to be held neutrally. It doesn't matter, give or don't give. That doesn't matter. Find out what the experience is and see for ourselves. See how all this is taking us to see for ourselves. What is he saying here? What's Donna all about? Same with Sila. What's that all about? Living well, you know, practicing the precepts. We can get caught up in trying to get the rule right. You know, trying to hold one should be this way. You know, one should behave in this way. You see, it's not that there isn't a realization that it is good to behave well. But when it's being held in this way, we're missing the potential of practicing Sila, which is to notice and discover for ourselves the law of karma. Actions have consequences. Unskillful actions bring unskillful results, unhappy results. Skillful actions bring happy results. And if we can feel that for ourselves, then it's like the whole system starts to move in the directions. Like you, you know, the whole system wants the path of least resistance. You know, you find out that it feels much better to live harmlessly, kindly, with generosity, holding each other with respect, you know, treating not treating each other like objects, speaking well. When we find that out for ourselves, then you just start to move out of the patterns that are in the opposite direction. Can you feel it? So it's really very powerful when you take it to heart, taking Sila to heart. And then the same is true with the meditation practice. You know, we can hold the idea of mindfulness, hold the idea of being concentrated, and then try to become that. Versus right here, right now, what is the experience of being present and aware? Can I become more and more familiar with the direct experience of that and endeavor to live that from moment to moment in my life? That's what it's about. It's not about getting the right technique, getting concentrated genres and, you know, making myself be mindful. One should be concentrated and mindful. It's about feeling it, knowing the experience of this for ourselves, and putting in the proper perspective what the formal practice is versus what we might call the informal or the rest of life. So it's about a 24-7 kind of thing. It's about presence of mind and wakefulness all of the time. And the formal practice held in the proper perspective is seen then as a tool. That's not meditation. That's not the meditation. It's a tool. It's a means. It's a formal applying oneself to this effort to be relaxed and aware. But if we don't understand that, then you get all kinds of fixated on retreats and sitting on the cushion. As all of that, that's the practice. And one keeps trying to do more of that because that's the practice. But that's only the mechanism. That's only a structure for the practice, which is all the time. It's like if you want to learn how to play the piano, you set some time aside and you work a little bit more deliberately on it. But that's not what it's for. It's so you can play the symphony. It's so you can live the life. So just really getting it. So I think all of the months and years of our practice, certainly if you reflect back on when you first came to the practice right up till now, this is what has been going on. This is what it's about. Coming to understand and break through these first three defilements of mind so that we can be happy. Ajahn Ammar always says that Buddha gets a bad rap, you know, that he's the ultimate pleasure seeker. He's trying to make us happy. And this is how it's done. So I'll offer these thoughts for your reflection this morning and certainly happy to field some questions if you'd like to take a few minutes and certainly happy to stay back if you'd rather ask something more privately. Do you have some thoughts or questions? Where are the 10 reflections? Oh, Dasudamas. Let's see. You can get them online. They are the suttas. But if you go to Abhayagiri website, they're in the chanting book. 10 subjects for frequent recollection. Well, thank you. Thank you for your presence and attention. And as I said, I'm very happy to stick around and talk to them if you like. My favorite thing to do. Take care. See you tomorrow night.
