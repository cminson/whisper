 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So it's very common for people to ask how they can let go of something troublesome or unwholesome that they have noticed. How can I let go of anger? How can I let go of obsessive thinking? And sometimes people seem to think that the teacher is going to just tell them, you know, turn the red knob a couple of times counterclockwise and that should do it. But as we think, as we know from doing this practice, it's not quite like that. Not only is there no exact formula, but having someone tell you is actually less effective than discovering it for yourself. But the practices we're engaged in do lead to letting go. We might, in fact, we might distinguish between the practices that lead to letting go and the letting go itself. So it's more like our job is to do those practices without to the degree we can manage it without so much expectation or attachment to results. And then the letting go will take care of itself. And we also have to be a little bit careful about the language. So letting go is not the same as getting rid of. You know, our practice does lead to the ending or, yes, getting rid of Dukkha suffering or stress or struggle or discontent. But letting go is not quite the same. In order to end Dukkha, we might need to let go of a lot of things along the way. And it's not only what we let go of, but what we let go into. New things tend to open when we let go of something. And this week we'll be talking about various actions we can do that lead to letting go. And so the series is called The Art of Letting Go. The Buddha said that certain things are to be let go in certain ways. So imagine that you're trying to get a container open. And this is the aim, but you're going to have to do something for that to come about. If it's a glass jar, then it's to be opened by twisting the cap. If it's an aluminum can, twisting won't help, but you can use a can opener. And if the container is made of fabric sewn together like a pillow, then cutting it will work or unzipping it if it has a zipper. But you can't use a can opener on a pillow. So this is an analogy for the way that certain unwholesome qualities of mind can be best released by certain methods or certain instances of experiences can be let go of or the attachment to them can let go, let be let go by certain methods. So in one teaching the Buddha talked about seven ways to let go, seven methods to open the mind and heart and release various kinds of dukkha. So we only have five days so we'll talk about one or two of these seven per day. And today, we're starting with what's called abandoning by seeing. So the discourse actually uses the word abandon, and sometimes that has a negative connotation for people because it's not usually a positive word in English. So we'll mostly say letting go, but this word, it's nice to know that this word abandon is positive in Buddhist teaching it means I'm releasing the stickiness or the attachment around something and when you abandon that, then you feel freer and lighter. And you can move more easily in sense. So letting go by seeing has to do with the directing of our attention. There are some ways that we suffer that can be eased by changing how we attend. In some sense, actually the basis of Dharma practice is our ability to at least to some degree, direct our attention. If you couldn't do that you couldn't practice. So for example, you know right now you can just try directing attention to your right hand. Now direct attention to your left ear. I think that's pretty effortless usually it's and somewhat possible to do deliberately. On the other hand, when I started speaking again, your attention naturally went to my voice, probably. And you also know that if some part of the body is painful. It can capture our attention non volitionally. So we don't have complete control, but we have some ability to direct the attention and using that ability in a way that helps our spiritual practice has partly to do with what we pay attention to, and partly to do with how we pay attention. So it's not actually that there are specific things that we should and should not attend to like a list I could give you of do's and don'ts. Instead, the teachings are a little more subtle and they say that we should wisely attend to things such that wholesome states increase and unwholesome states decrease. And similarly, we should not attend to things such that unwholesome states increase and wholesome states decrease. Right. So, unwholesome would mean that there's an increase in greed hatred and delusion or various emotions and mind states that are associated with those. And wholesome is about the opposite mind states that are about non greed non non hatred non delusion so things like generosity love compassion wisdom patience integrity. And if we're mindful, we can notice which of those sets is increasing or decreasing. So, sometimes, there are things that we just shouldn't put our attention on, because we're at this moment at least we're not able to find a way to be with them without our mind going off track. Maybe every time you read an article about a certain topic you become angry, and then all you do is sit there and do with the computer screen, or you start complaining to your partner across the room which probably affects their state of peace. So maybe it's better for you not to read articles like that, you know, just don't put your attention there. A more extreme case maybe would be someone who's in recovery from alcohol addiction, and such a person probably should not go into a bar. It's better just not to go there. And if you're in a world, there are many forces out there that are trying to capture your attention. It's not at all trivial to be actively concerned about where your attention is going. There's a whole science behind getting you to look at things on an internet page for example, and getting you to click on things. We need to know about, about this in our own mind. And it's not something exactly that someone else can tell you precisely or abstractly you know here's a list of what not to direct your attention to or what to direct your attention to, because it might be particular to your mix of conditions. So far more important is to develop that discernment about whether wholesome or unwholesome is increasing as we pay attention to something. And of course things are going to shift as we practice mindfulness and get more aware of our own tendencies. It's not like we're going to have a don't go there list forever. Eventually we would want to find a way to be with anything such that our mind doesn't tend toward unwholesome states and may even increase the wholesome. And the teaching, the teachings that we have suggest a lot of ways that we can be with things in a skillful way. And in the interest of time I won't go into lots and lots of those that's the, that's the whole of Dharma practice but we could just name one to be concrete, which is that we might bring in the wisdom of understanding impermanence. So whatever we're being with with attention we can remember also, this is temporary. And in that case then the mind might not be so reactive it might not allow the unwholesome states to increase. And we might not grasp but something pleasant quite so vigorously. If we remember that it too will decay and break. Or similarly, maybe something painful can be endured more easily without sliding into grumbling or self pity, or me. If we remember that it won't last. Or we could use the understanding that all people have difficulties. Pain or difficulty is actually something that unites us all as humans. And so, compassion might come forth so there's a way even that wholesome states can increase. And as we're being something difficult. So one thing that this practice of abandoning by seeing encourages I think is simplifying our relationship to experience. If we launch into a long story about what we're paying attention to, and especially a story about me or about what other people should be doing, why they should be not doing something, then we're very likely allowing on wholesome states to increase all that mental proliferation, especially when we have thoughts about ourself. Right. So suppose, you know, suppose we hear a sound outside. We hear a sound and we hear it. But then we recognize it as our neighbors leaf blower. And we remember a conversation that we had with them just last week where we pointed out that it's disturbing when they use the leaf blower before 8am. And here it is it's only 742am. And they should not be doing that. Don't they know that I'm meditating. Is there clock set wrong. I'm going to go tell them how terrible this is. Or whatever the mind is doing. And maybe you know maybe it will make sense to go say something to them later I don't know. But for sure in this moment. There's Dukkah being generated in our own mind. And can we recognize that. And, you know, maybe hear the sound in a different way. But in contrast, you know, when we see something in a way that increases wholesome states it doesn't tend to spiral into a story about me. You know, we might be taking a walk and simply enjoying the scenery or silently wishing well to the people and animals that we see or practicing with noticing the four elements, you know, whatever it is that we're doing on our walk but this way of being. It's kind of simple and in the present moment doesn't tend to generate those stories and anxieties about me. So abandoning by seeing means discernment about where a situation or experience is going. Is it going toward or away from suffering. And if we seem to be going toward more suffering, then could we shift how we're attending to that experience. And I would say that if we're very diligent and conscientious about paying attention to things, such that the mind avoids an unwholesome relationship and encourages a wholesome relationship. What will be let go is pretty amazing. If we do that we will let go of self centeredness. So that's worth doing. So, we're talking remember about the practices that lead to letting go and seeing in a skillful way is one thing that leads to letting go. So letting go is an art form. We don't, we don't exactly do the letting go part, per se, usually, but we do have to be actively involved in practicing if we want letting go to happen. It's kind of like the way you can't really set out to make a great painting. Instead you practice a lot and you just keep doing it. And then eventually something great might happen. So with Dharma practice, maybe the heart will open. Maybe the mind will be freed. Just keep seeing in a skillful way and something will happen. So we're going to unfold all of this more in the coming days this was kind of a general overview with a method that's always useful it will be relevant in all the other methods and then we'll, we'll talk in the coming days about some more specific situations. So take care.
