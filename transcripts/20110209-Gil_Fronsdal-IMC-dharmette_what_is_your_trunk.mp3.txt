Dharmette : What is Your Trunk ?

Good morning ev eryone. The word ‘trunk ’ has 
interesting multiple meanings. We talk someti mes about 
the trunk of a person  meaning the torso , but there is 
also the trunk of a tree. The trunk  of a tree , especially a 
big tree , is the solid, strong base that holds all the 
branches. To be rooted, resting or centered in one’s 
own trunk , is a very interesting idea. If you use  the 
metaphor of a big tree where the branches branch out 
from the trunk , first you have two or three  big branches , 
and then they branch further and further. The further out 
you go, the more the branches divide out and become 
thinner , until they get so thin that they wouldn’t even 
hold up a squirrel , let alone you.  
 
The further out you go, the closer you get to the leaves, 
and the more easily those small branches and leaves 
get pushed around by the wind, rain , or anything that 
comes a long. They move back and forth. The leaves  in 
a deciduous tree w ill eventually fall off anyway, and 
small branches  will also break  off easily. But the trunk of 
this big solid tree doesn’t move. No matter how strong 
the wind is , the trunk stays solid. If someone bumps up 
against the trunk, the trunk is not going to break. But if someone bumps up against some of the thin branches , 
they break  off. If you find a squirrel bouncing around on 
the outer -most branches, the branches dip and move 
under  the weight of t he squirrel. The squirrel is always 
going, bouncing and bouncing along. It’s not going to 
find any real place to rest on these outer branches. But 
the closer to the trunk the squirrel comes , the more 
stability and strength it has.  
 
Some  of us are living o ur lives way out on the edge of 
the branches , and so  much so that we don’t even know 
we have a trunk. Part of the task of practice is to find 
ourselves in our trunk – to find out where  the place , 
values, emotions, and sense of being -ness feel the 
most stable, rooted , or “at the heart.”  That place is 
where there’s confidence and strength , rather than 
where  we’re responding and reacting to the world 
around us – and  negotiating, managing, fixing, 
defending,  or building up . To be on the branches is to 
be responding and reacting. For people  on the 
branches , practice can be v ery important, but it 
exhausts them because they are alway s reacting, 
responding, and trying to be mindful, compassionate , 
and not pulled this way and that.  
 
Practice  is good anywhere , but if you’re on the edge of 
the branches , you’re going to tire yourself out pretty 
quickly.  If you’re in your trunk , you’re not going  to be so 
reactive and pushed around by all the things around you. You’re not going to be influenced by things as 
much. There is less that you have to respond to 
because you haven’t reacted.  
 
I think one of the possible tasks of any practitioner is t o 
discover what their trunk is – what’s the place inside 
where they feel some sense of strength , confidence , or 
foundation  – a place of refu ge or rest, where they’re not 
so easily swayed or moved by the things around them. 
They’re not at a place where they’re looking for approval 
from other people . In your trunk, it doesn’t matter if 
someone disapproves of you. The trunk has been there 
for a long time. The weather comes and goes , and it’ s 
okay for the trunk. However , when the w eather comes 
and goes for the branches , it’s a big deal. In a big 
snowstorm, the branches break. If you live on the 
branches , and you measure your life by th e most 
superficial qualities , your life becomes quite fragile.  
 
What  do you think is the difference between you living 
on the branches and you living in your trunk? Do you 
have an understanding of what that difference is? For 
each person it’s different. I don’t want to say there’s one 
trunk tha t everyone is supposed to find – the same 
trunk. But what is your trunk? Where is your base, your 
foundation? Where are you when you’re on the 
branches? Where are you when you’re way out on the 
branches a nd very fragile, easily tripp ed up , or caught 
up, and always having to react, respond , and move?   
One of the ways of finding the answers to some of these 
questions is to do something like meditation. In 
meditation , we and sit upright, let go in a deep way , and 
find a deep  rest in the physical trunk – the body . In the 
wonderful statue of the Buddha in meditation, t here is a 
very confident, strong trunk. This is not some kind of 
wimp. We don’t know at all what the Buddha looked like , 
but the ideal is that the  trunk is something solid. So 
what would it take for you in meditation to assume  a 
physical posture that expresses confidence, rootedness, 
and presence, and then let go of the things that p ull you 
off this way and that?  Let go of the superficial mind 
that’s caught up in things , and find yourself rooted here 
in the present moment. With that as a reference point, 
look at your life, and how you live it, the concerns you 
have , and see if you can identity what it is to be in  the 
branches  or way out in the l eaves , and what is it t o be in 
your trunk  right here.  
 
I want to challenge you further in this kind of 
investigation. In the whole issue of identity  – figuring out 
who you are in terms of identity , how you’re going to 
represent yourself, how you’re going t o define yourself  – 
more likely than n ot, it is out there in the branches. 
You’re not going to find your trunk by assuming or 
taking on  an id entity , or saying , “That’s who I really am.”  
 So the question  is, “What is your trunk ?” And over  the 
next months some of you might want to come back here 
and tell me what you think it is. I would love to hear. So 
those are my thoughts.
