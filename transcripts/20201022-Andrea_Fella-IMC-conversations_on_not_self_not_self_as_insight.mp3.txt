reflect on this evening is what occurred to me is we've been talking a lot about understanding the teaching, you know, bringing in the kind of a shift of perspective. 
What does it actually mean this teaching of not-self and turning the mind towards understanding a very different perspective than we're used to navigating in our usual lives? And what I'd say actually is what occurred to me to bring in tonight is that, you know, not-self isn't some kind of practice that we do to try to get rid of something. 
You know, not-self is not something that we, it's not a practice, we don't practice not-self to stop some process. 
There isn't, the instructions actually in terms of observing our experience are to kind of more help us to understand or to recognize that what's already happening, it's already not-self. 
There's nothing any different except a belief of you that, you know, so what it really is is a shift of understanding around what we typically believe, we typically believe self to be. 
And so really we could say that the teaching of not-self helps us to understand and have the insight into this perspective on experience, that what we typically think of as I, as me, as mine, is a kind of an illusion, a misunderstanding, a misattribution of the experience that's unfolding, just the kind of the tumbling on of experience, a misattribution of something in that process that is stable, reliable, you know, something that's kind of steady there. 
And there isn't anything steady in our experience. 
It's all just this changing flow of unfolding conditions, processes that work. 
We've talked about various analogies of that, the analogy of the river, for instance, the rainbow is actually the one I like the most in a way. 
I think in the first week I did tell this story, but I'll just remind you of this. 
I was on a retreat and I was on the coast of Oregon, wandering the coast, and it was a particularly high waves that day. 
There had been a storm, but the sun had come out, and so there was a lot of really big mist sprays coming up. 
And at certain points on the path along the coast, I could stop and stand there and just watch while the spray of mist came up and a rainbow appeared in the mist. 
And it was enough that it would happen, like I could stand in the same spot and sometimes I would watch the mist kind of float through and see if the rainbow was appearing here. 
It'd be like the mist would float through and then the rainbow would appear when the mist floated through and then it would disappear and then another bit of the mist would float through and the rainbow would appear. 
It looked like the rainbow was sitting there just like in the curtains were being parted in a way. 
It was appearing in exactly the same place as long as I was standing in the same place. 
It was appearing in the same place. 
It looked like a thing that was being revealed in a way as the mist would come up and then it would fall away and then there would be no rainbow. 
But that we know, it's not that the rainbow is sitting there in the sky. 
It's not. 
It's not there. 
It needs the various conditions. 
It needs the observer, it needs the sun, and it needs the water in the atmosphere. 
Any one of those three conditions not there, the rainbow won't be seen. 
And so that analogy, I mean what we tend to do is to attribute, that's very much what the sense of self is. 
It's this congealing of conditions that is then attached, given a name, that's me. 
And often I think sometimes we have various patterns or habits that result in familiar contractions, familiar senses of experience. 
Like, yep, that's me. 
I felt that before. 
And so we tend to like the rainbow. 
It's like, well, it's there. 
We think it's there. 
And it's just, you know, it's like, it's kind of feel like that pattern or habit is waiting somewhere, that it's always there. 
Not that it's being created in the moment, like the rainbow is being created in the moment. 
And so this, these teachings, the teachings, a lot of the teachings around not self are helping us to understand this perspective, that what we think of as self is not self. 
It is just this tumbling on of causes and conditions, of patterns of habits. 
And so the instructions for practicing, there are instructions for practicing around this topic of not self. 
But they're mostly, they're not directly aimed. 
Usually there's there's a few that are kind of more directly aimed at helping us to understand this teaching. 
But many of them are much more just like be with your experience. 
Notice the impermanent nature of experience. 
That's a key, a key teaching he gave to his own son. 
He said cultivate the perception of impermanence. 
When you cultivate the perception of impermanence, the conceit I am will be abandoned. 
So he talks about the understanding of not self as being an insight, rather than something we look for. 
He points to observing our experience directly. 
And that as we observe our experience directly, we begin to recognize that there isn't a self there. 
That I mean that there isn't what we think of as self isn't there. 
So those just wanted to review a little bit the kinds of teachings that support us in beginning to have this understanding for ourselves. 
The first the first thing that we talked about in the last weeks was studying what we think of as self. 
Studying what feels like is I me mine. 
When it feels and that that's often you know when there's a strong sense of I am often a sense maybe of self righteousness or doing things well or doing things poorly or you know just some strong congealing of this is me. 
That's a great time to be curious about well what is it you know what actually is it that I'm experiencing here. 
Does it last? What is what is the actual experience that I am calling I or me or mine and what happens there often when we start to look at that is it's kind of hard to pin down exactly what we think of as me as I as who I am. 
It's really hard to pin it down and that's not a mistake because we can't pin it down. 
So that's one area of exploration is this kind of curiosity about what we call I me mine. 
The teaching of dependent origination which I haven't talked about in depth in this class and this may be something that we come back to when I come back from my retreat. 
The teaching of dependent origination is a teaching that describes how suffering is created in our habitual mind. 
It's a set of processes conditioned processes that we tend to when something is pleasant we like it we want it we want to hold on to it we create a sense of self around it this is that this is described in the Buddhist teaching in this teaching of dependent origination. 
It's a 12-step series series of conditions and kind of patterns that tend to arise when our mind is caught by views and beliefs caught by greed aversion delusion and it is a description of how suffering comes to be. 
It's a description of often what we get to look at when we turn our attention to our experience and so instead of you know when we think of oh this is me you know start to look at it when we have a strong sense of I or me when we start to look at that what we might begin to see is this process of dependent origination unfolding. 
There's something pleasant that we are holding on to or something unpleasant we're pushing away something we're clinging to views and ideas that I have to hold on to it views and beliefs all of this is is how you know dependent origination describes this process of suffering coming to be. 
This process of dependent origination also it equally describes how a sense of self arises where the you know the place in the chain of dependent origination there's a term bhava which means becoming and that's really kind of the congealing of views and beliefs that kind of orient around the clinging to to keep it to hold it. 
We could say it's the set of views and beliefs that arise in in service of the clinging and those include usually a sense of self and so this teaching on dependent origination which is a description of how suffering comes to be is also a description of how the sense of self comes to be and how we tend to get caught in believing it as something solid or real. 
So this this is actually the teaching of dependent origination gives us a sense of what is available to be observed in experience when there is suffering happening when there's a sense of self happening and so this is this is really how do we study a sense of self when we're studying a sense of self we're studying this chain of dependent origination we're studying this process of of conditions unfolding and another piece that feels useful to me because the single process the single teaching of dependent origination both describes how suffering comes to be and how the sense of self comes to be the kind of the attachment of the belief in the sense of self. 
Sometimes when we're observing our experience the sense of self is clear it's obvious it's you know that that sense of I need this or I'm right you know that I'm right when is is the big one for me you know that's a real sense of the I am comes in there but sometimes what's more obvious is the suffering sometimes what's more obvious is the pain of some kind of constriction and it may may not be so useful when that's what's most obvious to try to stop and think well where's the sense of self in that you know if what's if what's obvious is the suffering if you're observing that and exploring that with mindfulness you're looking at the same process maybe just a different part of the cycle maybe you're looking more at the constriction that the clinging the the the craving in the clinging part of it or the suffering part of the cycle so if in terms of exploring the teaching in terms of exploring how to see into or to have that shift of mind that understanding of not self it's not necessary to be looking for where's the sense of self in that if you're observing suffering if you're observing and curious about how is this suffering working what's you know what's being what's the tightness there what's what's being clung to you are observing the same process at work so you don't have to kind of come at it from the sense of self the the teaching of dependent origination allows us to look at any part of that cycle there's a there's a beautiful teaching that says we can look at any part of that cycle look at any part of that cycle and understand it thoroughly maybe just the craving part just that part that goes from feeling to craving we see that the cravings being springing into being from a feeling tone and really understand how that comes to be and how that might fall apart the Buddha says that that or the teachings say that that is a place where freedom can happen so we don't have to follow it through and then see where does the sense of self arise independence on that craving so studying the sense of self could also be we could think of you know we could study the sense of self we could study we could study what it feels like when there's a strong sense of self but if what's happening is there's a strong sense of suffering equally that is a valid exploration you're studying the same the same process a little bit more directly using the teaching of not self the Buddha encourages us to reflect from time to time bringing in the reflection using thoughts in the mind essentially this is not me this is not mine this is not who I am or even just this is not self and this one one teaching which which takes the six sense spaces and says that the eye is not self and sights are not self and the the the teaching says this is how you cultivate the perception of not self by by reflecting the eye is not self sights are not self the the the sounds are not the ear is not self sounds are not self the tongue is not self tastes are not self thoughts are not self the mind is not self but that's using that's using reflection it's kind of like bringing that perspective that that does require some of this understanding that we've been exploring in the last few months what it actually what actually the teaching of not self means to drop that in as a reflection there needs to be some understanding of what the teaching means and again it's not that there's nothing there is that there's it's it's not what we think it is so there's that that use of reflection it's like bringing in wisdom bringing in the perspective of wisdom now there's some other perspectives that I find useful sometimes I'll use this is not me this is not this is not mine this is not who I am this is not myself sometimes I'll use that occasionally I'll use that but more the the understanding of the conditioned nature of experience is very close to the understanding of not self and so for me recollecting this is just conditions unfolding that often feels like at least for me has a much more direct kind of shaking or waking the mind up to what's actually happening not self feels a little more like a concept to me this is conditioned for me has a little bit more of a direct sense a direct understanding and another way to phrase that Saita Utejnaya uses the phrase this is nature and to me that that really speaks to me it's like you know what's nature nature is just conditions unfolding and growing and you know a tree grows from you know an acorn in the ground if that acorn is in soil that's got nourishment and then it gets moisture and then it gets sun that acorn is going to germinate and split open and then it's going to send up a shoot and it's it's a process it doesn't become an oak tree immediately but there's this process that happens because of conditions and that's all expressed in this phrase this is nature to me at least it it kind of like really resonates and so those are also reflections that that can be useful and I find those kinds of reflections useful if I'm a little bit stuck to something you know if there's a little bit of stickiness there or you know the mind can't quite have balance around something I might just remind myself right this is of course you know this is nature of course the of course the of course is also a another one that that I use a lot and of course is also you know connected to conditioning this is happening of course of you know out of the nature of the unfolding conditions so the you know of course this is happening that often for me will give a little bit of space to be able to be with something that maybe there was some stickiness around and so these these these reflections can support helping the mind to kind of I was just thinking it's like I just this image just came to me it's like a tree that grows in granite you know at the tree that's got it's it's it's got you know it's roots in a crack in the granite you know that tree is going to break the granite apart the power of the growing of that root is going to fracture that solid granite and it's kind of like that that these reflections are kind of like those roots growing in that granite and kind of cracking apart that belief for that view of this is me so these reflections can help the mind to recognize things recognize experience in a slightly different way and then the last piece I'll bring in oh goodness I wanted to have some time for questions but we'll see the last piece I'll just bring this in briefly there's a teaching I'm sure most of you if not all of you have heard the teaching from the Buddhist teaching to Bihiyah a very famous teaching the Buddha basically says to be here Bihiyah comes to the Buddha and says teach me the Dharma in brief and the Buddha says this is how you should train yourself in the scene is only the scene in the herd is only the herd in the sensed is only the sensed in the cognized is only the cognized that's how you should train yourself so he says this is this is the basic work of practice we train ourselves to explore meeting experience in this way of just like bare meeting that's not easy it's not easy to do that you know in the scene is only the scene when when we see something there's almost always views and ideas and beliefs and opinions that are there with that seeing there's perceptions that happen with it and so you know we don't usually just have the scene it's conflated with all the views and ideas and beliefs and perceptions around it now those views and ideas and beliefs and perceptions aren't necessarily we don't necessarily have to get rid of them but what we have to understand those as as cognized experience happening so in the cognized is only the cognized so yes they're seeing happening and there's the perception that that's a wall and there's the view that view is arising around boring wall whatever you know so you know so there's that those are are arising in the mind and so the Buddha just pointed to be here know your experience in the moment just the direct experience notice where the thoughts are arising where the perceptions are arising notice the sight the sound the smell the taste the touch so in the scene is only the scene the herd is only the herd the sensed connects to smelled taste touch those three so it really is covering all the sense bases and then in the cognized is only the cognized so things are rising in the mind are just things are rising in the mind they can be known as things are rising in the mind a thought arising in the mind can be known as a thought arising in the mind we don't have to get rid of the thought but we need to recognize it as a thought arising in the mind and so this is the teaching and this you know we could talk for a whole retreat on this on this subject and I have but but the next piece of that teaching so this is basically you know bare experience no experience just in this simple way the follow-on in that teaching is when for you in the scene is only the scene and the herd is only the herd in the sense is only the sense in the cognized is only the cognized then there is no you in terms of that when there is no you in terms of that there is no you there when there is no you there you aren't either neither here nor yonder nor between the two. 
This just this is the end of suffering. 
And so to me, this the second part is pointing to the understanding and the insight that happens. 
So we the training is to just meet experience. 
The understanding there is no you in terms of that. 
Isn't something we try to find. 
It is an insight and understanding that arises through the meeting of experience in this direct way. 
So really this is the piece I really wanted to speak to tonight that the teaching of not self is more of a pointing to an insight. 
And it's not something we can look for almost by its definition. 
And the other one I mentioned really early on is that the Buddha mentioned is like, yeah, notice impermanence, cultivate the perception of impermanence, then the the conceit I am will be abandoned. 
So again, you know, the the it's not like cultivate not self. 
It's notice that things are impermanent with knowing that things are impermanent. 
But it doesn't hold water that there is something that we take to be I or me.
