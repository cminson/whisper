 For the last three months, I think since the end of August, I've been going through the Satipatthana Sutta, the discourse the Buddha gave, that is the source for the mindfulness meditation that we do here. And it's taken us three months to get through it. And last week basically was the last talk in that series. And it was very nice, very sweet for me. A lot of people that I know, a lot of people from Marsanga here, connected directly, occasionally here, went off and sat the three month retreat at IMS. Some went for the whole three months and some went for six weeks. And I guess it ended Thursday or Friday? Friday. And they're already showing up. They just can't get enough. And it's very sweet to have, I think about 80 people who sit at a retreat, is that right? 95. 95. Well, I was counting how many people I knew. And I figured it was about 10% of the group comes from our wider Bay Area community that either our community knows well because they sit with us or they have sat with us or I know them. So I feel as way of these people who've been, you know, coming, sitting for six weeks, 12 weeks, coming back. And it's really lovely to know people have done that. And then I was inspired the fact that while they were sitting off there in silence for in the woods of Massachusetts, I was talking about the Satipatanasuta week after week. And I thought that was kind of lovely. So, so now when I talked about the Satipatanasuta all these weeks, mostly I just talked. I don't think I gave much opportunities for questions. And it did occur to me that some of you might have had questions about what I was saying during these last three months. And I got a I got a letter from someone some months ago, you know, some of these talks end up on the web, you know, people can listen to them on the web. And someone said, 22 minutes into the talk you gave in May 5. You said something that wasn't right. Let me tell you, you know, like 22. So I hope that none of you have that kind of memory. In the beginning of September, you said, but I thought it'd be nice to see if you have any questions about the discourse and, and also, but if you don't have any questions, then if you have questions about other things around practice, I take it that people who come to a meditation practice like ours and come and do it on a regular basis and come to sit with us on a regular basis, that the meditation practice has an importance to them that coming here, the practice is important for them. And you don't do this because it's, you know, casual thing, usually, you don't keep it up like that. And so perhaps there's some questions that come out of that sense of importance if it's not about the suit terms itself. For those of you who haven't been here, the discourse covers four broad areas that we can develop our mindfulness, our presence, our presence of mind, our sense of being really attentive to what's happening in the present moment. And these four broad areas are the body, which was there's five different nine exercises having to do with the body, learning to develop mindfulness of the body. The second area has to do with the feelings that we have. And generally, that's explained as the feeling tone of our experience, though it's probably more complicated than that, probably more complicated in the way I described it. But the pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral aspect of our experience. The third is our mental states or mental states of consciousness that we have, not so much, you know, great altered states of consciousness, exactly. But in the mind, when it's colored by anger, then the consciousness is covered, colored by anger. So we say anger consciousness is there, the mind is concentrated, then the consciousness is somehow, you know, shaped or colored by concentration. So again, to know the state of your consciousness is part of the practice. And then the fourth one is the realm of the dhammas, which is mostly has to do with the processes that come into play as a person is either moving towards suffering or moving towards liberation. So getting a sense of some of these inner processes and how they work is a very important part of the practice. And all these are considered ways of developing mindfulness. Some people focus on one area more than another, but it tends to be holographic in the sense that focusing on one tends to bring out the other. And, and they tend to all develop to some degree as we practice. In modern America, American vipassana scenes, these, the understanding is often given to these four foundations of mindfulness is that they describe the whole range of our human experience. And it's kind of like shorthand and saying, pay attention to everything in your in your empirical experience, things you can actually see and feel and touch. And, and, and so the progression from the body to these inner processes is a progression that goes towards just something very particular to becoming quite inclusive of everything that we possibly would be aware of. Probably if you read the discourse carefully, or maybe not so carefully, you don't get that message that it says to do that. What it does, it doesn't say, you know, pay attention to everything. It says, pay attention, pay attention. It's a very important, mindfulness is very important. But it says, it gives you particular areas to bring mindfulness to. And so then the question is, what's, what do we do by that discrepancy between how some of the modern teachers teach and how the text teaches? Maybe we don't care. Maybe both of them are wonderful. And it's interesting to see the difference. One, one argument that can be made is that a text is not focusing on everything that we can pay attention to, but rather focusing on those things which are most beneficial to focus on, if you want to develop, if you want to liberate yourself. And so it kind of narrows the field of experience a little bit, because the whole field of experience is so large, and that everything you pay attention to is beneficial for, you know, is further leading onto liberation. So it says, you know, pay attention to these particular things. These are the most useful things to pay attention to. So that's an argument that needs to be made that way. Lately, I've been aware that among people who come and talk to me, or people I hear talk about religion and spirituality, that there seems to be a very strong tendency towards either or thinking. And I probably succumb to that all the time too. That's either one way or the other. And I think that it's probably wiser, probably more realistic or whatever. At least in terms of spirituality, to always be thinking first or kind of bring on the perspective or consider things also through the perspective of maybe it's both and rather than either or. And so rather than, you know, one ways better than the other, maybe both are useful ways, and we don't have to set them opposed to each other. So I should stop so I can give you a chance to ask questions. I need to remind you that you create good karma for asking questions. You need karma or answers. Perhaps you could say a little bit about the difference between investigation and just thinking about somehow. I mean, between fair attention, focused attention, something in that category. When you open the question up, and maybe too broad near the end, but in the beginning, the difference between investigation and thinking. Investigation is an important aspect and it appears explicitly in the seven factors of awakening, which is one of the instructions for the text. And again, I think sometimes there's a strong tendency to problematize thinking in meditation circles. Thinking is wrong or you shouldn't think. If you're meditating, there should be no thinking going on. You should stop it or not pay attention to it. Thinking, you might be thinking about things, but you know that you be aware of it, but thinking doesn't have any function, any value. So it's kind of pushed aside or ignored for its value, for its benefits. So the investigation then, in that kind of dichotomy, the investigation is one of, it's a non-discursive investigation. So we're not using the mind to think about something to understand it better, but rather developing a capacity to see it better more carefully. So to really be able to describe what a sunset looks to someone, you don't usually take a quick look at the sunset and close your eyes and try to think about the best description. Probably you want to kind of study the sunset for a while, look at it, and really take it in in a non-discursive way, perhaps. I don't know if that was a good example, but there's a lot of situations in life where kind of a non-discursive sensing or experiencing what's going on gives us the biggest sense, the best sense of what's actually happening there. And so there's a lot of powerful ways of experiencing our life non-discursively, and some people find it quite liberating or delightful. That part of mindfulness practice, which is non-discursive, we spend so much of our time thinking about things, that it's such a relief to find another way of relating to our experience. For some people it's quite a challenge to relate to their experience without relating to it by their thinking, because most people are relating to experience most of the time through their thoughts. We're thinking about things, we're experiencing things through the filter of our thoughts, our beliefs, our values, our opinions, our past experiences, and so it's relatively unusual that we kind of see something unmitigated by concepts and ideas. And so then some people really emphasize the value of doing that, of kind of dropping thoughts and dropping ideas, just seeing things as they actually are. So I think it's quite easy to make a sharp distinction, at least in the theory, between thinking and some other way of investigating. I think in practice, my sense, my own experience, is that it's very hard to make a hard and fast line between thinking and non-discursive investigation. I think there's quite a bit of overlap, and there's no indication, as far as I could tell in the discourses of the Buddha, that the Buddha was encouraging people to stop thinking, that that was the preferred mode of being. So then we know what's the role of thinking, how do we think, and part of that understanding is certainly to understand all the ways which is not useful to think. And there's so many ways that thinking gets in the way, and that's maybe what most of us are aware of. But thinking is a beautiful attribute to the human mind, because of beautiful things. And it also helps us, it can help us to understand things. We can ask particular questions, and we can explore, what's a really good question to bring to bear on this topic? And then what's the best way to be discerning? Just being discerning has an aspect of thinking about things, remembering a little bit what happened, kind of anticipating what might happen, and evaluating what's useful to happen, what's not useful to happen. There's an evaluation process that can go on in practice. I like to emphasize that part of mindfulness practice is trial and error, and I like to emphasize as part of that is that it's very hard, it's very hard to be a teacher. You say it's so hard. Some days I say it's so easy, but it's both then, right? But today it's so hard, because I try so hard to convey the practice. It's what I do with my life, I try my best to figure out how to talk about it and say it, but I just know I can't succeed. All I could do is do these really broad brush strokes, and kind of point to you in some general direction over there, and then you got to try it out. And then you find how to do the practice, you find what the instructions mean on your own by applying it and by trial and error, finding out what it means for you. And so trial and error involves some evaluation. This worked, this didn't work. But then some of us are neurotic about evaluating our experience. I mean, we're so good at it, and it means, you know, this means that I am neurotic, this means I'm really great, this means you know, it's just a disaster, you know, as soon as we start that. And so a lot of American Vipassana teachers almost want to de-emphasize thinking, because for Americans it gets in our way so much. And so they don't talk about that as part of, you know, what you can do. But I think that my sense is that there's no sharp line between a non-discursive approach to investigation, we are sensing more carefully the experience, and some kind of discursive analytical or thoughtful way in which we go forward. One of the principles for using thoughts as part of practice is the use of your thinking as you practice, helping the mind to become stiller. If it's not helping the mind become more silent and more stiller, more concentrated, then probably you're not thinking it, you know, in a usefully meditative way. And so, but most people, it's hard to find that. So, and most of us think so, like for me, I tend to be fairly investigative. I think it's one of my more kind of stronger aspects, perhaps when I do practice. And so there's an element of kind of thinking about things to some degree going on. And I did not need any teachers telling me to think more about things. So, I mean, mostly I messaged like I don't think, don't think, don't think. And so I, you know, I mostly didn't. But then a little quiet voice in the back of my mind was going along barely, helping me along. In this way. And I'm really glad for that part. But, but it needs to be de-emphasized. And for some people needs to be de-emphasized, some people needs to be emphasized and developed. You know, we don't want meditation to make you, you know, to, you know, kind of dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb you down kind of thing, right? I think mindfulness meditation, you're supposed to bring all your intelligence to the practice. Whatever intelligence you have, you should bring to it. And it's not, you know, it's not meant just to be something, you know, that you only bring part of yourself to. So you bring all your intelligence to the process of learning how to be still. And part of that process is no, is having intelligence or knowledge or went to stop. Whatever, you know, is that making sense? So is that helpful? I went on and on without checking in seeing if I was addressing your concern. I think one of the things that's so difficult for me is feeling that in some sense that we start with that first factor of mindfulness, that mindfulness is that present of mind that keeps track of what's going on. Right. And then if we add something new, that is a quality investigation. Here's the, I mean, it seems kind of funny line to me when I'm adding an investigation, I can feel the energy there. Right. But it's kind of hard because I'll be, you know, trying to just keep my present experience and awareness. And then if I start thinking, well, let's see, what is the strategy? Can I notice, you know, what my feelings are, what my body feels like when I notice that suddenly slipped away. Yeah. And that seems kind of, you know, I start to think more about what's really happening right now. And then next time I know, I'm watching the distraction. Oh, it's time to have investigation. Well, once you start the process, investigation can lead itself very easily to excessive thinking and being lost in thought. And so it's an art form to learn how to use an investigation that helps us keep us present and nudges us on to get more concentrated, more present. Mindfulness is, as I've said recently, mindfulness by itself as a technical understanding of mindfulness in the Buddhist tradition. Mindfulness is actually pretty dumb. It's a dumb capacity of mind. All mind, all in the traditional understanding of Buddhism, all mindfulness is, is kind of this simple capacity of the mind to hold something in its intention, kind of a presence of mind that we bring to whatever is happening in the moment. So that's all it does. When we talk about mindfulness kind of colloquially in America, we often add a lot of other factors to it and make it a little more complicated than the traditional understanding of mindfulness is, where it's kind of a dumb thing. Just, you're there, you're plop, you're right there, you're showing up. You know, that's all you've done. You're shown up. A lot of people can show up. And then as the practice develops, especially if you look at the seven factors of awakening, is that it is that you want to collect other things together with the mindfulness. And one of the first things we collect is this quality investigation. And the simplest way of doing that is to ask yourself the Vipassana question. And that is, what is this? So you've shown up and then you say, what is this experience? So you're showing up for your breath, and you're there with your breath, and you can do that kind of brute thing, you know, just hang in, stay there with the breath. And then what is this breath? What is this experience like? And then you kind of start looking more carefully. And the question of what is this, or let me look more carefully, is using your thought, perhaps your evaluation. But once you've kind of, then it kind of, you turn your mind to pay more careful attention to what the experience of breathing is like. Or you have an emotion. And you notice the emotion is strong. And then you have the question, what is this experience like? And so then the mind maybe drops back down into a more non-discursive approach, if that's useful. But it was the thinking mind that kind of realized, oh, this is some place to pay more careful attention. Let's look more deeply here. Is that helpful? Yeah. On the same subject, one of the ways that one teacher taught this was in relation to seeing experience in terms of a nicha, dukkha and a nata. And which is something that I've used when I'm trying to investigate. It's like trying to look at something deep enough to see what that is a permanent, to see that there is a self. There are two very general approaches, maybe around investigation. And you pointed to that to now. And different teachers emphasize different ways. And it's probably both and kind of thing. But one way is to actually be looking for something in particular. And the particular things that are useful for deep vipassana practice is to be looking for that aspect of our experience which is universal, and not necessarily just personal to ourselves. And the most universal things we have is what's called the three characteristics. That things are either, in some sense, impermanent, in some sense, unsatisfactory, and in some sense, there's no self there. You can't find a self in that experience. So some people, as Ines says, will look for that as their experience. Other teachers will de-emphasize looking for anything in particular. Just look. Just investigate and see what's there. And part of the reason for not looking for something in particular, but rather just look what's there, is that when you start looking for what's in particular, the mind can be very well, it's adjustable, it can manufacture things. And so if you've been told that, oh, experience of impermanence is really what's important, then people will kind of tune into it or imagine they're seeing it, rather than really seeing it in the way it's meant in vipassana. And same thing with a lot of other factors, like in certain meditative states that can arise in practice, like certain kinds of joy and bliss, which sometimes emphasize in practice. If people learn too much about these things ahead of time, then people are not just allowing it to happen as it happens, but they're kind of leaning, looking, anticipating, and they're kind of mad, that's it, I think that's it, yeah, that's it, I think it's it, yeah. And it's not it at all, but, you know, and or whatever. So there's two whole approaches. And the way I was trained in Southeast Asia, was maybe epitomized by the first meditation monastery I sat in in Thailand. The monastery had a library of Buddhist books, mostly in Thai. And for some reason, I went there to the library one day, and it wasn't a big room, but there was, you know, lined with all these books in Thai, and they have no meaning to me because I don't read Thai. And then I was shown that the there were in fact some books in English. And but those books in English were behind the big picture of the Thai royal family, or the king and the queen, I think it was. And the reason they were behind the picture was the English books were being hidden. So the Americans or the Europeans, Americans, Westerners who came there, wouldn't find those books and start reading them. And the idea was that it's fine to read these things after you practice for a long time. And that's the way it was in Burma also, you were told not to read a lot of things about meditation, until after you've gone through a series of practice periods. And then you were told then it's okay, now you can read and find out what happened to you. But you're not supposed to find out what's going to happen to you before you do it. So there's different approaches. Yes. How do you get that clue? Well, I think one of the best clues, so you all hear the question? So one of the best clues is if you're suffering. The Satipatanasuta, the main kind of rationale or the point of that traditional practice of mindfulness was to help people suffer less and be free of their suffering. And so is the practice you're doing leading to less suffering? Is it causing suffering as you do it? And so you can pay attention. So if you're kind of lost and kind of diluted and holding on and wondering what's going on, confused, there's probably some sense of suffering, some tension, some anxiety, some pressure, some stress, something that's in there that would qualify as dukkha, suffering. And that can be a great clue. The bumper sticker for a Buddhist is, I stop for suffering. And what it means is we stop and pay attention. We learn from it. So I'd like to give you my vipassana, my Buddhist test. I gave some people recently my little test to see how good you are as Buddhists. How do you know when suffering is sacred? What is sacred suffering? That silenced the room. Are you all going to fail my test? So how do you know when suffering is sacred? Yeah. When you're not allowed to question it, you have to explain a little bit about that. Um, why would it be sacred when you can't question it? Oh, when it, when it's just, beyond the pale, just don't ask. Oh, it's so awe, awe, awe, awe, awe inspiring me. It's so monumental and huge. And there's no, someone who thinks that there are an authority and they're not to be questioned. So you can't do anything about it. But how's that sacred? Because they say it is. Oh, they say it is. Oh. No, I better not say anything. It's good. Thank you for saying it. Thank you. Yes. Great. I like that answer. Yes. That's a good answer. Nothing is sacred. Nothing is sacred. See, it's a Zen student. See, around here, everything's sacred for us. And it probably comes to the same. If you're trying to understand it, then it's sacred. So the, so those are good answers. The, because the word for sacred here I'm using is, is I'm using it kind of a synonym for the word for noble. The first noble truth is the truth, noble truth. The truth is the noble truth of suffering. So there's ordinary suffering, which is suffering where you suffer. And then there's noble suffering or sacred suffering, which is the same suffering, could be the same suffering. But we understand how to find the path to liberation in that suffering. We understand how we can bring practice to it. And then it's become sacred in a sense. It doesn't mean we look for suffering and try to make it happen. But when suffering does happen, if you have a sense of how, where the practice can be found in the middle of it, then you found the first noble truth. Is that another way of talking about right view? Yes. The right view or right perspective or the right orientation. Yes, and? So if I'm investigating my breath, I maybe wouldn't be thinking about what the breath is. I would be feeling it more intimately, more carefully. And so when I feel the chest expand, that experience of expansion is, I'm not, the thinking is not making that happen. It's happening independent of thinking. And the sensing of that, the sensory awareness of that is not a thought either, but it's a physical sensation of expansion, of pressure, thoughtness. And so then I saw the investigation of the breath feels or senses in that non-discursive way, that non-discursive aspect of our experience, the non-discursive way of experiencing things, which is through our senses, is coming into play and we become more sensitive. And as we get more concentrated, it isn't just simply an experience of expansion, but it might be a whole series of small little movements of expansions and stretching and tautness and hardness and tightness and whole bunch of things happen there as the chest expands. And you don't see like one smooth sensation. Very, very concentrated, you see a lot of minute little sensations that kind of ripple up as you go through it. And you can't think about that. So you can think about it, sure, but the learning about that, that you don't learn about that through your thinking. You learn about that by feeling it directly. So by non-discursive, you're talking about the sense of... Yeah, yeah. So how about like naming the aspect of the mind? I would say naming is a discursive aspect of the mind. And I wouldn't use it as discursive. Maybe I should be more careful with my language. Discursive, I think of as being kind of having a conversation. And discursive thinking often gets in the way of meditation. You're giving a discourse to yourself. But there can be much more simple kind of forms of thought that help further leading in meditation, that keep you connected. And probably one of the simplest forms of thoughts that actually can be very, very helpful in meditation is mental notings, to make a mental note. And that's like using... Your thought is so simple that it's just like one word. It's like expansion as you breathe in. You feel the expansion, expansion. And so you're using a very, very simple part of the mind, a thinking part of the mind that helps you kind of feel and more carefully, kind of gets you focused and engaged in that part of your experience. Yes? I'm supposed to know them sometimes in meditation. I noticed the different ways that the mind took off. I mean, when you're projecting your planning or reversing, there are all these different ways that I'm not listening. And then not follow it off, because you say, oh, that's what it did this time. Not exactly. You're not supposed to bring this forward. Yes, yes, yes, fine. The same thing is for this notion that if you do not go off, you follow it. Oh, you see, I'm not supposed to be the judge of what is useful and not useful. That's why my job is so easy. I'm not the judge. Anybody's experience. I can just tell you the broad principle. And the principle is that if it helps you become more attentive and helps you become stiller, more aware of what's going on, then great. And you're the one who's supposed to be the judge of that, not me. Someone once suggested to me that non-discursive thinking could be viewed as standing in the middle of a train station, watching all the trains coming and going to all these different places, without ever getting on one. That's a good one. So he's heard the analogy that non-discursive thinking is like standing in the middle of a busy train station where all trains are coming, going in all direction, people are coming in all direction, and you're standing there in the middle and not getting on any of the trains. I haven't heard that one exactly. One I've heard one just is similar though, just standing at the edge of the train tracks and the trains keep coming by. And there's all these interesting trains go by, we just watch them go by. But then there's a box car that has really interesting things in it and you jump on. And it takes you 10 minutes or 2 days to realize that you're on the train. So thoughts are like the trains going by. So it's possible to be aware of thinking with that part of the mind that doesn't think. Maybe we can call that non-discursive part of the mind. So it's possible to experience thinking and see that you're thinking. And the part that sees or senses there's aware of thinking happening, that is a silent part of the mind. So that's why it's possible to be and have a lot of thinking going on and still feel, even the mind can even be agitated at times, but there's a feeling kind of like there's still a point in the middle of it. And all this stuff is happening and we haven't gotten on. One of the ways of understanding this is we don't, we certainly don't get attached or cling to what's going on. And we don't personalize it, we don't take it as being this is who I am. One of the ways to get on the train is to say, oh, that train is Gil. But if it's just thoughts, one of the little exercises that Joseph Goldstein used to teach, when you're sitting in a meditation hall, is imagine that the thoughts you're having in meditation are being projected into your mind from the person sitting behind you. And I think he taught that as a way of helping you kind of disidentify with your thoughts. Don't take him so seriously and it's so important. Before I came down here tonight, earlier today, we had a questions and answer session yesterday on Sunday morning. And there were some questions then about mental noting. And I thought, well, maybe it's time to give a talk on mental noting. And then I thought, well, I should do it to Sunday because that's what people seem relevant. But now you've got somebody, would you like a talk on mental noting and X Monday? Should I do it both days? How many of you come on Sunday? Or I wouldn't mind hearing it twice. Sometimes. Well, I think people on Sunday would like to hear the talk, but it would be nice to hear on mental noting. So I usually don't like to give the same talk on Monday and Sunday because that's my neurosis. I don't like to repeat myself. So, thank you. But I could do it. I have a question. All of the instructions in the suit that you were reading were to Max. Did the Buddha ever give instructions to Max? He did. I don't know a lot about this topic because I haven't gone too carefully through suit. He doesn't see exactly what is it he taught to lay people. I know in the commentary to this discourse, it's clearly explained that take the word monk in this text, what it means is anybody who is sincerely practicing. So if you're sincerely practicing, then you're a monk. So it's not limited to only people who take an ordination. That's what the commentary says about this text. But to answer your question more directly, I know some places where the Buddha gave very clear instructions to laity. They tended not to be meditation instructions. And there's one discourse called the Sigalaka Sutta that is sometimes called the Vinaya for the lay people. Vinaya is the Buddhist word for the monastic Vinaya, and the monastic Vinaya is the rules and regulations, the guidelines for the monastic life. So this text provides the guidelines for lay life. And it's been on my mind for some time to talk about it, but I've been a little bit shy about doing it because I couldn't quite, I hadn't put my mind around the text enough to convince myself I can do it in a way that was useful for people or wouldn't put people asleep. But maybe one day. It has tended to be in Asia a big divide between monastics and laity in terms of the practices they do. It hasn't been an absolute divide. And that divide has broke down quite a bit in the 20th century. But still in Asia there's still a divide. One of the primary characteristics of that divide is that it's the monastics of meditate, and the lay people generally don't. They do other forms of spiritual practice, devotional practices, for example. And so it's quite a new thing. It's only maybe 60, 70 years old maybe, the phenomena where meditation is offered quite readily and easily to lay people. Not just in America, but in the West, but also in Southeast Asia. It's a whole new phenomenon. Probably it's difficult to... I kind of put the time on 1940s as a time, a real watershed time for bringing meditation to lay people. And then our teachers, or people who studied in Asia, Westerners who went to Asia, and then directly benefited from that big change that happened in the 1940s. And we're introduced to a meditation practice where it was fine to be due as a lay person. And then no one thinks twice about it. Oh, this is what lay people do. Last one, then we should stop. Do you say the goal of the past now is to be totally in present time? No. And just to... I've been using the book Power Now as kind of a bible, like... I'm trying to get into present time. It's just extraordinarily difficult. And I'm not sure... There is a follow-up book called Practicing the Power Now, but still it's not... It's just... I'm trying to be almost impossible to do. I can do it for 10 seconds in the morning and then I get distracted. 14 hours later I remember that I was supposed to be in present time. I think all of us here in the room understand that one. But he has some really good... He offers some really good arguments for being in present time. And it seems like... I mean, it's very logical. I know people who love this book. I haven't read it. And... Before I even heard about this book, I had a little bit of a sense that the present moment had become the god of American Buddhists. It's kind of like very highly valued and very important for American Buddhists being in the present moment now. As you can't do nothing wrong if you're just in the present moment. My sense, my own sense is that... That's why I said no, it's not the goal of Vipassana practice. The present moment, being in the present moment, paying attention to the present moment is central to the development of Vipassana. And a lot of the whole Vipassana practice is... A lot of it is focused on learning how to do that. And it's a whole training to learn to do that. It's kind of like the main thing that we teach here in many ways is helping people, help all of us to kind of learn to be in the present moment. And it is a challenge. But it's not the goal. The goal is to be liberated. And it turns out that being in the present moment is one of the best ways to help you become liberated. Once you're liberated, I mean, that's not so essential to be in the present moment all the time. I get the sense that once you're liberated, you're automatically in present time. I mean, it's because if you're not in present time, you're always in the future, always in the past, and you've got all this mind-shatter and all that conditioning and stuff. So naturally, I'll get all these reports. Let's compare notes in 20 years. We'll find out. So thank you all. And I hope it was useful to do an evening of questions like this. So maybe next week we'll do this thing of mental noting, which if you're already thinking you're not going to come because he's talking about mental noting, you're the one who should come.
