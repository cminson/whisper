 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning, good day, hello. And sometimes it's useful to see ourselves in a different way than we habitually do. So it occurred to me to say, to greet you, calling you all earthlings. So, you know, good day earthlings. And for me, calling ourselves earthlings, immediate identification with this earth, that this is our place, this is our home, and that it's kind of a mutual, kind of identification with all living beings that are here, not just human beings that share this planet. And so to have this different name, like different than Homo sapiens or people or something. And so this idea, this ability to shift our orientation simply with a word can make a huge difference in meditation practice and in mindfulness and in liberation. Because we often are unconsciously many times conditioned by concepts we've internalized, that our society, our family, your experience somehow points us in that direction so that we think in that way all the time. And I know that sometimes with, like with COVID, my son got COVID and I had had contact with him about almost two months ago now. And I had contact with him before he knew he had it. And so he called me up and explained the situation. So that day I was oriented towards all kinds of little changes in my body temperature and the raspiness of my throat and was that a headache or not a headache I was having? And it was just kind of my orientation became focused on different body parts that were associated with symptoms of COVID. Other times, there have been times in my life where I used to have very long blonde hair. And I remember seeing other people with long blonde hair and now I was concerned with comparing myself to them and my orientation with who I was with my hair. So the ways in which we understand our body can be biased. The way we orient ourselves towards our body can be to a particular lens. And that lens can be wind drag. That lens can be a little bit of a weight. Maybe it's a little bit negative self-talk. Maybe it's we orient ourselves in a way towards ourselves that we're not happy with our body and just connecting to our body is a little bit discouraging because of the orientation we have. So this 32 or 31 parts of the body exercise, one of its functions is to begin shifting the way that we understand or orient it towards our body. The concepts in which we hold it by from one that often can produce a lot of suffering to one that doesn't, to one that actually helps us become concentrated. And I think so. So that's all I'll say for now. So, you know, we're kind of taking a side tour, a detour right now, and the kind of the simplest way of continuing with Satipatthana. But this is the way the text goes. And maybe for good reason, it's now that we've kind of done the foundation work. Now we're continuing to lay down a stronger foundation with this 32 parts of the body. I keep saying 32. The usual meditation practice is 32 parts. But in this discourse we're doing, there's only listed 31. The brain is left out. And so for today, what I'd like to do, and from the beginning of this sitting, is to do a version of this practice of the parts of the body. Often people, when they learn it, they are learning it in groups of five. So I'll teach you a group of five. I'll guide you with a few rounds around how doing this. And then we'll be silent. And you can either continue with the rounds and just keep doing it and see if the focus on it both develops some concentration and or also kind of begins orient yourself to your body in a different way that maybe brings more stability, more freedom, more ease. Maybe. So see what the difference is, how you do it. So the five parts of the body is the progression from the external to the internal. So the first is the skin, then the flesh, then the tendons, then the bones, and then the bone marrow. So skin, tendons, skins, flesh, tendons, bones, marrow. And I'll post it here in the chat just if you want to see it there. Skin, flesh, tendons, bone, marrow. And you might try repeating it with me a few times out loud or silently. So you get the hang of it. Skin, flesh, tendons, marrow, tendons, bones, marrow. I need to get the hang of it. Skin, tendons, there we go again. Skin, flesh, tendons, bone, marrow. Skin, flesh, tendons, bones, marrow. So taking a meditation posture and kind of maybe shaking a little bit in your body and swaying back and forth a little bit to help you settle in. And gently closing the eyes and letting the eyes be relaxed. Some people find it helpful to imagine or feel the eyes as cool, cool eyes. And then a few long, slow, deep breaths, settling into your body as you exhale. Letting your breathing come to normal. And again, with the ordinary breath, continue this process of relaxing into your body, softening. And then bring your attention to one of your hands. And you feel the sensations of your hands, of your hand. The warmth and coolness that's there. Any tingling and pulsing that might be there. Any contact of the hand against some other part of the body. Pressure, weight, softness. And then for a few moments here now, focus on the sensations on the skin. The warmth or coolness that might be there. If the skin is touching something, feel the contact of the skin. To be aware of the skin, but see if you can feel from the sensations of skin more than your thoughts and ideas and memories of what your hands look like. We see the hand from the outside when we look at it, but we can feel the hand from the inside. So what are the sensations of the skin, surface of the hand? If your eyes closed, maybe no need to have an image or memory or ideas about your hand just to feel the skin. And then to spread your attention of skin throughout your body, letting the awareness float to wherever in the body the skin has sensations. And be aware of skin. Underneath the skin is flesh. The muscles that we have. Maybe it includes the fat that's there. And can you kind of feel your way or imagine your way to some place in your body where you feel the sensations or your sense into it, the flesh that's there. The sensations that are deeper than the skin. And feel those. Independent of what you think about it, the ideas you have, that this exercise is giving permission for the flesh to reveal itself in its own terms. The flesh has no ideas about how it should and shouldn't be. It just is. And allow the sensations just be. And then going deeper in, there's the tendons, ligaments. Perhaps the tendons connecting the bow to the bones. Maybe you feel, I can imagine them stretched if your knees are bent. Maybe there's no obvious sensations but vague sense of location or place or shape of tendons. The Achilles tendon. And if you don't feel it, then the exercise is to imagine it. Imagine maybe what it looks like. And then deeper is the bones. Perhaps some version of white, white bones. Perhaps you've seen nowadays around here, a lot of life-size Halloween skeletons. Skull and rib cage. Hips. If you have an ability to visualize, you can visualize your bones. Or you can feel or sense the hardness, the solidity, the structure of the bones that hold you upright maybe. And then deep in the bones, especially some of the larger bones in the body, is marrow. Where blood is made, life-giving blood is made. A little bit more fibrous perhaps than the outer side of the bone. Imagine visualizing the marrow, feeling yourself settling into the center of some of the bones. So for a few rounds, I'll just recite these five areas of the body. And let yourself follow the path from this surface to inside, feeling, imagining, visualizing, sensing these important parts of your physical body. Without which you wouldn't be able to manage in your life. Skin. Flesh. Tendence. Bones. Marrow. I'll do it one more time and then you're on your own. You can do it slower or faster or not at all. Skin. Flesh. Tendence. Bones. Marrow. Skin. Blood. Skin. Blood. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. Skin. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, consider other people and maybe for them also to see them in a new way different than the usual one. But perhaps to see them as skin flesh tendons bones and marrow to imagine to visualize to reflect that they too just like you have skin flesh tendons bones and marrow. They too have the skin that holds everything together flesh and muscles that store nutrients and house the muscles to which we can be active. Tendons that hold the bones together. The bones that they too have bones and marrow. All material that it's arisen out of this earth all material which is recycled our physical beings are made up of recycled materials. items that are in us now and will be somewhere else when we die. We are made from this earth earthlings all of us. And perhaps sensing the physicality and the earth the ness of each being perhaps seeing them differently in a way that we share so much commonality we share our earth thingness. We share in this endless recycling of material. May we live together as a community of earthlings may we live together with care for each other with respect for each other with generosity to each other. May we live together with love for each other. And may we in small or large ways find ways to live and express that love the care the respect for other earthlings. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free.
