 One of the kind of practice suggestions or themes that I've mentioned the last few weeks has been the idea of to practice mindfulness carefully as you come out of meditation. If you sit every morning, practice as best you can while you meditate. And then as you come out of meditation and start your regular day, pay attention to how you reconstruct your regular day. Pay attention to whatever openness or calm or presence or mindfulness you have from your sitting begins to close down or closes down entirely or the mind tightens up or whatever, the heart closes. A big source of the wisdom that can be found from doing insight practice is not necessarily from doing meditation itself, but by paying careful attention to what happens as we come out of the meditation. Often a common tendency for people is to say, well, this period is over and the bell rings or the time is up and then you can just forget about it. Whatever you do early in the morning. So I mentioned that as a possibility. I think it's an important suggestion because it's very important to integrate your meditation practice and mindfulness practice into your daily life. And this is a very useful way to bring that integration about. And there can be said that there's a teaching in Buddhism about grasping where they list four different kinds of grasping that could be useful to this exercise. The thing that kind of we lose our mindfulness or lose our presence or lose our connectedness with the presence happens primarily when we start grasping at something. The mind or the heart clamps down on something and because it's clamped down, then it doesn't have this open, more present panoramic presence, but rather becomes very fixated on something. The four fixations, the four grasping. And the word for grasping in Pali is Upadana. And what's interesting with this word is that the word Upadana, meaning grasping, also has the meaning of the fuel or the fuel. The fuel is also the fuel. And the implication is, I understand it, is that in this word, is that grasping, when we grasp, grasping itself is the fuel for further grasping. Then when we're attached to something, that attachment feeds further attachment. And there's no other way of saying that. So the word is Upadana. And that's what we're talking about. And that's what we're talking about. When we're attached to something, that attachment feeds further attachment. And there's many ways we can understand that mechanism. And there are four of these graspings. And I'm not going to go into all of them now, but I want to mention the four. One is, the traditional first one is sensuality, grasping for sense pleasure. The second is grasping at what's usually considered at precepts, at grasping on precepts or morality, commitments, and practices or rituals. And the third is grasping on views. And the fourth, maybe a kind of subcategory of views, is grasping on a self, the concept, the idea of a self, holding onto a self. And on Saturday at the one day sitting I talked about the first two. And today I want to talk a little bit about the fourth, about grasping on a self. And a little bit about the notion of no self in Buddhism. Buddhist kind of approach to the notion of self. In talking about it, I think many of us in the West, when we hear the Buddhist teaching of self and no self, get concerned, to say the least, worried or insulted or outraged or disenchanted or just disbelief or saying, we say, how quaint and archaic, but they don't really understand modern psychology and how it all works and how important it is to have a sense of self and a strong sense of self and an independent sense of self and a grown-up sense of self and an autonomous sense of self. And I think because so many people that I hear, I have so much trouble with the Buddhist teaching of self and no self. It seems to raise a lot of buttons, a lot of concern. Because of that very concern, it becomes, I think, a very interesting place for us to explore. The fact that we'd only simply say, well, that's no good and push it away. We actually kind of get kind of excited. Many people I see get kind of excited and concerned about it. You know, wait a minute, what am I buying into here? This is going too far. I can accept Buddhism up to this level. But when you talk about self and no self, I'm not going to take that and kind of pull back. So that's very interesting. What is it that gets threatened? So that notion of a self is a common place where we grasp, where we get stuck, where the mind, the heart gets stuck, gets succeeded. And looking at it from that point of view, whether there's a self or not self, maybe it's not so important. What's the issue is, is there suffering, are you experiencing suffering around the fact that there's grasping to this notion of self? That's one way of looking at it. So who cares if there's a self or not? But Buddhism is very concerned about the suffering around this notion of where we hold the notion of self. So see if we can be a little bit more free of suffering. I think most of us, probably all of us have had the experience of maybe the frustration of recognizing that someone sees us in a very limited way. That someone has a kind of puts us in a category and then assumes that's all we are. They kind of treat us according to that category. So they see, you know, we're just a parent, or we're just a child, or we're just a spouse, or some, you know, our position in the world is because we're so and so a spouse. And so we, you know, treat it that way. Or with certain kind of gender, that means a certain thing, or certain nationality, or certain... You have a certain career, and so you're identified just by that career and nothing else seems to count. Or, you know, you were angry once upon a time, you know, probably was long, long ago, but that person remembers. It is, well, that person thinks of you as an angry person and relates to you that all the time, kind of treats you with kid gloves or whatever. And, you know, it can be very frustrating and sometimes feel very disrespectful to be treated in that kind of categorical way and limited way. And it feels very limiting. Say, wait a minute, I'm much more than that. Give me a chance. And then it's also very easy, I think, somewhat easy also to notice for themselves. When people put themselves in a particular category and see themselves in a certain way and say, hey, you know, you can see that they think that they are, that they put themselves in a category of being unworthy. So, you know, please, you don't have to be so unworthy, you know, kind of, you're fine, you're wonderful, you say, but they're kind of locked in that position. Or they, or it's a role. They're locked in maybe being, you know, always being the doctor who knows everything, you know, the professor who knows everything. So they go, everywhere they go, they have to be the one who knows because that's their role and they confuse their identity with their role. They limit who they are. So it's kind of easy, that's easy to think that they limit themselves by holding on to some category. What's much more difficult is to see that in ourselves directly. Is to see that we do the very same thing to ourselves. We put ourselves in categories and we don't see the full width and range of who we are. And in a sense, if someone else is disrespectful to us because they don't do it, I mean, maybe there's, maybe if we can say we're kind of just being disrespectful to ourselves, we put ourselves in a narrow category. And a lot of suffering in the world arises, a lot of individuals suffering, a lot rises from seeing ourselves or holding a small limited idea of who we are and not understanding that we're much more than that. When I was in junior high school, I had an art teacher who told me I had no ability in art. And so I thought that was, well, she should know. So it became one of the identities that I kind of added to all the identities I have. I probably had already had by that time a whole bunch, bunch. It was very conveniently kind of, it just slid right in enjoying all the others. So I carried that identity with me until college where I was kind of tricked into doing art and found that I had some ability. And more important that I enjoyed it. And so here I had limited myself, or I had limited myself from taking on and relieving what someone had told me about myself. And it took a long time, to ten years or something before that particular identity was overcome. Part of the difficulty that Buddhism says around the notion of self is that any notion of any idea of what a self is, what our self is, what the self is, what the self is, what the self is, what the self is. And we relate to the concept of self as an idea, as a concept. And ideas, so there's various things, various problems with that. One is that the notion of a self, in that it's an idea, limits reality. Because if it's one idea, it can't be another idea. Also, that idea might be wrong. Completely wrong, not only just a small aspect of reality, it might be wrong, aspect of reality. And one of the things that happens as we do mindfulness practice is some of the more erroneous notions we have of what the self is begins seeing through it. And the other thing about having a concept of self, an idea of self, of seeing a self in ourselves, is what we're setting up then is a kind of subject-object duality, distinction. And we're kind of objectifying ourselves, we're kind of seeing ourselves in a certain place. There's this kind of the subject that sees and observes the self, and the self that has to become a thing. And that's, maybe doesn't sound like a particularly... but it's kind of like the eye seeing itself. Can the eye see itself? I can't really see the eye. I can't really see itself. When it functions, it doesn't see itself, unless you kind of look in the mirror, of course. When the eye functions, the eye just functions, it doesn't see itself. It doesn't have to see itself in order to function. If the eye had some idea of what an eye is supposed to be, you probably get confused. In the same way, perhaps with the self, that the self is something that goes to function, and not to be seen, not to be objectified. And we have different notions and ideas that we grasp onto in relationship to our self. And I can think of maybe several. One is the idea that the self is constant, is stable, is permanent. And I can have some sense of that. I'm sitting here, you know, and I spent the day and the last week, last month, basically kind of with the same concept and sense of self. Things haven't changed too much, I think. But actually, with these weeks, I'm very sensitive to this, because I reconnected with my first real love, that I met first year in college, who was really kind of my great love of my life and all that. And that was some 23 years ago, or 24 years ago. And we haven't really been in touch since for 20 years or so. And then we kind of reconnected through kind of strange circumstances, and we haven't met yet, but we're going to meet in a few weeks. So I'm wondering, I'm almost as interested in meeting her and catching up and finding out how she was, as I am trying to recall who was I. You know, I try to think back at who I was back then. I guess that doesn't make any sense. Where's the continuity and where's the discontinuities of a lifetime and a life? So, I don't know, there's a kind of short-term stability, which feels constant, but I don't really see, you know, I see some stability, some constant throughout the lifetime, but I see a lot of discontinuities also. Then there's the idea that the self is independent, which is a very important one in America, American individualism, the independent notion of self. And part of the great suffering a lot of Americans feel, it comes from the idea that they are independent, in the sense of being individual, independent with everything. Self-reliance, self-this, self-that, self-opinionated, self-directive, self-willed. And what happens in American culture is that that kind of notion goes so far that people become isolated from each other and separated, and people feel very lonely in our culture. I think, at Park, there's a legacy of American individualism taken too far. The idea of independence. Some Buddhist teachers will translate the word anatta, which means no self, will translate it into English as being, there is no separate self. And that's maybe a good translation. So, the idea of self is independent is one that's common. And then there's the idea that the self is coherent. How many of you think you're coherent beings? You're supposed to be coherent. You're supposed to fit into some kind of consistent package. And if you're not consistent, if you're contradictory, heaven forbid that you have contradictory opinions or ideas or feelings towards someone. Then you're kind of confused, and that's not good. But we're made up of this huge collection of different tendencies and emotions and feelings. And I think in modern psychology sometimes we talk about sub-personalities. Is that a term they have? You know, there's supposed to be like this huge number of sub-personalities operating. I'm not so sure how all this works, but if you quiet yourself down, pay attention to the mind, you'll be surprised if you haven't done it before. The number of different voices or expressions or feelings that arise and pass and arise and pass. And I'm sure that most of you, probably all of you probably, some of the thoughts and concerns and feelings and reactions that you have, you probably wouldn't be too proud of as being the one to put the self you're going to show. I mean, we all have these bizarre stuff that goes on in our minds, in our hearts, in our emotions. So I don't think the idea that we have to be coherent is very problematic. And I've known people who have suffered a lot because they felt they had to always be good. That somehow they had to always have good thoughts. And when they had bad thoughts, they were therefore inadequate and there was nothing wrong with them, and so they were oppressed by that. So the notion of self is a coherent thing. Then there's the idea that the self has needs. Once you have a self, the self, then you can say, well, the self has these needs. The self has needs. What is the self? I mean, so much of what we call the self, identify as self, is really a socially conditioned and constructed phenomenon. Our society helps us in the construction of a self, and society then helps us in defining what the needs of that self are. And so what's a good example of that one? You should even help me. What's a good example of some kind of... Yes? I need an expensive sports car. Show who I am. Advertisers advertise. That's for sure. It's sad because we internalize a lot of that. We internalize so much about what those advertisers tell us. White teeth. Sparkling white teeth. So what's an example, though, when an advertiser tells us besides teeth that the self needs? Oh, there's this expression. Oh, there's this horrible expression on advertisement. You hear sometimes, you deserve it. Not just something you need, but you deserve it. Cheap Cherokee. You've worked for it. So there's these needs that then gets created. And so then once you have a need, then you have a whole other kind of chain of associated reactions that happen because of it. You deserve a cheap Cherokee, but you can't afford it. So then you get angry with either yourself or with society or whatever. And then the idea that the self has possessions is another concept that is often taken as being kind of for granted. Things which are theirs. This is mine. And it should have these things. They're me and mine. In Buddhism, this is one of the classic sources of suffering. Buddha talked about is it the idea of me and mine, mine, my things, my this, my that. What else? Maybe that's enough. And I think part of why people feel threatened, I think, with the idea of no self comes with those kinds of assumptions. If you feel you have to be constant or independent or the self has to be this or that or have these kind of possessions, and you're told there's no self, then what happens to that whole thing? It's a complex of ideas, your whole reality on, your security on. What happens to that? One idea I was thinking about this weekend about how to describe one notion of self or one idea of self is, there's many definitions of what a self could be. Part of the difficulty of talking about self and no self, especially, is that there's so many different kinds of definitions. You have to almost define your terms. And so when you compare Western ideas of self, just in the West people can't agree on how to define the self. Let alone at Buddhism. But one way of defining a self is the self is how you want to be seen by others. That's an interesting one. That could be one definition of self. How do you want to be seen by others? And so what do you do in order to be seen that way? And what happens if you're not seen that way? And to what expenses will you go to create that image? The way that we want to present ourselves to others. That's one way of seeing a self. Another way perhaps, another definition could be, I don't know if this is a good one. I was thinking about something that had to do with threat, that which can be threatened by others. But that doesn't seem right. Can you think of some other way of saying what kind of notion of self? Anyway. What? The way we respond in crisis or something? The way we respond in crisis. That which can suffer a loss. That which can suffer a loss. Something like that without which you think you will be who you are. That's a good one. Without which you couldn't be who you think you're supposed to be. I was thinking who you think you are. Or who you think you are. Or just the reverse of what you said, like the sense of self as to who I will never be, which is... It's a large category. You will never be or who you better not ever be. It's very interesting, these boundaries and the definitions and what that means. Our grasping and our attachments and our sense of security. I see in meditation as a teacher, people who are very frightened of the idea of no self. Not philosophically, most people are not frightened by philosophy. But as meditation gets deeper and quieter, many of the normal categories of self begin to dissolve. They simply don't hold up. One of the things that then looms a very large for some people is a sense of numbness. Some sense of emptiness, gap or voidness. It's very frightening for people, partly because it can be unpleasant. Being unpleasant is also nice. But it's very frightening because... Partly because there's no sense of self is not present. But if you do a little bit of probing or look more deeply, the sense of numbness, the sense of lack, of a sense of self that can sometimes arise in life or in spiritual practice, is kind of a cover sometimes for deeper emotions and feelings, which are painful and we don't necessarily want to confront or to meet. What meditation has to protect us from it is to create a curse on numbness or voidness or gap or emptiness or something. And so some people are frightened of the notion of no self because it seems to put them into that place. No self is a nihilistic teaching and it puts them in this place of that numbness, where they're afraid of, because if they hang out with them long enough, they have to be honest with what's under it. I'm going to talk about the self. Maybe this is too cute, but another definition I thought of for the self, Buddhist definition of self is, the self is wind drag. And the image perhaps is if you're riding a bicycle, if you're riding a bicycle down a hill and you kind of sit up really tall and straight, it slows you down, right? But if you kind of bend over and kind of rest on the handlebars, you kind of don't put so much resistance to the wind and you sail right along freely. Well, the self is the wind drag. When it's up, there's a lot of resistance. And without the self, we kind of scoot right along quite easily, quite freely. I think what's in... Oh, there's another thing I was thinking was this idea of having a strong sense of self, which is very important in Western psychology, and there's a lot of discussion about it. I was thinking about this today and I felt it started to feel a little bit suspicious of it. It's probably a good idea, the notion, but it's just a notion. There's a concept, and Buddhism loves concepts. It doesn't have a problem with concepts and ideas and notions. It has a problem with grasping on them and being limited by them. The Buddhist attitude towards concepts and notions and ideas is one of two things. One is pragmatic. Is it useful to have that? Does it serve some purpose? And if it doesn't, then find another one. Or another way and attitude is playfulness. You become playful with concepts, playful with roles and identities and all that. It's important to have identities and important to have roles. We can't really function well without them. But rather than being oppressed by them, by playing with them, acting with them. In tantric Buddhism, they have training in how to take on different roles. You assume that you're a divinity of wrath, or divinity of greed, or divinity of great compassion, or divinity of great this. And you're taking on these different entities and roles in order to be playful and expand your repertoire. So you're not limited and fixed in a certain way all the time. So we have this idea, concept of a strong sense of self. In thinking about it today, I thought, well, there is an example of that. If you focus on that too much, we're reinforcing our tendency to grasp and hold really tight and have a fixed sense of self. And perhaps another way of saying the same thing, maybe it's like saying the glass is half full or half empty, another way of saying the same thing, but maybe without that danger, is to say, rather than a healthy sense of self, what we need to develop is a healthy sense of relatedness, a healthy sense of relationship to ourselves and to others. So the focus is on relationship and not on this independent, autonomous, constant, permanent. And a healthy sense of relationship, in order to develop that, you need to develop a lot of the same things that you need to have a healthy sense of self. You need to understand yourself, you need to understand your reactions, your feelings, your emotions, what goes on in your body, and understanding your reactions, your responses, and understanding what's going on in the world around you, how people are reacting and responding to you, what they're doing towards you, what's their motivation, what's their intention, understanding the balance and the play between people. From that comes a healthy sense of relatedness, I believe. But the focus there is more open. So I think that's a nice, healthy sense of relatedness. And mindfulness is indispensable for that. And the last thing I'll say before I turn it over to you guys for God's sake, and for the rest of your comments, questions, is part of what a sense of self is, is perhaps the way we want to present ourselves to the world, or to ourselves, or to ourselves. Another whole way of looking at this is not so much to be concerned about who we are, according to some ideas and concepts, to find out who I am, who my true self is, as if it's a noun, a thing. But rather what we're looking for is expression. What is our deepest expression that wants to come out of us? And to focus on expression rather than on self. What is it that's here within us? What are all the voices? What are all the desires? What are all the feelings? What are the motivations? Recognize those clearly, and respond and give room to some of them, and other ones of them maybe let go of because they're not so appropriate. But what wants to be expressed? And one of the great questions to sit with when you sit in mindfulness practice is ask yourself the question, what wants to be expressed here? And then get out of the way. It's like the eye can't be in the way of itself in order to see. And if the self is a wind drag, let it be out of the way. Let the expression come out and just live actively rather than... through your ideas. That's why I did this talk without my notes. I thought if I was going to say that, I better not have any notes. One did wonder. What? One did wonder. What? No notes? So, any comments? Yes, Jonathan. You mentioned how we all have habits and certain tense, emotional tendencies and picking patterns. Aren't all those combined sort of like a fuzzy... of ourself? I mean, there's nothing in that which is, you know, myself, but isn't that generally who I am? It's what... Yeah, somehow that seems to fit is what myself is. Sure, as long as you use those adjectives, like general and fuzzy. Buddhism recognizes that there is some kind of integrity in a stream of being, a stream of self. But it's a stream of impermanent phenomena that's arising and passing. And what happens is we take certain part of that as a self and then we hold on. And it would be as if there was a stream in a river. And you pull the bucket of water out of the river and you walk around and say, I have the part of the river here. I mean, we don't talk that way. It's the water, but you don't have the river with you anymore. So the river has certain kind of integrity to it. It has the banks and the sides and the shore and depth and all that. But you can't pull certain things out of the river and say, this is the river. And perhaps our stream is a stream of becoming, a stream of expression, not a stream of reflection. As soon as there's reflection, reflection is important to do, but as soon as a reflection, reflection by nature is perhaps... ...a bucket to be the whole stream. Expression is the stream flowing. Is that why self is a bit like wind, right? Because we limit it as soon as we sort of define it. Encapsulate it. Right. And it can be frightening to kind of show up with other notes. Or just simply show up, you know, and just kind of be yourself. Yeah. So I was listening to your construction of this concept of self. Paul and Curtis, one way to describe it to yourself, is just some total of holes in one's attachments. And then, if you weren't attached, then in that sense there's a relationship to all these, right? But then in some ways I think about what we should be or what we thought to be is the problem. It's that we do get attached to all of those definitions or ideas of ourselves. Yeah. And so it's very interesting then in the... Buddhism has a teaching about self and no-self. Buddhism says categorically there is no-self, an absolute point of view. But since there is no-self, that also means there's no-self to be gotten rid of. Right? So you're not frightened by the notion of no-self because there's not something, you know, you can't find it. But it's an illusion. So we're not getting rid of something real, we're kind of letting go of an illusion. But in letting go of an illusion, we're not letting go of parts of ourselves that already exist. Right? So we have feelings, we have emotions, we have relationships, we have all those kinds of things. And those still are expressed and go on just fine. The fear people have is it becomes kind of nihilism. It's kind of regression or repression or asceticism, you're kind of denying yourself. But actually you're not to deny anything at all except what's an illusion. What's tangible, what's real in our experience, our emotions, our feelings, our emotions are taken very seriously. So the Buddhist definite, one Buddhist understanding perhaps of the problematic self is the self we're attached to. Is that what you said? Some total. Yes? Until you mentioned the expression that our intentions would be tied to ourself, that it would be part of our living, that it limit itself. Is there a problem with the importance of the intentionality in keeping it separate from ourself? I don't know if I quite followed, but our intentions can be tied to our concepts of self, our ideas, and it can be tied to deeper expressions within us. So for example, the example of the sports car. If my sense of self requires me to have a shiny car, then I might have a lot of my intentions of how I live my life. It might come from that attachment to a certain idea of self. So I might get a good job, I might get a good education, I might do many, many things, I might rob a good bank, do many things because of that intention. A lot of intentions arise in that sense of self. But if someone is hurt in front of you and needs to be cared for, there can arise the intention of them. Independent of any kind of self-concept. Or there could also arise with a sense of self-concept. And both could happen, but if it arises with a sense of self-concept, it could get them away. So try again if I didn't respond properly. Let's add probably some confusion on mine, but even if you saw someone that needed help, you would have to define that help in terms of yourself. You have to say, okay, it's me that's going to help them, and I know my limitations, I don't know, first aid, or whatever. Although we do say that to our self even. Well, yes and no. Certain things we do spontaneously. I mean, if you slip on wet water, you will try to grab the railing before you start to construct a self who's capable of grabbing the railing. Now, if you know that you're going to be in a situation where people might need CPR, you might feel, I want to respond to that and take care of that, so what does that take? Well, I better go get some CPR training. Well, that kind of thing in that sense is considered to be fairly innocuous. I mean, we can have a general sense of self. We can have kind of a vague or general or working operating idea of the self. But what we don't want to do is latch on as being, this is a permanent and absolute phenomena. It's a conditioned phenomena, it's a conditioned idea that arises, it has some validity. There is some integrity to this being here. I mean, I'm not having your thoughts sitting here. I mean, I'm mostly having my own thoughts. And so there is some integrity to this being. So there's some idea of self. And I can operate on that. I latch on to one of them as being myself that I have to protect or that I've attached to or that it's threatenable or whatever. Then I start entering into some problem. So in order to understand the Buddhist notion of self and no self, you have to also, it helps to understand what I've been mentioning the last few weeks about two levels of truth which they talk about. There's conventional truth and there's absolute truth. And from an absolute point of view, there's no self. But from a conventional point of view, there is some notion of self that we can have and see. And so we have to know how to kind of negotiate our way through the two. And having the two notions is how to become freer. So we don't get trapped by either one. And, yeah. Is it possible to also say no self is like no permanent self? I was thinking as you were giving the definitions of self, they sounded very exterior. And I was thinking in western psychological problems, people talk about the essential self or yoga talk about the essential self. And I was thinking, well, sometimes self is when you meditate on spaciousness and all of that outside stuff gets quiet for a minute. And that feels like self, but it changes from the moment on like self. It could be. It's a fine thing to decide. However, what the difficulty some people get into with that kind of definition of self is that the only quiet, pure, pristine, luminous mind is the self. And the busy mind, the active mind, our emotions, our feelings, which are more agitated and more active, our relationships with the world, all that then doesn't belong to the true essential self. And so there's a split. And so Buddhism is like that. There is a possibility. Buddhism recognizes the possibility of feeling very quiet and calm and very peaceful. But that's just another conditioned phenomena, just like anything else. So the classic exercise in Buddhism is to study very carefully anything that you label as a self to see if it's permanent. And one of the most difficult things to see as being impermanent is a kind of deep meditative experience you're talking about. Awareness or consciousness itself often is the last bastion of seeming permanence. But if you look very carefully, awareness arises and passes it in permanent. And then you say, well, I can't take even consciousness as being a self because it's not permanent. And so then you, in a sense, Buddhism affirms everything. The teaching of no self is a kind of affirmation of everything except the illusion. Yes? Is there anything in the Buddha's teaching that's akin to grace and Christianity, about transcending the self, just some help in transcending the self and getting to the state of the self? Yes. The notion does appear in Buddhism in various forms. In Theravāda in Buddhism, which we're kind of teaching in that lineage now, the experience of impermanence, when you really experience impermanence in a deep way, becomes a kind of experience of grace because you realize that there's no dissipating it or efforting or trying. There's efforting, there's effortless effort, there's efforting, there's activity, there's practice, there's feelings, there's sensations, all these things are happening, but without you being the agent. So it seems like a miracle then. And perhaps it can be called grace. But grace in the West is usually understood to be something given to you from the outside. And Buddhism doesn't want to posit that kind of duality between someone outside of you that gives you something, does it for you, and you which are going to then puppet to that, or the agent to that, you surrender some larger force like a god. It's just the Dharma is happening. And the Dharma is not dual. Does that make sense to you? So initially when we start practicing, we practice with a sense of self, that I'm the one who's doing this and I'm trying and I'm having a hard time and now it's going really well, and me and mine, it's my meditation and we get out of the way, my meditation is constant, it's always horrible, you know? My meditation is independent, I never reach it. There's all these ideas. But as the practice deepens, it's quite common then to experience, there's a feeling is that actually you're not the agent anymore. And the very idea you're the one who's doing something just gets in the way. And to really allow yourself to go deeper into the realm of trust, it feels like grace, you know? So hearing that, do you hear it? Is it grace? It's because it's so easy sometimes to hear something like a sound. There's no effort, nothing's required of us. You know, we're not trying to listen, we're not pushing it away or holding on to it or trying to define it, it just happens. Most of us don't want to recognize it as grace because that seems pretty insignificant, the sound of a motorcycle, Jesus. But that level of grace. And it's not really a matter of so much of a lot of work and effort to define that, but a lot of it has to do with just letting go and relaxing and realizing, what a wonderful amount of grace supports and upholds life all the time. I am...it makes sense to me that there is no permanent unchanging self, but I do find that I keep, whenever I hear anybody talk about it, I suppose I am very attached to the idea that there is something. There's just something there that's under all of that stuff that does change and goes up and down, and that is essentially me. So what does that provide you, in that sense? Well, it must provide me some kind of comfort because it's always very uncomfortable to hear, when I hear people talk about it. So there's maybe two possibilities. One is that sense of comfort would be there just as well without identifying it with some category, some concept, without being attached to it. That sense of comfort arises from some psychological need. And... So this is going to sum up. It's not whether we believe or not believe in a concept of self, but rather whether we're attached or not, whether we grasp or not, because grasping itself in co-suffering limits us in our life. So, thank you all very much. I hope this was enjoyable.
