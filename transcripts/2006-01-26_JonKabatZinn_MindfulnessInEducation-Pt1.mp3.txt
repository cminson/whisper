Well thank you Amy and it's a delight to be here and I want to thank the
Association for Mindfulness and Education and in particular Amy Salciman and
Gil Fronstel and the committee for inviting me here to I guess launch the
the public lecture series on the subject of mindfulness and education. So I
deeply appreciate the invitation and the privilege to be here with you tonight.
And I'm always kind of amazed when people come out to hear me talk because
much of what I talk about is nothing. I should say much ado about nothing. It's
becoming more and more and more ado about nothing only it's not quite nothing. But
so there have been various sort of representations of the title of talk
tonight. The one that I'm going with is igniting passion for inward and outward
learning and the promise of bringing mindfulness into education at all ages.
And Amy mentioned love and was intuiting that you came out here tonight
out of love to a certain degree and and and that's why the title is igniting
passion because I think that that love and learning are very intimately related
and to the degree that we can ignite passion for learning in others or keep
it alive in ourselves. To that degree we continue not only learning but growing
to a certain degree healing whatever woundings we've experienced over the
course of a lifetime or being thwarted in our original intentions or or loves.
And ultimately the potential for not only learning and growing and healing but
for something akin to transformation or transmutation which often in the fairy
tales is that moment when the frog turns into a prince or something shifts and
the and what was dross becomes gold. Well what was hidden becomes revealed
although it has been present all along. And fairy tales are really famous for
that and one of the reasons that children love them so much is that they know
in some very very intuitive way without ever us having to break the spell by
some kind of explanation that these stories are really about them. That they
are and all of the characters in these stories are really representations of
aspects of the psyche including the wicked witch and the ogre and the troll and
the princess and the king and the queen and the lake and the dwarf and every
other creature in these fairy tales are representations in some sense of the
beauty of being human and the complexity of being human and the
challenges of being human and of finding our true way. And we all I think
intuitively know that it is valuable to find the true way. Your own gold and
luminous embodied potential and it seems to me that what education is really
all about and learning it was all about is that adventure and to a large extent
in our society it's been an outwardly focused adventure. That has to do a lot
with putting things into little people so that they will accumulate more and
more and more of the right kinds of views and tools and and skills and
capacities so that they will be able to in some sense function as adults in our
society when they grow up. But you know sometimes I ask myself well wouldn't it
be nice if we grew up we who are already adults all you need to do is look at the
Congress or the White House and you know you sort of wonder when we're going to
wake up or grow up and I say that equally oriented towards the Democrats
Republicans and every other identification of a particular kind of
view because what I'm talking about is something that has more to do with
being human in its wholeness than with a particular kind of view ideology or or
a belief system. And part of the beauty of mindfulness is that it really is
empirical and is in some sense pointing towards what I consider to be the final
common pathway of what makes us human in spite of all our differences and which
tribe we belong to and all the tribal allegiances and and how arcane and fear
driven and greed driven all of our sort of interactions can be on any and every
level from the personal to the institutional. That in some as the
Dalai Lama loves to say everybody really wants to be happy everybody wants to
satisfy that deep inner yearning for wholeness even your most you know sworn
enemies really are looking for some kind of satisfaction and well-being and in
some sense even peace of mind. So the beauty of mindfulness is to me that it
in some sense delineates a final common pathway of our humanity and one that has
the potential to actually be recognized as what makes us most human or most
beautiful or most miraculous and that has to do with our capacity for paying
attention. Sometimes that paying attention comes in the form of hearing
which is quite miraculous hearing so thank you for the cell phone it would
also be nice if you now just made as many noises as possible in turning them
off just so that we could have some kind of protected time here that that is so
hard to find in the world because of all of the various kinds of interruptions
outer interruptions that happen just keep it coming shut them off and notice as
you're shutting them off how much anxiety or is there a reason you know as
you're stuck or if you have to have them on because you've got babysitter at home
put them on vibrate or if you don't know how to do that or it doesn't work
that way just leave them on and we'll deal with it but since hearing came up I
mean just the miracle of hearing we don't know actually how it happens
neurobiology of hearings not all that well worked out and we create a whole
world that of sound and yet if you start to pay attention to hearing you can
very rapidly realize that a lot of time you only hear what you want to hear you
don't hear a lot of things as anybody that you dearly love ever said to you
these words or something like it you never listen to me why do you think they
say things like that it's because even the hearing is very selective same with
seeing same with every one of the senses of which there are more than five so
this sort of universality of the sort of final common pathway of being human has
a lot to do with attending being present to the world and there are these
different aspects of the world we sort of fragmented the world into lots of
different aspects one is outer and the other is inner and my point was that a
lot of our educational system is oriented towards the outer and not so
much toward the inner and we do a lot of fragmenting in that regard how about
subject and object when you went to school yourself and you remember a loose
leaf book and you had various like colored things that separated the
different classes that you were taking and those classes were indifferent
subjects yeah and when you pay attention to something you yourself are the
subject and what you're attending to is the object of your attention so
actually when you're studying the subject it becomes an object of your
attention and if you've gone to sort of college and graduate school at a certain
point you may have picked up the idea that being objective is really good
because you get outside your own bias you know field and you can really see
things as they are because you're being objective and science reports to be you
know it cats me out when it comes to objectivity unless you know any
scientists because the thing about science is you have to bend over backwards
to be aware of your biases or you will not possibly be able to be objective
because the subject of element enters into it so much in terms of you know
what the Buddhists just bravely assert as greed hatred and ignorance you know but
that can arise even around pursuing your career getting grants being in
competition without laboratories I mean there's all sorts of subjectivity and
science and if you want to read a wonderful kind of thumbnail autobiographical
sketch of it read Jim Watson's book the double helix about the story of the
competitive discovery of the structure of the three-dimensional structure of
DNA so what I'm going to be talking about tonight has to do with weaving
inner and outer together and understanding subject and object in ways
that differentiate them and also understand the links between them okay
because very often as observers we make ourselves into the observer and then
there's the observed and what gets disregarded actually or ignored is the
observing which as I was suggesting with hearing we don't know how we do
anyway so we see but we don't know how we're seeing if you look up in the sky
I mean I use this as a common example you know or you see anything say of the
color blue there's no real blue there's just electromagnetic radiation of a
particular wavelength and frequency and our there's no blue in the eye either in
in the retina but somehow we have or build the brain builds an experience of
blue and can differentiate it from red you know and we don't know how we do
that and we actually build any experience of we're all sitting here in this room
and we're agreed we're all sitting in the same room but we're all sitting in a
slightly different room because the light coming in through the eyes and then
taking in the whole thing is different depending on where your location is in
this space and so are we sitting in the representation of the room that the
brain is putting together in the occipital cortex and associative areas or
you know how what is our relationship to the outer in terms of the inner so in
the domain of science now there is more credibility in part because of the study
of meditation in the notion that there are different ways of knowing and that
each has its own validity or field of validity and it's really important to
honor the range of them if we hope to understand the either the beauty that
this simplicity or the complexity of experience because the one thing we
really don't understand is experience itself don't know how we experience
things yet we do and and it's very profound part of being human we are not
robots we're not automatons but we often really out of touch which is another
sense okay the sense of touch if you go and look it up as I have in the Oxford
English dictionary the word touch is the longest entry in terms of mileage in
the columns of the Oxford English dictionary of any word in the English
language including love and they're like thousands of ways that you can touch
or be touched including being touched in the head or a little touch of this or a
touch of that or a touch of the flu touch is absolutely fundamental bringing the
one and the other together and and in the process you have touching so in
education it seems to me the root of that word I just asked to do with drawing
out and nurturance bringing along into sort of a more elaborate developed
dimensionality of being that of course humans are capable of if we nurture our
potential and nourish with ways of knowing facts of course skills trainings
of various kinds and I would say underneath it all
subtending it all love just what Amy started up talking about and and I don't
mean this in any kind of romantic way but I mean it in terms of like the
passion for being in touch for being in relationship in a way that is so
nurturing and so illuminating and so adventurous that it contributes to a
sense of belonging or a sense of connection a sense of inhabiting a
world that that holds us and that we belong to and that is full of interest
and that gives us the potential to feel like we are learning and that there's
an infinite amount to learn so we'll never come to the end of it which is in
itself a lot of fun growing which is itself I mean I like to quote around
this point you know around growing from the great yogi Bob Dylan who said if
you're not busy being born you're busy dying you know so growing is like the
time to grow is while you're alive don't wait till you're dead okay and why
not start like real young actually in a sense you could say we do all start real
young and then there's a certain way in which society can kill it or damn it up
at least or ignore it in certain ways and the same for healing and
transformation that it all in some sense boils down to that so how might we
ignite passion for inward and outward learning so that we don't make them into
some kind of other dichotomy or dualism but they both are part of it and as I
was saying in science this kind of third-person understanding is now being
coupled with another way of knowing which is a first-person understanding in
neuroscience for instance if you want to study the mind well it's almost
commonsensical that well you get someone and put them in the scanner and study
them usually they're undergraduates because they're cheap minds and you ask
them questions about their own inner experience in a particular moment when
you see something on the EEG or in the scanner and usually they're not real
good reporters of what they're in experience what were you feeling in
just that one I don't know they're not really trained observers of their own
experience if you take a Buddhist monk and put the Buddhist monk in the scanner
first of all you see very different patterns from an undergraduate psychology
major and when you ask them to do certain things that they claim to do they
can do them reproducibly over and over and over again and in some sense move in
and out of them at will which is like you know watching an Olympic athlete do
something that well I could do that too if only I was that person it's not like
you're it's not like your body is any different from Lance Armstrong's you've
all been on a bicycle but you aren't like Lance Armstrong because a certain
element of training determination passion will discipline and pain is
involved in reaching that kind of inhabiting of once life and body and in
the same way if you take you know people who've spent their entire lives doing
what Lance Armstrong does on a bike with their mind and you ask them what was
happening in that moment they can tell you a whole bunch of different things
that were happening in that moment because they are very very highly skilled
observers of the sensory dimension the emotional dimension the cognitive
dimension and there's and there's how can they tell you because there's another
dimension that we don't learn in school that much or that's really seems so
undervalued it's almost like camouflage you know how kids like to wear
camouflage nowadays you know stands out like a sore thong because it's not
jungle or not desert but everybody's kind of camouflage but what's most
camouflaged in our society is this capacity to know what we're knowing or
know what we're experiencing we even have a word for it and we almost never
give any credence to it as if it's worth actually noticing or exploring in its
own right the word is called awareness I often was in the habit when I was in
grade school of asking my teachers why we had to learn this whatever was I mean
I thought it was a good question why do we have to learn this and usually the
response was one variant or another of it's to help you become a critical
thinker sounded good so I've grown up to be very critical and to be completely
overwhelmed by my thinking and of course I'm you know joking about it but the
fact of the matter is that's an incredibly important mental faculty is
the faculty of learning actually how to think critically and with discernment
around abstract issues or more concrete issues we've poured so much energy and
attention the educational system into thinking and even so the results have
not been that impressive I mean it's you can read this over and over and over again
in the New York Times and other such scientific journals that that locating
the Pacific Ocean is a big challenge for a lot of adults in this country never
mind say you know I don't know Iraq we I think we have down now but but for a
long time Iraq was like you know couldn't locate it it was just an article
this week in the Times about like how most of the people teach science in the
United States in high school weren't science majors they'd never loved science
and therefore in terms of like that students that are being turned out that
love science in this country compared to in say other countries whether it's
China or Japan or France or England or Germany I mean it's it's it really
strains credulity that you know that we don't have a system that is in some sense
more motivated by love of subject that you're teaching so there seems to me
there's some big issues here one of which is and this is not I don't mean by
any strategy imagination to be critical of teachers who I think are like
basically battlefield soldiers on the front lines of you know of some kind of
warfare that's being fought out and very very under recognized and under
compensated for doing that kind of work and perhaps even under trained or not
nourished or nurtured enough to be on the front lines of this kind of thing and
we're talking about the body politic taking care of its next generation of
citizens or you could say the cells of the future cells of the body politic
because it's a regenerative regenerative organism the country
so imagine that while we're learning critical thinking we're also learning to
inhabit this other capacity that's kind of like a hidden dimension it's out there
but it's so camouflage called awareness that we never receive any training in
and almost never get any credit for it you know no gold stars for awareness and
what kind of awareness are we talking about well that's the beauty of
awareness you name it it's such a big basket it can hold anything emotional
awareness which could be inner like actually how you're feeling how about
training in learning how to have a hundred different ways to know how you're
feeling very often the women I noticed are smiling you know because compared to
I don't want to fall into stereotypes here but very often like women know how
they're feeling it in a lot of different circumstances often if you ask a man I
feel you get a couple of grunts you know I'm not happy it's not very nuanced there's
the whole spectrum here of emotions that if one brought attention to it can
actually see the landscape of like what triggered that sadness what triggered
that anger what triggered that fear how much fear actually drives our actions
even our learning actions are often driven by fear so what if there was a
certain kind of training in awareness or attention that sort of balanced out the
training in cognition or thinking so that one could sort of expand the field
of understanding of various phenomena and relate them to one's own inner
experience a lot of this has to do and and I've started to use the term
awareness sing so that we don't have to fall into on now I'm getting into
awareness you know or awareness of what but simply awareness sing so you don't
have subject or object and that's one of the beauties of the present
participants is that instead of like I am breathing you can just have breathing
why should you claim that you're breathing if it were up to you you would
have forgotten and be dead a long time I'm breathing nonsense so from the point
of view of language for instance which is very important this kind of thing if
you want to ignite passion in anything part of it is I gotta be verbal I mean
we've got to be able to relate to whoever it is that we're teaching in a way
that will like make sense and wake them up and open the space so that it's not
like just imposing particular kind of knowledge based on them but actually
drawing it out what do you see what do you feel what do you notice when we set
a situation up this way or that way or some other way and turn it into like an
adventure I know teachers who actually do this in the classroom and at any age I
mean students like all of a sudden there's some things on the website of the
association mindful education I pulled some of them off and preparing for this
talk one of which was a chapter my wife my wife and I wrote in a book on
mindful parenting about education in the classroom and I thought I'd just
actually read you a little bit of it because it speaks to just that I mean
that kids actually love to pay attention to their own interior experience
especially if they given tools for doing it so there's not just I mean there's
plenty of talk in public school I went to public school in New York City and I
got yelled at a lot to pay attention but that doesn't actually ignite passion
for paying attention and in a sense you could say I was paying attention it was
just like maybe the tree outside the window was more interesting than what
was going on on the blackboard and you have to be careful about that kind of
thing so I worked for a time it was contacted by a teacher in the public
schools in South Jordan Utah which is a suburb of Salt Lake City so this is like
a 95 percent Mormon community and she had taken a mindfulness-based stress
reduction program which is the kind of work that Amy was talking about that
we've been doing now for 27 years at the in mind-body medicine or now
sometimes people call it integrated medicine at the University of Massachusetts
Medical School okay and this teacher actually went through that stress
reduction program and she felt it was so valuable to her that she wanted to
bring it to her kids and it's all based I I guess you could say I sometimes do
sometimes just to provoke people on Buddhist meditation without the
Buddhism okay it's not true really because I don't want to get into a long
thing about this but Buddhist meditation is about without the Buddhism
it's it's about being human and about not knowing what that is and learning how
to be comfortable not knowing which of course any scientist knows that how
important it is to be aware not only of what you know which can be very
oppressive because it can take you so far but then you have to in some sense
be comfortable with the not knowing in order for something to reveal itself to
open to have an insight of some kind or another you've got that at certain point
let go of all the thought they got you up to a certain place and then just be in
the discomfort of like what could this possibly mean and not know and then very
often something emerges an insight and then you say I didn't I see that before
or someone else will have the insight then you'll really say why didn't I see
that so she started bringing oh so she said to me I'm gonna I'm going to
bring this into my classroom and I said are you kidding you'll get lynched I
mean the school is 95 percent Mormon and you are going to bring what they will
see as Buddhist meditation into your classroom and you're gonna be in deep
doo-doo the parents are gonna you know really think you're just kind of
indoctrinating them in some other religion so here's a take-home lesson
like any good student she didn't listen to the teacher she just did it and she
is an absolute genius and she figured out ways to bring mindfulness into every
aspect of the curriculum I'll show you some pictures I have a few PowerPoint
slides of it and I'll show you some of them in a bit but so she just wove this
into every aspect of the curriculum she went to the Utah Board of Education and
where it talked about what public education was supposed to be and sure
enough it said there are four components to public education in Utah
cognitive somatic intuitive and emotional and she said what I've never
seen anything having to do with intuitive emotional or somatic so
cognitive so she took that as license to actually get people to develop how by
paying attention through experience simple and through paying attention to
become aware of aspects of experience like how your body's feeling in this
moment when some little fight unfolds in the classroom for instance how can we
just drop into awareness for a moment and start so start practicing dropping
into awareness what's the best way to drop into awareness close your mouth for
a moment let's just be silent with the feeling in the room now people you know
are okay with this if it doesn't go on too long if it goes on too long it's like
hey wait a minute he must have forgotten he's giving a talk it said that one of
the best talks the Buddha gave was sitting up on the platform an hour goes
by nothing has a 10,000 people out there he talked yesterday talked the day
before he scheduled to give another talk tomorrow and today he's like sitting
up there two hours go by three hours go by finally holds up a flower you know
there's a kind of flowers on the stage he holds up a flower it said 9,999 blank
stairs and one smile and that smile is said to be the the moment of the first
transmission of I don't even know what word to put on it usually the word Zen
is put on it okay but Zen is just the word if you're taking it seriously if
you're stuck in I wonder what he means it's a nice flower but we came here for
a talk we paid good money for this talk or whatever it is you know thinking
thinking thinking you know lots of thoughts that start judging it and your
body's hurting after three hours of sitting waiting for the guy to talk
he holds up a flower but one person like was like in the present moment didn't
say so it seems to me this is what we want in the classroom I don't care if
we're talking kindergarten or we're talking graduate school it's like hello are
we even here let's practice actually being here how dropping into silence
this stillness if it feels weird that's okay because it doesn't have to feel a
certain way yeah let us let's when we talk about it say yeah that felt really
weird okay so now let's just be weird let's see how weird is and then all of a
sudden you cultivate what we're talking about is cultivating intimacy with
ourselves that's the actual vocabulary that they were using in this you know
fifth and sixth graders in Utah so at a certain point they sent me a bunch of
letters about what mindfulness what their stress reduction course meant to
them and so forth and I went out there met with the parents and the teachers
and and and I asked a bunch of the her colleagues of Cherry Hamrick's colleagues
that write to me and tell me what they were seeing in her classroom so this is
one of those a teacher in the school wrote describing his experience of
sharing an open classroom with Ms. Hamrick quote the attitude and climate in
her classroom was very impressive especially as I had not here too for
experienced anything like it I came away I became aware of certain vocabulary
she used to describe things she referred to what she was trying to attain as a
functional classroom I noticed a peaceful atmosphere in her classroom with
the students cooperating and discussing their work together talking was
encouraged but only work-related talking and feeling talk was allowed there was
genuine interest and concern among the students and the teacher they practiced
talking about feelings and processing them on a daily basis I noticed the
students grow in their self-esteem in their regard for human life as well as
all life in general the students seem genuinely happier and more content in
the classroom setting than I'd ever observed or experienced myself they
expressed their love with appropriate touching hugs and parenthesis and they
knew how to resolve conflicts and problem-solving in a loving caring
fashion rather than in the hostile or abusive fashion Ms. Hamrick also put
the students had a focus and how to get in touch with their own breathing and
how to control their lives their own lives with that technique this is his
view of it we tend not to use the word control they seem to be able to work
better during the day after a few moments of meditative preparation in the
morning have them sit every morning and every day I brought some bells if we do
any more sitting but I gave her a set of these bells I've given them to all our
kids teachers it's amazing what happens when you say ring these in a noisy
classroom you know in elementary school or even in junior high school or high
school do you now often teachers yell and scream at the class to be quiet
imagine and you learn to drop into hearing so every day somebody would get
the bells and it would be their turn to ring the bells and decide how long they
were going to sit and they guide the meditation sometimes pointing towards
deepening stillness or they just sit in stillness they can't go more than 10
minutes so he's saying here that they seem to be more able be able to work
better during the day after a few moments of meditative preparation in
morning we taught in an open classroom situation and their ability to focus and
not be distracted by all the noise and that type of environment is a tribute to
her application of training and drive I mean it was quite extraordinary I
remember in particular one boy who was described to me as the most hated kid in
the school because he was like very severely ADHD and just bouncing off the
walls and a big problem in the classroom and I could only come on a Saturday one
day I came they had school on a Saturday and they invited the parents and this
boy guided the sitting meditation with his mother sitting right next to me I
got to talk with her afterwards and he he sat for 10 minutes and guided this
sitting meditation he sat and he went from being the most hated kid in the
school to being just a regular kid it's just interesting all he was being
trained in is how to drop in on himself and to honor interior experience so in
science what I was saying was that if you wanted to study somebody's mind up
until recently you'd or somebody's brain you'd mind you'd study somebody else's
mind but what about studying your own mind what about including the subject of
experience and not having it have such a bad reputation like oh subjective so
biased but is there a way to be actually objective or less biased about
subjective experience and there is and it's only thousands and thousands of
years old and it's called meditation but it doesn't come with of course it comes
with lots of baggage and lots of different packages but the beauty of
mindful
