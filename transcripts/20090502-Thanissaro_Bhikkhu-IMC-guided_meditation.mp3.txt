The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I thought we'd start with a brief meditation.
Goodwill is a wish for true happiness.
Because it's true, it has to come from within, which means that your true happiness doesn't have to conflict with anyone else's true happiness.
So when you tell yourself, may I find true happiness, it's not a selfish thought.
It's a desire to look inside and to develop the resources you have here.
So they can lead you to true happiness.
And as it turns out, the more you develop those resources, the more you have to offer to other people as well.
So you want to turn those thoughts to other people now.
Think first of people who are close to your heart.
Your family, your very close friends, may they find true happiness too.
And then spread those thoughts out in ever-widening circles.
People you know well and like.
People you like even though you don't know them so well.
People you're more neutral about.
People for whom you have conflicted feelings.
People you're more neutral about.
People for whom you have conflicted feelings.
And people you don't like.
Remind yourself that the world would be a much better place if all of us could find true happiness inside.
And then if you place limitations on your good will, you're placing limitations on your own mind.
And spread thoughts of good will to people you don't even know.
And not just people living beings of all kinds.
East, west, north, south, above and below, out to infinity.
May we all find true happiness in our hearts.
Now bring your attention back to the breath.
Make a survey of the body to see where the sensation of breathing is most prominent.
Where you can see most clearly that now the breath is coming in, now the breath is going out.
Focus your attention there and allow the breathing to be comfortable.
Try not to squeeze it too much or push it too much.
Just ask yourself what rhythm of breathing would feel good right now.
If the body doesn't seem to respond to that question, you can experiment.
Try breathing a little bit longer for a while.
See how that feels.
Then a little bit shorter.
See how that feels.
Try deeper breathing, more shallow breathing, heavier or lighter, faster or slower.
Then you see which rhythm and texture of breathing feels best for you.
When you've found something you like, stick with it for as long as it stays pleasant.
After a while, the body may tire of that particular rhythm, so change it again.
Keep up with the needs of the body.
So that the breathing is a really pleasurable experience.
It feels nourishing, it feels refreshing.
Relaxing if you're tense, energizing if you're feeling tired.
Try to stay with the breath as continuously as possible.
If you find yourself slipping off, just come right back.
Slip off again, come back again.
Each time you come back, give yourself a little reward.
What would be one really good breath right now?
Now as the breath gets more comfortable, you can move to the next step, which is to start exploring how the process of breathing feels in different parts of the body.
A good place to start is down around the navel.
Notice that part of the body in your awareness, and watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out.
If you feel any tension or tightness there, any sense of blockage, think of it dissolving away.
So that no new tension builds up as you breathe in, and you don't hold on to any tension as you breathe out.
Now as the breath gets more comfortable, you can move to the next step, which is to start exploring how the process of breathing feels in different parts of the body.
Move your tension over to the right, the lower right hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same three steps there.
In other words, one, locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Two, watch it for a while all the way through the in-breath, all the way through the out.
And then three, if you notice any sense of tension or tightness or blockage there, think of it dissolving away.
If you want, you can think of the breath energy coming in out of the body right there.
So you don't have to pull it from anywhere else.
Then move your tension to the left, the lower left hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same three steps there.
Then move your tension to the left, the lower left hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same three steps there.
Now come up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach, and follow the same steps there.
Then move your tension to the left, the lower left hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same steps there.
Then move your tension to the left, the lower left hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same steps there.
To bring your tension to the middle of the chest.
Then move your tension to the left, the lower left hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same steps there.
Then move your tension to the left, the lower left hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same steps there.
Then move your tension to the middle of the chest, and follow the same steps there.
And now up to the throat.
Then move your tension to the left, the lower left hand corner of the abdomen, and follow the same steps there.
And then to the middle of the head.
Be very careful as you focus here, because the head gets a lot of pressure.
To try to be very gentle but steady in your focus, think of the breath energy coming in and out, not only through the nose, but also through the eyes, the ears, and from the back of the head down from the top of the head, very gently ventilating the whole head.
And dissolving away any patterns of tension or tightness in the face, in the jaws, around the eyes, and the temples.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
Now focus your tension in the back of the neck, and think of the breath going down the spine as you breathe in, from the back.
This may seem counterintuitive, but it's a good way of working through any tension that tends to build up there in tension central, back of the neck and the shoulders.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
Now move your tension down to the base of the spine.
And as you breathe in, think of the breath energy coming in there and going down both legs and out the toes during the in-breath.
In other words, open up all the channels down through your feet.
And then to the middle of the head.
Now return your tension to the back of the neck, and this time as you breathe in, think of the energy going down the shoulders, out the arms.
And out through the fingers. Again, during the in-breath.
So all the channels down through your fingers feel open.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And now return to whichever those focal points seem most congenial.
Allow your awareness to settle there, and then think of it spreading out from that point to fill the whole body.
So you're aware of the whole body breathing in together, the whole body breathing out together.
And try to maintain that centered but broad awareness.
It will have a tendency to shrink, so keep reminding yourself every time you breathe in, whole body breathing together.
Every time you breathe out, the whole body breathing together.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
And then to the middle of the head.
All our companions are birth, aging, illness and death.
May we all find peace and well-being in our hearts.
