The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So this morning I'm continuing on the topic of oneself,
that each person is the person responsible for their own practice.
The Buddha said, I only point the way.
It's up to you to make the effort.
And our agency, our involvement, our engagement with practice
is an important part of an ingredient in walking the path of liberation.
And classically, I think the path was, back in the ancient world,
it was a path you walk on, which means we bring all of ourselves to the path.
And so one of the important ways that we bring ourselves is to know ourselves,
is to meet ourselves, and the way of meeting ourselves, the way of knowing ourselves,
needs to be done with care.
And I love the idea of hospitality.
I think I talked about it yesterday, that when we offer hospitality, it's an offering, it's a gift.
It's something we have agency in our doing.
You don't just sit, stay in bed all day and play host to the people in your house.
You're engaged in caring for them, serving them, whatever it takes when you're the host.
And there's also a kind of putting aside of our own desires for ourselves,
not completely, but there is a deference, or there is a letting go of self-concern to a healthy degree
in being a host for other people that they're very different if you're living alone
and you just can do whatever you want, and you don't have to take anybody else into account.
So to be a host for oneself, the host within the host is saying in Zen,
to be a host, to create a hospitable environment for oneself.
So for to do that, we have agency.
We have to engage in some way.
And one of the ways we have to engage is to show up, to be present.
And the other is that we also have to get out of the way.
Our selfishness has no place when we're being a host for ourselves.
If we're caught up in our desires and our wishes are passed in the future,
so we can't really offer this hospitality to ourselves, then there's no practice.
We get lost in that world.
But to have hospitality towards oneself is a kind of letting go of self-concern,
self-preoccupation in order to meet what's here, to be the host for what's here.
And one of the crucial things that we're trying to be a host for is to understand ourselves,
to have self-understanding.
But to have the discovery of ourselves, the understanding of ourselves,
come from this possibility where we're also learning to let go of selfishness in the process.
To be selfish, you can't really be a host.
And so self-understanding is aided by things like meditation,
by things like mindfulness, where we're awakening our capacity to be attentive
to what's happening within us, what's happening here.
Of course, it's not limited to ourselves, but this is kind of the seat,
the beginning place, oftentimes in meditation and in Buddhism, is to understand oneself.
And what are we understanding when we understand ourselves?
We're understanding things that are unique to ourselves, that we are contributing to our lives.
We're doing that are healthy and things that are unhealthy.
We begin seeing how much we're distracted.
And all distractions involve some degree of attachment.
And so if we can become, have understanding about how attachment works
and recognize it when it's there, then we play host to that.
What happens to our involvement with attachment?
Chances are if part of who we are is the host, that part is not involved with the attachment.
And there starts to be space for the attachment.
There starts to be some degree of non-involvement with it,
some degree of clarity and seeing it for what it is.
And perhaps some idea that, you know, I don't believe in the attachment anymore.
This is not where I want to be. It's not where I want to put my life energy into these attachments.
And that's not a critique of them. It's not an aversion to them.
But it's a wisdom that comes from self-understanding.
Well, this is not where I want to be.
And so there's, but I'm the host.
So there's more opening up, more kind of letting go.
And to the degree to which attachment is closely connected to selfishness,
self-preoccupation and self-centeredness,
they, as we let go of attachment, selfishness and self-centeredness fall away.
And paradoxically, we become more self-aware but less self-centered,
more self-aware but less bounded by definitions of who we are,
trying to prove who we are or hold on to who we are.
And so we begin looking, self-understanding, turning inward and understanding.
How does desires work for us? When am I caught up in desires?
How do aversions work for me?
And then to understand that, how do I caught in the grip of those?
Do I spend a lot of time in stories?
Do I live my life in stories? Do I live my life in opinions?
In what's right and wrong? Do I live my life in judgments?
And to really see this in self-understanding leads to wisdom.
And one of the, maybe a little bit unfortunate aspects of all this
is that wisdom comes from familiarity.
That a lot of the wisdoms we see over and over and over again.
We sit down to meditate, be mindful in our life,
and we see over and over again, oh, there's the desire.
Wow, I had no idea I was living in stories all this time.
I had no idea that I was, I'm so judgmental.
I'm judging every little thing that goes on.
I had no idea that I'm living in planning mind all the time.
I had no idea that I'm so self-referential in my thinking.
And by seeing that over and over and over again,
something begins to shift.
We tend not to be mesmerized or enchanted with those thoughts and those activities.
We start having wisdom about, this is not the place to live.
I'm not wisdom about not being committed to it,
not being so interested in it anymore.
The wisdom that lets us see it clearly and know an alternative.
An alternative that I'm suggesting today is to be the host,
to be hospitable, have hospitality for the stranger.
So even this part is strange about you.
Maybe your selfishness, maybe your attachments,
maybe your story-making, your opinions, your self-righteousness,
your fears, and also what's beautiful about yourself.
Here, let's hold that in a hospitable way.
Not to condone it, not to accept it in some way like,
oh, this is good and I have to just let it be,
but a kind of way to space and open up.
So it's kind of like a stranger who comes into your home
in a cold rainy day and shivering and has no attention to you
and is self-concerned with her cold and their wetness.
And as the host, you put them by the fire,
you give them a warm blanket, you bring them warm tea.
And the stranger begins to relax and warm up.
And it turns out that as they relax more,
that the stranger becomes a wonderful person.
So the same way with what's difficult and challenging within ourselves,
just to know it, to have the self-understanding, or there it is,
and to have the self-understanding to know how to be the host
and how to hold it, not exactly in acceptance,
but with hospitality, without conflict,
so that it can relax.
And perhaps all attachments,
all selfishness, self-centeredness,
all greed and hatred,
is just a stranger that needs the chance to relax,
to warm up, and to thaw.
And some of these things, when they relax and thaw,
turn into something else, something that may be a surprise.
So an important part of this Buddhist practice of ours
is self-understanding.
And so yesterday the topic was self-respect.
And so to always meet ourselves with respect,
always to cultivate respect.
And part of cultivating respect is cultivating.
And to be able to be a host, to be able to have hospitality,
to be able to prioritize self-understanding
over self-preoccupation,
over spinning along with our attachments,
is in gender's respect,
oh, I can see, I can understand.
I can be the host here.
And so as we have more respect,
we can have more capacity to look at ourselves,
to be present, to understand, to be the host.
That makes more respect,
which supports more this capacity to be present,
be here, and be fully here
in a way that allows for greater understanding.
And at some point this grows
so that there is self-understanding,
the self-partful's away.
And we just live mindful and aware
with awareness and understanding available
wherever it's needed, whether it's within or without.
So self-understanding.
So you are definitely worthy of hospitality.
You're definitely worthy of understanding
and seeing and knowing.
And to do it in as simple as possible way,
maybe without analysis and a lot of thinking,
a lot of thinking about yourself is more attachment.
So what we're talking about here
is not thinking about ourselves,
but really almost like a silent presence
that sees and recognizes,
oh, that's what's happening.
I'm thinking a lot.
And then we're host to that
so we can read something about the thinking mind,
can relax and settle.
So thank you.
And I look forward to sitting again tomorrow
in silence with all of you
and continuing on this topic.
