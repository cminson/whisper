Dharmette : Generosity  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I want  to talk about generosity. There is a Zen story 
from China of a student who asks his teacher “What is 
the gateway of Zen?”  The teacher says “ Generosity.” I 
like this so much because  a gate is a gate into 
something and out of something. The gate of Zen or 
Buddhism being generosity means that the gate into 
Buddhist practice is generosity as well as the  gate out of 
it, or the  expression , or conseq uence of it. Generosity  is 
such a beautiful aspect of practice. It supports practice . 
Classically in Buddhism , there’s an understanding that 
generosity lies at the foundation of all of Buddhist 
practice. It’s one of the first virtues that’s taught to 
peopl e, and in which they train . Generosity is also the 
natural express ion of the awakened heart  – of someone 
who is awakened . As people become  freer, they also 
become less greedy , more open , and their natural 
expression is to be generous. As people mature in 
practice , there’s a gradual unfolding from generosity 
being a practice  to generosity being an expression. In 
different phases of a person’s life , different parts  of this 
spectrum take prominence.  
 Sometimes  it’s useful to see generosity as a practice . 
It’s a min dfulness practice. It’s a heart -opening practice. 
It’s also a practice that establishes our relationship to 
other people. In that generosity is understood to be the 
foundation of Buddhist practice , it’s useful to think of 
that foundation as creating healthy relationships with 
other s. Sometimes when people start Buddhism through 
meditation practice , they forget about the relational part 
because they close their eyes and it’s all about 
them selves . But if you start with generosity as y our 
foundation , then you start creating this strong 
understanding that you do your practice in relationship 
to other people.  
 
So generosity creates a  lot of mindfulness. It creates 
healthy relationships. It opens the heart . It also teaches 
you a lot about yourself because sometimes it’s not 
easy to be generous. When you take on generosity as a 
practice , it means that you are beginning to explore 
when to be generous when you might not want to be. It 
might occur to you to be generous , but something inside 
of you resists it out of fear, or a sense of lack  or 
scarcity,  or various other things . While  you may h ave an 
impulse to do something nice for someone , you may 
think , “No, I can’t do that .” “I can’t do that for a stranger .” 
“If I do th at, something will happen .” Or “I need that 
thing for myself.”  
 A lot of attitudes, feelings or attachments come into play 
when we stretch ourselves to act more often on the 
impulse to be generous , or to be generous in situations 
where we  normally wouldn’ t be. You don’t act out of  a 
sense of duty, but because you’re interested in 
understanding yourself better , and finding how to stretch 
your heart  and your generosity in some new way. A very 
important part of the practice of generosity is what  it 
teaches us about ourselves . When we do it that way , it 
is very important that we don’t beat ourselves up over 
what we learn about ourselves. We don’t say, “How 
terrible I am that I’m not generous,” but instead use 
what we learn as a way to stretch , to be challenge d, to 
open up , and  to establish better relationships to the 
world around us. 
 
Many years ago I read a beautiful story about  a tribe in 
the mountains of the Philippines  who didn’t have much 
contact with the modern world. Dreams were a big part 
of this culture. Every morning they would tell their family 
about their dreams. It was the practice  of this society 
that if someone they kne w came in a dream and was 
scary, or angry , or was part of a difficult relationship , 
then when  they woke up the next day , they would bring 
a gift to that person. Ther e is something very significant  
symbolically and interpersonally about bringing gifts to 
people with whom the unconscious psyche has some 
difficulty , or who represent some difficulty i n the mind 
even if there is no real difficulty in life. It isn’t for their benefit that you’re giving the gift , but it’s for your benefit 
because the unconscious works sometimes in these 
symbolic ways , and giving a gift makes a difference.  
 
As we practice  generosity , one of the guidelines that is 
really helpful is to give in such a way that you feel lighter 
and happier. Don’t give in such a way that you feel 
burdened and depressed – if you give that way , then it 
is not really generosity. The practice in Bu ddhism is to 
cultivate generosity , not the capacity to give. There are 
phenomenally wealthy people  who can give quite freely , 
but it doesn’t mean that they’re  being generous. 
Generosity involves a spir it of openness  and caring for 
someone. It’s delight in the idea of supporting someone, 
or doing something for someone , or bringing joy to 
someone . So part  of the practice of generosity is to 
search for the joy  and lightness that comes from it.  
 
If there’s  no delight or joy, you should be happy that  you 
feel burdened by it because this gives you a chance to 
turn your attention to understand ing what’s going on 
that you feel burdened. What are the limitations ? What’s 
going on? Try to understand yourself better. Are there 
genuine ways that you can do it  so that it brings joy and 
happiness?  As this continues , hopefully you will find 
yourself being more generous, less greedy  and clinging 
to things,  and more able to let go of things in a beautiful 
way. Generally you’re generous in situations where it’s 
not expected that you should give anything , but it occurs to you to give . If it’s expected , I don’t know if it could 
really be generous.  
 
With time, your motivation of generosity becomes 
stronger and with that comes the capacity to let go. The 
Pali word  for generosity is cāga  and it  has two 
meanings. Sometimes it’s translated into English as 
generosity, and sometimes it’s translated as letting go 
or renunciation. Some people feel concerned that the 
word for g enerosity also means letting go or 
relinquishment. The idea is that you’re generously or 
happily relinquishing  or giving away something you’re 
not expected or obligated to give. You’re open -handedly 
passing it on as opposed to holding on tight. The joy of 
generosity has a lot to do with feeling the joy of that 
open -handed releasing of giving. That relinquishment  or 
open -handed giving away is c losely connected to 
liberation and awakening, because liberation or 
awakening in Buddhism is the letting go of the clinging, 
limitations  and constriction in which we’re living. 
Generosity  is the movement away from that to open ing 
up. 
 
The flip side of generosity is that  we can also be the 
recipients of generosity . It’s a beauti ful thing to be 
graciously and openly willing  to receive someone else’s 
generosity o r goodwill gifts . When you realize how 
beautiful it is to be generous , you w ould never want to 
reject someone’s generosity. You are  giving  them a gift by allow ing yourself to be the recipient. If you say , “No, 
I’m not worthy ; don’t do that ;” or “I’m afraid  that now I’m 
going to be obligated to you ,” then you actually interrupt 
that flow of beauty in them.  
 
So part of being generous is to also be willing to receive 
generosity. As we feel more receptive and open, we 
perhaps become aware that there are many m ore gifts 
in our life  than we’re aware of . I got a lesson from this 
when I read something by Thomas Merton , a Catholic 
monk. When he wrote about Buddhism he said, “The 
open begging bowl of the Buddhist monk and nun is 
symbolic of being open to the gifts of the world.” 
Because a when a monastic go es out into the world with 
an open begging bowl, they don’t ask a nd they don’t 
pick and choose what gets put in their bowl. They just 
go out , available to the gifts that come their way. For 
Thomas Merton  that was symbolic of just  being open, 
receptive and available to a ll the gifts that are coming 
into our lives all the  time. I think that as people develop 
in practice, and relax and become more present , it 
seems really amazing how much is here to support their 
life, and how many gifts are here all the time.  
 
So the gate of Zen is generosity. We go in;  we go out ; 
and in that gate we receive.  Who knows what will come 
in through your gate of generosity if you’re open and 
present in this wonderful world of ours?  Those are my 
thoughts on generosity.   
May you experiment a bit with generosity. There’s a 
wonderful practice to do . Take not a lot of cash , but a 
significant amount. When I first heard about this 
practice, the suggestion was $20. During the week that 
you carry this $20 in your pocket , figure out some one to 
whom you’d like to give it in a way in which you’re 
offering it  generously. See what happens as you do this  
exercise.
