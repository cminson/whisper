 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Welcome everyone. Good day. And I appreciate us coming together to meditate and hope that our meditation together is useful for each of you and helpful. So the next step of satipatthana is relaxing the body. And there's this dynamic relationship between energy and engagement in the practice and being relaxed. I've seen photographs of bare-chested babies who are sitting upright on the floor. And it's so clear while seeing their musculature of their torso that they're completely relaxed. And also they're completely upright and alert, looking around, studying the environment. And over years then, what happens to that relaxed body is that the fears, the desires, all the constructions of the mind, the activities of the mind, the way we engage other people. Slowly the musculatures of our body tense up and stay tense, stay held tight. And at this stage of satipatthana is to relax the body, relax the constructed body, that body that has been constructed over years and decades with tension that's holding patterns that are kind of become chronic maybe, or maybe those that are new today. And it can be easy to dismiss the importance of relaxation, if that's what we think, that's all meditation is. But we should be very careful not to do that because relaxation is of the body, relaxation of the mind, partakes of or has qualities or is a beginning step in liberation, in a deep spiritual freedom that is a kind of relaxation, but qualitatively it's dramatically different. But with relaxation, even the simplest relaxation, if you linger a little bit as you relax, in the feelings of it, the sense of it, because in there somehow subtly, there will be little qualities of release, little qualities of lightness, of openness, of a little bit freedom perhaps from the holding that was there before. And to have a little sense of that, a feel for that, becomes kind of like a guiding light, becomes kind of a, it's a door, it's a path forward in the practice, oh this is the direction to go into this feeling, into this way of being. So relaxation. So assuming in this dynamic relationship between engagement and relaxation, take a posture that feels both alert, alive, little bit like there's some intentionality in being here. If you are laying down to do this, you might, the intentionality, the engagement might be in having your forearm, your elbows on the surface that you're there, but that your forearm is pointing perpendicular to the surface, straight up to the ceiling. And that gives a little bit of dynamism. And then to gently close your eyes. And again, adjust your posture a little bit more, kind of feeling it from the inside. And that's a cross-legged meditation posture sitting upright, is one of the postures where the body can relax deeply. Taking a few long, slow, deep breaths, pausing at the top of the in-breath for a second or so. Pausing at the end of the out-breath for a second or so. And that pause can evoke a greater sense of intentionality, to really be here with the breathing, appreciate it. Letting your breathing return to normal. And then to begin relaxing, to relax the muscles of your face. And if you're able to do that, let your attention linger a little bit to feel what it's like to have that relaxation. The goodness of it, the pleasure of it, the relief of it. Relaxing around the eyes. Relaxing the jaws, maybe by parting your teeth a little bit so that lips are very lightly touching. And to relax the shoulders on the exhale. And if the shoulders don't relax, it's okay. But maybe there's a sense of softening that can happen. A feeling of spaciousness for whatever is in the shoulders. Perhaps softening in the belly. Relaxing. And even if the belly is tense in some way, there's a kind of a pull and pull between tension and relaxation. See if you can notice whatever subtle goodness, rightness, pleasure that comes from the relaxing part. On the exhale, relaxing the hands and the arms. On the exhale, relaxing the legs, the thighs. And on the exhale, relaxing the whole body. Maybe the whole body has a subtle way it's bracing itself against life. Whatever tightening up in order to do or engage. Softening, release, relief that comes. On the exhale, relaxing whatever tightness there is in the mind. Relaxing. And then becoming aware of your breathing more fully. And as you feel your breathing, feel your whole body as if the breathing is at the center of it. And as you breathe in, the awareness spreads throughout the body. And as you breathe out, the awareness returns back to the center of breathing. And then as you breathe out, the awareness returns back to the center of the body. And then as you breathe, also relax the body as you inhale. Relax it as you exhale. For some people, it's easier to relax on the inhale, for some on the exhale. Allowing yourself sometimes to feel the whole body as you breathe. And sometimes to relax as you breathe. Relaxing the body. And as you relax, take some time to feel whatever the rightness, the goodness is of relaxing, the relief, the relief. Take it in. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Breathing in and feeling yourself deeply inside. Feel the depth of yourself the best you can. Breathing out, feeling the depth deep down in your core. And as you breathe, relax in that core. Soften. Release whatever you're holding on to. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. And we're more likely to be sensitive to our own caring emotions. To our innate capacity for generosity. For kindness. For love, compassion. And to see that relaxation makes room for some of the best qualities that we have. As a deeper sensitivity. And so at the end of a meditation session, to touch into or to make room for that deeper sensitivity. To give it expression so that it can live more fully and be recognized more fully in us. May whatever capacity we have. For friendliness and care and kindness. May it come forth in these words. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free of suffering. May all beings be free of suffering.
