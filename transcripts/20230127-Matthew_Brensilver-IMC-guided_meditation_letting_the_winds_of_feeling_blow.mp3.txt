 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Yeah, nice to see the names streaming. I'll put it over there in the chat. Very sweet. Okay. Well, that's it. Very gently put your heart into a kind of Dharma posture. No way in yoga, doing a pose, asana, very deliberate about how we get into that pose. Same thing with a kind of Dharma pose of our heart, just get lined up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Dharma path is one of becoming progressively sensitized to goodness, being moved by it, being moved by your own goodness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For whatever reason, we find ourselves in this lineage of wisdom, love, love, and so many ways for human life to unfold, so many ways to suffer, so few ways to be free, but wisdom and love, that actually is a path. Some hope and wisdom and love. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our techniques, the ways we march all attention, kind of efforts we make, are infused, seasoned with the felt sense of presence, love. Meditative techniques can be recapitulation of our anxiety, vigilance, our self-correction. And we let the mind marinate in images, signs of wisdom, love. And maybe then we use our attention in particular ways. Often useful to connect with the affective circuits of your body, the surges of feeling, of emotion, of impulse, of motivation. The building blocks, of the moving towards and moving away, that characterizes so much of our life. And we let the mind marinate in our self-correction. And we let the mind marinate in our self-correction. And we let the mind marinate in our self-correction. And we let the mind marinate in our self-correction. Equanimity with feeling. Not so intimately tied up with our freedom. It's feeling that tangles us up with phenomena. It's the fuel of the push and pull of aversion, grasping. It's feeling that makes experience feel dense, a burden on the heart. So we practice letting the winds of feeling blow through us, trusting that nothing will be blown over. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the surges of feeling seem to beg us to think, to place the feeling in the context of what we want, what we don't want to tell story about this moment, about this life. Very innocent impulse. But sometimes we experiment in meditation with not making anything mean anything. Not over-interpreting phenomena, the push and pull. In other words, we start to trust awareness, trust the logic of the Dharma. Thank you. Thank you. you you you you you you you you you our understanding comes less from seeking answers more from surrendering surrendering to not knowing surrendering surrendering the stories we use to grapple with the intensity of the moment all the ways we cope with feeling by thinking no no... and relax As faith, Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha
