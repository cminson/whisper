 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. All right, everyone. So hello, hello, and welcome to happy hour. Lovely to be with you, to see you, to feel you. Whether you're joining in real time on Zoom or YouTube, or you will be listening later, joining the Sangha later on audio dharma or on YouTube. So, so for for today's practice, to bring up the theme of transitions, it seems like with with those of us will either in northern or southern hemisphere if you're in the northern hemisphere. The fall is coming and the colors on the trees in California we're finally having rain. Yay. There's a transition. There's a transition in the air. And if you're in southern hemisphere, like Mari Christine or dear Sangha member. Different transitions. Yes, spring. Spring is springing right now. I trust and and so the sense of transitions of transitions and and transitions. Change. Change is a part of life is a part of life. We know this. Of course, we know this. Change happens and yet, how do we feel? How do we approach change? How do we hold change as it arises for ourselves, for others? And can we bring both metta to the wisdom of being with change? Can we be. Can we bring equanimity? Can we bring a sense of care, warm heartedness, friendliness to change and again change somehow the word change sometimes brings up this sense of fear like oh change goodness change or as sometimes changes. Positive change is good. Change is yay rain. So change, change. How do we so so the invitation tonight in our practice would be to open our hearts and our senses. Can we be with with change whatever you know the waves of the ocean will always be here. Can we be with them. Can we serve them with with warm heartedness with metta with equanimity, which is one of the four Brahma viharas, one of the four heavenly the boats. So, so transitions change however they're showing up for us. And drinking more awareness. Yeah, that is basically the theme. And we will explore it more in our. Yeah, in our practice tonight. So let's, let's check it out. Let's try. Let's start. Let's start by sitting. Let's start by landing. Let's start by landing in our seat. Yeah. Can we arrive. Can we arrive transition. Can we embrace this transition. Can we embrace the transition from busyness. Can we transition from busyness to stillness. Being here. Just here. Can we just arrive. Can we embrace this transition. And tell for us. Landing settling arriving with the breath with each breath, each breath. Thank you. Thank you. And each breath, each breath itself is a transition. Each breath itself is a transition. Constant movement. Constant change. Open up to this constant sea of change. With each breath. Each in breath, each out breath the entirety. Staying, staying steady. Staying warm heartily steady. With all the transitions, the in breath, the pause. Between the in breath and out breath. The out breath and the pause again. Moment. Change. Change. Present, present change. With each breath, relaxing into the change. Embracing, opening up our hearts and our awareness to the change. With each breath, in each breath. Thank you. And can we open up to all the changes in the body happening, all the sensations coming and going. There's a stillness of sitting and yet all the inner movements. The breath, the sensations, the breathing. All the sensations, shifting, moving, vibrations. Can we receive them smilingly? Yes, this is to be alive. Transition. Change is part of being alive. The awareness be steady, steady and warm. Steady and warm with the transitions. Not turning away and not falling into. As our minds might wander away into thoughts and memories, plans like little puppies running around. It's okay, it's alright. It's okay, notice the transition away from the breath, away from the body. To thought, to memory. Yes, yes, movement, transitions. Can you not frown upon it, to smile? Yes, here it is, that's what minds do. We willingly invite, invite awareness to transition back, to settle with the body, with the breath. Steady with these transitions in the body. The transitions also in the sound escape, sounds in the environment. The sound of my voice, noises, they're not a problem. Nothing is a problem. All these transitions. Can we embrace them wholeheartedly, aware of them? Awareness unmoving, awareness kind, wholehearted, warm hearted. Can we embrace them wholeheartedly, aware of them? And notice that the mind can become very still, the heart can become still with the awareness of change. The mind, the heart can become quite steady, noticing change. How interesting. Thank you. If you notice again, your mind moving to a thought, memory, coming back. It's all change, it's all change. Be open and spacious with all these transitions. No need for judgment, for you to chastise yourself. Noticing change, aware of change with kindness and wisdom. Thank you. Maybe you're sitting comfortably and then maybe a part of your body starts to feel uncomfortable and painful. Bring your awareness to change with kindness. Oh, here is change. Hello, change. Hello, transition. So not focusing on the content of, oh yes, Aikina, but the process, the process of transition. It wasn't here a moment ago, now it's here. Can I be warm hearted, open kind to the transition? Or maybe you were sleepy and now you feel more awake or feel more relaxed, more spacious, more calm. Yes, you can receive the content, let's say the calmness, more calmness, more peace, with appreciation. But instead of just the content, see the process, the transition from less peace to more peace, this transition, this change. Can we open our heart to change, not turn away? Receive it with kindness, with curiosity, with stability, steadiness, equanimity. Thank you. Thank you. And relaxing into change. Change. Change. Change. Notice how relaxing into change with the breath. Change is non-reactivity. Reability of the heart and mind. Change. Transition from thinking into stillness. Stillness into thinking, stability with all the transitions. Change. Change. Change. Change. Bringing an attitude of metta, open-heartedness to our awareness of change. Every moment, every breath, sounds, etc. Can bring a sense of steadiness, stability, peace, and joy. Not the fear of change, but the joy of change. energy, zest of change. If you notice your mind is thinking, just notice the transition. Ah interesting, transition from peace to thinking, ah interesting. Notice and change. No need for self-flagellation. Notice change, notice transitions. And maybe the transition back into stillness. The breath and body, non-thinking. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Change is the nature of the force of life, of the life force. In us, in others, in life in general, in the universe. Eliveness entails change, transitions. It's not to be dreaded or feared. It is the nature of the life force, change. Silence. Silence. Change. The nature of life force, the nature of nature all around us. Nature outside, nature inside, this body nature. Embracing, opening up to change, transitions wholeheartedly. It is the Dharma, the unfolding, the law of the universe. Change. To embrace it wholeheartedly, to step into the stream. And to be carried by it, not fighting. May we all embrace change with wisdom and an open heart. May we be free in the midst of change. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. So embracing change, embracing change with openness, warm heart, care. So in this practice tonight, as a practice of, for those of you who might have noticed, this was a practice of bringing in wisdom practices together with metta. Metta and wisdom, metta and wisdom together. So the metta aspect is the open heartedness, the warm heartedness. Yes, here it is. Yes. The wisdom aspect is, guess what? Change, transitions is another word for anicha, impermanence. So we've been practicing with one of the three characteristics, a wisdom teaching. So bringing a warm open hearted awareness to change in this way, in this unusual way, can really help us befriend change because instead of being afraid of change. So it's the way of the universe is the Dharma, it's the unfolding law of the universe change. You can't stop it. So might as well embrace it. So I'd like to invite you all for reflections, for questions, for comments. What did you notice, especially if you haven't shared in a while, I would like to ask you to share, to raise your Zoom hand. And also you can share in chat. You just send it to me. I will read your share, not your name. If it's sent to everyone, then I will also say your name. So take it away. What did you notice? Did you notice that? Okay. I'll ask a question. Did any of you notice that your mind actually became quite steady, quite stable, noticing change, noticing the breath changing sounds changing. Yes, I see more, at least one thumbs up from Neil. Yeah. So noticing. Yeah. And some people, yeah, I see. Notice the total opposite. Mary Christine says, great. I love all the variety of experiences coming up. So I'm going to ask you actually if you'd like to comment. So I'll ask Neil, if you first of you want to say anything about it, and then Mary Christine, so we can just both. If you'd like, you don't have to. You're welcome to. Yes, you are muted. Yeah, sure. I just found it very calm in many ways it felt like a continuation of Wednesday's practice. You know, I mean, things just change and so they just move on. And as long as I don't get hung up in them being the way they are, it's okay. Right. It's the grasping that seems to be the problem. Right. Right. Exactly. It's grasping to the content of, oh, this chain things changed and it's this way now. And why is it this way? Why is it? It's like, oh yeah, it just changed. It's just like pumping of one level. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Many of the changes are from pleasant to less pleasant. Yeah. Right. Yeah, it's like, well, it's not the way it is. It's the way it is. It's the way it is. It's the way it is. Yeah, exactly. So if you stay, not with the content, but with the process, oh yeah, this transition. No, that's interesting. There is a, the mind has spaciousness. There's more spaciousness that comes and you notice that. Yeah. Great. That's one thing I wanted to, for, uh, hopefully to get across. And if it didn't get across, no problem. There are plenty of other opportunities to practice with this. This is a significant insight. This is, this can be a significant insight on the path of practice, seeing change and how the mind can stabilize actually seeing change, not the content from pleasant to unpleasant and back, but actually, oh yeah, there was change. There's change. So thanks, Neil. Larry, I do see your hand up. I wanted to invite Mary Christine, if she wanted to, to share anything and, um, you don't have to Mary Christine. Yes. No. Yes. He will. You would like to. Yes. So please. For me, it was interesting. I was trying to observe. I've got a fair bit of body pain. I wanted to observe as opposed to get absorbed by the content. Yeah. But as all the pain, as every pain symptom kept coming up in my body, it meant that my my monkeys were just moving around a lot because my monkey mind was literally trying to stay with the change, the ongoing change. But, and that then Dean Dean, I settled my mind. It was the opposite. It became super active. Right. That makes sense. But right. Right. It does make sense. Absolutely. Yes. So, so what I'm hearing you say is that there was so much going on in the body and, and not and what you were trying, it wasn't to be with the content of the pain, but to notice the transitions, but it seemed like there was so much movement that it was just like, whoa, this is, this is too much. Yeah. And that sometimes when there's so many transitions, like, and that can happen exactly. It's like, wait, too many transitions. Like I can't keep up with these. It's like too many. Right. Great. I'm so appreciative that you brought up that. I went back to my phrases. What would you advise? Yeah. Yeah. Great. So, so one thing you could do, we could go back to the phrases. That's lovely. That's something that kind of anchors you and stabilizes. Another thing is if you, if you wanted to still dip your toe with this transition is to, to invite it back to be with the breath, because the breath has simpler transitions, right? It has simpler, like, it's like, yeah. And like, afterwards the mind, the mind is like, it lullaby. Yeah. And right. And it calms down. And then you could open up to the, to the body sensations again, or, you know, the body transitions again with the mind. Thank you, Mark. That's lovely. Thank you. So Larry, I see your hand, please. I really appreciated the guidance. Watching change, sort of the ever changing existence at times, it does really calm me and I can get very still. And what I felt this time was I would get still and then I would move to the future. I was like, do I listen to, should I listen to this talk again and then I'll be in the same place or how do I stay in this place? And as soon as I went to the future, I could feel the clench of like, you know, the self coming right back. Right. And I could see that and then I could go back to the still place again. So it was that watching that, watching that, watching that, it felt very useful. Nice. What a wonderful insight that came out of this with noticing that, yes, when the mind went to the future, that's when the clenching, the self came in, the selfing me, am I going to be in this place? Like, whoa, whoa, wait, just beautiful. Wonderful. Thanks for sharing that insight. How, how important. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. See a couple of shares and then we'll transition into the group. Bill says thinking became more stable but not completely stable. That's fine. That's all good. Is this more focusing on awareness than on what is noticed? Ah, kind of, kind of. It's, it's we're not focusing, we're not aware of the content, but we're aware of the transition. So we're not actually aware of awareness itself. It's not that. And we're not aware of the, we're not focusing on the content either. It's kind of in the middle where it's, it's the transition we're aware of. It's like the derivative for those of you who like mathematics. It's the, that, that's what we're paying attention to. So yes, I hope that makes sense, Bill. Aurora says, I feel like I need to practice this more to really drop in, it felt like open awareness practice and my mind kept trying to decide what to focus on. Ah, right, right. So what the invitation I have is to stay with the breath, to stay with the transitions of the breath. That is your anchor here. So usually our anchor is the, the breath itself, the content of the breath, the sensations of the breath. Here I was suggesting for the anchor to be the transitions, the, from the, on the breath, in breath, out breath, all those transitions. So, so that could serve as the, as the anchor here. Aurora, if you wanted to try this again. So that's what I would invite you. Excellent questions, beautiful reflections, everyone. So touched with your practice, everything that's coming up for you. So juicy. Everyone. Thank you so much. So, so let us transition now, let us transition to practicing in small groups and bringing a theme from Wednesday, listening with our hearts, listening with our hearts, sharing with our hearts and whatever transitions we would like to share or not. It's all good. So let's start with 15 seconds of, of silent Metta for one another before we engage. And I've created the rooms. The rooms are made. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. Okay. Welcome back, everyone. We have just about a minute left for any reflections that might have come up either during or before. So I'd love to hear from you, especially if you haven't shared for a while. Don't be shy. Go for it. Yes, Jerry, I do see your hand, please. Anyway, I can talk and talk a lot, but try not to like I learned more when I listened. But anyhow, just add, I joined late, but it really helped when you said that the essential of life is change and a reflection came up in the group and they said, you know, so often our lives we we don't we either want something to change now, which it will eventually, or we don't want to lose what we have. And so we get sad thinking of the loss or loss aversion. And so I was thinking about that, that happiness or content might be more contentment, which I think is the greatest wealth, as you say, in Buddhism, that it's to embrace change that is inevitable, it's essential of life actually makes the enjoyment of the moment that we're here for such a short time. So rewarding. So well said. Thank you, Jerry. Well said. Well said. Thank you. Thank you for that. And Larry quickly asks, or I'll quickly answer, why do we need an anchor? Is we are watching everything change if not is way I think there was a typo there. But I think I get the gist of the question, why do we need to anchor if everything changing or something like that? The idea is that so that our awareness can can be stable. Otherwise it becomes overwhelming. Because it just, you know, it's like if you're looking through binoculars, it just if it's shifting and moving too much, like, right, you can't really look through. So but you want to look through the binoculars so that they're stable, so you can see everything that's shifting really clearly. So that's the idea. That's the reason for that. And thank you all. Thank you for all your practice showing up your beautiful reflections. That was a lovely point to end on. Jerry, love that. Thanks for that reflection and everyone. Thank you for coming to happy hour, practicing, cultivating your heart, your minds for yourselves and the sake of all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. Okay. Thank you.
