Dharmette : It’s OK  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I was reminded this morning, as I have been periodically 
over the last months, of the great American mantra , “It’s 
OK.” “It’s OK” Is a very powerful mantra.  It’s what we 
parents often use for our children. And it’s a magical 
mantra because – what  does “It’s OK” mean when the 
kid has scrap ed his  or her  knee and  there’s blood 
everywhere ? Maybe it’s more realistic to get really 
anxious around the kid and say, “Oh my God this is 
terrible;  you might get infected ; and who knows you 
might get gangrene , and you might lose your leg , and 
this could be the end of yo ur career as a soccer 
champion.” It’s like “ Oh no, I’ve failed as  a parent.”  
That’s one option.  
 
But usually  parents don’t sa y that. More likely they ’d 
say, “It’s OK; c ome here ; it’s OK; we’ll clean it; it’s OK.”  
There’s something very important for these little kids 
saying it’s OK, reassuring and supporting them. So what 
is OK? It’s not OK that they hurt their knee, but in the 
bigger picture of things, it’s OK. In the bigger picture 
about how their life is unfolding, it’s not  that important that they scrap ed their leg. There are  many  more 
important things in this life  than an infection in their leg , 
even  though it is to take care of that.  
 
And when a parent says, “It’s OK,”  I think the good 
parent is very committed to trying to take care of it with 
the best he or s he can. They’ll clean the wound; they’ll 
disinfect it; they’ll put a band -aid on it; they’ll do wha t 
they need to do . “It’s OK” is not saying, “I t’s OK ; let’s 
leave t he wound to take care of itself;  go back out in the 
playground , and don’t worry about the dog shit that’s out 
there; it’s all OK .” That’s not what’s being said.  It’s 
some thing deeper, broad er that  it’s OK.  
 
In Tibetan Buddhism they have this very powerf ul 
mantra that’s six syllables : “Om mani padme hum .” The 
American version is , “It is really OK ” (also six syllables ). 
It doesn’t have quite the same rhythm as “Om mani 
padme hum ” – maybe because we haven’t said it 
enough. Maybe if we say it as many times as the 
Tibetans have , we’ll get in to the rhythm: [slower] “It is 
really OK.”  
 
In terms of meditation practice , to have this mantra, “I t’s 
OK,” or at least the attitude that it’s OK is teac hing the 
heart something important that we need to learn.  One 
thing  that’s encouraging is that the heart can heal itself, 
can take care of itself, if we get out of the way.  
 And often it’s the way in which we get anxious  or 
aggressive or  upset, or the way s we try to manipulate 
and fix things, that often stirs up the pot and makes 
things worse. It certainly makes things worse in the 
sense of  making it difficult for everything to settle down 
and relax. And so t o say, “It’s OK”  is an encourageme nt 
to get out of your own way. D on’t interfere with what the 
heart can do on it’s own. The heart kno ws how to take 
care of itself – just as a wound kno ws how to take care 
of itself. T he body knows how to take care of a wound, if 
you clean it and protect it. The physiolo gy of healing a 
wound  is very complex : all the chemicals , blood , and 
everything that goes on  to heal the wound . And it’s 
amazing that this goes on wit hout our conscious 
manipulation or  our conscious engineering of it. In fact, 
if we were going to engineer the healing of the wound, 
we would probably have to have a greater processing 
power in our conscious mind because it’s so complex. 
But somehow the system knows how to do it. Our job is  
not to do the healing. Our job is to make sure the 
healing is not interfered with. So we clean the wound 
and we keep it covered and then we leave it alone.  
 
It’s the same thing with the heart or the inner wounds or 
difficulties we have. The mantra, “It’s OK” is a way of 
keeping it clean and putting a bandage over it , getting 
out of the way and allowing something else to unfold, for 
the natural healing process to happen. With a cut on the 
knee, sometimes it hurts for a while, . Sometimes it hurts to wash it and put the disinfectant on it . So, you’re not 
necessarily making the kid ’s life more pleasant when 
you say, “It’s OK.”  Y ou just put this disinfectant on it. 
They have to deal with that.  It’s the same thing for our 
hearts with the mantra, “It’s OK. ” Somet imes it can sting 
a little bit or be a little bit awkwar d. But to get out of the 
way and allow something deeper to unfold is a very 
powerful thing .  
 
Part of the mantr a, “It’s OK”  is an encouragement to 
look at how we relate to things as if they’re not OK.  And 
some things, of course, are not OK . So it’s not justifying 
everything . But it’s useful to question the movements of, 
“It’s not OK,”  which  – more  often than not  – have  to do 
with anxiety, ambition, greed, fear , and not with 
something that’s really inna te. So perhaps  we can have 
the mantra, “I t’s OK ” and use that to massage  or relax 
that muscle of,  “It’s not OK. ” And the m ore we can relax 
that, the more likely it is that some inner unfolding or 
healing has a chance to move through us and to 
develop and happen.  There’s more going on here than 
your conscious mind. In the same way, there’s more 
going on in your healing of a scrap e on your knee than 
you can conscious ly be aware of. And so, it’s OK to  
trust this, to allow something to happen.  
 
It’s OK is also  an encouragement  to look at things in a 
different , wider,  more universal perspective than the one 
you happen to be using. If the kid scrap es their knee and can’t go out and play with their friends, that’s the 
perspective the kid’s going to be upset about , and that 
might be the drama they’re living in.  But in the bigger 
picture  of a lifetime, it might actually be much more 
important that the parent was there to hold the kid who 
was crying , and to care for and attend to the kid . And 
the kid sees that, “O h, there’s a community of pe ople 
here who care for me .” That might be actually much 
more important than the perspective the kid had  in the 
moment.    
 
So what perspective are you bringing to bea r on your 
problems, to the  issues  in your life? Do you have a very  
small perspective  in the immediate moment? Do you 
have  something to do with your self -identity or with your 
desires? Or do you have a bigger, broader  perspective 
that includes something  more universal?  
 
How is it that we’re held by the Dharma? How are we 
held by our wider community? How are we held by the 
world, by this universe of ours? Where do we fit within 
the universe?  
 
A childhood experience that I had regularly, that I think 
was meaningful for me was when I would lie  in bed 
before falling asleep, and I would think about the 
universe – whatever  understan ding of the universe I had 
– all the stars and the galaxies. I would think about my 
death, and I thought my death was rejoining  all that , and I thought it was quite beautiful. I was very comforted . I’m 
not going to exist when I die , but I didn’t mind because I 
was going to become all of this , and it was very 
meaningful for me – as opposed to the drama o f what 
happened in school today when Susie stole my pencil or  
Char lie wouldn’t talk to me. What perspective do we 
have?  
 
It’s OK . The universe is there for us , or the mind – the 
very profound mind that can let go – is there to hold us. 
Or there’s a won derful feeling of m etta or loving 
kindness where there’s a deep sense  of love or security 
or happiness that’s not connected to getting all the little 
details of our life lined up just right: having the right job , 
or the right relationship , or the right whatever. S o for 
me, while  the mantra, “It’s OK”  can appear superficial , 
with some reflection , it points to something very deep 
and profound and meaningful . And perhaps  it 
encourages you to relax and let go  and allow yourself to 
be alive – where just being alive is enough. It’s enough. 
It’s OK.  
 
And if it’s not OK, that’s OK too. So thank you.
