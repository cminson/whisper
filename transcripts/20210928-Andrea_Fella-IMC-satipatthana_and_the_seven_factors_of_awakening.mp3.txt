 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So continuing the teachings on Satyakpatana that we've been exploring, then in the fourth foundation for a while, exploring some of the various teachings in the fourth foundation. And before shifting to the next teaching in the fourth foundation, which I'll introduce a little bit today, I want to kind of back up and give a bigger perspective again of Satyakpatana and kind of the direction that Satyakpatana heads. Because the next teaching that we're talking about, the next list, the next instructions or encouragements in the Satyakpatana are to explore or be curious about, to be aware of the seven factors of awakening. And these are factors that are cultivated as we practice and in a way they are some of the aim of the whole practice of wise mindfulness. So the first of the seven factors is mindfulness and that factor is said to kind of condition or support the cultivation of the other factors, of investigation, of energy, of delight, joy, rapture, of tranquility, of concentration and of equanimity. So that's kind of the direction the practice heads through the cultivation of mindfulness. But to think about the Satyakpatana as a whole, a couple of pieces to just reflect on. In the guided meditation, I really emphasize receiving as a form of mindfulness practice. And just to speak to that and how that kind of integrates or is supported by the Satyakpatana Sutta. Often in reading the Satyakpatana Sutta, it's described as a whole bunch of different mindfulness exercises. Mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of breathing in mindfulness of the body. We direct the attention to the breathing or mindfulness of body postures. We direct the attention to body postures or mindfulness of feeling tone. We direct the attention to noticing pleasant, unpleasant or neutral aspects of experience. That's one way the Satyakpatana Sutta can be understood, to choose various aspects of experience and kind of focus on them. And there's value to that. There is value to that to kind of learn about various aspects of experience. But the wording of the Satyakpatana Sutta actually does support kind of the receptive aspect. With receptive mindfulness, we aren't choosing something to pay attention to. It's more, OK, let's see what awareness is already here. What is awareness already knowing here? So the awareness is just kind of open receiving and it may be body that's being received. It may be breath that's being received. It may be feeling tone. It may be mind states that are being received. And whatever is obvious, there's something in the Satyakpatana Sutta that can point to, what's a skillful way to be with that? What is already arising? And so, for instance, in the feeling tone, it describes it. I think the language says, when feeling a pleasant feeling, one understands, I feel a pleasant feeling. So it doesn't actually say in the foundation around the feeling tone, direct the attention to feeling tone. It says, when feeling a pleasant feeling, one understands, I feel a pleasant feeling. So that's a much more receptive, it's receptive language, actually, in several of the Satyapatana exercises, in several of the things that are mentioned in the Satyapatana Sutta. It has very, it uses very receptive language. The description of mind states, for example, I'm going to actually pull my book down and read this section to you. So this is in the contemplation of mindfulness of mind. One understands a mind affected by greed as a mind affected by greed. One understands a mind affected by aversion as a mind affected by aversion. Again, it's not saying necessarily that we have to direct the attention to that aspect of experience. It says, how does one abide contemplating mind is mind? That might be thought of as, you should contemplate mind is mind, but it might be also understood as, when there is, what is obvious that's arising is something in the mind. This is how to be with it. This is how to contemplate it. So I think the Satyapatana Sutta supports both perspectives on mindfulness. If we think about the Satyapatana Sutta as a whole, we could say that the first three foundations, mindfulness of body, mindfulness of feeling tone, whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, mindfulness of mind, which includes noticing presence or absence of greed, aversion or delusion, presence or absence of contraction and distraction, and presence or absence of some states of concentration. So those three are kind of more general ways of familiarizing ourselves with the experiences of body and mind. We're encouraged to get in touch with a familiar with body. And again, it might be noticing it through receptive awareness or directed awareness. We're encouraged to get familiar with body, the breath in the body, body postures, the sensations in the body, the elemental nature of our experience, hardness, pressure, softness that's framed in terms of earth, air, fire and water element. So we're encouraged to get familiar with body. And then in the feeling tone, we're encouraged to get familiar with that just very simply. The feeling tone again, feeling tone is a very simple instruction. When there's pleasant feeling arising, one knows that unpleasant feeling one knows that mindfulness of mind, just the simplicity of recognizing when the mind is affected by greed or not, when it's affected by aversion or not. So the first three foundations we can think of as kind of familiarizing ourselves with what our experience is in the present moment. So encouraging that interest. And I think of the mindfulness. Mindfulness itself is a kind of a neutral quality. It's a capacity we have as human beings to be aware of what's happening in the present moment. But that capacity to be aware of what's happening in the present moment is not inherently either wholesome or unwholesome. It's a capacity that we have and it can be joined with various intentions. So the reason why we are present, what we are exploring with being aware in the present moment, what's the purpose of our being aware in the present moment? One might be aware in the present moment in a wholesome way, but not necessarily directed towards full freedom and awakening through being very mindful while doing a particular job like being a surgeon. A surgeon probably has to be really present with what they're doing. They are doing it for the purpose of helping someone. So that's wholesome. But it is not necessarily the kind of mindfulness that is just simply curious about, well, what's it like to be a surgeon in the present moment? There's more there's more aim and direction to the purpose of what they're doing. Then there's a thief who might be very present and aware when they are going through a house to seal something. And again, you know, very kind of aware of all of their movements to be very quiet, to not draw attention to themselves. But the purpose for which they're doing that is not to be curious about what is it like to take this step. It is in order to steal. So the purpose for that is is greed or potentially aversion, depending on the motivation behind the robbery. So the motivation or intention that turns that capacity we have to be present in the present moment into a wise mindfulness is a curiosity about this present moment experience as present moment experience that maybe is the simplest way to describe that perspective. It includes a curiosity about what the formal way that this intention or wise intention is described is that it includes a curiosity about what suffering is, what stress is and what freedom from stress is. And that suffering or stress is kind of revealed. And the the perspective of simply being curious about what's happening in the present moment as a human being begins to point out to us that there are things happening in the present moment, particular things in our own mind that are contributing to the stress that we feel, the suffering that we feel. And so the this kind of what we might call bare attention or receptive attention, receptive awareness begins to point out what kinds of things are happening that lead us towards stress and suffering. All of those difficult states of mind, the hindrances and what leads us towards more ease and peace towards the cultivation of those seven factors of awakening. And so these first three foundations are cultivating this kind of mindfulness. We're learning what it means to when feeling a pleasant feeling, one feels a pleasant feeling. We're learning what it means to breathing in one understands I'm breathing in. We're getting familiar with that kind of awareness in these first three foundations. In the fourth foundation, it begins to point more to the process of experience, how things happen in our in our experience. So the hindrances is the first set in the fourth foundation, the first list. And again, we can think of the instructions on the hindrances being, you know, when the when we recognize sense, desire arising, we know. So one knows sense, desire is present or absent. That's a simple instruction in the fourth foundation. And then it encourages us to begin to get curious about how that has happened. How does that hindrance come to be? How does sense, desire arise? And how does it end? So that in the the fourth foundation, we're beginning to get more curious about the causes and conditions around our experience, around the hindrances to start. And maybe the order is useful in the fourth foundation in a way, because, you know, when we start our meditation practice, often the hindrances, the sense, desire, ill will, restlessness, sleepiness and doubt, these are things that come up a lot. They're kind of the obvious things that happen. You know, when you sit down for the very first time, I mean, one of the first things we often notice when we sit down to meditate, the very first time we try to meditate is just how much our mind wanders off. You know, we sit down and we try to stay with something or we are exposed to the instruction of be present with what's happening. And what we notice is that the mind goes off a lot. We notice the restlessness of the mind. That's essentially what we're noticing there. We might orient to it as this is a problem or we might take it as an understanding. Oh, wow, look how restless the mind is. And that's what the fourth foundation is encouraging us to do, to get to know these things that are essentially in the way of a mind that settles down. The hindrances themselves are kind of five habitual, very habitual functions in our mind, and habitual things that we've practiced, that we've been conditioned towards unwittingly thinking they're helping us out that tend to keep the mind from actually landing in the present moment. And so the familiarity with them and what makes them happen, what makes them go away, that's a place often where we begin when we first sit down. This is one of the most obvious things that happens. The mind wanders a lot. And there's a lot of aversion often to what's going on or I want to be anywhere else but here. All of these are hindrances. And so if we can be curious instead about this is what's happening, instead of feeling like I'm doing something wrong, why can't I just make my mind do what I want it to do? It's actually an insight. It's an understanding that, yeah, our minds are kind of out of our control. It's actually a pointer to the deep teaching on not-self that we see this. Minds are out of control. So instead of rejecting that, you know, or thinking I'm at fault because I can't control my mind and make it stay in the present moment, it's like, wow, this is what minds do. Can I be curious about all of these forces that make the mind do this? And that's what the Buddha is encouraging at the beginning of the fourth foundation. And the order here is interesting because that's often something that we're going to see when we first start our practice. We start to see how crazy the mind is and what does kind of take it away. Sleepiness, we get so sleepy when we meditate or the mind jumping all over the place or we doubt ourselves. I don't know how to do this or I want to be doing anything with this, you know, this is the perfect time to clean the refrigerator. I think I'll go clean the refrigerator instead of sitting down. You know, just the way our minds work to avoid something that we don't feel like we do very well, essentially. So that, again, the encouragement is to kind of get curious about these things and to be curious about what happens. And what we start to see is that there's things going on in the mind. We start to see the kind of a thought arises and the mind kind of getting hooked to that idea or that belief. I need to do this right now. This is not the time to be meditating. I need to do this. And then if we actually see that arising, we see that belief arising. We might recognize, yeah, actually, I don't need to clean the refrigerator right now. That is something that hasn't been done in the last five days. It certainly doesn't need to be done in the next 30 minutes. So if we see those things, then it can begin to expose how driven we are by things that are below the surface, how conditioned we are. And so it starts to help us to understand how our minds do what they do. As we kind of get curious about the the hindrances, we might start to also recognize as we see the hindrances, seeing, for instance, a version in the in in that I don't want this. I don't like this. We might also start to see that there's experience in the body that is related to that and that there's unpleasant feeling connected to that. So the next set of the aggregates, we might start to kind of go underneath the kind of the grosser level of, yeah, this is a version, and start to see how the processes of feeling and perception and body and and all of the ideas and beliefs are contributing or kind of weaving together. And so that that teaching on the aggregates kind of might help us to see or understand the condition, the nature of that of that hindrance. We also might start to see how various sense, sense basis or senses, sense experience contribute. We might notice that a particular desire has come up because we heard something. You know, that that seemed to be the trigger point. And so the encouragement to notice the sense basis and how the sense basis, how seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, touching and what goes on in the mind interweaves with these the processes that create hindrances and and move in the direction of of their letting go as well. So the these first three aspects of the fourth foundation are really an encouragement to look at the conditioned nature of our experience. And in particular with the the hindrance, you know, what is conditioning hindrances? What's conditioning the arising of hindrances? What's conditioning the ending of hindrances? Now, again, this can be done in a in a kind of a directed way. At times, we might pick up a particular teaching like at one point on one retreat. The teacher was talking a lot about perception, how perception works. And and and that kind of got into my system. And the you know, the curiosity about perception began to aim the mind to look at that. So there was a kind of a directedness about it, although it wasn't so much me saying, I'm going to look at this. It was more the interest or the intention that arose because of so much conversation about perception. But there are ways that we can direct attention to some of these various areas. And that can be useful. It definitely can be useful. And at times, it can be useful to look at things from a particular lens, like just simply looking at things from the from the lens of the presence or absence of greed or or sense desire. Sense desires present. Here's what's happening. Sense desire will either be present or absent in any moment of experience. And so that instruction from the the hindrance describing sense desire could be looked at as a framework for attending to whatever's happening. We might notice, OK, sense desire is absent right now. And in the noticing the absence of sense desire, we might notice that aversion is really here, you know, so we might we might notice that part. Or we might notice in the absence of sense desire that there's ease, that there's a sense of. Not needing anything of contentment. And so the absence of sense desire might begin to show reveal some other qualities in the mind. And so we can we can aim kind of towards particular explorations at times. As we do explore the experience from this perspective of curiosity. We may not notice. That the. We may not be consciously aware of, although we will probably notice at some level that there are some qualities that are supporting us. The seven factors of awakening. And so this is the next list in the Satipatanasukta, the seven factors of awakening supporting us to do our practice. We don't we think about being mindful of something, being mindful of what's happening, being mindful of what we're receiving. But less often are we aware that we are mindful. We think about being curious about exploring a hindrance or something, but less often are we curious or aware of the curiosity itself. So this is this is a pointing in the in this teaching of the. Seven factors of awakening, including those in the Satipatanasukta. That all of those wholesome qualities that are shaped by being mindful. Mindfulness. Supports investigation, interest, curiosity, which supports energy. Energy to engage with the practice, a momentum of the practice, which supports a joy. Which can then lead on to a more tranquil experience. And concentration. And equanimity. Suckas in there to happiness, so tranquility, then happiness, then concentration and equanimity. So the. These factors that happen, sometimes we we kind of recognize these things going on like. But not so much directly. It's more like we were more aimed at. When I paid attention, I felt that way and I want more of that feeling. So let me pay attention more so I get that feeling back. I get that delight back. I get that happiness back. I get that contentment back. And what the Buddha is encouraging us to notice is, yeah, any any experience that can arise and these are beautiful qualities, they're wholesome qualities of mind. And yet we can also get attached to them. We can unwittingly kind of be aiming our practice at getting more of them as opposed to being curious about, well, what's it like to be a human being feeling happiness? What's it like to be a human being experiencing tranquility? So this is an encouragement in this in this instruction where we're encouraged to. Notice the presence or absence of the factor of mindfulness is of the factors of awakening is mindfulness present is the factor of awakening factor of mindfulness present or absent. Is the awakening factor of interest investigation present or absent? Much as we were encouraged in the hindrance to notice is the sense is senses are present or absent. Here we're kind of flipping it around. Is mindfulness present or absent is is joy present or absent is tranquility present or absent concentration present or absent. This becomes easier as there's more continuity of mindfulness. It doesn't have to be like the kind of continuity of mindfulness that is like for days on end. It can simply be mindfulness, continuity of mindfulness, even for a few seconds. The stronger are the momentum of our mindfulness gets, the more we're familiar with what's going on in our our hearts and minds and bodies. Then when mindfulness arises in a moment, we might notice. What's happening right now, for instance, is wow, there's there's there's a kind of a not wanting something to happen arising. So we notice the arising of the aversion or the ill will. And with that comes a very strong kind of recognition of like, yep, that's what's happening. There's ill will arising. And with that recognition, there can be the sense or the understanding of space that happens like, oh, yeah, that's what's happening. I don't have to let get all been out of shape about this. It's just that's just what's arising right now. And there can be not only the space, but within that space, a sense of ease of even joy. So to my surprise, at times I've seen seeing anger and joy at the same time, you know, but that's not not when I'm involved in the anger, but when I'm aware of it. So the the as the mindfulness gets stronger and more able to meet even even in a few moments, oh, here's anger and well, here's the mindfulness that's meeting that and there's a lot of curiosity about what is this? What is this experience of of aversion right now? So we might be more the mindfulness might be more kind of attuned to initially might be more attuned to the experience of the aversion. And that's where we start in the, you know, in the fourth foundation encouraged to get to know those experiences. This is what aversion is like. But as our practice deepens, we get interested in not only or maybe even more interested in not just that aversion is arising and what's that aversion about but what's all of the capacity to hold that aversion about? What's the mindfulness like? What's the interest like? What's the joy like? And that's where we're moving into this kind of curiosity about the seven factors of awakening. One simple way into exploring this, that's really a useful practice. And it's useful wherever we are in our practice, it can it can point out kind of hidden things going on in our minds, things that we weren't consciously aware of. So while we're noticing what's here in the moment, just kind of occasionally checking in. And what's the relationship to what's happening? So we might be noticing an unpleasant physical sensation. And the relationship to that might be aversion. We might not have consciously recognized or become aware of, oh, what's happening is there's aversion. There was a kind of a way that we were attending to that unpleasant experience in order to get rid of it, as opposed to just being curious. Well, there's an unpleasant sensation. What's happening? And not seeing that aversion is happening. So this kind of curiosity, but what's the relationship to what's happening? As our practice strengthens, as our mindfulness gets stronger, we gain more skill at that capacity to be curious and aware of what's happening. Then the relationship to what's happening, like I described with seeing, there's aversion and wow, yeah, there's aversion. You know, the relationship to seeing that the relationship to the experience was kind of curiosity, interest. And so checking the relationship to experience might also show or reveal some of those beautiful qualities that have been being cultivated while exploring being with experience. Oh, so there's interest here. This is what it's like to have interest. This is what it's like to have joy or delight while watching experience. And that that kind of may may bring the mind, the mindfulness to the awareness of some of these wholesome qualities, some of these seven factors of awakening. So this simple exploration of what's the relationship to experience can support both the exploration around the hindrances and the exploration around the seven factors of awakening. So there's a lot more to say about this, but I think I'll stop my part here and see what are your thoughts about what I've shared any comments or questions or reflections about this. And you're welcome to type into the chat if you prefer to to not speak into the room. Make sure you can unmute yourselves. Yes. That was a lot. I know that was a pretty broad topic, but yeah Bruce. Sorry about that. Can you hear me okay I've got a new cheap microphone. Yep. I'm sorry I wanted to send one of the worldly wins your way by way of praise and gratitude. Your kind of meditations are really quite beautiful. The, your tone of voice is very soothing, your, your pace is wonderful I never feel rushed. When I have a guided meditation with you. And also, I feel like you try and keep it simple and not too complicated which for my pea sized brain is a, is a really good thing so many thanks for that. I'm glad it's supportive. Thank you, Bruce. Follow up with a question it's sort of a beginner's question but I wrestle with when experience comes up with, how can I really have an experience without naming it, you know, like, I'll feel like the breeze on my porch. When I'm sitting at my porch I'll feel the breeze on my forehead then I'll be like, Okay, I'm feeling some sensation. Like I feel like I can't just leave it there it may not be there unless I name it, you know. And so what I did I wondered if this was skillful, I sort of went back and forth between like not naming it and letting it arise and seeing what happened and not feeling the need to name it. And I try that for like five minutes and then I'd switch to like, okay, let's I'm feeling my feet on the floor okay I'm feeling my feet on the floor, I'm naming it after it arises. And the question is, is that was that skillful to go back and forth. So were you able to not name it at times. Yes, when I, when I tried that I could do it, but it felt funny it felt like a newer thing you know it felt like, Oh gosh is it really here if it doesn't have a name you know. So I don't know if that's a direction I should head in to try and get better at that without the name. So, so there's a there's a there's actually several things to point to here. I'll try to do what I can in these next three minutes. So, you know, if you're noticing that there's kind of a conscious naming of experience, you know, and it's habit, right, it's habit. It's, it's not. It's problematic so much you know that that we do that but it and sometimes we can't stop it. You might try to stop it, and it almost feels like repression. And if it's feeling like repression to stop it, I'm not sure that that's useful. But if it feels like you can let it go and it just feels a little bit like floaty or like, yeah, not sure what's going on. That's okay. Just, just notice yeah, oh, it kind of feels a little strange not to have that extra like grounding with this is what's happening like telling yourself it's basically like narrating to yourself what's going on. If you can stop it without a feeling of repression. You can play with that. And just notice the relationship to that, which is what you said, you know, it feels a little strange so that too that's just the next thing it's like okay not doing that there's a little feeling of strangeness it feels a little floaty it feels like whatever, you know, it feels a little bit ungrounded somehow. So, so that's, that's, I would encourage that at times, and then to see what happens with the, you know what happens with the naming or the kind of identification of, of the experience you know, is there a sense of being able to be more present or more. So, kind of look at the conditions what's going on on both sides of it. You're welcome to play as long as it's not something that's actively harming us or others. You're welcome to play, you know, with well what's what's here you know what's going on with that. So, so that's one piece. And then another piece is that, you know, as our mindfulness gets a little bit stronger. We will start to recognize that our minds do this process of recognizing. So, you know, we don't necessarily see it consciously at first. But you know the the experience of noticing the sensation of feet on the ground, or the hearing a bird, you know that the mind will naturally recognize that experience it's it's part of the process of perception. So, you know, there's a sound that arises and almost immediately our minds identify it as, you know, leaf blower or bird or dog or refrigerator hum or whatever you know it, and it may identify it in different ways it may identify it through the word in our mind saying the word, it might identify it with sounds it might identify it through an image, like we hear the refrigerator hum and we might see an image of a refrigerator in our minds as the way that it's identified. So that's a natural process of recognition that's a supportive process for us to live as human beings, and we're not going to be able to stop that. You know that's that's just something that will happen. It doesn't usually come with the whole sentence. You know, it's not usually oh I'm hearing a refrigerator hum that's, that's a little bit more that's more of a thought that kind of has followed on from the recognition of the refrigerator hum. Sometimes though it is simple the words like hum, or bird, or that may be how it's recognized, or the image may be how it's recognized. And so just to be aware that that's also something that happens in our in our experience and so you know sometimes people get get confused think you know thinking, you know, why can I stop that my mind is labeling everything, and we're not going to be able to stop that process of perception. So a useful exploration when something like this happens, when it feels like I'm naming everything is to see, can you stop it, not through repression but can you stop engaging with that process as I asked you, can you stop doing that, you could, to some extent and then you had that kind of weird floaty feeling. And so that tells me that that was more at the level of a conscious kind of engagement a conscious kind of thinking or doing that is possible to let go. And so that that's, that's a useful thing to check with with this kind of experience can I stop doing this and sometimes, sometimes the answer is no, you know, I don't seem to be able to stop doing this it's just happening. And when that is the case then we just get to watch it. That's what's going on in the mind. The mind is recognizing experience perception at work is actually what the mind is interested in knowing right now. So, those are, those are just a few, a few thoughts about that.
