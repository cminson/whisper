 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. And tonight I'd like to talk about why's right attitude, what I was referring to a little bit in the meditation already. And then I want to weave that into talking about right understanding or about why's wisdom and understanding. And the wisdom understanding part was a question that came into the forum that you can find on the calendar of IMC. And you can put in a question if you have one, if you don't want to ask a question during the evening. So I want to start off with the why's right attitude part. And then weave the why's understanding into that. And this is all based on Teshin Nia, Sayedah O Teshin Nia's teachings, who I've practiced with in Myanmar several years ago. And he wrote a book, which is called Don't Look Down on the Defilements. And in that book that I had to read when I came to the monastery there, the first thing that Sayedah wanted me to do was read that book before anything else would happen. My first, all yogis had to read that book. And in that book is a quote that I've been using all these years since I read that book there for the first time. And I'd like to share that quote with you all. And it goes like this. Having the right attitude is a way of looking at things that makes you content, comfortable and feel at ease with whatever you are experiencing. We all have wrong attitudes. We cannot help having them. So do not try to have the right attitude. Try to recognize if you have the wrong or the right attitude instead. Right attitude allows you to accept, acknowledge and observe whatever is happening, whether pleasant or unpleasant, in a relaxed and alert way. End of the quote. And I've used this quote during my practice a lot over the years. And I changed it a little bit so that it would be more of like an instruction for myself. So I used mainly the part that says I am content, comfortable and at ease with whatever I am experiencing. I accept, acknowledge and observe whatever is happening, whether pleasant or unpleasant, in a relaxed and alert way. So, Saeda Uteshaniya uses right attitude a lot. He uses the word right. And sometimes it might be helpful for our Western minds to use wise or skillful attitude. Or with wrong attitude, you can use unwise or unskillful attitude. Because sometimes right and wrong makes us feel a little bit like we're doing something wrong and it shouldn't be like this. While what Saeda also says is like it's all nature, it's just coming up. We can't help having these unwise or unskillful attitudes. So if it's helpful, you can refer to right attitude as wise or skillful and to wrong as unwise or unskillful. So attitude is about our mental attitude, as you might have understood already. And there are three types of attitudes that are not so skillful. And these are the three defilements, the three kilesa in Ali, the attitude of greed or loba, the attitude of hatred, and sometimes also translated as a version, dosa. And then moha, delusion, greed, hatred, and delusion. These are also sometimes called the three unwholesome roots of existence. These are the roots that have all other unwholesome states of mind in them. And we all have them. We can't really escape them until we're fully enlightened. And loba or greed expresses true wanting and trying to make things happen and wanting things to be different. Like we're sitting in meditation and we're wanting the same stillness that we had last time, or we're wanting just some ease. And in daily life we might want another cookie or when we get up out of our bed in the morning and so cold in the house, we want to turn the heat on. And dosa or aversion or hatred is the not one thing that pushing away or not okay with what is. And it's a whole range from aversion, like the mildest form of aversion or irritation, all the way to like the strongest hate we can experience. It's all dosa. You can also think of fear, worry, impatience, stress, all part of dosa. In meditation we might experience like, oh I don't want to feel this tiredness, I don't want to feel this pain, or maybe even I don't want to meditate. And in daily life we might experience like real life example, the computer is not doing what I want and then I get all aversive. And I start, you know, being aversive towards other things as well like if then someone comes up to me and ask me something I'm like, er, well normally I might be really kind. So these states also kind of influence other aspects so if we get aversive because of the computer, we might, this might translate to other aspects in our life as well as like glasses we put on, that we start looking through. And then the third route, the third kilesa is moja or delusion. And that's often a little bit harder to recognize for people. Moja includes not knowing confusion, not clearly seeing how things are. And in Dutch my mother tongue, one of the words for moja to translate moja is closely related to a word that means something like magic trick. So it's like moja is like a magic trick being played on us. One of those magic tricks that are played on us when we even moja is present is that we think that the loba and the dosa, the greed and the hatred leads to happiness. For example, when I'm angry with someone I might, might think like, Oh, my anger is going to teach this personal lesson, and then I'll feel better. And I really don't really recognize like this anchor is actually painful right now inside, and it brings suffering, suffering to me right now. I can also moja can also express itself by tuning out like when we're in meditation, and we just tune out really not present anymore. That can also be moja or delusion. And we all encounter these three on wholesome roots the streaky Lisa in our meditation in our daily life we probably all have a lot of examples for them. But the good news is that there's also a fourth attitudes, which is the attitude of okayness that we're okay with what happens. And then, then I would call right or wise or skillful attitude. The other three are the unskillful types of attitude. And then you can be all probably have the experience in meditation that we just content with, with whatever is happening we're just okay we're just sitting there we're just in meditation and whatever is happening is just okay. And sometimes it's not only just okay, we feel very wholesome states, maybe stillness or kindness, wonder, equanimity. So when I now go back to that quote that I read earlier, I am content comfortable and at ease with whatever I'm experiencing part of the quote. So now you can maybe recognize that when you're not content comfortable and at ease with what you're experiencing, and likely one of those on wholesome roots, those key Lisa, if popped up. There's greed hatred or delusion presence. And say it all. And I would say the recommends checking out as a checking is any of those key laser as there has that come up as it popped up. What has worked very well for me those last years and I, and I keep using this is this quote is asked myself, am I content comfortable and at ease with what I'm experiencing. And if not, what's going on. I use the second part of the quote which is, do I accept acknowledge and observe whatever is happening, whether pleasant or unpleasant in a relaxed and alert way, especially the weather pleasant or unpleasant. I find very useful because usually the unpleasantness we want to push away. The pleasantness we want to grasp so even if there's something pleasant or unpleasant present can we still accept and acknowledge what's happening in a relaxed and alert way. Or are we pushing or pulling. I feel like we're not content or comfortable or at ease, or we are pushing and pulling on a pleasant or unpleasant. We can really start to be mindful of, of that push and pull of the greed or a version. I'm focusing mainly on agreed and a version because that mo has little more difficult and illusion is more difficult to recognize. I was checking, like, and I felt like I'm not content and at ease at the moment. Now checking like what's going on and, and I felt a little bit of restlessness. Then I was wondering like, why is there restlessness. And I realized it was because I was worrying about not being able to finish certain things on my to do list, and we're urgent. And through a little bit of investigation to a little bit of wondering what's happening. We can sometimes find out what's, what is happening and why we're stressed or irritated or grasping. And we might not always find that out. And that's okay. We know we're anxious, but we're not sure what we're anxious about. And we might ask ourselves like oh what's happening, why is it happening, but we might not get an answer. And that's okay it's about our inquiry it's about the intention of trying to understand what's happening. The, that inquiry that trying to understand this, what's powerful part of it. And then you look at insights like, oh wait, there's just a little bit of worry going on and, and then it already lets go just by seeing it, sometimes it doesn't. That's just nature and it's just the way our minds work in our hearts. And that's what OSS says in that, in that same quote, it's that we all have wrong attitudes. And it's not about trying to have the right attitude, it's not by trying to have be always okay. But it's about recognizing what's present recognizing, do you have the wise or the skillful attitude or is there an unskillful attitude present. And that's the question, the skillful first unskillful attitude is important. And that simple awareness of attitude leads into next part of this exploration, the terrain of wisdom and understanding. And I'd like to read the question that's coming in the online form. The question says, as a shin tissue knee or side of what he has written awareness alone is not enough. Having a desire to really understand what is going on is much more important than just trying to be aware. You practice mindfulness, because we want to understand. He has also written in meditation, you should always try to understand what is happening. And the question is, how does one go about understanding. So, my answer to that would be the engineer describes that wisdom is a part of the mind. We are not. It's not us with wise, it's wisdom as wise, the wisdom's job to understand. The good news is that we don't have to understand ourselves we don't we're not personally responsible for our understanding. Our simple job is to put in place the conditions for understanding and wisdom to arise. And if we put in place those conditions, then nature can do its thing, and then wisdom will naturally arise. So, we need to put in place these conditions and what conditions do we need to put in place. So awareness is the first condition that is needed for wisdom to arise awareness or wisdom can exist without awareness. But, as stated in the question awareness alone is not enough. And it's also the title, one of his books, side of his books. And it's being aware. It's also very helpful to know the attitudes, what I've just discussed with lenses of Loba Dosa and moja. So we're aware and we're checking our attitudes. And then we apply interest. So, are we interested in understanding the mind. So, the interest interest in understanding what the mind is like how suffering comes about, and how to steer in the direction of happiness is what helps wisdom to arise the interested in learning from our experience. That's what's really important for wisdom to be able to to come about. Because, often we experience those, those three types on wholesome on wholesome elaysa. And we just want to, you know, push and pull, but we're not really interested in learning from it. So being cute to like oh I can also maybe learn from all these on wholesome states of mind, and also from the wholesome states of mind. That helps for the process to start the wisdom process. Because in the beginning of our practice we might not really see clearly that these, these three on wholesome roots these tricky laser are actually causing suffering. We all know this example of we all want something really like maybe chocolate cake. And then when we get it, it's such a nice it's a nice experience. I really think that that craving for the chocolate cake has made us happy. But we can experience that the craving itself is not making us happy. When we don't get what we want, then we can feel the pain of the craving. Like the, the other day, I went for a walk and I wanted one to go to the nature park and wanted to go early. You know, life happened so I couldn't go early and it was maybe 45 minutes later than I was wanting to go. But I was in the car and I was like, I really want to go early I was still wanting to go early. Well it was already 45 minutes later. So, it wasn't really useful anymore. But this was really painful this wanting wanting to the situation to be different than it is. I could really feel the pain of that. And maybe you can experience that in your life as well that you feel that you can feel the pain of wanting something. And first of first we can recognize that when we don't get it but after a while we can recognize this also when we do get it. You can recognize that it was a little bit of a cringe inside, maybe, in the heart. So it's very, very helpful in developing wisdom to being interested in what leads to suffering, and what leads to happiness. And just being interested in how the mind works. So this is also kind of we can see that as an intention, it's kind of an intention to learn from what's happening to learn from all our little experiences it can be very small things like what I named to the computer gets angry, the computer is not doing what you want or being having the with the blog, the one thing to be different. And an easy way to keep check in our meditation and in our daily lives of what is happening is to ask ourselves that question, am I content comfortable and at ease with what I'm experiencing right now. And if not, what is happening. And what is the interest in finding that out. So the short answer to how we go about understanding is that we keep check on history on wholesome roots, the glaisa of great hatred and delusion, and that we check our attitudes. That we're interested in what causes suffering and what leads away from suffering towards happiness. And in this way wisdom will arise naturally. As I do audition here, I will close with his words. Examine what is happening and try to learn from it. Try to understand the nature of this kind of mind, try to understand how it works. But this takes time. It will take many such observations for true understanding to arise. Thank you all for your kind attention. Give a little bit of time for some questions if there are any. Or maybe some reflections or sharings. You can unmute yourself. Yeah, you want to. Yeah, Anthony. Yeah, I wanted to hear your. Here you comment on the maybe like the connection between compassion and wisdom. Is there like a connection there of any kind. Are they too. I know they're intertwined but they're both important, you know, for sure. I just wanted to get your. I wanted you to comment a little bit on those those two important and how they interrelate, so to speak. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they're both really needed in our practice. If you take compassion without wisdom, then it might, you know, result in pity or, you know, less wholesome state, really need to visit them to be able to actually experience compassion because compassion is wanting to alleviate other suffering or own suffering. But if we do that from a place where we're not grounded in ourselves and we're overwhelmed with the other suffering or own suffering, then it's not so helpful for the for the person that we're trying to help or the being. So we need the wisdom, you know, to see to stay a quantum as well in our compassion, so that we're not overwhelmed and that we're not getting out of balance ourselves. So the wisdom part in compassion is very important. And when wisdom arises in us. It's kind of a natural thing that that compassion arises as well. Wisdom gives rise to the four Brahms of Yharas in general, so also compassion. So if we if we start to become more wise, we will experience that our compassion and our metta and our joy and our equanimity will grow as well, just together with that. That makes sense. Thank you. That was nice. Thank you. Thank you for the question. David raised his hand. Thank you. The list of content comfortable and at ease. Those are those are three different separate things. At ease makes a lot of sense to me. I'm not an equanimous sort of accepting approach, but content and comfortable both both to me sort of imply almost a happiness around whatever issue it is. I'm asking a lot in a really tough situation. I'm getting better at being at ease but content and comfortable. Can you can you comment at all on sort of the distinction between the three. Yeah, I think it might be just linguistics, like what those do those words mean to you. So, it might be useful for you to just use only at ease, and not the other two. But apart from that, I think, for me contentment has some sort of okayness in it like, and it's all three are kind of like taking a bird's eye perspective and looking through the lens of the contentment to what's happening so if it's something unpleasant. I can see if I can be content with that unpleasantness. And if it's something really strong then it usually doesn't work and then first that strong the strongest of the emotions need to subside more content about it. So, or comfortable. Or for me also at ease. So, if it's really strong then it's, it's much more difficult. For me I would first let those emotions subside more before I get back to the wise attitude, again, and just knowing that there's not wise attitude just knowing that it's doesn't feel okay just knowing that, because that's also just nature that's just what happens to us, we experience these strong emotions and difficult times and. And then we're not okay with what's happening. And that's, and that is then okay as well. That makes sense. Yeah, that's exactly. That goes exactly to my point. Thank you. I, especially acknowledging that just accepting being not okay with something is a productive step. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. And you're still muted. I don't have a very clearly formulated question but I have a clearly formulated situation where, which isn't anticipating for tomorrow. So I'll be interested in your reflections on this so I'm very excited that this heavy rain coming in for the first time for it seems like a couple of years. At the same time tomorrow we're driving from the Bay Area to Sacramento in preparation for a family wedding the next day. So I'm a little bit nervous and fearful about this drive. So, that. So it's anticipatory to I mean in the moment I can say okay well we're setting off and I'm a little uncomfortable with this. And you know wisdom would play in and I would say well you know these are the ways to be safe as safe as we can be but you know the anticipatory and this would apply I think to a lot of anticipatory situations where we're not content because we're anticipating something that's going to happen that might be difficult tomorrow so I guess that's my general question, and how you would apply these teachings to that. Well, I would say it's always easiest to stay in and now. So, anticipating. It's really good what you're saying like yeah of course we can be safe by doing, you know, ABC or whatever. And then, but then, like right now there's really nothing you can do. You're not on the road, you're not, you know, you're not driving there or nothing you know you have taken all your precautions already, as it sounds. So, right now what you can do is just be with feeling that uncomfortableness and feeling the not okayness and feeling the anticipation to the future and that's what's happening right now you're not in a car right now you're not in any danger or anything right like that, hopefully. So that will be my advice to just stay with your present moment experience. And when you're tomorrow in the car, stay with that present moment experience. And if right now, the anticipation of, you know, the worry the anxiety everything's coming up. Then that's what's there right now. And it's unpleasant. And you can recognize that that's suffering, that's, that's, you know, it's not, it's not okay right now. You know, that's a really good point because if I if I experienced the uncomfortable uncomfortableness now but then I make stories up about it then that's just really, you know, increasing the intensity of it so you know I hear what you're saying this is a lesson I have to learn over and over so it's like staying with the body, staying with the uncomfortableness finish what I have to do tonight, going to bed and hopefully relaxing but with the uncomfortableness is there it's there but it doesn't have to have all those words attached to it right. Yeah, exactly. I mean you get yourself going into the stories you can, you can also say like, Oh, to yourself like okay, I'm going into stories again. And sometimes at least for me, when I recognize that it just the stories just stop right there because I recognize them. It's not happening right now it may happen tomorrow, the weather may go away so yeah I hear it. Thank you very much appreciate that. Yeah, thanks for the question. Yeah.
