 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello, greetings, friends. Greetings. Hello, wherever you are in the world. Lovely to be with you in this moment and to practice together. It's so lovely to see all the hellos and greetings. All these expressions of metta that people are expressing from around the world. It's very sweet, very sweet. Warms my heart this morning here. I'm Niki Margafuri in Mountain View, California, on seated Olloni land, a few miles away from IMC. The virtual background of IMC, so we feel we're at home. So today, speaking of being at home, we continue our exploration of the mind's body, not just the body as we take it to be, this fathom-long body, but the mind's body, the way that this physicality, this experience of having a physicality in the world or a perception of a body is impacted by the way we pay attention and vice versa, the way this mind's body or energy body impacts, supports our awakening. Especially if you tend to always do the same thing or pay attention the same way to your breath, to your body. These sessions are especially for you to explore, to open up different pathways, different ways, different impacts. So today in the guided meditation, I'll invite us to explore the impact of attending to the breath, being mindful of the breath in different places, the difference between paying attention to the breath in the abdomen, the chest, the nostrils, the whole body, these all have different impacts. And at different times, different practitioners would be invited to explore. So let's explore together and all you need is a sense of interest, curiosity for your own mind-body laboratory. So here we go. So let us settle, let us arrive. Finding our seat first and foremost. Feeling our sit bones. Feeling ourselves connected to the earth. Sensing, feeling your feet on the earth, your legs, your bottom on the cushion. So relax, let them land, let them be released, connected, connected to the earth. A stable base, stable base. Turning your attention, your awareness intentionally to the sensations of contact. Feeling out, feeling out your legs, your feet, your sit bones, your bottom. Relaxing the upper body, releasing the upper body, the jaw, forehead, neck and shoulders. Chest, abdomen, arms and hands. And noticing, noting, turning the awareness fully wholeheartedly to the lower abdomen to receive the breath. The breath is being breathed on its own. So no need to make it into a project. You don't have to breathe intentionally. It's already happening. It's already happening. So all the doing that we do, if there is any doing, is to receive, is to receive with our awareness the breath. So we are in the abdomen. It's just turning, adverting our attention. A gift is given every moment, this breath, this gift that keeps us alive, this air, this oxygen. Receive it, receive it wholeheartedly. The lower part of the abdomen. Let it ground you. Let it be enjoyable. Let it be enjoyable. Let it be enjoyable. Let it be enjoyable. Let it be enjoyable. What is something about attending to the breath, receiving the breath in the abdomen? How it manifests in the body? What happens in the heart, in the mind that you may have never noticed before? Be interested in this laboratory. Make sure you're relaxed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now with the same ease in the body, feeling relaxed, releasing false muscles, not turning attention awareness to receive the breath in the chest area. Feeling as if the breath was being received from your heart center, the middle of your chest, entering and exiting. Maintaining your heart in this moment in time with each breath. Giving, receiving to the world. Perhaps your good wishes, your kindness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How different it may feel to receive the breath and the chest, the heart center. Compared to the abdomen. Is there something different about your state of mind now? State of your body overall? Is there something different about your state of mind now? State of your body overall? And now, receiving the breath at the nostrils, not inside the nostrils, but outside the nostrils at the upper lip. Is there something different about your state of mind now? Is there something different about your state of mind now? Is there something different about your state of mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now? State of your mind now?
