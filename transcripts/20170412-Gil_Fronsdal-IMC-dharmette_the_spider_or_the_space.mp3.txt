Dharmette: The Spider or the Space?

This week, someone who regularly comes to IMC told 
me a wonderful analogy for himsel f: as a spider , who 
makes a web , and a fl y. You can imagine seeing all 
three of them . The fly is caught in the web that the 
spider has made . This person told me that he realizes  
that his mind is all three. Sometimes he ’s the spider 
who’s making the web that he then gets caught in.  
 
You can imagine that one  of the webs that many of us 
get caught in is our thoughts. We can think wonderful 
thoughts, fascinating thoughts, compelling thoughts , 
and we get stuck . We’re the fly that ’s stuck to those 
thoughts. We can have desires , fears , hostili ty, anger , 
resentment . Who is it that ’s spinning these emotions? 
Somehow we are . Then we get stuck in that web of 
feelings and emotions. So , we’re the spinner, the web , 
and what gets caught in it.   
 
Then the person said  that there ’s actually a fourth thing. 
We can identify with being the spider, the doer ; with 
being the glue, the web ; and with being the one who ’s 
stuck in the web. All three are possible. But then there ’s 
a fourth thing : the air around it  all. There’s space . And that air, that space, flows freely through the web. It flows 
completely and intimately  around the spider  and the fly . 
In a sense it ’s not connected, but it  is in touch with 
everything. It ’s not separate  from any thing , and i t’s free , 
fluid, relaxed, and open with it all.  
 
In the same way, in our minds, there are ways we are 
spinning . We’re  the spinner, the doer for all kind s of 
things . We spin these things , and then get caught in 
them . We’re the one who ’s caught. But there ’s also a 
certain kind of space all around everything . The space 
that we talk about in Buddhist practice is the space of 
awareness. Awareness doesn’t need  to be stuck. It can 
be intimate with the experience. It ’s in touch with it, but 
it just passes through  it, around it . It doesn ’t hold onto 
any of it . There’s lots of space.  
 
Today I met  with someone  who may be dying, or 
preoccupied with dying . I said to her, “Imagine that you 
go to a beach on the coast, and it ’s a beautiful day . The 
ocean is wide . The horizon is far away and spacious . 
The sky is open and blue . You’re sitting in a nice beach 
chair . What’s it like for you to do that? In that moment 
you’ve accomplished everything that’s needed. Y ou’ve 
had a nice hike . Everything ’s going well for you , and you  
have no preoccupation s. You’re just there . What would 
it be like for you to just sit there , looking at th e ocean? ” 
She said , “It would be spacious , beautiful , awe-inspiring , 
and fantastic to sit there. ”   
Then I said, “What if it ’s the last minute of your life ? 
Would you rather be sitting there in that spacious 
openness  looking out? O r would you rather be caught in 
the web of your thoughts , and all you haven ’t 
accomplished , and what you ’re leaving behind , and 
thinking  there must be a solution : “I have to figure out 
some way to get healthy quickly because... ”? What 
would  you rather do in those last seconds ?” She said , 
“I’d rather look at that space .”  
 
That spaciousness is available all the time  – not just by 
going to the beach. That spaciousness is intimate and 
connected to what ’s happening here and now . But it is 
fluid, free, and not caught by anything . It doesn ’t stick to 
the web. So , can there be a shift of perspective?  
 
Part of what Buddhism is pointing to is a shift of 
perspective. We are not the spider ; we don ’t identify 
with the spider . We don ’t identify with the web, the 
attachments, the concerns, the thoughts, the feelings. 
We don’t identify with the fly ; we don’t identify with the 
one who ’s caught and who’s suffering . We open up 
more widely and see the spaciousness, the openness, 
the freedom . There is  something that is actually not 
caught . It’s always here , and has qualities like being at 
the ocean , looking out at the space . It is not a thing in 
the world like the ocean scene is . It’s an aspect of the 
spaciousness of awareness  – the spaciousness of the mind that ’s always here.  
 
How would you like to spend yo ur last moments being 
alive? Would you rather be caught up in whatever you r 
normal web is ? Or in those last moments, would you 
rather be in that spacious, open, place of peaceful 
awareness  – like looking at the ocean, the horizon , in a 
space where there is no time ?  
 
In a sense, there is no death, no dying, no being, no 
identity, no problems . It’s just timeless. Y ou can talk 
about time, but this is a timeless moment. There  are no 
problems . There’s no nothing . No thoughts have to be 
there. You ’re just there. So , for the last moment s of your 
life, where would you rather be : one or the other?  
 
But why wait until the last moments? Maybe this wider 
perspective  – being  free, at ease, and peaceful with 
how things are  – maybe that ’s possible now !  
 
It’s your choice. The spider , the web , the fly – or the 
freedom, the openness , the space  – the awareness that 
can hold it all , and which is  the container for it all ? 
 
And if you ’re the spider, at least try to enjoy it [laughter].
