Dharmette : A Zen Poem  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on April 13 , 2011  
 
 
These last days I’ve been thinking about a poem by 
Ryokan, a  Japanese Zen monk. He lived in the 1700s or 
so. He apparently spent a lot of time living in a small , 
one-room hut in the woods , far away from the trappings 
of institutional Zen. He didn’t become a great teach er. 
He didn’t have a big monastery or a lot of students. 
They say he  lived a very simple life , like a hermit . He 
was famous for liking to play with the children in the 
nearby village. He woul d play ball with them. He’d be 
like a little kid himself. He also wrote poetry  about his 
somewhat solitary life,  practice , and way of living. This 
is one poem :  
 
In the still night by the vacant window , 
wrapped in monk’s robe  I sit in meditation,  
navel and nostrils lined up straight , 
ears paired  to the slope of shoulders.  
Window whitens – the moon comes up; 
Rain’s stopped, but drops go on dripping . 
Wonderful – the mood of this moment – 
distant, vast, known only to me!  
 On the surface of this poem , it was probably a 
description of what it was like for him meditati ng some 
night in h is little one -room hut in the middle of the 
woods. Apparently there wasn’t much in his hut.  
 
There’s another poem where he writes of coming home 
and some  thieves ha d robbed him of everything he had 
in his little hut. He wrote this poem:  
 
The thieves, the thieves,  
they left it behind – 
the moon in the window.  
 
So he’s meditating seriously  in his hut. He’s probably 
cold, wrapped in his monk’s robes. I was a monk in 
Japan and I remember sitting in the cold , wrapped in 
monk’s robes. It was ki nd of a nice feeling. I sat in the 
monastery in Japan during the full moon outdoors on 
the balcony overlooking the rock garden. It was terribly 
cold – shaved heads – but you’re wrapped up in your 
robe. It’s quite something to be sitting there in the 
stillness of the night meditating. He described himself 
sitting straight  in meditation, sitting in zazen .  
 
Navel and nostrils lined up straight,  
ears paired  to the slope of shoulders.  
 
When he was sitting straight, he was aligned. He wasn’t 
slouching or falling asl eep. He was really sitting well, strong , stable , and present. Then  the window whitens , 
because the moon is coming up. I imagine that out in 
the woods , it’s pretty spectacular to see the full  moon 
coming up , and th e light that comes  with it . It’s quite 
something.  
 
Then  the rain stops. So now you find out it has been 
raining. I’ve had the experience of meditating in a small 
hut in the woods or vario us places , and the same thing  
happens. Rain comes pouring down on these little roofs , 
and it’s quite something to hear the clatter of the rain. I 
find it very comforting to sit inside when it’s raining. I’m 
dry, and it’s really still and quiet. There’s also all this 
noise – rain and wet. It’s quite comfortable. It feel s 
intimate , close , and still. It’s a very nice fee ling. But here 
the rain stopped. It  had been raining . It now has 
stopped, but  the drops go on dripping. You can still hear 
the rain drops dripping from the eaves of the roof. And 
he says:  
 
Wonderful – the moo d of this moment – 
distant, vast, known only to me!  
 
There’s a strong mood, feeling , or sense of sitting there 
in thi s beautiful, still, quiet place. The feeling is one of 
vastness , and great distance  with no limit  perhaps, even 
though it’s a small, impove rished one -room hut. This 
renuncia nt has nothing. The thieves have taken 
everything with t hem. He doesn’t have much left, except probably his robes and his bowl. But the re is a sense of 
great vastness, openness, space , and freedom 
probably. Then  he makes an interesting statement : 
“Known only to me!” I don’t think he means he’s the only 
person in history who has ever had an experience like 
that. I think what he means is that  it’s very personal, 
intimate , and something yo u could only have for 
yourself. You can’t explain it to  someone else , or borrow 
it from  someone else. It’s something that’s very 
personal. So he has this very intimate and personal  
immediacy of sitting there in the stillness of meditation 
in the woods with  the moon coming up. Probably if you 
use your imagination , you can imagine a little bit what 
that experience was like. Maybe you have had  
something similar.  
 
With many of these Zen poems in Japan , there’s the 
surface meaning , and then there’s  the symbolic . The 
two go hand in hand. There probably  was an experience 
like this that he actually had , so the surface meaning is 
real. But then there’s the symbolic meaning of the 
poem. There  might be symbols that I don’t understand , 
but the full moon coming up is a symbol of 
enlightenment or awakening.  
 
in a Japanese poem , when they  talk about seeing the  
full moon , they’re talking about awakening. One the 
most famous uses of  the symbol is the expression , 
“Don’t confuse the finger with the moon ,” as you’re pointing at the moon . This means  that when someone 
talks about awakening or freedom , the talk itself is not 
freedom. The description is not it. Don’t mistake  the 
finger for the moon. So here the moon comes up, and 
awakening, freedom , or some kind of profound peace 
surfaces for him. Sometimes , it comes with a sense of 
white. One of the reasons that the moo n is used is th at 
there can be a luminosity in the mind that sometimes 
occurs . 
 
So the rain  has stopped . The rain  and clouds are 
usually  what obs cures the moon. Generally  we can’t 
see it when it’s raining. In order for the moon to come , 
the rain has to stop , and the clouds have to go away. So 
this is all the defilements, attachments,  and 
preoccupations the mind  has. We always  get caught up 
in concerns for the world. All that has to come to a stop. 
The rain is like the weather – it comes and goes. So 
probably it’s going to rain for him again [ laughs] . It’s not 
like it stops raining once and for all. But it ’s settled  and 
fallen away – all the concerns  and preoccupations in his 
mind have fallen away. It’s a  beauti ful thing to have a 
mind and  heart that is not caught , or needs  anything. I t’s 
not trying to defend itself, apologize , or prove anything – 
just there.   
 
One of the descriptions of an araha nt, someone who is 
fully awakened in the  early  tradition, is someone who has nothing : akiñcano is the word  in Pāli for  someone 
who has nothing.  
 
Because it’s  a Japanese poem and not an Indian poem, 
it goes on and says , “But the drops go on dripping.” I t’s 
not completely there. There’s still some little left over, 
and it’s not completely dry. The sense of the moon 
coming up, the rain having stopped, and the defilements 
falling away, but there’s still something a little bit left . 
Some of the traces of that  old way or  that old karma  is 
operating  and is still there.  
 
To me , when I read these Japanese poems , there is  a 
recognition of a common humanity. We’re not 
measu ring ourselves by perfection , which  is often the 
Indian approach  – looking for absolute perfe ction. The 
Japanese are much more willing to live in a human 
world which is not quite perfect. So here the drops go 
on dripping , and in spite of that , it’s wonderf ul to have 
the mind open, clear, vast, and spacious enough that , 
even if the imperfections  – the defilements – are still 
there , it’s okay. There’s  no need to take them 
personally , or to be upset  by them , or react to them. It 
just drops  – stuff coming and going.   
 
Then  the mood of this moment : “distant, vast. ” It’s one 
of the wonder ful paradoxes that you can have a sense 
of tim eless presence , but it’s happening now. It’s 
happening at 12:01. How could something  timeless happen at 12:01 [ laughs] ? But the mood is of this 
moment : “distant, vast, known only to me. ” This “known 
only to me,” I think , is a very powerful statement. He 
was alone in his hut , so there was really no one to share 
it with. But can you really share it with anyone else? Or 
to say it differently, there’s no need to share it with 
anyone  else. It ’s just there. It’s so  intimate, present , and 
complete in itself. It just is what it is. It’s enough.  
 
I find this poem evocative and very rich. It’s the kind of 
poem that sometimes you can read and reread , and it 
raise s questions , perspectives, or a different way of 
looking or understanding.  
 
In the still night by the vacant window,  
wrapped in monk’s robe I sit in meditation,  
navel and nostrils lined up straight,  
ears paired to the slope of shoulders.  
Window whitens – the moon comes up;  
Rain’s stop ped, but drops go on dripping.  
Wonderful – the mood of this moment – 
distant, vast, known only to me!  
 
So I hope that all of you will have  a chance to sit 
peacefully and quietly at the edge of your window at 
home. May it be vast, distant , and very personal in a 
wonderful way. Thank you.
