The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, here we go.
Little smiley face, thank you. Thank you.
Okay, so I started with this idea of just this inquiry of why do we practice mindfulness?
What brings us to the cushion?
What brings us to the synoderma talks or to have a meditation practice,
whether it's regular every day or not, any meditation practice?
What brings us to the cushion?
And there are so many different answers to this question,
but one might include that we want to feel some ease.
We want to feel some peace, we want to feel a sense of well-being,
that we want to have some freedom from physical suffering, emotional suffering,
some difficulties that we're having.
Or maybe we want to have a sense of fulfillment or contentment,
this sense of it's a little bit more satisfying to sit in our cushion
rather than just be going through our lives, perhaps not completely engaged,
but to be engaged with our experience while we're sitting on the cushion.
Maybe that brings a sense of satisfaction.
Another reason we might be practicing meditation is to
help support the sense of open-heartedness or balance
that can really support us in a life of service,
coming from some compassion in which we might help others, support others.
Help cultivate and develop a spirit of caring
that's this open-heartedness that allows us to approach those who need care and support
without getting thrown off balance.
So that could be a reason why we practice mindfulness.
Maybe another reason is just to gain some greater understanding.
Understand what are some of our habits of mind?
What are some of our habits of behavior?
What are some of the ways that we are inclined to behave or
some of the ways that why do we find ourselves often doing the same things
and the same types of situations?
So to learn about what are some of the things that we do repeatedly,
what are our patterns?
I could go on and on.
There's a number of different reasons why we practice mindfulness,
but I think most of us consciously or maybe unconsciously,
maybe it's not in the front of our minds,
but we would like meditation to be kind of a chill-out session
where we don't have to relate to any unpleasantness,
where there can just be a certain amount of ease.
There can be these other things too,
but I think many of us would like meditation to be a peaceful,
easeful experience.
Actually, it's not uncommon.
Many people have this idea that that's what meditation is all about
and some types of meditation and in some settings it is about that,
about finding ease.
But mindfulness practice,
that type of practice that's really going to make a difference in our life,
that's going to be transformative,
includes this practice of this too, right,
that we bring in whatever our experience is,
including the unpleasant ones,
including the difficult ones,
which of course means that our meditation experience
cannot always be easeful and peaceful.
And some of what we're bringing into with this this too practice
is difficult emotions.
Or just maybe they're not even difficult,
they're just emotions and they're kind of like loud quote-unquote,
they have a certain energy to them
or a certain activation to them.
I would like to say that mindfulness,
while it can bring some ease,
what it really can bring,
where the kind of the real power is,
is with it to bring in freedom.
Freedom to make a choice to behave a little bit differently
than what our patterns are.
To behave and to think in a way that enables more choices
to go a different direction
than perhaps the ways that we have been going.
And of course this includes the way with our emotions.
So meditation practice is a way in which we can have some more choice
in the way that we are with our emotions
and the way that we relate to our emotions.
Does it mean we get to choose which emotions we have?
Does it mean that we get to only have,
okay I'm just going to have the positive, pleasant ones
and not have the ones that I don't want?
We don't get to do that.
But it allows us to have freedom
that we can have the capacity to be with whatever emotion is arising.
Whatever emotion that we're experiencing.
I think I might have heard this from Gail the first time.
This idea of emotion.
Like emotion, this movement, that emotions like move through us.
That's the natural way that they arise and pass away.
But it's not their nature themselves to get stuck,
to get calcified, concretized, reified, stuck.
But instead to move through us.
But of course it's not our experience.
Often our experiences are that they are getting stuck.
And we kind of like get tangled up with them
and then they stop flowing.
And there can be a lot of this mental proliferation
for those of you who know this expression,
a lot of story making, well this happened
and then because that happened this other thing is going to happen
and because that other thing happened it reminded me of this
and that other thing that reminded me of this
made me think of that other thing
and then we just kind of like,
there might be a certain repetition
but we're not really going anywhere.
So rather than emotion flowing through,
it's kind of stuck and maybe we create like a dam
when there's just this lake that's not really moving.
And maybe even the,
maybe I'm taking this little too far, this analogy,
but maybe even the lake we imagine there's a Loch Ness monster in it
or we're afraid that we'll forget how to swim
or we already know how to swim
or there won't be any boats or whatever it might be.
So notice that I'm not saying that being mindful of emotions
is about not having only pleasant emotions as I said,
but also we don't want to think that we will only have
what's quote unquote like the appropriate emotions
from normal whatever that is in emotions.
Whatever ideas that we might find in some psychology textbooks
or maybe even the Dharma teacher saying about emotions,
whatever ideas we might have about emotions,
it's important to recognize that that's culturally situated,
historically situated.
You know, just whatever group that we're in,
whatever culture that we're in including Dharma culture
or whatever religious culture
or whatever national or ethnic heritage,
they all have their own ideas
or their own expressions of what are of emotions.
And so there's a large range
of what we might consider what's appropriate
or what's healthy or what's normal.
And to be careful into thinking that there's like one particular way
in which we should be
and in which our emotional life should be.
Instead I would say that the human experience of emotions,
what they are, what they,
I don't know how they get expressed
or where they arise
and what affects the magnitude of them,
I don't think human beings will ever get to the end of that exploration,
the idea that, okay, we got them all figured out
and have a little algorithm
and you know, just do this, say that
and then you will have only these emotions
and not those or something like that.
I don't think that's possible.
I don't think that's what the human experience is about,
so I hate to disappoint you
if you have this idea that finally
you'll be able to completely figure it out
exactly how to have only the emotions you want
and the emotions you don't want.
So mindfulness of emotions isn't about that.
Instead, as I said, it's about finding freedom.
Freedom we can translate as finding,
being able to have a choice
and the way that we are with our emotions,
the way that we relate to them
and whether we get cut up by them
in the grip of them or overwhelmed by them,
mindfulness allows us to not be in the grip of them,
to not be overwhelmed,
means we might still be experiencing them, of course.
So emotions, we can think of them as a form of communication
from ourselves to ourselves.
So in this way, that's emotions are an opportunity to learn about ourselves.
But of course we can only learn
if we allow the emotion to be there
and we observe it in some kind of way.
If we're always trying to bat it away
or hit it over the head with a mallet
or something like this,
then there isn't an opportunity for us to receive the message
that emotions are trying to tell us.
So what are these emotions?
What are these messages?
Some of them can be
but our barriers are being crossed,
but it's not appropriate behavior.
Maybe that communication that it is a loss,
that we are experiencing a loss.
Or maybe it's a communication
that not a loss, but that there's been a gain,
there's been a boon,
and it supports us,
supports the life that we want to have.
So in this way, emotions can help mobilize us
and motivate us.
We can think about the physiology
in which often when we're angry,
like blood flows to the hands.
We might even find ourselves making fists or something.
I know in TV or movies,
if we're ever watching them without any sound,
often like the actors, this is what they'll do,
is make a fist as a way to indicate that they're angry,
whether or not they're actually saying anything.
Or even if they were saying something,
but we've turned the volume off,
we could just tell, right?
In the same way, when we're afraid,
blood flows to the legs so that we might be able to run.
So the emotions have this physiological correlate
or a physiological aspect that can motivate us.
Or can affect our attention
when we have fear.
Our attention can get really focused
and it becomes very clear that what I need to do right now
to take care of myself or to take care of my loved one
or whatever the fear is about.
There's lots of ways in which emotions affect our physiology
and of course our behavior too.
If we think of embarrassment as an emotion,
if all of a sudden we feel embarrassed,
then we'll stop doing whatever it is
that was the source of the embarrassment.
So in this way, emotions are composites.
They are not one simple thing.
There's physical aspects of them.
There's sensations at the guided meditation.
I asked you to check in to see
if there are some physical sensations associated
with whatever mood that you are experiencing.
There might be a knot in the throat
if there's fear or sadness, for example.
There might be a sense of opening or warmth
in the chest and the heart center
when there's some tenderness or love
or there might be sadness felt in the eyes.
I'm just offering these.
I think all of us have our own ways
in which we experience physical sensations
that go with the emotions.
There's also, of course, expressions.
Earlier I talked about making fists
but there's our faces, right?
So expressive, whether we want them to be or not,
have our emotions.
And then, of course, there's the mind states
whether there's a certain amount of, like,
the thoughts going really fast
or maybe there's a sense of ease and expansion.
So an emotion is not just one thing.
It's not one thing that we can just put our finger on
and say, oh, that's sadness.
Instead, there's some physical sensations.
There's mental experiences.
There's expressions.
And so when we think about or talk about
mindfulness of emotions,
we can talk about mindfulness of any of these
different aspects.
Whether it's the bodily experience
or it's the quality of the mind
or the thoughts going really quickly
or are they expanded.
Or maybe to the expressions
in our face.
So part of the way in which being mindful
of our emotions can be helpful
is that it can help us to tune into our experience.
Which can help us to have some greater understanding.
Bringing some curiosity
to whatever emotion we are experiencing
can help us to observe it a little bit more
and in that way not to be so much under the grip of it
or to feel overwhelmed with it.
And this way, for example,
we might discover if we're able to
just hang out with a warm hearted, gentle way
grief.
We might see that there's other emotions also.
So grief may include some deep sorrow.
There might be elements of fear.
There might be elements of hopelessness.
There might be a sense of powerlessness.
Maybe a little bit of anger.
Maybe there's some poignancy or
maybe a sense of relief
when we finally are feeling the grief.
Maybe we've been holding it back.
So we can see with mindfulness
might help us to see that
not only are emotions composite events
but even emotions themselves are composites.
There might be some emotions
that are underneath the surface ones.
And in this way there can be a greater understanding
of both of ourselves what's really happening.
But it can start to unpack,
undo any of this sense of
there's this emotion out there
that's this big black box, for example,
or something that we can't see into.
There's no light that's getting in.
We're not able to shine the beam of mindfulness.
Instead it feels like a place in which we can't see anything
but maybe we don't even want to, it's scary.
We can bring a little bit of mindfulness
and start to see that there's so many different elements there
that it becomes a little bit more alive for us
and maybe not as overwhelming.
We can see there's different aspects
and just choose to be with one aspect
including to be with the sensations in the body.
This, of course, is a way in which we can bring
our experience here into the present moment.
Of course the body is here in the present moment.
And that one advantage, of course,
not only being in the present moment
but if we bring our attention to the felt experience,
it can interrupt kind of like maybe
some of what's happening in the mind.
And instead it can transform or deconstruct
this emotion which we had kind of constructed
into this big blob, maybe a scary blob.
We can deconstruct it into its elements
including the sensations in the body
and then just be with the sensations in the body.
Be with the tightness in the throat.
If we're going to be sad, maybe the feeling behind the eyes.
For me sometimes when I feel sad
there's a real heaviness in the shoulders also.
And then just to be with the sensations
of heaviness in the shoulders or the sadness.
And this way of deconstructing the emotions
by paying attention to the physical experience of them
by recognizing that there are physical experiences
and there's a mind state
and there might be other emotions all mixed in together.
By recognizing that we can deconstruct them
also helps us to notice that they are constructed.
That these are composites,
that these are made, they're fabricated,
that they are made of,
they're created out of a whole bunch of different elements.
And there can be something deep inside of us
that recognizes that, oh, things that are constructed
can be deconstructed.
Things that are conditioned can fall away.
And in fact, this is exactly the way
in which emotions move through.
We use this expression, move through.
They arise and pass away.
I'm even doing this movement with my hands
like they're moving through space.
But we might also use this language
in which they're constructed, deconstructed.
There's a way in which they're fabricated
as opposed and also kind of like calcified,
but they can be deconstructed,
unfabricated, unmade in some kind of way.
And this is where freedom is too.
There's freedom in this recognition that
they arise and they pass away.
There's a construction that happens
without any entity that's doing the construction.
The construction that happens
and we can deconstruct them
with our mindfulness practice.
And that part of our practice is to notice this process
not only with our emotions,
but with so many different aspects of our experience.
And dare I say, with all of our aspects of our experience.
So practicing to be with our emotions
can be an integral part of our freedom
in all areas of our lives.
So it can help us immediately
when we're experiencing difficult emotions
or even when we're experiencing pleasant ones
or ordinary, not difficult or particularly pleasant ones.
Then notice how they're made up of different elements.
Notice how there's a physical sensation
and notice how the elements maybe seem to shift and change.
And in this way,
in this way they can be a great teacher for us
to find more freedom in all areas of our lives.
So that our capacity to be with difficulties
can increase to support ourselves
and to support others.
So that our capacity to serve others,
to hear what others have to say
and to help them through their difficult emotions
or whatever difficulties they're experiencing.
So in this way,
working with emotions
can help us,
can help the whole world.
Thank you.
