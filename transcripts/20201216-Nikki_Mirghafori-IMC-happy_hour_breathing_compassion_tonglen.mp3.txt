The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, hello and welcome everyone.
Hello and welcome to happy hour, this rendition of it.
So, as I close my eyes and actually feel myself in my body,
I invite you to feel you, feel yourself, feel your body in this moment.
And just arrive.
Arrive here right now as I introduce the theme for a couple of minutes.
Before we even start the meditation, arrive, it's important to arrive.
And here with different ears.
So, today's theme is somewhat related to what we practiced on Monday.
But of course, always a little different.
So, on Monday we did a practice of compassion as dedicating,
as a dedication of our suffering, our suffering for the benefit,
for the alleviation of suffering of others.
So, it was practice and compassion in a particular way.
And I mentioned on Monday during the introduction that this practice
is related to two different practices.
Is related to Tongalan practice, which is a practice in Tibetan Buddhism.
And it's also related to the practice of dedication.
Dedication in general, which is what we do.
For example, dedication at the end of every session when we practice,
we dedicate the goodness, the merit that has been generated.
So, I'd like to explore the practice of Tongalan this evening,
this morning, wherever you are.
And maybe on Friday we'll see what comes up.
Maybe we'll explore the practice of dedication in its own right.
But for today, we will explore Tongalan.
So, Tongalan is one way of practicing compassion,
practice of compassion for the world, for ourselves.
And it's also sometimes referred to an active breathing,
active breathing, compassion practice.
So, essentially, these are the three parts of Tongalan.
I'll break it down and then I'll introduce it and we'll do it together.
So, the main part, the main thing to bring attention to in Tongalan
is a sense of transformation.
So, basically, the basics of the practice are breathing in, suffering,
letting it be transformed into healing, into goodness,
and then breathing out, goodness, healing, well wishes.
That's the idea, breathing in, suffering as if a cloud, as if a smoke.
So, basically, as you're breathing in, you're imagining that you're breathing in,
suffering of yourself or others, letting it be transformed,
and then with the out-breath, you imagine that your out-breath is sharing,
goodwill, goodwill, your compassion, your wish for alleviation of suffering
for yourself and all beings.
So, one power of this practice of compassion, Tongalan,
is that it gets connected to our breath, to the process of breathing in-breath, out-breath.
So, with each breath, we're practicing compassion, which can feel really embodied.
And you can imagine that we're breathing into our heart center,
so it can feel really centered, embodied, connected with the breath, this sense of compassion.
One thing that often trips people up is this idea that,
oh, it's overwhelming, I don't want to be breathing in and holding my heart,
who am I, the little me, to breathe all this into my heart and transform it.
So, the invitation, actually, is that your heart, imagining that your heart center,
is this powerful, shiny, bright transformer.
It is yours, and it's not yours.
As you breathe in and out, it gets transformed, so it doesn't stay.
It's not as if you are taking on the challenges of the world.
You are holding witness, you are holding witness to this process happening,
and realizing the capacity of your heart more than you ever imagined.
I'll repeat this part one more time, because this is where people get hung up,
so please listen carefully.
You are holding witness to the process of transformation,
of suffering as it's breathed in,
into this amazing capacity of your heart for transformation, for care, for love,
and as it's shared with the world.
Opening up to this incredible beauty, grace, that's beyond space and time,
so you, whoever you are, are not taking it all on, even though it may feel that way.
So pay attention to that, okay?
Without further ado, allow me to lead you into exploring the practice of compassion as Tong-Glen.
I'd like to invite you to get settled
in your body in this moment in time,
and just connecting with the breath, simply connecting with the breath.
With the each breath allowing your body to relax, soften, blend.
Letting your body be relaxed and yet you're back to be straight, having a sense of integrity in your sitting, in your posture.
Allowing the breath to be received in your abdomen for now.
Settling, soothing, calming your whole body.
Each in breath and out breath.
Letting go of the balloons of thought and let them float away.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Feeling settled in the body with the breath.
Allowing the breath to be received now both in the abdomen.
And further up in your trunk, in your heart center, the middle of the chest.
Then allowing your awareness to rest.
When the time is right, only on the chest, the heart center, the breath.
Or received as if entering, as if the breath is entering through the middle of your chest, your heart center.
Yes, there is a fire alarm, where I am. I'm going to see if it's a false alarm.
And I'll continue for a moment. Equanimity and peace in the midst of it all.
And if it continues, I would have to stop your session. I'll give it a minute.
Thank you for watching.
Let's continue with silent practice.
And I should leave. I'll leave the room open. We'll continue to practice in community and in silence for the next 15 minutes.
I'll join on my phone from the parking lot. Let's keep practicing compassion for all beings who are in distress.
