 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello everyone. And here we are on Monday. And for this week's theme, and for the next actually maybe four or five weeks, I would like to go progressively through the basic instructions that we give here at IMC for mindfulness meditation. Normally we'll do a five-week introduction to meditation course. Some of you have probably done it with us. And it's available, the course, on Audio Dharma. And it follows a sequence where it's five weeks and one evening a week. And the first week we talk about just introduction to mindfulness and then mindfulness of breathing. And then the next week we talk about mindfulness of the body. As people settle into meditation, the body often becomes very loud or clear, often because it gets uncomfortable if you're not used to meditating. And then the next week we talk about mindfulness of emotions and then mindfulness of thinking. The fifth week there's a range of things that are talked about. And that sequence is meant to kind of steadily lay the groundwork to a time when all those ways are practicing, all those areas are integrated together into a whole, where we're practicing mindfulness, where depending on what is compelling, what is predominant, what's happening the most, we might be aware of breathing, the body, the emotions, thoughts, and other experiences of our life. And this ability to develop an awareness that's available, mindfulness is available, to the full range of our human experience is the goal of mindfulness practice. And that's valuable for many reasons. One reason it's valuable is then we have a heightened attention to so many areas of our life. Things don't remain unconscious. Things don't remain unknown or kind of sidelined. Everything sooner or later comes through the view, the knowing of awareness and seen clearly. Also, as we do this practice, over time we start appreciating more and more what it is to be aware, what it is to be mindful. And in particular, noticing all the extra baggage we bring along that we put on top of the simplicity of awareness, the expectations we have, the idea that we have to do a lot of things, the idea of being an agent and I have to prove myself or I shouldn't fail, that it's all up to me, me, myself, and mine to do it. We might come with fears around being aware and being aware of what's coming along. There might be more of these kind of things we bring along with it. We might have really big goals like ambitions around meditation that we bring along. And as we become more and more aware of all this extra stuff we bring along, we can start kind of shedding them and discovering the simplicity of awareness itself. And part of that simplicity eventually is that awareness exists, can be present without us doing it. And awareness becomes kind of autonomous from our doing. Our role is to allow for it, to stay close to it. And it's a magical time, a special time to feel that awareness is just kind of the nature of who we are. And we don't have to insert the self and agency and doing into it. And there's a shift in mindfulness that for someone who's a raw beginner, the practice does involve doing. We're engaging in something that's changing the direction, changing the course of how our life is going, from just letting ourselves wander off in thought and desires and aversions and just kind of be caught up in things, to waking up, to not being lost in the world, but being present in the middle of our experience. They're really present, really centered here. And there's a doing coming back. And so applying ourselves to the breathing, applying ourselves to the body, to these different areas that we pay attention to, there's a sense of applying oneself and doing it. And partly that's because it's an alternative to being lost. As that builds over time, this sense of autonomous awareness, independent awareness becomes stronger and stronger. And then awareness is more like receives experience. Things arrive in awareness. Awareness is not something we have to do. It's more something we allow. And there can be a sense that things just arrive or arise within awareness. And awareness becomes freer and freer of even the sense of me being a doer, the doer, the agent. In a sense, awareness becomes independent of the usual ways in which we identify who we are, me, myself and mine. And so the awareness, and so the mindfulness instructions that we give have two sides to it. It can have the side of something we do. And so it's prescriptive, this is what we do. And that's often the case for some different beginners, but at different phases of life, different levels of what's happening in our life. It's always coming and going, these different ways of practicing, depending on what's needed at a time. If we're experienced practitioners, really frazzled and agitated, they might be better off applying themselves to the meditation. But as prescriptively, the other way that mindfulness works, instructions work, it's more like, they're not instructions what to do, but it's instructions what to notice. So it's descriptive of what arrives in awareness when awareness is established. Awareness established, it gathers together, allows to arrive the experience of breathing, the experience of the body, the experience of emotions, the experience of thoughts. And there's a radical shift from being a doer to being an allower. And that allowing allows for a different way of participating in the world. That's still very effective, but very different than being all up to me, myself, and myself to do and be, and all this stuff. So in these next days, I'm going to talk more about breathing. And what I want to do for each of these, try to do each of these five days of each week of this series, I want to repeat the same kind of theme around each of them so that these become a little bit more familiar, regular, available to you at different times to really understand different facets of this practice. So on Mondays, and I'm not going to do much time now, but Mondays, the theme is going to be relaxation. And Tuesdays, the theme will be recognition. Wednesday's theme will be respect. Thursday, the theme will be restoring. And Friday will be release. So we'll look at each of these things, hopefully, and look at these different aspects of the practice in relationship to breath, body, emotions and thoughts, and then whatever we do the following weeks. And so relaxation with the breathing, we did that little bit in the guided meditation. Part of the function of coming back to the breath over and over and over again, the mind wanders off and we come back, is that if we return to the breathing, is the breathing then is the anchor for having awareness established. And we relax. It isn't so much that we force ourselves back to the breath, but it's more like we welcome ourselves back to the breath over and over and over again. So the breathing, the regularity of breathing takes the energy away from other, from ways that we're tense, tense around our thoughts, tense around our emotions, caught up in things. And the more preoccupied we are in thinking, the more tension there is in the system, more force and pressure there is. And this gentle returning to the breathing, returning to be aware of the breathing begins to take away some of that energy that goes and keeps in the mind and the heart and the body tense from our concerns. And then in addition, the regularity of breathing helps us to relax the rhythm of breathing for many of us. And so you can even help that by allowing yourself to relax on the exhale, relax gently, openly. For some people, this focus of breathing is difficult. Sometimes that's normal enough and it's just a process to work through that and be gentle and patient and not make a problem out of how difficult it might be, the tension or the holding patterns of the breathing or controlling the breath or something. And it's well worth kind of spending time to see if you can kind of work through it. For some people, if the breathing is not really the appropriate object for attention. And I've known people, for example, who had maybe a near-death experience of drowning or something else. It was very difficult for them where breath was really a challenge. And so the memory of that or the impact of that is such that breathing never really becomes a good place to meditate. And so for them, sometimes body, just being rooted in the body, kind of being grounded here in the body in some open way is much better. There are other options as well. But it's really nice to work through some of the difficulty, if possible, around breathing and relaxing is a big part of it. Learn to relax with the breath. So that's the plan for this next period of time. And I'm hoping that this instructions and teaching I give will work both for people who are beginners or new, but also there'll be support for the people who are quite experienced in practice as well. The beginning practice is the practice. And sometimes the more mature people become in this practice, the difference between a beginner and a mature person is that a mature person is a better beginner, more thorough beginner. And finally, I gave kind of said some of this, but also a little bit more yesterday morning for the Sunday morning talker at IMC, a talk that was kind of done as an introduction to this series that we're doing here now. So some of you haven't, if you haven't heard that, you might go and listen to that half an hour. And it also sets the stage a little bit for what we're doing. So thank you for today. And I'm looking forward to sharing something that is so something I love quite a bit. So thank you.
