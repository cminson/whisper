The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So yesterday we had a shift in this teachings of Satipatana in the second
half of the third foundation and it's a shift to a state of mind that is an
outcome of cultivating awareness. An outcome of no longer prioritizing states
of greed, hatred, and delusion or thoughts or attitudes of greed, hatred, and
delusion and all its subsidiary kind of common ways in which we get caught in
thought, limited by our thoughts and thinking, where we are excessively
focused on objects of awareness, objects of attention. If I suddenly
started thinking about how it'd be nice to replace a carpet at home and then
I'm very mindful of the carpet here at IMC, the I'm focusing on it and I'm so
studying it that I even lose touch with what I'm talking about to you because
that becomes the important thing is to, you know, the object of attention becomes
carpets. But in that focus on carpets, I'm certainly present and mindful for it
but that's not really the arising of awareness which is free, awareness
which is present for things but knows its presence, not lost and caught up in the
activity. So this mindfulness begins developing stronger, when stronger
there's the sense of awareness is not limited or bound by what the object of
attention is. And as awareness keeps developing, that sense of awareness not
being bound or limited but being larger is partly represented by a sense and
there's feeling, a sense of knowing that we know, we know, we know we're aware.
The awareness is not submerged in something, the awareness is kind of
like the lotus growing out of the muddy water. The lotus is not blossoming
underwater in the mud, it comes out of the water to blossom. So the mind, the
awareness blossoms and becomes kind of spacious. And the important point here
that everyone emphasizes, the mind is no longer caught or preoccupied with
thoughts, with feelings, emotions, with reactivity, with the world. Now the
mind becomes much more infused with this wider kind of awareness, this presence,
this attentiveness. Some people might call it a broad sense of being conscious
of experience, where the sense of consciousness is kind of broad and
inclusive. And so at some point then the mind, there's a shift in it of what
gets prioritized. Rather than prioritizing our preoccupations with what we
want to get and what we're angry with or upset with or afraid of, we begin
prioritizing a state of mind which is peaceful or calm or
peaceful. And in that calmness, in that peacefulness, there isn't that kind of
narrow, tight, limited attention on some particular thing. The awareness now feels
broader, more expanded. And so this shift in the Third Foundation begins when one
knows an expanded mind as an expanded mind, and one knows a mind that's not
expanded as a mind that's not expanded. So it begins a sense that the size of
the mind can be a large sense of mind or spacious or even boundless sense of the
mind, or the mind is in fact limited and constricted and preoccupied in some
thing. And so this idea, if mind under stress is limited, and sometimes as the
mind begins to open up, we can feel the places where the mind or the body, the
brain is tense, and we can feel how that creates a limit or a boundary or a
constriction for this open awareness, this open presence and consciousness. So at
some point there's a shift where we have this as a reference point, this
possibility of a calm, peaceful, more expansive awareness. And that's a nice
reference point, but even better is to begin prioritizing it, especially giving
it at least slightly more priority than the mind's inclination to prioritize the
unhealthy states of mind that we go into. And might say that I don't prioritize,
but the mind will do it for you, and we get pulled into this world of
preoccupations and concerns that can be quite stressful. What about prioritizing
the peaceful mind, the calm mind, or the open mind? And not to hold onto it, not
to make it an object, not to constrict ourselves around it, but rather to kind
of rest in or open to or allow. It would be a little bit like someone wants to go
swimming in a wonderful pool of water, but they're, you know, maybe they're on
their cell phone talking some animated, engaging, upsetting conversation that
completely absorbed in the conversation. And so they walk right into the water,
and the water gets deeper and deeper and deeper, and maybe suddenly there's
an alleged that there's no more ground in it, but they're so concerned with the
phone call, they're not paying any attention to floating, and so they drown.
But, you know, as we get a sense as we go into the water of consciousness, we have
a sense that we can, there's also floating, there's swimming there. And so we
prioritize floating enough, just like that person on the phone should not have
the phone in the water probably, but would at some point prioritize floating in
the water if there's no bottom. And so we prioritize this kind of wider state to
this peaceful place. As we do so, and it develops and gets stronger, at some point
there's a, we can know a mind which is unsurpassable, and we can know a mind
which can be surpassed, or a mind that's ultimate, and a mind which is not, you know,
ultimate. And what this refers to is the states of enlightenment, states of
realization, that this movement into this open awareness, calm, peaceful states can
grow and develop. And at some point there's a, it feels like this is ultimate.
There's nothing better than this, nothing higher than this, because in this state
there's zero suffering, zero stress, zero tension, zero fear, nothing that kind of
limits it. And so there can't be anything more ultimate than this, because
there's no absolute, so peaceful, there's nothing that disturbs it. No, there's not
even a self that we're preoccupied or caught up in or, or, or contracted
around. There's not even any kind of ripple of self-concern, and so it feels,
it feels so ultimate. And now that, this becomes another reference point, not just
a peaceful mind, but now a mind that is so free of suffering, that this becomes a
powerful reference point where we know what's possible, we know it's possible to
live, have a mind live this way, this kind of radical freedom. And, and then the
next sector, when knows a, a studied mind as a studied mind, when knows an
unsteadied mind as an unsteady mind, this is knowing that there is that mind
that's peaceful, has no ripples on it, that's so peaceful, and when knows when
there's ripples on it. And so after some very deep kind of realization experience,
practice still continues, but now there's a reference point of what it's like to
have no ripples, and so we're much more sensitive to the subtlest little ripples
in the mind, or the big ones, and how there's subtle prioritization of
preoccupations, concerns, and where there's still a little bit of attachment.
And then the last thing it says in Satipatana hears, when knows a liberated
mind as a liberated mind. And my understanding of this is that, that this
is a mind which is fully liberated, that somehow the, all roots of attachment,
all that have been pulled out, there's no more attachments, nothing, no more
tendency for the mind to cling. And, and that can be known. And this and, and so
this is the ultimate, the final goal of Satipatana is this kind of liberation.
And so this third foundation does describe the whole path of practice in a
certain way. And, and, and then we'll go on to the fourth foundation which presents
that path in a different perspective. And the third foundation is from the
perspective of the mind states that we have. So one of the things I'd like to
leave you with in this third foundation is this idea of, two ideas, the idea of
reference points, and the idea of prioritization. What reference points do
you have for a state of mind that is valuable for you, really precious,
that's, that is certainly maybe better than some of the alternative ways your
mind functions in, in maybe some of your life. Maybe something you attain in
meditation or experience in meditation or some other times. And how can you
beneficially use that as a reference point? So many ways. And one way is to
give a certain kind of prioritization to that state of mind. Don't take it for
granted. Don't think that it's only available in certain rarefied states
like meditation. The more you experience it, maybe there's hints of it. Maybe
there's the smell of it or small clues of it. Maybe it's always present to some
degree. And, and so maybe you can prioritize it or, or, or let it inform
you, let it support you in being free and relaxed and present more often than
you do. An interesting exercise is to go through the day or the end of the day,
review the day, like write the autobiography of the day, based on what
the mind was prioritizing. And see if, you know, did you have to prioritize that?
Was that really to your best interest? And could you have done different
prioritization so that something else could have blossomed so your lotus can
blossom out of the muddy waters? So thank you. And next week we'll start the
fourth foundation. And so if you didn't follow in well enough this third
foundation, the fourth foundation, as I said, does a similar thing from a
different angle and through the angle of insight. And then finally, so we have to
for the next days until Monday IMC is doing this fundraiser for the refugees
from the war in Ukraine. And I think it's a quite a powerful thing when a group
of people gather together to support and raise funds to support people suffering
in the world. I believe it's beneficial for them, but it's also beneficial for
others that see this being done, to see that there are caring people who are
engaged and collectively to make a difference. And so if you were wondering
how you could support the people of the Ukraine when the tremendous suffering
they're experiencing right now, I invite you to join this IMC effort. And the way
you learn about it, the way you can do that is to go on IMC's website. On the
home page there's a section called What's New. And there in the What's New
section there's a, you know, it says fundraising for the Ukraine, for Ukraine,
and you can click on that. And that'll take you to a button, donate button, that
is specifically for us to make a donations to Save the Children, a wonderful
charity, a foundation that's supporting people in the Ukraine. And the money will
go, we'll receive it. Well, it's 100% of what we receive. We'll give to Save the
Children, 100% of what they'll use is to support their efforts in the Ukraine. So
thank you very much, and I look forward to starting again on Monday.
