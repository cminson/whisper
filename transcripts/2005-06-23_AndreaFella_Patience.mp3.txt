 So this week we're having a sandwich retreat, which is a week long of integrated practice. We met on Sunday and we're meeting morning and evening each day. So we're really delving into practice in daily life. And a topic that seems to be of relevance to a lot of the people on this retreat is patience. So I thought I'd talk about patience this evening. So sometimes after we've been practicing for a while, maybe we've been practicing for a couple of years, and we start to think, how come I'm not enlightened yet? We start to feel like something should happen to us. And this is quite a natural reaction, especially for Westerners. We have such an instant gratification culture. Some of my teachers have said that the Buddha said, patience is the road to nirvana, the road to enlightenment. So it's a very, very helpful quality for us to cultivate in our practice. Patience is one of the ten paramese, and paramese means perfection. The mythology of the Buddha's life is that he cultivated these ten perfections over many lifetimes before he became the Buddha. So these stories of him are very much like Aesop's fables. They often involve a lot of different animals, and usually the Buddha is one of the animals. And the animal is cultivating one of these qualities. Some of these stories are also about people, kings, princes, or bakers. So they're just a real wide variety of stories. They're kind of fun to read. So these qualities, the paramese, they're ten paramese, and they are generosity. You have to read them, actually. Virtue, renunciation, energy, wisdom, patience, truthfulness, resolution, loving kindness, and equanimity. So there are a wonderful list of qualities to think about cultivating in our lives. And in Asia, it's understood that the cultivation of the paramese is the practice of daily life. In Asia, a lot of people, particularly in Burma, which is where I've practiced, I know a little more about that particular culture, a lot of the lay people will come for long periods of practice, two months, three months at a time, and then they'll go back to their daily life. And in that time practicing in their daily life, the teachers are encouraging them to cultivate their paramese and then come back and meditate some more. So these qualities really support our meditation practice. So tonight I'm going to talk about the quality of patience. Patience has, when I thought about it, I thought of patience having three sort of aspects to it. There's an aspect of persistence, an aspect of tolerance or forbearance, and an aspect of acceptance. So each of these qualities helps to cultivate patience. And likewise, as they are cultivated, they develop more patience. So there's kind of a cyclic quality that goes on. So for example, persistence in our practice will perhaps lead to some small results, some small recognition of the benefits of practice, which then leads to a little more patience or tolerance of some difficult things because we have seen some results, which then leads to more persistence. So actually quite a number of the qualities that we cultivate in our meditation have this kind of a positive feedback loop. We start with a small bit of the quality and begin to see the benefits of that, and then it feeds back on itself. Almost like the practice kind of bootstraps itself just by bringing attention to some very small aspects of our experience. So that's actually a good instruction. You can start by paying attention to noticing very small moments of patience, and it will support the cultivation of patience and help it to grow. And I'll talk more about how we can cultivate patience later. So the quality of persistence, I'm going to talk about each of these qualities, persistence, tolerance, and acceptance. So the synonyms for persistence might be perseverance, steadiness, steadfastness, resolution, diligence. I think of this aspect, persistence, as highlighting the active quality of patience. It's not a passive state of mind. Thanh Jef, having spent a lot of time in Thailand, his teachers talked about the patience of a farmer. And he described that, especially in Thailand where they don't have a lot of the farm equipment that they have here, the patience of a farmer involves a lot of hard work. And it's not simply, it's not just waiting for something to happen. You have to know when the time is right to plow the soil. You have to know when the time is right to plant the seeds. And then there's the work of planting the seeds. You have to know when the time is right to do the next step and then take the energy to do it. When it's time to cultivate the crop, you have to do it quickly before the rains make it get moldy. So you have to really have to know the process of the cycle and act quickly in each step of the way. So it's not an inactive sitting back and just waiting for something to happen. It can be a very active quality of mind. Thanh Jef points out that farmers know how long it takes for their crops to ripen. And that can help them with their patience in doing their tasks, in following all the steps they need to follow to get to the end result. With the cultivation of the meditation practice, with the cultivation of mental qualities, we don't often know how long it will take us to wake up. So we really need to practice patience with results. We have to be persistent in cultivating the qualities of mind that lead to waking up, but have patience with how long it takes for those qualities to manifest. So we just continue to persist with what needs to be done. Paying attention, being mindful, attending to how we take care of our relationships with others, even if it seems like nothing is happening. But over time, we start to see small benefits. Maybe we see that in a conversation with someone, we notice a little bit of reactivity and refrain from speaking out of that reactivity. Or we notice a little bit of happiness in our life and just rest in that happiness. So we may start seeing small benefits. And these shifts start to encourage the persistence. They help us to see that there are small changes. We can take joy in the small changes and encourage ourselves to continue to persist in the practice. In the suttas, the Buddha talks about the patience of a hen. And he says that suppose there's a hen with eight, ten, or twelve eggs, which she covered, incubated, and nurtured properly. Even though she does not wish, oh, that my chicks might pierce their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatch out safely. Yet the chicks are still capable of piercing the shells with their claws and beaks and getting out safely. So it doesn't necessarily take the wish to have the awakening experiences, to have the benefits of our practice. It simply takes the work of keeping the eggs covered, of sitting there and doing what needs to be done to have the results manifest. We don't actually have that much control over the manifestation of the awakening, of the positive results of our practice. We have some control over the persistence to just keep practicing. Again, this points to the patience with results and just paying attention to what's happening right here, right now. What needs to be tended to right here and right now. So that's the aspect of persistence. The aspect of tolerance, synonyms for that might be forbearance, self-control, endurance. And this aspect is often related to tolerance of difficulty. We often think of tolerance or forbearance or self-control in our relationships with others. And this is a great field for cultivating the quality of patience. So like persistence, the quality of tolerance can have an active aspect to it. It might have the aspect of actively avoiding taking some actions. We can act tolerant even if we don't feel tolerant. Sometimes this might mean refraining from doing something, refraining from lashing out in anger or speaking from the place of judgment. So refraining from an action can have an active quality to it. It can be an active choice, a conscious choice. I'm not going to act out of that anger, to actively choose self-control. But there are times, of course, when certain situations call for an action. When there are certain injustices that call for an action, we don't necessarily have to use our patience to refrain from action. But we can act wisely in the situations. Use patience to help us act wisely. I watched the film Gandhi again not too long ago. And I was really struck again, once again, by his message of nonviolent, non-cooperation. There's another quality to it. Non-violent, non-passive, nonviolent, non-cooperation. So this means this is not tolerance of the injustice itself. So in the case of India, Gandhi was not recommending that the people of India be tolerant of the injustice that the British were putting on them. Rather, he was suggesting that there be tolerance of how long it takes to change. So it's tolerance of the process of change. So in this case, there was persistence in the face of how long it takes for change to happen. Tolerance of the actual, sometimes increasing injustice that happens as the perpetrator gets frustrated and tries harder to make their way happen. And the patience and self-control to refrain from acting out of violence. So this idea of non-passive, nonviolent, non-cooperation, we can bring to our practice as well. So the practice brings up difficulties. We start to see our unskillful actions, and after some time of meditating, it may seem even more like we're in the throes of a mind that's out of control. I think one teacher, it might have been Trung Parva Pichay, said, practice is one insult after another. It really feels like that sometimes. So we need to cultivate patience of our own minds, patience of the fact that the hindrances continually arise, the hindrances that cover the clarity of mind. Those are aversion, desires, sloth and torpor, restlessness and doubt. We have to have patience with the fact that they come up. Again, it's not patience with the quality of mind itself. It's not tolerance of the quality itself. It's not tolerance of aversion. It's tolerance of the process of the change. It's tolerance of its existence and non-passive, nonviolent, non-cooperation with it. So we can actively look at the quality of aversion. Non-passive, it's an act of observing it. We don't simply let it just be there. We observe it. It's nonviolent. There's a sense of holding it with compassion, a sense of acceptance and non-cooperation. We don't act. We don't take action out of that quality. The third aspect of patience is acceptance. And when we begin to taste the quality of acceptance, we really start to feel the depth of patience and what it can bring to our practice. Acceptance is the quality of mind that doesn't resist what is happening in the present moment. Ajahn Sumedho gives a teaching that, it might be a transmission, it's a great teaching. He says, when you experience something difficult, you can just say, it's like this. It's like this. Fear is like this. Anger is like this. Hatred is like this. This is what's happening in this particular moment and it can't be any other way because that is what is happening. It's like this. Another thing that Ajahn Sumedho says is, it's a great relief to accept the way things are because the only real misery is wanting them to be in some other way. Another teaching that's been helpful for me around this aspect of acceptance is by Jokobek and it's in a book called Nothing Special. She has a chapter called The Icy Couch. In this chapter she describes how our contractions, our difficult states can feel so cold and cramped and icy sometimes. And that what we can begin to do in our practice is to see that we can find a place where it's as if we have a couch molded out of ice that perfectly fits our form and that we can rest perfectly at ease on this icy couch. This teaching was helpful for me. After I had read this I had a couple of experiences where I was in meditation and just experiencing a tremendous amount of unpleasantness in the whole body. And this image of the icy couch came to my mind and it felt as though that the entire being was supported somehow by this experience of the unpleasantness. So it was almost as if the experience itself was the rest. Even though the experience was unpleasant, there was a resting. It didn't feel like resting in the experience, it really felt like the experience was the rest. I also had another experience on a retreat. This was a three month retreat, my first three month retreat and I didn't really know what to expect on this retreat. And at one point the mind got very quiet and very calm. It was just quite lovely. And then the next day all I was experiencing was just this tremendous amount of cramping around my heart as if somebody had put a vice grip around my chest. It was very painful and I couldn't pay attention to anything else. And I just did a lot of walking meditation. Just walking, walking. It was much easier to walk than it was to sit. And I just remember there was some point where I just felt like, well, it's not that calm anymore but at least I'm cultivating patience. So how do we cultivate patience? There's a number of aspects of the practice that can support us in this. So we can cultivate it by intention through an act of choice. Even if we don't feel like being patient, we can cultivate patience through choosing to act patiently. It has a rebound effect on the mind. If we choose to act in a particular way, there's a little bit of intention towards that quality. So if we choose to act with patience, it's like we're planting a seed of patience. Even if we don't feel patient at that moment, we're choosing to act in patience, we're cultivating that intention of patience, we're planting that seed of patience. And if we continue to do that, those seeds of patience will eventually sprout and there will be some naturally arising patience. So using our intention, choosing to act in a certain way, choosing to cultivate certain qualities, even if we don't feel them at the moment, it has a rebound effect on the mind and can actually help to cultivate those qualities in the mind. Another way to cultivate patience is through reflection, actually thinking about patience. For example, we can remind ourselves of times when we've been patient. And if there's a situation that has come up that we're impatient with, we can call to mind a time when we have been patient. So use the mind. We can use the mind in our practice. It's not against the rules. So we can use the mind to call to our awareness a time when we have been patient in the past. And the act of bringing up that thought in the mind can give you a flavor of what it feels like to be patient. And it may generate some patience here and now. Then I like always, of course, to suggest mindfulness as a way to cultivate any quality of mind. Notice patience when it's there. If it arises, notice that it's there. It appears during our day, often we don't notice when we're being patient. That sometimes we're kind of naturally patient with certain situations. Let yourself recognize those situations that you are patient with and appreciate them. Knowing while it's happening, knowing the patient's while it's happening, serves to reinforce it. I've said many times that mindfulness has a kind of a magic quality that when you pay attention to wholesome qualities, it tends to increase their chances of appearing in the future. And when you pay attention to unskillful qualities, it tends to decrease their chances of appearing in the future. So actually bringing our mindfulness to qualities that are naturally arising serves to support them. It's like it gives them a little boost through recognizing, yes, this is patience. I'm being patient now. Even if it seems like a very minor thing. So recognize it and appreciate it when it arises. Another way to use mindfulness with looking at the quality of patience is to notice its opposite. So in cultivating these qualities of the paramees, there's sort of two basic approaches we can cultivate knowing when the quality itself is present and actually trying to actively cultivate the patience itself. Or we can look and see what is getting in its way, what is blocking the patience. That's a fairly direct way also to understanding patience itself. So we can cultivate patience by watching impatience. Now this may actually be a little more apparent to some of us. I chose at one point to spend a period of time watching impatience, to notice impatience in my life. I spent about a couple of months paying attention to this. Just noticing when it arose, what the situations were when it arose, what the mind was doing, why was it impatient. So I noticed, what I noticed was that I was impatient all the time. It was like, it came up so many places. It was like mind blowing. I was impatient when I was brushing my teeth. I was impatient because I didn't think it was worth my time. There's more important things I have to be doing than brushing. I've got to get on to the next thing. I noticed this also kind of quality in my very first meditation retreat, this aspect of getting to the next thing. On a meditation retreat, all that you do is sit and walk all day long. That's all you do. You sit and then you walk. And then you sit and then you walk. I was noticing that while I was sitting, I was impatient for the end of the sitting. I couldn't wait for the end of the sitting so I could go walk. I was impatient for the end of the walking so I could go sit. It began to be clear to me that the impatience was just kind of a pattern, a habit in the mind. It didn't matter if it was just sit and walk and sit and walk. It was impatient about that. So after a couple of months of exploring this process of impatience, I was noticing, I noticed I was outside one day walking down the street and I noticed the impatience arise over. I don't even remember what, some small thing. The next moment in my mind was, I've been paying attention to this impatience for two months. When is it going to go away? I just had to laugh at myself, oh there it is again. So we do have to be patient. It takes a long time to cultivate these qualities and to observe how the minds function. The minds have a huge history of habits that are not easily dissuaded from reappearing. So sometimes it seems like patience is mostly needed at the beginning of practice, you know, when there's a lot of hindrances. But actually patience is needed all the way through the practice. We can start getting these periods of great calm and tranquility and we start to feel like, wow, I've arrived. This is what it's supposed to be like, this calm, wow. And so maybe it lasts for a while, maybe it doesn't last for a while, it may not last actually, it may last five minutes and then it goes away and we need to have patience with the fact that these states come and they go. But sometimes they come and they stay for a while. Sometimes they may come and stay for a long time, a couple of months. And you start to think, wow, this is great. But then after a long time, especially on retreat when we're paying attention to these states, it's just calm, unending calm and it starts to get really boring. So we need to have patience with even these qualities of mind. We need to have patience with whatever it is that continues in our life. It's like this, calm is like this, boredom is like this. Another way we need to, or we begin to see that we need patience throughout the life of the practice is when we start seeing really clearly into the nature of how things are, that they're impermanent, that there's nothing really existent. There's just this pattern of things that come together and fall apart all the time, this continual pattern of things coming together and falling apart. When we first start to see this, we think we've understood something. We see in a moment the clarity of something arising and passing. Wow, it's impermanent. I understand that things are impermanent. And there can be this release, a sense of it doesn't make any sense to hold on to anything because it's just going to pass away. So there can be this moment of insight and just a sense of wow, I get it, I really understand. But that insight itself is impermanent. Within the next day, even hour or even minute, that insight itself has fallen apart. And in the next moment, we're clinging madly to something. And we think why? Why is this happening? I understand that this is impermanent. It's those habits again, those habits that are, they just have their life, the habits don't go away because of a single insight. The habits of clinging keep coming up again. So we need to have patience with that, the understanding that we have in a moment and then isn't there in the next moment. Just continue to persist in the practice. Those moments, however, can give you a sense of, they can support the practice, they can support the cultivation of patience, having the recognition of things being impermanent, that seeing in a moment that clearly, even though in the next moment, it's gone. We can know, there's some kind of lingering memory or trace of that, that resonates in our mind. And even though we're clinging madly, there's some sense of patience with that clinging, that it too will pass. So those are my thoughts about patience and impatience. And I'd like to see if there's any comments or thoughts that you have, things that you might like to share. Yeah? So how do you draw the distinction between your paying attention to passivity versus patient-wise? Passivity, I think, has a quality of just kind of sitting back without engaging. And patience can have a more active sense to it. But can you say something about your experience of passivity and your experience of patience that might help me to more directly answer your question? It's really not specific to a situation, it's just, you know, there's that concept that you could have thought about the near enemy. Yeah, I think you're right, it would be a kind of a near enemy. I would say that it would have a quality of complacency, passivity would have a quality of not caring almost, of just, well, it's the way it is, you know, there's nothing I can do about it. As opposed to actively being with it, with a sense of engagement. Well, I can imagine being in a situation where you are uncomfortable with something and just still passively being with it, as opposed to actively enduring it, actively, you know, knowing this is how it is right now. I think that that quality is called learned helplessness in psychology, of, you know, where you're just in a situation where there's no way to change it, and you just learn to sit there and just bear, not even bear, but just, you know, kind of numb out to the pain. And I think patience is more the sense of, of really being present for it, as opposed to fogging out for it. So I look at the passivity as kind of having some delusion in it, some fog, and not really knowing this is how it is. It's like this, pain is like this, the injustice is like this, whereas passivity is kind of just, don't want to look at it more, it's a, you know, avoidance, yeah. Thank you for that. Yeah. I was thinking about how you made it up reaching a level of calmness, but then kind of being bored with that, and I was wondering if there are kind of contributions to that one, or the... With calm? Well, if anything that just continues for a long time, we tend to, we like change. I mean, our minds are habituated to things being different. We like, we like, you know, new excitement in our lives. And if things are just calm for a long period of time, it's just a kind of a sense of, is it ever going to be different? And we also, we also can get the sense in the, in the seeing of those states of calm and peace and tranquility that they are not the answer, you know, that, that they're not really the answer. And the Buddha discovered that, the Buddha said that one of the ways that he felt he attributed his awakening to was that he was not simply satisfied with calm, with wholesome states of mind. He wasn't simply satisfied with calm and peace, that he kept probing, he kept looking. So there's that sense when we're in these states, you know, of calm for periods of time that this isn't, this isn't quite that release of suffering. There's still, there's still some clinging. There's clinging to the calm, there's clinging to wanting to be different. So we see that it's not quite it. Perhaps one thing I'm not clear about, I know that traditionally that the parameters are supposed to develop each from the last. And I was wondering, because I don't remember the order, what patients gross out of and what it develops into. That's an insight. Energy is what it comes out, I believe, let me just double check. Energy and truthfulness, I believe, are the ones around it. Let me check that. Yeah, energy, patience, truthfulness. So it can grow out of... Energy, that persistence. That active state of... Yes, that active, the quality of just coming back over and over again. The patience grows out of that reapplication of energy over and over and over again. So that makes a lot of sense. The truthfulness, I think partly the truthfulness, it doesn't simply refer to telling the truth. The paramy of truthfulness refers to seeing the truth, seeing how things are, seeing the way things are, and being very honest with ourselves about the way things are. And patience supports the awakening of that. One thing that helps me when I'm in adverse situations is to look back in your life and see all the adverse situations that I have been in the past. And here I am, I'm still here, I'm gone to you. And as you say, this too shows up. Yes. Yeah. Ajahn Sumedho has a similar kind of teaching. He talks about a time when he was in meditation and experiencing so much pain, he just thought, I can't bear this. I can't bear this. And a moment later, well, guess what? He's still here. We can bear these things. And coming out the other side, as you say, is a great support for cultivating patience. We can see that we can bear things. We can bear a lot more than we think we can, than we know we can. So if there aren't any more questions, I thought I was thinking we could do a reflective practice. And this will be a meditation. And the way this reflective practice works, this was taught to me by Ajahn Amaru. And he suggests spending a few moments settling and getting calm in the meditation. So we'll spend some minutes just in regular meditation. And then he suggests dropping an idea into the meditation so we can actively explore particular topics in a meditative way using this technique. So what we'll do is in that process of meditation, I'll drop a word into your meditation. And what I'd like you to do is to just see what comes up, what bubbles up. Not to think about the word, but just see what the impact of it is in your body, in your mind. There may be some thoughts that appear, but try not to follow the thoughts. Just keep coming back to the body. So we can just learn a little bit about how the word affects us, and perhaps a little bit about what the qualities feel like that the word evokes. So we'll start with the meditation. And at some point, I will say a word. I may do a couple of those. So there may be a couple of times I drop a word into the meditation. So just close your eyes and get into an upright, alert posture. And bring your attention to the sensations of breathing. Impatience. Exhale. Exhale. Ease. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Patience. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Patience. Exhale. So you can use that technique by yourself to explore any topic that you're interested in in a meditative way. So I'm curious if anybody is willing to speak a little bit about what they noticed in this exercise. Yeah. I'm interested. Did everyone hear her? Did anyone not hear her? Okay. That's beautiful. Thank you. Anyone else willing to share? Yeah. I also felt more at ease when you said patience than I had felt the desire about the new patience. That's interesting. I mean, I think a lot of what this reflective practice does is it kind of calls up our kind of responses to things. So it sounds like maybe a response to patience for you is like, no. Patience is my side. Yes. Yeah. We do have a kind of a moral outlook on patience somehow, you know? So it can have more of a quality of something that we end up wanting to do after a while. Thank you. That was very helpful. Thank you. I noticed when you said patience, it was like a note that gets played off key and it continues to jangle. That was sort of the – and I think I actually threw that. I mean, I think there's a certain agitation. Yeah. And later, when I heard the word patience, it was a relief. Another thing to notice in this is how easy it is for these words to shift our whole state of being. I mean, it's just a word. But, you know, I say a word and the whole experience changes. So it kind of teaches us a little bit about the way our mind works. A thought comes in the mind. Our whole experience changes. So, yeah, I mean, it's a real lesson. And we can get to see a little bit in this type of exercise what it feels like. If we want to begin to understand what impatience feels like, I think you have now a bodily sense of it. You know. So, yeah. Thank you. Down. I noticed that being in a meditative space when you said impatience, it was like you said, like a discord note. And it didn't ring true with the space that I was in, which made me realize, aha. So, like being here and now, there's no impatience. And it reminded me that when I am impatient, it means I'm not here now. So, one ring, they all kind of reinforce each other, or they're the exact same thing. And then when I found myself, I say, okay, once this can be over, we send patience. And that brought me back to here and now because I had to walk her. Yeah. It's very true. I mean, I don't think they're quite the same, the being here and now. I mean, it's like, I don't know, so many of these qualities are just so tightly interconnected. You know, that when we're in the present moment, really fully in the present moment, the quality of patience is there. The quality of acceptance is there. The quality of calm is probably there. You know, that there's a lot of different facets of the experience, and they're not quite all the same. But yes, they're very tightly connected. Yeah. So, yeah, being in the here and now, that process of being here over and over again is the patience. Yeah. Thank you. So it's nine o'clock, and I'd like to thank you for your patience and your participation. Thank you. Good evening.
