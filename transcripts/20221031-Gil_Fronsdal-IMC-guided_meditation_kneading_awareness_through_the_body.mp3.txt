 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning or good day everyone. And coming here from having finished being at a retreat, teaching at a retreat for the last week. And so perhaps the retreat practice is still with me, and maybe I can share a bit of it with you in this meditation. And I'll do it with a simile. The Buddha taught a lot with similes, and he had many having to do with meditation. And one that Fonda is that, and I'll adapt it for the kind of a modern example, that you take dry flour and you sprinkle water in it to make bread, to make dough. And as the water gets into the flour, the idea is to begin kneading the flour first mixing, first so that all the flour can become moist. And then to really spread it out and kind of line up the structure of the wheat protein so that it can really receive well the yeast and I guess the carbon dioxide the yeast makes, so it spreads and expands. And so this is kneading the bread to get the moisture, kneading the flour to get the moisture throughout evenly throughout. The Buddha used something almost the same idea that kneading and kneading some powder, dry powder, until no part of the dough is not moist, saturated, suffused with moisture. But also not oozing, not dripping with moisture either, just enough to hold it all together. And this idea of keep kneading so that the structure of the flour gets aligned, gets well established for the rising of the bread. And in this analogy, the body is the flour and a body which is not saturated with awareness, with attention, is considered kind of dry and not held together in a unified whole. But as we take our awareness and we're kind of like awareness is the water more or less and we are massaging or kneading the water, the awareness into the body. And the rhythm of it, the kneading is the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. And for different people, maybe different halves of breathing is the pushing the dough down. And then the other half is kind of squeezing it together. And for me, what works well is the in-breath is the kind of gathering together the dough into a ball and then the exhale is the spreading it out and kneading in and spreading out. Other people, it's the opposite, that somehow the exhale is the kind of gathering together and the inhale with the expansion of the torso is the spreading, is the spreading out the exhale is the gathering in, bunching up. And as we do this, there's a kind of rhythm that goes with the breathing. And some of that rhythm is inherent in the breathing. And very gently, it's possible to just like with dough, we don't try to knead the dough as fast as we can. There's a speed that seems to be proper or appropriate for the dough. And so to not necessarily breathe in whatever way you happen to be breathing, but to be attuned to what is the kind of breathing, the speed of breathing, the extent of exhaling, the extent of inhaling that seems appropriate to the task of moving, spreading awareness throughout the body. So that's the symbolie. And it gives a very different sense of what to do in meditation than just, you know, follow your breath, be with your breathing, if your mind gets distracted, come back. There's a kind of embodiment or fullness and the imagination is a little bit engaged. So assuming a meditation posture and one that allows your chest to be more open, a posture where the front part of your body doesn't get scrunched up, but rather the front of your body is a little bit open. And your belly can also a little bit not be bunched up, not be squeezed, but more open. Maybe even allow it to relax and extend forward, gently closing your eyes. And maybe the dove is already starting to get moist and the first few needs that you do are large, large, long, extended, deep, really to kind of get started on the kneading of the doe, breathing in deeply, exhaling and relaxing into this body, breathing in deeply and exhaling so that the chest and the belly stay open, maybe even open a little bit more by letting the muscles of your back settle, relax. Letting your breathing return to normal, and the body is malleable, workable, like a ball of dough, maybe still not completely moist everywhere. Parts of the body are not saturated with awareness, embodied awareness, breathing normally, maybe gently exhaling a little bit longer than usual, partly to so the mind becomes more interested in the body, more interested in breathing. One of the deep instincts of the body is to breathe, the natural instinct to breathe in and breathe out. Feel the breathing in your body, how the body, the torso moves and sensation shift. For this meditation, lovingly putting aside concerns with whatever you're thinking and also whatever you're feeling emotionally, not out of disrespect or for these minutes, it's all right to let those be on the side. To give yourself to the simple task of kneading the body with breathing, it may be as you exhale, a gentle spreading of attention awareness more broadly into the body, bit by bit, wider and wider awareness. Maybe on the inhale, pulling in, breathing in, gathering together, a sense of preparing to spread the awareness a bit more through the body. Perhaps gently, a bit longer exhales and an extra longer period of exhaling. This may be an occasion to feel more the body, letting the thinking mind become quiet in favor of feeling the body. Giving yourself over to the rhythm of kneading, the rhythm of breathing. If you don't feel your body so well, inhale a little bit more so that the chest expands, the belly expands. If you still don't feel your body much, gently hold your breath at the top of the inhale, the top of the exhale, until the sensations of the body ask you for to breathe. The kneading of dough doesn't make the bread. The kneading of the dough prepares the dough for the oven, prepares it to rise, kneading your body with the breathing. Don't try to make your meditation into something. Let it be the preparation, loving gently, massaging the body with the breathing, with awareness that spreads as you breathe..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
