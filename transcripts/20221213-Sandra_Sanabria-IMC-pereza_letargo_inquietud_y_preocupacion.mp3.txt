How can one discern how to face these situations in meditation and daily life?
It seems to me that this time of the year is appropriate to talk about these two obstacles.
There is always a lot of agitation.
I am counting the days, looking at the calendar, noticing the excitement in the air.
It seems to me that this is a good moment.
As you begin to analyze these states, you begin to give information.
Is this lack of concentration an obstacle?
It seems to me that this is a good moment.
The lack of concentration is something that impacts the meditation of everyone at some point.
The lack of concentration is something that everyone has.
On the other hand, the lack of sleep is chronic.
On the other hand, the lack of meditation is too exciting.
Sometimes there are emotions, situations.
There is a memory that suddenly comes to you.
It seems to me that the defense of the mind and body is better than sleep.
When there is too much emotion, it is going through a complicated situation, but for some reason it is very active.
Sometimes in these situations, I feel meditative.
When I feel pain, I am going to concentrate on pain.
I apply all the techniques to concentrate in one moment.
What does one do with these states?
The practice offers us some alternatives.
If it is the omnolence to get up and meditate on foot, open your eyes, do a meditation walking, something like that.
I think these two states are useful for any of these two obstacles.
Sometimes with the presa and the lethargo, you get a little more energy.
You get a little more energy to connect with the body.
You get a little more energy to connect with the body.
I think our lives are very complex.
Not all the time, but frequently there is something below the surface, something that we see, but that we ignore.
Sometimes leading with the obstacle gives you a little clarity to see what is happening beyond fatigue or anxiety.
The appearance of obstacles is sometimes the door to investigate what is happening inside us.
It is information that the mind that the body is giving us.
Sometimes it is the list of tools that allow you to get out of these states to allow yourself to investigate.
I am going to see what is happening.
It seems to me that sometimes in the middle of the attack or the obstacles, or all of them, there is clarity.
With practice, if we are practicing at a certain time, sometimes that confusion, that mind that is on the other side, that does not go there.
One does not find the position.
Every week I feel that I am sleeping.
I do not know if I become more aware of the obstacle and start applying these things, but it seems to me that sometimes there is a path that we need to follow to see more clarity.
Sometimes we have to suffer the obstacle, the reaction we have towards it, to be able to remove that veil and see with clarity what is happening.
Sometimes you simply have the indication that it is what is happening to me, that it is what is really bothering me.
To dig, because it is not always evident.
I speak today and it is based on my own experience, but sometimes it is the resonance and the agitation. You feel very similar meditating and in the day to day.
I move particularly in this age of the year, where I have the calendar here in front of me. I am almost unconsciously counting the days that I have left to go out on vacation.
And I realize that there is something that I had already told you on another occasion, that due to the speed of life today, we tend to live in two states.
We live in two states, or super occupied, many things to do, we do not have time for anything, or vacations. It seems that there would not be an intermediate state sometimes.
And how to find that intermediate point?
That enjoyment for having too many things to do, that you forget things, that you don't know where you left the keys, what you did with the glasses.
We start to forget all things. We don't find the energy to sit down to meditate or to go out for a walk.
So it seems to me that these, particularly these two obstacles, sometimes it is difficult to know if it is an obstacle in itself or it is the process that you have to follow to see what is happening.
In the, it also seems to me that the agitation that we have in daily life comes a time when you no longer want one, nothing more.
There is a deep rejection and it is a combination of the two things. You do not find the space to do what you need to do and you do not have the energy to do it, even though you are in a state of exaltation.
It is a whole mass, a very complicated question.
Looking at the other two obstacles, the unwillingness and the desire, desperately, a antidote for any of them, it seems to me that they began to ask themselves,
What is what I really want to do? What is what is really important at this moment?
And a bit of the antidote for the obstacles is a bit of the contemplation of death. There are many ways to do it and maybe one that has been useful to me.
Wow, you ask me questions like, well, if this was my last day of life, how would I live it?
Without having to look at it for a very long time, but today at this moment, what can I change at this moment? What would that change of attitude be?
What would that little thing look like on the one hand? Not 180 degrees, but what if I only move without healing? What would change at this moment?
Many of the obstacles arise in relation to others. We are not individual, independent units, if we are not beings who live in community.
And there are moments in which maybe we are not the best company, because the state of mind, malheny, I don't know if it is part of what we are, but sometimes it is something that has been useful to me in those cases.
I imagine that this is the last time I am going to be with this person, even if it is not. And then it is how I want to be present at this moment.
What would my attitude be? And it seems to me that those kinds of questions help to soften our state in which we find ourselves and soften the attitude we have towards the state in which we find ourselves.
In the teachings it tells us that to work with these obstacles it is important to recognize when you are present, to recognize when you are not, when you are absent.
It will begin to discover when they begin to arise, what makes them arise. And to recognize when one can release them.
I invite you a little to stop.
