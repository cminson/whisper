 Today I'd like to offer a guided meditation that goes in the direction of pointing to the experience of a very broad awareness, not just the awareness broad but the experience that awareness meets being very broad. So just following along in the meditation I'll speak to that and we'll just see how it goes, I found this kind of awareness to be really useful in my own practice throughout the years in various ways but more recently I've become really appreciative of how valuable it is in terms of meeting just the everydayness of our lives. And so I offer it in that vein, in that hope. We'll begin our guided meditation as we often do just by settling, just by beginning with arriving, arriving with your body. Meeting our mind and body together at the same place at the same time. That's how our meditation starts, just allowing our attention to settle in, to connect with being here physically in this body. Sometimes I feel like the initial few minutes of my guided, of my meditations when I do them myself are really just kind of allowing various threads of my experience to come together, to be received within awareness. The physical sensation level of experience is a big part of what is here right now. And often it's one of the more obvious experiences, easy to connect with. And so just allowing yourself to arrive with yourself in the body, allowing as much relaxation as is available, physical relaxation can be supportive also for allowing this gathering or arriving. Maybe too there can be a softening, a relaxation of any worries or concerns that might be here, just not so much saying setting them aside, but just allowing them to be here, not focusing on them. Allow them on to relax with whatever is here, what is already here. Arriving with your experience, just in the simple way, knowing that you're sitting in this space, in this room, wherever you are, in this physical body. And also acknowledging or taking in how you are, how are you right now, physically, emotionally, mentally. And receiving just whatever is most obvious for you, allowing mindfulness, allowing awareness to connect with whatever it's naturally, easily connecting with. You don't need to direct the attention, experience can come to mindfulness, we can settle back and receive whatever is obvious. I have a sense, another way to phrase that, I have a sense perhaps of letting experience come to you, whatever experience is already coming to you. Another way perhaps, what's asking to be noticed, what's asking to be seen. Mindfulness can be understood or felt almost like a mirror, just simply reflecting what's already here. What's obvious? And it is some physical experience that come in as obvious, maybe contact of your body, wherever it's touching the chair or cushion, whatever you're sitting on. Maybe it's other touch points, hands or feet or a particular sensation that may be a little stronger in the body right now, an area of strong sensation. Often the strong experiences are the ones that seem most obvious to us. Or we can begin with what's most obvious. Emotions or moods may also be present at times, kind of come into the field reflected by this mindfulness. Our attention may shift from one experience to another, often probably will shift if we're settling back and just receiving and not choosing what to attend to. Very often there's a very dynamic quality of receiving first one thing and then another thing. A body sensation for a few moments and then a sound, maybe a different body sensation and then a thought. So there can be a sense of having a very broad awareness that's receiving a lot of different experiences. The relaxation supports this capacity to allow the awareness to be broad. And another aspect of experience that can be felt but may not be so obvious is a broader sense of how you are with that, perhaps that sense of that broad awareness receiving a lot of different things, touching into perhaps the whole of your experience. What is here for you? How are you? And how is that felt, that broad sense of how you are, allowing the mind to relax and just kind of be available to receive perhaps a sense of broad, it can be felt in the body often, a sense of broad, diffuse sensation throughout the body. Not a specific sensation here or there but a broad sense of the body as a whole. That sense connected with how are you, maybe touching into a broader sense of how you are right now. This broader sense can have a very subtle quality at times. It can feel diffuse, it can feel pervading. It can at times be strong depending on what's going on but often it's got a quality of a little more subtlety. And it often also has a kind of a shifting quality. And today I use the word undulating and that kind of resonates for me. A broad, vast kind of sense of how you are, all of how you are. Can you touch that? And yet the touching of it is really delicate, like the most soft meeting, the awareness really soft. And relaxed to receive this very soft experience, perhaps a soft experience. An analogy for this kind of broad seeing might be, if you imagine being out on a cloudless, moonless night, not far away from ambient light. You might look up and be able to see the Milky Way, the vast Milky Way stretching across the sky, the breadth of that, the seeing of that takes in not just any specific part of it but the whole thing. And today there can be a sense of looking at our experience that way, the whole thing. And I find this broad, diffuse, whole experience doesn't necessarily have, it's not offering itself as something specific, it's not often coming with a label or a word, it's a kind of a vague experience that is often hard to name. And that's okay. Can you explore the possibility of allowing awareness to simply receive something that we don't know how to name? Awareness knows how to receive it. Can you trust awareness knows how to receive something you don't know how to receive or how to describe even? This aspect of experience, this broad sense of all that's happening, it can be felt as a physical sensation energy through the body perhaps, sensation, and it's also very intimately connected with our emotional and mental realm. So it's almost like we're seeing all of those parts together in this, touching this kind of experience. Seeing the possibility of a kind allowing field that this experience is being met with, it's okay, whatever it is. It may feel vague, shifty, kind of like sand slipping through your fingers or you might have a quality of undulation, shifting, changing. It's okay. Whatever it is, not able to identify it, not able to name it, it's okay. And there can be resistance, confusion, uncomfortableness, even some fear that might come up in touching this kind of experience. And that's okay too. It may be able to be just a piece of the whole of your experience, that's there too. And yet it also might get strong and if that happens, you're welcome to let go of this exploration around this broader experience and allow the attention to connect back with something a little more familiar or more comfortable for you, honoring that at times we've had enough of something, that's fine. And yet if you find this exploration of a broader awareness useful, you're welcome to continue with touching into it for the remainder of the sitting, exploring that possibility of just opening to how are you in this Broadway, not needing to name it, figure it out, just meeting it. When the attention is likely to wander out or be drawn to something more specific at times, that's fine too. When you remember touching in again to this receptive quality of awareness, receiving what's here, whether a specific sensation, a specific thought, or perhaps this broader kind of experience. What is the feeling of how you are? Relax and receive. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
