 So this is the fifth week of our series and the last of our series on the hindrances. So what we've done for the last four weeks is we did an overview of the hindrances and of these five hindrances and talked about what makes something a hindrance and things like that. And then we've spent all the rest of the time on the first two hindrances. So tonight we want to focus on the last three, but I think we should be able to go through just fine tonight. So as a reminder for those of you who just haven't been here for the other sessions, the first hindrance is what we call it's desire or greed or clinging. Those things are not all the same thing, but they're all very close. It's whenever something that we want or that's very pleasant arises and we hold on to it, and that can become a hindrance, and we've talked a lot about that. We won't go into it tonight. And then the second of the hindrances is the opposite of that. It's aversion when there's something difficult or unwanted and we're pushing it away. So those are two sides of the same coin. It's ways in which we're not able to be present and free and clear and awake in the midst of whatever the experience is. So that's what we've talked about. I'm just not going into the detail. So let me, hopefully we'll have some discussion, but let me just mention the next hindrances. The third one is is restlessness. And the fourth one is called sloth and torpor. And the fifth one is doubt. So let's talk a little about the restlessness. Probably all of us have experienced it. Oh, and one other thing I should say. The hindrances are talked about a lot in relationship to the actual formal meditation practice. They're hindrances to going to dropping into the deeper levels of the meditation, but they also apply in daily life also. So there's both ways that we talk about them. So we all know what restlessness is. Certainly we can experience it. If you're ever sitting in meditation and feel like I'm about to jump out of my skin, I don't think I can sit here another moment. I can't sit still. I've got to get up. That's all restlessness. Now we often talk about in Vipassana practice of using mindful awareness to connect with whatever experience, whatever is real in a moment, whatever the experience is. And to meet it with that mindful awareness, with that awakefulness. Well, restlessness is just another experience. What is it that makes it a hindrance? Why is it a hindrance? Anybody want to? You can't concentrate. Can't concentrate? Make a young hanyan warm up with what's going on. Right. Won't stay with something. Right. Right. It's right. That's exactly right. The quality of this experience is such that it's very strongly pulling us away from being present. So if it's within the realm, it's not too strong and we can work with it, we could just notice with mindfulness that there's restlessness. And then that can be just what is occurring in the moment. And then we can work with that as part of the Vipassana practice. That's one way we could work with restlessness. And if we can do that, it's actually not a hindrance. It's just probably an unpleasant experience arising. I'm just thinking sometimes restlessness can be quite constructive if you're in a situation, a job or whatever, and you just can't be restless about it. Is there a positive aspect to restlessness? Yeah, I guess. I mean, maybe we could talk about that a little. I don't know. But I think part of what you might be pointing to is that, which is something I was going to bring up, is that sometimes restlessness is just an energy imbalance. The energy is just too much. And that's all there is to it. Sometimes, though, restlessness can be there's something else that needs to be looked at that's underneath the surface. So I've had meditations when maybe there's a lot of restlessness and you could connect with the restlessness itself. But when I looked a little closer to it, what's fueling it? What's underneath it? I could see that really there's something I'm worried about underneath it. You know, oh yeah, you know, I've got to whatever. I need to write that paper for school or boy, I've got a lot of things I have to get done by this time. There's something fueling it or I'm worried about something or afraid of something or there's some difficulty under it. So it can be useful sometimes to look underneath and to really connect with what's fueling it. And sometimes by doing that, it can then relieve the restlessness or if nothing else, we're getting more to the root cause there. So I don't know necessarily if that's what you were referring to or not, or if we would even consider that a, it's always pointing to something to look at. So I'm not sure about the useful usefulness because sometimes we're called into action regarding whatever situation, work or life. It doesn't have to come out of restlessness. It can just be from a real clear place of just seeing and knowing what needs to be done and then just moving into action. Right? So I'm not sure. I don't know. Maybe other people have some thoughts about that. Well, we'll see. And if other things come up, you know, we can, you know, just we'll jump in anytime. So that's a couple of places. One is there's just the restlessness itself. Now, another problem with restlessness is it kicks in the second hindrance aversion because for most of us, probably all of us, restlessness is unpleasant. If you really make an extreme case when I was saying, you know, you feel like you're going to just, you literally are going to bust open. If you sit still, you're going to, you know, just burst out of your skin. Well, it's unpleasant. So now, in addition to the restlessness itself, then aversion kicks in. And we made a joke, you know, kind of got a laugh, I think, on the first night of this series, but really people talk about, I don't think the Buddha said this, but, you know, they'll say, oh, you're having a multiple hindrance attack. And many of you have probably heard that before. So it even gets worse because it's not just one hindrance. There's the restlessness and the aversion at the same time. So we need to kind of pick that apart. They're really two different things. If we're caught in the aversion, it'll be something else. And if it's not seen, it keeps us from seeing clearly what's going on. If there's no aversion, well, no problem, which is just restlessness, right? We're able to just be with it. There's the restlessness, there's the unpleasant aspect of it, the feeling tone called Vedana feeling of it, which is unpleasant. And then maybe there's aversion too on top of it. So there's a couple of ways then that are the classical methods of dealing with it. It always starts with, of course, mindfulness, because if we don't have the mindfulness, as with any hindrance or any experience, we're lost. This is what we've been saying over and over and over again. It applies to everything. We have to have enough wakefulness, mindfulness in any situation to have any freedom or choice in how we're going to act. Sometimes we're just going to get lost, and then we're lost. When we can wake up and realize, oh, there's restlessness, see it mindfully, then we start to have some choice. One level, as we said, we can just be present with the restlessness. Another level is we can start to, I shouldn't say another level, but another direction we can approach it at. There's not levels here, but another direction to approach it at is to see if there's something underneath it, fueling it. See if there's aversion there to it. Those are all ways to work with it with mindfulness. Sometimes what's needed is not to meet it with mindfulness. Sometimes what's needed is actually to use what's called an antidote to do something actually to alleviate it or make it go away. That's the art of this practice. It's the art of with any experience, when is the time to meet it with mindfulness and just be present and not in a fear? When is the time when you need to take some action to tone it down or ease it off a little bit? We were talking about that a lot in the last few weeks with aversion. If you're sitting in meditation with maybe you get severe back pain or knee pain, we've said, I'm repeating this because I think there's some people who haven't been here for this before. One level is it will just be present when the pain comes up. We don't want to be in reaction the first moment anything unpleasant arises. If it gets too strong, it reaches a point where there's no sense struggling with it anymore. It's too much. It's too strong. What we really need to do then is maybe shift our position, move a little. Because it's gone way past where it's useful to work with it. It's the same thing with restlessness. If we can work with it, then we can just let it be. What are ways to work with restlessness? I can think of two and maybe there are some others. The traditional antidote for restlessness is to crank up the concentration. I'll hand these sheets out later for those of you who didn't get them. Did I bring that one in with me? I left it out in my car. I do have a sheet here. Out in my car I can bring it in. I handed out the first night. It lists all the five hindrances and the antidotes and everything. The antidote for restlessness is you can crank up the concentration to really bear down with the concentration, make more effort to overcome it and to cut through it. You have to have enough concentration built up in your practice in general in the first place to be able to do that. But that's one thing that can work. Another thing that can help with restlessness is sometimes what's needed is to get up and dissipate the energy somehow. Not get up and walk away from the practice, but I've found that sometimes by getting up and maybe doing walking meditation instead of the sitting, it gets it out a little bit and then I can settle down more. Those are two ways I can think of for working with restlessness. The problem with restlessness when it's really strong and there's no mindfulness, you sit down and you're restless and the next thing you know, your body's just getting up and moving on to the next thing. Before you know what happens, you're just up and gone. You ever sat down to meditate and you sit down and say, oh forget this and you're just gone. You didn't even have a chance to work with it because it just got you. So any comments or thoughts or opinions, questions about restlessness? Well on the sheet it says restlessness and remorse, how do they relate? Oh yeah. Well it's just like we're saying, the way I think of it is I put that on there and that's traditionally kind of coupled with it sometimes when you'll read about it. Well remorse might be what can fuel things. It's just like worry, fear. So remorse might be for example if say I was in an interaction with someone, have you ever had an interaction with someone and it was a difficult interaction and maybe you said something that might have been a little harsh or a little, yeah you kind of regretted, had some remorse. Oh gee I blew it. Oh I feel bad that I said that. Now imagine if you came to sit. It's possible that you might calm down but it could also be that you're still just, it's still cranking around because that remorse is just oh gee and it's going through the mind. Oh I said this, you know and it can keep, that's a restlessness. It's the energy's too much. You're not settling down. So it's just another, it's a part that could fuel it I suppose is one way to think about it. Hey they want to point out the way, the way not to get into trouble with remorse. It says in the text is to lead a virtuous life. So blin, the way that says is a blameless life. The way you lead a blameless life is to lead a virtuous life and that is following the precepts. But then you feel no sense of blame. You're not going to feel guilty about it. No that's exactly the reason why in the Eightfold Path you know it's divided into these three sections, the seal of samadhi and the punya, what they call the morality and the meditation and the wisdom sections. And we do them all in parallel. You don't have to start with one but the morality, and we don't want to use it in a negative connotation that some people can take that word morality in the west but it's just living your life, you know like the precepts. Wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood if you want to think of that right, right speech, right action, right livelihood which in the precepts are kind of ways of implementing that. Because if we live in ways that are causing more harm, bad, not bad but difficult, harmful, unwise speech or unskillful speech or actions, doing things in the world, it is going to be hard to settle down. This is exactly right. So the mind is not going to be able to go deep. You're not going to be able to you know live your life out of greed and aversion and being a jerk and running around and being an awful person and sit down and kind of go deep in this calm quiet meditation. The mind's not going to do that. That's exactly. So it's purification really. What's that? What is like purification? If you can't have all that block in the way to being able to sit mindfully, does it quiet? Because if you have guilt or greed or those things but it's kind of a purifying. Yeah. And so this actually that gets into a very interesting place that and I'm trying to be really good tonight about staying on topic because that's I mean you're bringing up a really great thing. Let me just say something briefly on it and then we're going to get back. That's a big topic because so we all start in this practice with who we are and we start where we're at. Right. We say that all the time. It's kind of a cliche but that's the truth. Right. You can't be other than you are and you can't be other than where you're at. So if you want to use the word purification which is used in the texts. It's a traditional term. The facility mug as the path of purification which is this commentarial famous commentarial text. We have to be careful with purification because we all would like to probably be whatever pure is. As we're moving towards that we don't want it to be an aversion coming out of aversion for where we're at. We want to be so it starts with self acceptance. Otherwise we're in one of the hindrances already which is aversion like oh I'm all screwed up. I got to get better. That's one thing. Second thing is it can be one of these chicken and egg situations because say we're and I'm saying using this term purposely. So say we're not very pure. I don't know a better way to say that's not a good way but just you know we haven't done much purification so all of our unskillful aspects of ourselves are really up in full force. They will tend to be hindrances for the very work we do that helps clear out or get us free or from those. So the more work we do the more purified we get if you want to say it that way the more purified we get the more we're able to drop down deeper so they kind of support each other. But fortunately the Buddha had this wonderful image in which he said I don't know the exact words but the idea of it is that doesn't matter because just starting wherever we're at is fully enough. And it gets into the idea of conditioning because as we take even one step in a direction it reinforces that it's like the habit or conditioning of the mind is built in that direction. So just by pointing us generally in the right direction of the Dharma that's where the fateful path is and just starting it might be we'll still have our difficulties and you know maybe get caught but it will continue to open to grow like any habit or tendency that we're developing. And the image he used was one of a river and he said sometimes you look at a river and it might have places where you can really see it flowing. Maybe it's narrow and you can really see the flow of the water and other places it might be very deep and wide. You can't even tell that it's moving it is moving of course but it looks like a lake almost. But eventually it doesn't matter if there's only one place for the river to go and it eventually ends up in the ocean. Nothing else is possible it only flows in one direction and it's the same thing with the Dharma only one thing is possible when you sort of step into the river of the Dharma if you will. It's this beautiful image no matter what level or I don't want to say level but no matter to what how or in what way we engage with these teachings that are teachings about bringing more self-awareness more loving kindness and compassion. Just the and of course we all get into this judging and comparing minds I shouldn't say we all but I think it's common for people to do that and want to judge it. We don't know and we're the least qualified to judge. Buddha said there's only one possible outcome freedom and liberation even a moment of trying to even if we're kind of faking it and just trying to pretend like we're a little more loving or a little more compassionate that just is inclining the mind in that direction and then it reinforces it for the next time. So that's I kind of got going off there but anyway that's restlessness. Okay then that's the third one the fourth one sloth and torpor and you know that's if you've ever sat in meditation and you've seen people sitting and they're nodding off and they'll be sitting on kind of jerking and I mean you're just it's like the mind is just thick and cloudy it can be sleepiness which is not sometimes it just feels like it may not even be sleepiness but the mind just is. It almost feels like it's covered with thick blanket you just it's not clear it no matter how much you try you just can't seem to really make it sharp and clear. The image that's used for all these hindrances is for restless in the image that's used it's like it's like there's this pond or a lake and you want to be able to see clearly to the bottom so when the when the water is clear and still you can see very clearly. Right to the bottom easily restlessness is considered the image is like wind that blows across the top makes ripples on the top and then it's whipped it up and so you can't see to the bottom very clearly that's the image of restlessness the image of sloth and torpor is it's like a lot of algae and gunk is growing in the water and you can't see down there just gunked up the mind. That's sloth and torpor now what makes sloth and torpor a hindrance it's just an experience arising right. Which is and that's true for all of these. Very difficult. Yeah. Yeah by its very nature you're just not able to muster up much. Mindfulness or concentration now it's also usually pretty unpleasant. You know to sit in meditation but you can do it I've had meditations when I've been on some longer retreats and just as an experiment when I'd start pushing try to sit up stay up later. And just play with it push it a little bit got to places where you know was I was so sleepy. Actually the mind was kind of clear but there was only two mind states intense sleepiness and intensive version. That was it. But actually that was known in awareness quite easily didn't feel like much so. I'm not going to call that sloth and torpor. The sleepiness. I mean if you just don't have enough sleep right. Yeah you're right body your body and mind needs a certain amount of sleep and you're playing with that which is also good too. I think you're right. I think you're right. It's more like the mind just wants to like shut right. And one of the things it does. What it can do is go to sleep. Yeah I think that's a good thing. Go to sleep. Yeah I think that's exactly right. And it's not sleepiness. I get sloppy in the way I kind of lump them all together but you're right it's more that just that dullness thickness of mind. Once again a version can kick in also with that. So then you've got another aspect to it. You know if so one way to work with the sloth and torpor is you could sit. You know you may not get a lot of concentration or mindfulness develop but you know if you could just be with an ease of heart and just not struggle with it and sit with it. Maybe and you didn't have much aversion it's really not a problem. That's just what's going on in the moment. No big deal. It's one level. You know when you can argue about. Some people might say yeah but it's not really that good of a use of your time. Maybe you should get up and. Whatever get rouse your energy up and that's the antidote to the sloth and torpor is to do things to rouse energy. So sometimes maybe it's better because it can be just an energy imbalance really a lot of the sloth and torpor especially if you start getting into the deeper concentration. That's why when you're doing more retreat practice one of the reasons that you alternate sitting and walking is because you're trying to keep the continuity of the practice up throughout the day as much as possible and you can only sit so long. So part of it is you'll alternate sitting and walking but also another piece is it actually balances the energy out and that's really true and can't be overstressed that you know if you sit and sit and sit too much. Sometimes it can be really clear and sharp and crisp but then as the energy can get out of balance it can really lower and then you need to get up and do the walking and that can help balance up the energy quite well. So that's one of the antidotes is to do something or sometimes just opening the eyes a little maybe take some breaths in the Burmese say if you pull on your ear lobes it's supposed to help but I don't know. I don't know. Maybe there's some acupuncture points there. I don't know but that's what they say. I mean it does hurt if you really squeeze and pull maybe that would kind of sharpen the mind up a little. I don't know. You know if you really yank on them it's kind of hurts. So anyway so you know it's just finding ways and if the mind does shut down like Steve's saying you know maybe I'm Michelle McDonald Smith once said once you've tried everything else maybe nothing maybe you need sleep. There are extreme measures. There's a Jack Haunkville teacher. Joseph Colosene's teacher told him to go sit by a well. Right. Right. You're not going to fall asleep if you're on the edge of a well. Now sometimes also what can happen is you're talking about sometimes the mind wants to shut down. There can be something that wants to be avoided. It's kind of like restlessness is sort of trying to pull us away like I can't be here the energies. Well another possibility is sometimes sloth and torpor can be because there's something that we don't want to see in the mind tends to shut down. You know maybe I'm not sure how to look under that when you have a dull mind you don't really have the tools necessarily so much to work with it but it can just be sometimes that we don't want to be present. So we're spacing out or we're getting dull or all different ways that the mind can. Sometimes the mind can be thick and dull and it's not the same as sleepiness but sometimes we really can just need some rest. So there's a lot of different ways but normally for the real pure sloth and torpor the antidote is to get the energy up somehow. Bring in more energy. Splash cold water in your face. Take some breaths. Open the eyes. Stand up. You know that's instruction in the meditation that's used a lot. You know you'll see people probably seen people sometimes when everybody's sitting and one or two and three are just standing there with standing with eyes closed and still continue with the practice. Works great. You know the Buddha said you can be enlightened in any of four positions right. Sitting standing walking and lying down. That covers them all. Almost. There's another one but that's got almost all of it. So it doesn't matter. It's just how to work. This all comes down to what is occurring moment by moment and how to work with it moment by moment. That's all I need to say. So I don't have that much else to say myself on sloth and torpor. No no no. Don't don't don't worry. That's to me the biggest of all actually for me. OK. Well let's move on to doubt then. The fifth in some ways you can think of the greed or grasping or desire and the opposite of it the aversion that the first two hindrages as being really in some sense those are the two biggies. They're also part of another list called the three poisons called hatred greed and delusion. Hatred is the aversion greed is the opposite the claim same as the first hindrages and the delusion is the underlying ignorance that doesn't see things how they are. So those are two biggies. For me doubt is hopefully we'll have some discussion on this. I'll just say a little bit. It's not referring to to doubt in the sense of you know a healthy doubt of well I doubt that that's true kind of you know somebody says something well I have some doubt I wonder if that's true. It's not that kind of doubt. It's this insidious undermining of our confidence in knowing in ourselves and the practice in our ability to deal with anything. It can be take many forms. I've had on retreats where just just this I call it despair would come up and it's a form of the doubt. I mean it's also unpleasant and get the aversion but just I'd be on retreat and you know you had nothing to do but you sit and walk and like you can't there's no place to go and just all your stuff comes up and I just get I've had the experience where you just drop into this despair and then when the mind kicks in around that it can just feel like you know then the stories kick in and the problem is we don't have mindfulness and to see that their stories are rising and we're just lost in it and we believe it. Oh you know whatever the story is it's hopeless. The way mine always used to go not so much these days but would be you know some version of I'm nothing my life's nothing. Nobody has ever loved me some whatever and just feeling this hopeless black pit of despair. Now that's a strong case of doubt okay but that's an example that I've been through before it's very painful. Not only is it painful so it's very unpleasant and of course the version can kick in but there's something about it it's like you put on these glasses that filter and color everything coming in the very perception the way we view everything is colored by that voice. And so it cuts the legs out from from us it just cuts out from everything our ability to even have some confidence that we can even that it even if this works or that I'm someone that can even do this practice or or that you know that there's any hope or you know it's though that's the kind of doubt. It's that it undermines it doesn't have to be this strong I'm trying to say it in a strong way just to get it across but it can be you know milder versions. So I have some more things I could say about it but I wanted to just kind of open it up a little and see if anybody had any thoughts about that comments questions. Right well like anything right so it is scary I would say two things about it one is depending on the retreat you're in but most of the type of retreats that would be connected with you know our style of practice. First of all you can always go find one of the teachers and just how if you really have to do that or you could get yeah you go take care of yourself you don't have to or you can try to work with it if you can but if it really gets strong if you're really lost in it once again if it's so strong we're not able to work with it. People if you ever go on retreats and you'll see there's a bulletin board usually where people leave notes for the teachers some days you'll notice that some people have like you know 15 notes up there well it's all this kind of stuff going on whatever yeah. Yeah and the teachers point out retreats I mean there's that for one thing to support your practice and the thing that's might say serious about doubt is if you get into that rut I mean your practice immediately stops or you're just going to wallow in it and wallow in it and wallow in it and not get anywhere and going to see a teacher. You know like have you used a different perspective. I know you miss starts this isn't a treat but actually Joe go back to mention how she was a teacher of mine and she once gave a talk to you said I'll never forget my first retreat was 105 and flies all over the place and I don't know who was crazy or me or the guy next to me was sitting this retreat. And hearing her talk about that she had doubt she was. Jekyll Bexley teacher to and she went there to have you among her other books the one I love is every day Zen which I'm sure you're familiar with she's probably done others of your interest it's a great book. So I think when I talk about the insidious nature of these kind of when the when doubt comes up this particular hindrance is where I find that such a hindrance is certainly in my earlier days of retreats. And it shifted for me and I'll talk about that in a minute but in my earlier days when it would come up I would just be shocked you know you're on retreat and I remember the first time I really got hit by this on a longer retreat. There wasn't anything particular sometimes just things actually going on in life that we can point to that were depressed or lonely or whatever the difficulty is about and it can come up in the retreats. The first time it hit me though life was kind of going on okay just came roaring up and I was just shocked and it really got me and it just was so real and I was so lost in it and just struggling. Oh matter of fact the first time I got it I was on a retreat and I was camping near with the meditation Hall but I found this place to camp. It was just over a little hill it was only about a one or two minute walk from the meditation Hall but it felt very isolated but it wasn't really that far far I thought this is a great place to camp. And it was you know you got there everybody sat and walked in the Hall and gave the intro and it was that first evening I walked back and it's dark and I sat and you hear the bell way off in the distance this lonely and it started coming this loneliness and then it went spiral down and I just thought it was the first night of the retreat. I mean I didn't even start and I just went oh not this anything but it was just oh in my stomach and it was so much aversion and it just spiraled again I was just caught in it and I suffered probably for a couple of days. What's happened I have found over time is is that it still can come sometimes not for me I found it just maybe just maturing of the practice not nearly so bad or nearly so often and when it does come. I really tend I don't want to be arrogant and say I will never catch me but pretty much I find now that when it comes up it's known I see it because I've had experience working with it and it can actually be quite difficult and I can just feel it and and just go up. My old friend despair loneliness or whatever that I want to label it and I can feel it and I know that it kind of comes and goes like they say you know like clouds passing through in the sky and I can't tell you how many times I've been on retreat I'd wake up some morning and I'm just in it and it's and that after you know and I'm struggling for a few hours and I don't know what changed I didn't go see a teacher nothing that afternoon. Life's beautiful and I'm full of gratitude and I'm crying of gratitude it's so beautiful you know these these things come and go. So when we're not caught in it. You can just know it see there and just just cool out. And I don't mean cool out in the sense of make it go away you can be present with these difficult experiences and we don't have to get lost in it we can be fully experiencing it and still kind of have a little bit of freedom around it and just be be present with it. One thing I've talked about here before some of you have heard this that I was listening to some tapes of talks that John tomato gave if you don't know some made always just a really fabulous teacher a tie. He's a westerner but he he's a senior monk in a one of the Thai traditions. Some of you may have heard of Amara Vati over in England and he's he's the head Abbott he's the Abbott. And he was talking about when all these different experiences would kind of float through the mind he would he would just meet them with oh loneliness is like this. Despair is like this joy is like this and he would just greet each thing and I found for myself that that was very very helpful. Something about that way of labeling it it did two things for me and you may want to experiment so I've tried it when I've been in really just despair and I would say despair is like this. First of all it did allow me to meet it with mindfulness to say okay it's like this and to get a little space around it so I'm not lost in it. But it also had a little bit of the so that was the sort of the wisdom or the compassion I mean of the mindfulness part but had a little twinge of the compassion it's like yeah you know it's like this. Despair is like this it's painful it's hard it hurts and just to acknowledge the difficulty and still meet and still find a way can I be just present with this and so just to say you know despair is like this and I really have worked with it a lot kind of almost like a mantra. Despair is like this to be present and found that it was actually very helpful. Now sometimes you're doing it because you're really trying to get away despair is like this and you're really trying to like but it's not working it's supposed to make it go away. It may or may not go away. So the antidote so always first if we can be awake enough and not be so when we're lost in it it's going to be very painful right very painful. We can be awake enough we can just be present for it and feel the feelings of it and just sit with it. I was just talking to someone today about a time when I think it was probably with about a year ago I don't remember exactly when I had been through some difficulties and within a period of a couple of days several very difficult things happened. So that I woke up on a Saturday morning and I was just very I just kind of had some I don't know if it would be a depression or just some difficult despair I mean I just woke up with that kind of just. And it turned out that day I didn't have anything that I had to do so I just decided all of a sudden I realized I was trying to make it go away call somebody put on the TV do something and I just realized no I just sat. And I took about I don't know a third or a half of the day. I didn't turn on the TV didn't call anybody didn't answer the phone didn't go out sat on my couch didn't meditate. Didn't try to stir it up didn't try to make it. Alleviate it I just sat there and when I realized I was about to do this it just seemed kind of it scared me like am I really going to just do this and just to sat there. The sound the couch being present and just letting it be didn't do anything with it. Just as an experiment I'm not particularly saying you should do this it wasn't meditation practice and my only task was when I would space out and everything once I realized that I would come back but rather than coming back to the breath or whatever just kept coming back to the actual experience and just sat there in the presence of this experience and let it. Let let the experience be. And over the course later in the day I did that for several hours just sitting there get up I have to go to the bathroom and get a drink of water do that and come and just sit again just like this. Sitting on the couch. What I found was that I could do it. I could be present for it. Just sitting right in the hopelessness and the difficulty and the despair. Now sometimes what's needed is to work on it a little bit and maybe think about well really hopeless figure it out decide what to do you know there's a place for that. Or talk to somebody or just do things to feel but all the things we would normally do. But it is nice to know that through that process we can be present for our experience even if it's difficult. So if we can be present for doubt even though it's unpleasant without getting caught the aversion we can work with it. But the antidote for the doubt is. It's just finding ways to get our faith back if you will. Getting support maybe it's reading the teachings of the Buddha or it's talking to someone or you do go to a teacher on a retreat or whatever it is that you can do. So you're not just stuck on your own in the muck but to get some help to what inspires you what lifts you out or just clears it up and to find those ways. Would you look on your sheet what's the antidote I mean what's the image for doubt. Like muddy water. Was it was I right about sloth interprets like algae moss moss okay and so the doubt is like muddy water. Yeah it's just it's all muddy we can't say and we don't see clearly. It gets back to what we were talking about early about perception it's colored the way we see things we're actually creating. Some kind of meaning making about how things are this creative. So that's the basics I think of those last three hindrances restlessness sloth and torpor in doubt. So you have a little time left if there's anything else yeah. And without I mean it can come from low self-esteem. Oh yeah. I was thinking the other day does it come I mean like low self-esteem or you know just not being sure it's really in that manner of self-doubt. It can come from I mean the life that you've led in this particular particular life from conditioning from your family life from whatever way you might be brought up on what happens. But how much of it is conditioned and how much do you think it comes from just like karmic lean. I mean it can't be as conditioned and karmically or conditioning is karmically and I mean it's just. Right. Yeah. Let's look at this way. Yeah. She asked the question of this the doubt can come from a variety of causes such as it can come from low self-esteem but also make sure I'm saying this right but also maybe there's other things that aren't so evident it might just be the way our minds are conditioned however they got to be conditioned that way. It could have been just from this life or maybe maybe getting to previous lifetimes or karma or whatever where we get the maybe we're born in with this conditioning or whatever and this just talking about karmic conditioning. So let me just say this I have two things to say on it. The first is. There is a. So I want to say that there is a the traditional teachings on multiple lifetimes and rebirth and karmic conditioning. And this and let me I'll just mention something about that. But the second thing is. To me I think those teachings. I don't actually have direct experience myself of previous lifetimes and a lot of that stuff. I don't know I happen to believe in them but it's totally a belief. You know you can have a belief. You just know it's a belief that you don't know. So that's kind of. So I do believe it but I don't know. Well. To me what's really it that's really the belief that I'm going to be. To me what's really it those there's a place where those teachings are useful. But there's a way we can take them that could be also maybe not helpful and you so we want to be careful. What I would say is is for me and everybody's got to find their own place is not a right or wrong. But one let me just say one possible way is is that. However we got to be how we are how we got here with this package with this conditioning. Here we are what are we going to do. I don't actually know about the karma and matter of fact the Buddha called karma. So karma is part of. Goes into conditioning and we're not going to have time to get into that although we could have a good discussion about that and they're not the same thing. But the Buddha said about karma he called it there's a list of four things he called with the unthinkable's. What that means is he said number one they're so vast and intricate and deep that it's not even possible to figure them out even if you try. You'll never be able to figure it all out. And second of all if you did try to it would just blow your mind. It would just cause you a lot of suffering. So don't even go there. Karma is one of those the workings the intricacies of karma is one even though there are teachings on karma. But the kind of things of like was this karmic or did that would be the kind of thing where I think. You know you're going to be a little careful. It can be useful to look back in our lives at what can be known. And as part of dealing with our conditioning or upbringing or our childhoods and to see you know how was I raised you know what was. Whatever my mother or my father or my environment how did I deal with that can be there you know anybody's done some therapy work or whatever can be very. I think it has a place. As to the extent that it's connected in with bringing more awareness into or more. More aware of ourselves right to see oh more understanding or insight into ourselves. When we start getting past that there's a lot that we just don't know and it can get into a lot of different beliefs. Yeah. Very very important to look at. Black or better or basic karma that if you do certain things with your mind and body you know. You know. Forget about anything with the mind but let's say. We like to eat. You overeat and then you feel sick. Well that was a cause and it was a fact there and that's karma. You ate too much. The result was you got sick. You know more. Mind ones is. If you. Your mind is angry. And you act on it. You know it's going to have certain repercussions in your life. Friends I'm not going to like you. You're directly responsible for that. You've caused that. That understanding of karma is extremely important. And that's the skillful the wise use because it helps. Influence or us into want to motivate us to want to act in ways that. Don't create difficult karma. But that the one of the inappropriate ways I would say to use karma if you see someone maybe who's. Crippled or there you know when starving in some third world country. It would. Maybe I don't know but I suppose someone could say well karmically you know karma was part of what. But it's not appropriate to say well you deserve that because you must have had bad karma. Nobody deserves. That would be. I don't think you were saying that but I just want to point that out that that would be a way that would probably not be certainly not a very compassionate way to take. Karma is you know. So we don't want to say well I you know how did I what did I do to myself to deserve this and then we can start to sort of have a negative effect. Anything else. I lived in East Asia and Buddhist countries Japan Taiwan Korea and I found that there is a tendency in society. People actually believe that there would be some sense of. Handicap or whatever. There is some sort of connection to karma and there are actually other religions besides that which is very much. Thinking of some some of the which is almost almost a statement. Things that they can do to make me change. I always found that very disturbing and kind of that it wasn't sort of intrinsic to the fact that there are beliefs. Well yeah and it's I don't know you know. As I said in. It the way the Buddha taught I mean the way it. This I know there's lots of that around what you're talking about. I haven't heard that you know it's possible if you go back into the early suttas that maybe there's places the Buddha talk like that but I don't recall anything like that but definitely there is this. Where Carmen conditioning come together and I think you used a great example but so for example if. I'll just change it a little bit say I'm where I say I am kind of a. Hot headed angry impatient sort of person and I go to work and I've been working with the same people for a few years and every day I'm barking at people and I'm impatient and. Then maybe. Something happens and I change one day I hit my head and I wake up and I'm not that way anymore I walk into work the next day and she I'm a real just mellow nice guy and I walk in and say hey Joe hi Jane how you doing. Well the way I. Acted for those previous years didn't cause them to give me the cold shoulder when I was being nice but it's strongly conditioned it could strongly can contribute to the conditioning so they're going to certainly have that strong tendency or conditioning to to respond in a way so we could think of it as that is I'm getting a karmic result and it's contributed to this conditioning that's been put out there. So the Buddha talked that way kind of the main thing the only reason for anything is is and it said very clearly in all the teachings and we all know this. What's done is done right. You can't all we can do is work with here and now in this moment. How are we going to think speak and act is it leading to more freedom more happiness is what we say over and over rights more liberation. Is it leading to more suffering more difficulty. Sometimes when we don't have the awareness. We're at the effect of things and we are thinking speaking and acting in unskillful ways. Maybe it's not intentional but we're just we don't have the the mindful awareness and we're stuck as we get more wakefulness we start to see that and maybe have some freedom and choice around that that's really all that we're trying to do. And say that people who have that attitude that people deserve the cripple deserve the calmer the corruption of the teaching and someone actually asked that to Jeff Tom Tom Jeff couple of years ago. What do you say. And he said well you know if you were ill or something you would want you to treat you with respect and helpful and compassion just as you would want it. You know you should treat other people. Yeah that's wonderful and we're actually going to end on time tonight so I'll just end with on that exact same note maybe I'll just say that hopefully what we're doing is we're going to be able to do that. Trying to learn is to yes treat others with care kindness compassion but make sure we don't forget to do that for ourselves with care kindness and compassion too. So anyway we're towards the end and every night I've been running over a few minutes so we did well good tonight and we're going to end on time so we'll just end with the traditional short meta practice loving kindness practice that we do. And so I invite you to find a position to sit in or lie down whatever position you need to be in so you can be as comfortable as possible. Some people's bodies won't get comfortable no matter what position they're in and then you do the best you can really try to sit you don't need to be in a fancy posture. And then the way I like to do the meta practice is to start with if your awareness has been out disconnected from yourself and from the body out into the room or into the discussion to reconnect better. And then you can go back in using the body or the breath however you want to and just to connect with awareness into the body and just to be present with whatever is there not having to do anything with it. So opening to the entire range of experience the body states of the mind and the heart and just holding all of that as much as you can with a sense of allowing and acceptance. So it's a practice of deep self acceptance. And we always say that if there is something in your experience or within yourself you're not able to be present for or cannot accept then to make sure you have some acceptance for that place in you that can't be with this. And then from that place of self acceptance to start actively sending some meta towards yourself some loving kindness towards yourself. It can be a feeling or it can just be a thought or a wish of just of well wishing for yourself. May I be happy. May I be peaceful. May I be free from inner and outer harm. May I be free from suffering. Then you can stay with that or if you'd like expand your awareness to all the others here in the meditation hall sending that radiating out the mental or if you don't feel it it's fine it can just be a thought or a wish just as I wish to be happy. May everyone here be happy. Just as I wish to be peaceful may everyone here be peaceful. May everyone here be safe. May everyone here be free from suffering. And then finally extending the awareness radiating this meta this field of met to out really through the whole world and the whole universe is even beyond the world. And just as the rain does not decide to rain down on some people and not on others and just as the sun shines equally on on all beings that we send our met to out to include all beings including no one. There's so much difficulty these days in the world. Can we send the same good wishes out to not only those that we are fond of but people maybe even who are difficult for us just for a moment wishing you know may all beings all beings are the same. All beings want to be happy and free from suffering. Let none deceive another or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another even as a mother protects with her life her child her only child. So with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings. So good night.
