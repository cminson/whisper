 Good morning. Good morning, everybody. It's nice to see you all. So we have our third and our last class today. But before we jump into the topics of today, which will be the theme for today is awakening is available for everyone. This idea that we don't all have to look like the ideal or have a life that seems like reimagine that they awakened people. And so we'll explore that from a few different perspectives today. But and maybe I'll say also along those lines, not only does our life not to need to unfold imperfectly the way that we imagine that an awakened person's life unfolds, but also that can I use this Beatles song we get by with a little help from our friends, something like that, like how people help each other that we practice together. But before we go there, just like to check in about if you have any questions or comments last week, David shared some poems that are about had some were all the practitioners had difficulties. And then their life kind of made this pivot made this turn towards awakening. And then Kim shared a longer poem go to about somebody who chose a different life, different different pressures than what was societal pressures and what were being put on him. So does anybody have any comments or questions? Feel free to raise your zoom hand or your, your physical hand. Yes, Randy. I have a quick question. Are these poets and monks and nuns supposedly or do we have the understanding that they were in direct contact with the Buddha? Well, so this is a good question. And what I'm going to share today, we talk about wolves see where some nuns are talk, have talking to another nun. And I'll unpack this some more. But maybe one more thing I'll say is, and in one of the poems that I shared on the first day, it's the written in such that an off screen, so to speak person is speaking to the monk or nun. And we can assume that it was the Buddha. And certainly, the later tradition holds that it was the Buddha, but we doesn't explicitly say it's the Buddha who was saying this. So that's an assumption we're making. But we don't actually know. Two things come up around that question, Randy, that I think, you know, are of good, you know, are of good, sort of good general importance. The two poems I'll be talking about in just a minute, both imply direct connection and relationship between the people writing the poems and the Buddha. And yet all of these have a lot of these have sort of a theatrical element almost where they the reciting of them would have had a sort of performative ritual devotional aspect as well, as Diana has implied. So they work on a lot of different levels at the same time. And maybe I'll add, I had mentioned there's different ways that awakening gets expressed. And one of them is the Buddha's instructions have been done. So kind of like I did what the teachings were. So that also suggests that I don't know if Yang or Kim, if either of you have any comments. Yeah, maybe I'll just add that the first poem we shared in this course, Patucara is known to be one of the foremost teachers, female teachers. And so you see the references in some of the poems where they would mention Patucara taught them, especially the nouns. Yeah. Thank you, and I'll talk a little bit about that later this morning. Yeah, are there any other questions or comments? Yes, Deborah. So I'm curious. In two ways, I was thinking about our practice and this path of awakening that all of us are on in our ways. And I went back and read the description for our gatherings and inspiration and insight were the two key words for me. So it's sort of a double question. Part of my inquiry to myself is, so how does this, how do I sit with this, you know, reading them aloud and the different things you suggested, but what is there that, you know, is there any shifting going on? Is there, one could say the inspiration is, you know, these various people who have awakened and there seemed to have been a great deal of struggle for the most part up there. And I think they were all nuns, I believe, perhaps some householders. So that's one thing, you know, as an everyday person for all of us sitting with this to be able to bring it into our practice for inspiration and insight. And then the other side of that is, have any of you wise or wise ones experience something directly from these poems? Do any of my teachers inspire us? Yeah, do any of my co-teachers want to talk about this? Or maybe we could ask you, Deborah, so you're asking us to see if we have had insight or inspiration so that others might also, is it? Well, it's twofold. I'm taking responsibility for myself and looking at it, you know, I look at the notes and I look at your suggestions and how does this, how is this going to support insight and inspiration in my practice? And then the other part was for the four of you, what have you experienced in practicing with these poems? Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. I see Ying leaning towards the unmute button. Great. Yeah, so my heartfelt sense is that if the teachings haven't touched us deeply inside of us, it would be hard for four of us to offer this kind of teachings because they can be difficult to intellectually analyze and debate. We don't know how, what they experienced directly, but there is some sense that all of us can touch in, in our deep sense of a being, that, oh, there's something this poems are pointing to that touches us, that may be resonating in us in some way. And so maybe that's what I would say. Maybe I will add that the reason why we chose this name is because I think, I don't know if this is the ninth or the 10th class that we've taught together. And we had this idea, you know, we're just the four of us, we tend to be a little bit more analytical, a little bit more, I'll just use that word analytical. And so we said, let's do something that speaks to us. That's a little bit different. That's we ourselves have found to be inspiring and touching. So we wanted to approach this class a little bit differently, just from our own experience. Just from our own experiences. And maybe I'll take off there to sort of launch the first, the first teaching part of the day, of the class. But I'll start with the response to Deborah's question. I think one of the reasons that maybe it's a little hard to answer the second part of your question is that the poetry, like music, as it's been said of music, expresses things that must be said, but can't be said in conventional prose. These things point to things that in a way the awakening experience is beyond language. And one of the reasons that poetry is particularly, I think, powerful in doing this is the way it works with language. So I would just echo what Ying said, I think for each of us, and I'll try to illustrate that now with your question as I talk about some of this theme of awakening being available to all, sort of how these poems have touched me, both on the insight and the inspiration side. Excuse me. Excuse me. So I'm going to share screen. Well, let me think here how to do this. Yeah, I want to talk about two aspects of this idea that awakening is available to everyone, to all of us. I like saying all of us instead of everyone, because we're included in this dispensation of anyone, all those who can become awakened, it includes us to this group of 23 sitting here, practicing together. This group of Kalyanamita, a theme we'll meet later in the day of spiritual friends or companions on the path. I'm trying to speak as loud as I can. I have asthma and it's smoking where I am. So I'll do my best. I may clear my throat from time to time. So first I wanted to talk about the case of, and I'm going to share screen, of a practitioner known to us as Lakunta Baidya. Lakunta Gabaidya. Sometimes you see this name separated. And this is a person named Baidya who was a dwarf. Lakunta means dwarf. And here's his poem, which I'm going to read. I think I'll later ask somebody to read a particular stanza. But we have a poem that we'll read in a second. But we have Lakunta Gabaidya's story going like this, his poem. Baidya, that is this practitioner, has plucked out craving, root and all. And in a jungle thicket on the far side of the Amabhutteka Park, he practices jhana. He is truly well favored. Some delight in drums and lutes and in symbols, but here at the foot of a tree, I delight in the Buddhist teaching. If the Buddha were to grant me one wish, and I were to get what I wished for, I've left that at the bottom of the page, because as I read this, I thought he's a dwarf. He's going to wish for full height to be like everybody else. But he says, if the Buddha were to grant me one wish, and I were to get what I wished for, I'd choose that the whole world be always mindful of the body. As I read this, Deborah, even today, I'm filled almost with tears. To me, this is just very sweet, very powerful, couldn't maybe tell you why in words. But it definitely moves me and moves my practice. Those who've judged me by my appearance and those who've followed me because of my voice, they're under the sway of desire and lust. They don't really know me. It's not clear whether this particular practitioner had a beautiful voice or whether in a world which was dominated in a way we have a hard time imagining by darkness. No artificial light beyond the flickering lamp oil lights in the night. Not knowing what's inside, not seeing what's outside, the fool obstructed all around, is carried away by my voice. Not knowing what's inside, but discerning what's outside, they too, seeing only the external fruits of practice are carried away by my voice. Understanding what's inside and discerning what's outside, they, seeing without obstacles, are not carried away by my voice. So a very powerful little poem about difference and how, in this case, a practitioner struggles with being different in the community. And in seeing more clearly with his awakening also is, I think has a lot of clarity around how people perceive him and knows in a sense his true friends by knowing those and sticking close, I think, to those who understand what's inside and aren't carried away by what they see of him, not carried away either by his beautiful voice or by his on atypical stature. We learn more about Lakundaka Baidya in a couple other things, and there's a discourse in Samyutta Nikaya 21.6 that talks about this same character, and I love this, and it ends with a stanza, so I'm including it in our discussion of poetry. It says, at Sabati, a familiar location in the suttas, then the venerable Lakundaka Baidya approached the blessed one, the blessed one, the Buddha, saw him coming in the distance and addressed the practitioners around him, the bhikkhus, the monks, in this way. Bhikkhus, do you see that bhikkhu coming, ugly, unsightly, deformed, despised? Yes, venerable sir. That bhikkhu, Lakundaka Baidya, is of great spiritual power and might. It is not easy to find an attainment which this bhikkhu has not already attained, and he is one who by realizing for himself with direct knowledge in this very life enters and dwells in the unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life, from the home life into homelessness. This is what the Buddha said, and then the Buddha captures this, and maybe this gets back again to Deborah's question. Here's a prose description of it, but here's how the Buddha captures it in an exclamation in verse, and I wonder whether somebody would volunteer to read this. I can't see everybody's pictures. Would somebody just unmute and read these two stanzas for us? Somebody feeling their voice this morning? Somebody in good voice? All right, I'll go ahead and do it. Thank you, thank you. Geese, herons, and peacocks, elephants and spotted deer, all are frightened of the lion regardless of their body size. In the same way among human beings, the small one endowed with wisdom, he is the one that is truly great, not the fool with a well-built body. I love this, a little couple of stanzas, particularly that last couplet. He is the one that is truly great, not the fool with the well-built body. So there's a lot going on here, but the Buddha in his own voice is here giving support to a practitioner who comes to the community different from others. This theme here, that one who is truly great, one who is truly great in the Buddha's practice, that the greatness in the practice isn't determined by how we're born. It's not determined by the physical body we're born into, nor is it determined by the social status that we acquire at birth. And the next poem I want to share is one that you think, do I have enough time? Yes, there's one more thing about Bhaidya that I'll say, Bhaidya the dwarf. We have another couple references to him and another couple exclamations of the Buddha that capture really important things. I just wanted to notice, and I think again maybe it's related to Deborah's nice question that launched us here today, just that we can see echoes with the things we just we talked about Tuesday. I mean Diana said last week, it was actually just two days ago, it may seem like last week, but on Tuesday we talked about ways that awakening appears, and this also came up Saturday. And here the particular awakening experience that Lakhrutika Bhaidya seemed to be talking about or seemed to have experienced is this one of not finding self in the five aggregates, a theme which was repeated. And again in these poems, these sorts of themes that we can see others awakening to the same sorts of seeing clearly that may be familiar to us in our practices. So not only the well favored, but also not only the privileged have access to awakening in the Buddha's practice. And this is a really wonderful poem by a man Sunita. And I'll sort of comment as we go as I've been doing, but also try to hold some of the poetry as poetry. Sunita's poem says, I was born in a low-class, we might say today, low-caste family, poor, little to eat, my job was lowly, I threw out the old flowers, probably the old flowers in the graveyard in the cemetery. And, you know, association with cemeteries then as now has frequently fallen to lower class or lower caste people shunned by people I was disregarded, I was disregarded and treated with contempt. I humbled my heart and paid my respects and bowed down to many people. This is important the bowing down, we'll see why at a moment. So this is a person who is lowly and cast because of birth, who is in the habit of bowing to everyone, everyone bows, he bows to everyone. Then I saw the Buddha honored by the Sangha of monks surrounded by his followers, entering the capital of Magadha. I dropped my I dropped my carrying pole and approached to pay my respects and out of compassion for me, the Buddhist stood still. When I had paid my respects at his feet, I stood to one side and asked this most excellent of all beings for the going forth, that is permission to become a follower, to be recognized as a monastic follower. The teacher being sympathetic and having compassion for the whole world said come then monk and this was my full ordination. So nothing to achieve, nothing to have been proven with the asking to become a follower. The Buddha says come, come and that's all that takes for this person to become equal to everyone else in the Buddha's community of practice. And then we hear something about his practice, staying alone in the wilderness without laziness, that is mindful. I did what the teacher said, right, fulfilling the teacher's instructions we know from other poems. As the conqueror, the Buddha had advised me. And then we see an experience exactly like the Buddha's. In the first watch of the night, I recollected previous verse. In the middle watch, I purified the divine eye. In the last watch of the night, I tore apart the mass of darkness. I let go of the defilements. At the end of the night, as the sunrise drew near, Indra and Brahma came and paid homage to me with hands and anjali. So a person who found himself humbled and bowing to everyone is now having the gods bow to him. And when the Buddha saw me honored by this assembly of gods, he smiled and said the following, by austerity and by living the holy life, by restraint and by taming the mind, by this one as a holy person. This is the supreme holiness. So we see here that somebody of humble birth, possibly somebody of what we would now think of as a lower caste birth, we find that in the Buddha's dispensation, birth doesn't determine our possibility of awakening. And as we learn from other teachings and other in the suttas, if not by birth, then by what? By action, by kama, by what we do and how we practice, can we become also free? And in that freedom, everyone's equal. And an interesting parallel, since I have a minute, is just to round out the other half of that, both in the suffering we know, regardless of the kind, the forms it takes, and in the freedom that we can come to know at the awakening that the Buddha describes is available to all of us. Okay. Thank you, David. So now we will meditate together. So let's take a little time to maybe take these poems in. So finding a posture for meditation, settling in, bringing the attention inward to the sense of the body sitting. If you're comfortable doing so, you can close your eyes, maybe soften in the face, softening the shoulders, down through the belly, really sensing into where you're sitting, your seat against the chair or the cushion or the bench, your legs or feet against the floor, or perhaps your whole body is lying against the surface, just sensing what supports you physically and letting go into that relaxing, letting yourself be upheld. Maybe on the next exhale, softening the body a bit more, relaxing and letting all the air just naturally go out, and breathing in a bit more gently. And bringing to the mind an attitude of calm and friendly awareness, really feeling how it is right now for you. How is the body? How is the mind? How is the heart? The sense of openness and kindness for this one, this one here. Just a human body, one body among all the possible ones, this one, in Asuta, the Buddha defines two kinds of beauty. One is the beauty of complexion, the second kind that is seen, and the other is sublime beauty, the second kind coming from one's spiritual depth. Spiritual beauty comes from letting go of the activities that bring suffering, whether outer behaviors or inner views. Sensing the beauty, the inner sublime beauty of one's heart and mind, even if it's just a little wisp. Finding that place of calmness or peace or love, it has so many faces. One Pali word for this sublime beauty is kalyana, spiritual beauty. Just resting in the sense of inner beauty. Simply by doing this practice, we have brought something beautiful forth. Knowing that in yourself, touching that. Thank you. Thank you. The small one endowed with wisdom. He is the one that is truly great, not the fool with the well built body. So resting in our real life body, just how it is. With the inner sublime beauty of the mind. It is available to all. Sometimes we can sense this. And sometimes we can't. And if that's the case today, then knowing also that even inclining toward beauty, even knowing that it's possible, is beautiful. Thank you. And as David said about these poems, we express what wants to be expressed, but can't be expressed. So perhaps touching this inner beauty, we may want to express, but can't quite express. So we try out a phrase like, May I be at ease. How true will be. Touching into the heart. May all beings find peace. May all beings shine with sublime beauty. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I just want to take a moment to take in that silence and the beautiful guided meditation that Kim did and the sharing that David shared offered this morning. So we are going to transition into small groups breakout room for us to share some reflections based on what's being shared today. And this question that will offer for you to reflect on is, how do this poems inspire you? And this may come in the form of words. Maybe you can get creative. Maybe it's a drawing and have a piece of paper that you like to draw out what might have inspired you and feel free. And so, as both Kim and David were saying, maybe certain things are harder to put into words. Maybe there are different forms of expressions that come along. Maybe it's a silence. So the poems that we shared today represented individuals that are far from the ideal idealized image of the Buddha. And often we had an image of the Buddha being quite a magnificent individual. And all of that. And so, yet the poems that we shared talked about individuals that are from lower classes that may be physically feels quite different. And the dwarf who had apparently ugly appearances. And so they may have gone through or faced tremendous barriers from a society from culture, maybe even from the family. And just, you know, for me feeling into their lives, maybe there are some deep internalized identifications they had to overcome on the journey of awakening. And yet, both of those individuals we shared today, Sunikta, and I can pronounce the other person's name. Have ended the craving once and for all. So, and those are being defined as the truly great. So how might you be inspired by this? So you will be getting into small groups. I invite you if you need a moment to collect as a group, feel free to do that. And once you gather together and ready to share, maybe use your zoom, zoom names, ordered by alphabetical order to start. If one is not ready, maybe share with the group and see if the next person would be ready to start. And this is sharing, learning from each other kind of exercise. And so, maybe each person take one point, and then listen to the next person, and then circle back. So you have about 10 minutes. Yeah. So, thank you I think David, I just put the question in the chat box. And here we go enjoy. All right. I think we're all back is that right. Yeah, okay. Well, and so we are going to open this and invite some additional sharing reflections or questions at this time. So again, if you want to use zoom room, or just raise your hand. I think for those who are on the video. Okay, I see Jerry. There's so much I could say but I won't, I'll just have to pick one. It's just amazing how three words put together can have such a deep and probably long lasting effect it's just amazing to me, but I'm picking this one is David you and I might and my question sort of is does it make a difference and my guess is it probably doesn't. But I really resonate deeply to tour part the the mass of darkness. So you had suggested that that's those are the defilements and I intuitively and I think that line shows up in two or three different poems at least two of them. But to me, it was just, it's about my ignorance, which is about based on delusion. And, and because that's where I'm at in my practice and to me in the long run maybe that that saying it's the defilement or saying is ignorance which is one of the defilements doesn't really make any difference. But I love that line I can't explain why tearing apart the mass of darkness. And to me on the other side of ignorant to get through ignorance, you're turning up the light of wisdom. And so that destroys the darkness I just find that beautiful. Yeah, thank you for sharing this, this is a pointing to what both Kim and David have been painting or being explicit that there are things that are expressed in the limited number of words, and that may be hard to put in the specific vocabulary on them. And so I can feel that you have a very deep heartfelt resonance in this, just trust that. Yeah, trust that. So thank you. Thank you for that heartfelt sharing. Michael. I think it's interesting to think about these repeated tropes that appear, you know, so that, you know, three crooked things, you know, appear in multiple poems and the Terragatta and Peragatta. And so, you know, for a couple of years like exactly the same words over and over, and so it was interesting to think about these as little, you know, presumably they were very inspirational to people, and so people were, you know, like one person, you know, one practitioner from someone, and then in the moment of their own awakening or inspired by their own awakening, want to like share this same inspirational thing they'd heard, or maybe these little repeated things were solving certain problems of meter and rhyme, you know, because coming up with meter and rhyme is hard and so it's sort of like, oh, that's a great turn of phrase and so I want to, you know, I want to use that too, you know, it's it was just interesting to see these things kind of migrate around I don't know if this poetry was orally transmitted before it was ever written down or if it was actually composed and written form, but thinking about the oral transmission and the sort of repeated little memory units. So it was just, I, you know, I was struck by seeing these little tropes and then for some of the ones where they're actually describing the moment of awakening. They're repeating exactly what the Buddha described, you know, so in the first watch of the night, I gained the first knowledge right in the second watch of the night, and that, and, you know, it struck me that you're hard pressed to find kind of a major religion, where people in the religion basically say, and I achieved exactly the same thing as the founder, you know, in other religions when you say I achieved the same thing as the founder that like it's you killed, you know, but in Buddhism, that's like what you're, that's the point is that you can achieve exactly the same thing as the Buddha. And so, that to me, you know, at first I was a little. I'm unsure about how to relate to some of this word like it felt a little like wrote or whatever, but then, but then my understanding flipped and it's like, wait a minute, they're basically saying, I achieved exactly the same thing as the Buddha, like, in the Buddha's words, I did that, and it's like, wow, that's very intense. And so, just want me to share that. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. I just, I love that you're unpacking this is in several different dimensions, right and this understanding of the recitation maybe the auto transmission, and the way poetry works, and maybe some of the things that are common that are being taught, being repeated again again. So it's very rich I just want to kind of open it up and see if any of my co teachers wanted to jump in and comment. Maybe I'll just add that noticing that some of the same phrases are in different poems. The later tradition, that is like maybe 800, 2000 years after the Buddha, when they're looking back on this, they, they wrote down at that time that they were friends, that some of these people that have the same language were friends, and I kind of exactly as you said Michael I like this idea that being open to influence from others. And I would just add a point to another thing wonderful, wonderful contribution of Michael's there. It's a very powerful idea that we, all of us, you know, can experience what the Buddha experienced. I think the, the, the role of memory in that, and we might say of Sati right of mindful attention to what's going on is powerfully supported by the chanting practice and internalizing the instructions and internalizing the language of those instructions and that certainly in a, in a time when these poems were memorized and passed on by chanting, you know, would have been part of the daily practice of that of that chanting and that function of memory. So anyway, just want to point that the connection again there between Sati memory and pain, keeping things in mind and experiencing what the Buddha experienced, you know, are are very very close. Thank you. And I see a DT. Yeah, thank you. So one of the questions that came into my mind when I read all of these is, Oh, do I have the knowledge that they have maybe like you know so so my thought was, Oh, you know what, soon as I retire I'm going to sit for seven days, or maybe there's, there's like more methodical so there was some self doubt. Is that really true is what we are learning enough. First I have to say you know when you guys were in breakout room for us were in breakout room we were resonating with the fact of how important it is to do some residential retreats. I think, for me right now I'm in a retreat setting, just putting away a lot of things that we usually do a such a great simplification of body mind and heart. And there is a real impact of it. So maybe that's what I would say for now. So, David did those will be our last question before we turn to the next piece. It's really not a question as much as a comment about the repetition. I found my, I find myself when I read that feeling like the person submitting that I came to the teacher, seeking to acquire something somewhat selfishly. And that what I learned was basically one burden myself for that selfish aspect. And it was more like, and now I'm a part, you know, of the teachers wisdom that this, you know, like the barrier has been broken. And so, you know, in a way I think it's a, it's a beautiful expression of gratitude to the song. Yeah. So, anyway, that's my comment. Beautiful. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for pointing that out. Lovely said. So I'm gonna pass to Diana. Yes, and thank you. David's comment right then was is a great segue and to what I'd like to talk about now. Often, or maybe it would be easy enough to imagine that this practice is solitary affair. We've certainly we've been talking about individuals, nuns and monks they have names or imagining them as people, perhaps similar or not so different than ourselves. We talk about also you know the individuals striving for enlightenment or working towards awakening and then becoming awakened and certainly the Buddha is depicted as a solitary figure so would be easy to kind of think about or assume that this practice is all about the individual. But also, we know this and we've talked about this a little bit that Buddhism, of course, grew out of community and connection with individuals. Certainly, at the time of the Buddha, that there was a monastic community and there were followers, and not everybody was near the Buddha all the time, but instead they were hearing the teachings from each other. Of course, how else could it be. They don't have podcasts and books and, you know, all these resources that we have available now. So, there was really a reliance on each other. And we do know that the Buddha also placed immense importance on the company we keep. And there's a one sentence study says in the Gudara, I do not see even a single thing that so causes wholesome qualities to arise as good friendship. And this word friendship is Kalyanamita. Kim dropped in this word Kalyan as beauty. So Kalyanamita can be expressed or translated a number of different ways. And I love this I love when there's different aspects and we can look at it from different points of view. So, one is good spiritual friend. Beautiful friend. The Kalyanamita the Pali allows us to also say, friend of the beautiful. So, just in this kind of way of touching into like what is the beautiful Kim pointed us towards some of the beauty inside with practice. So, now I would like to share screen and to share a little bit of some poems that talk about this directly. So let's see here. Can I get a thumbs up if you can, if you can see what I know you can. Yes, now you can. Okay. So, this is an under the was the attendant to the Buddha. This is just one stance he has a really long poem in the Terigata here's just one stance. If you want to understand the teachings, you should be friend, the sort of person who is learning, and has memorized the teachings, a wise disciple of the Buddha. And then we can see also in the next slide we can see that Atsa gotami, a nun, that opening of her poems, she recalls she brings to mind with a Buddha had sent the sage looked at the world and said, with good friends, even a fool can be wise. Keep good company and wisdom groans. Those who keep good company can be freed from suffering. So, going back to ananda, the rest of his poem. He talks about the Buddha as being a friend uses this word friend. And if you are familiar with this Ananda story that after the death of the Buddha, and Nanda was really distraught, of course he was distraught. He had been the Buddhist companion for so long. And here's ananda saying as part of his awakening poem he gives a little bit of like how his path unfolded. And you can imagine the death of the Buddha is set had such a big impact on his life that it is in his awakening poem. And when he is completely disoriented, the teachings don't spring to mind. With the passing of our good friend, everything seems dark. And then maybe with a change of a perspective, when your friend has passed away, your teacher is passed and gone. There's no friend, like mindfulness of the body. You can pivot this turn in the midst of distress towards practice and mind mindfulness of the body. So many of us are familiar with this practice, like the mainstay of like okay what's actually happening here and now, especially when we're getting overwhelmed or something. Also, Randy asked about where do they have contact with the Buddha. I said that was what the tradition holds. That's an assumption. A little bit embarrassed but Ying, right well, what about Patacara, she was a well known teacher, and I'd like to say a little bit about Patacara. We opened this class with that poem, David brought her in yesterday and I'm going to bring her in a little bit today, not her poems, but in her role as a teacher. And it's before I bring up the next slide just to be reminded that coming from a society in which largely women were expected to be mothers or wives or maybe even courtesans. It's striking to discover women who were really respected for their spiritual detainments really respected for their leadership skills and the fact that they were awakened, especially when we consider that there weren't there were few if any exemplars or precursors or certainly structures that allowed women to arise to the role of being a teacher. But we might also imagine that we know that the monastic communities are kept separate. The men are with the men and the women are with the women. So if we remember that they might say, of course, they're going to be women who rise up to teach other women, because they spend so much time together. And the rules for the nuns are that they should not be alone, just for their own safety at that time. So, we might imagine that there's a number of women who became teachers, but we know about Parachara. So now with this next slide is is Chanda, who is a nun who is talking about Parachara being her teacher. I used to be in a sorry state as a childless widow, a ref to friends or relatives, so I got neither food nor clothes. I went to the bowl and the staff and went begging from family to family. For seven years I wandered burned by heat and cold. Then I saw a nun receiving food and drink. Approaching her I said, send me forth to homelessness. And then I came here, maybe what David Weisskopf was said a little bit earlier about approaching a teacher wanting something we might imagine the poor Chanda here is hungry. It's starving maybe. And she sees, oh, the nuns receive food. Well, maybe I should just be coming down. We don't know what her intentions are. Maybe she just simply wanted some food. And then she continues, out of compassion for me, Parachara gave me the going forth. That means ordain to her to become a nun. Then, having advised me, she urged me on to the ultimate goal. After hearing her words, it did her bidding. The lady's advice was not in vain. I am free of defilements. So here's the power of Chanda to become awakened and the power of Parachara to help her become awakened. So, it's not only Parachara or maybe it is, it's not quite clear. I'm going to read some of these other poems. This one is by Anu Dara. And she's describing another nun who helps her. In the 25 years since I went forth, I have not found peace of mind, even for as long as a finger snap. I feel like, damn right, she had been a nun for a long time, but still wasn't able to find the peace of mind. Failing to find peace of heart, corrupted by sensual desire, I cried with flailing arms as I entered a dwelling. I approached a nun in whom I had faith. She taught me the Dharma, the aggregates, sense fields, and elements. When I heard her teaching, I retired to a discreet place. I know my past lives, my clairvoyance is purified. I comprehend the minds of others, my clairaudience is purified. I realized the psychic powers and attained the ending of defilements. I realized the six kinds of direct knowledge and fulfilled the Buddha's instructions. Really powerful. So, she is saying, you know, after so long of practicing, maybe there's a nun, not until maybe a nun that really helps her along and maybe points her in where she was stuck or helping her see things she hadn't seen. And then she has these visionary experiences that are part of her awakening experience. And to be sure, throughout the suttas, there is some individuals do have these kind of visions, but not all of them. So they're not a prerequisite, they're not required, but here maybe Anupa shares with us her, maybe extreme or intense, or I'm not exactly sure what to use, magnificent maybe, her awakening. So in this way, pointing to how it's the individuals are practicing together and helping each other, finding their way towards awakening. So maybe with that, I will turn it over to Kim. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Well, we're approaching the end. So now is another time for comments or questions. Yeah, anything that's coming up based on today's teachings, or on the course as a whole. Now that you've soaked in these poems for almost a week. Alex. I just wanted to say that I get so much more out of talking and hearing about, like, this kind of like poems like this in a group as opposed to just sitting and reading it myself, you know, part of a group like this I'm kind of new to this and it's really, really wonderful. So I want to express that. Very much in line with Diana's theme of Kalyanamita. Yeah. Thank you. Deborah. Well, I want to echo. I want to echo that. Yeah, the cat really enjoys this. Totally, he totally relates to it. And I too, poetry is an art form and I have found, even though I'm still fairly new to it, that when I hear different views and I, you know, I people share their insights and whatnot. And I think that it's so enriching and it just opens it up so much more than than what I get from my own singular view. And the other thing is, it would be lovely if this could continue in some way I think there's the breakout rooms are wonderful and there, there's a real also there's a deepening I think with ongoing practitioners, you know, there's this, not that you have to know each other. To be very open this seems to really encourage people to be very present at least the ones I was in. But I would vote for a continuance in some way. So thank you very much. Thank you. Well, yeah, we do intend to keep offering these classes from time to time David will say a little bit about that in a moment. But, Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments from the other teachers on anything so far. Maybe. Now I just want to point out that there is a chat message also. Oh, Kim you want to read the questions. Yes. There's two resources for hearing poems read in the original poly language on the net or other bibliographic resources. That's a great question. It's actually lovely to hear Polly. There is a site where you can hear various suitors read in Polly. I'm drawing a blank on the screen. I'm not sure what it is. It's something obvious like Polly reading.com or something like that. But I want the qualifiers I don't know if these poems are on there but certainly there's a one where suitors read in Polly there are recordings of them, Polly recordings, something like that. Diana, do you know this one. No, okay. I just read about it recently. I think it's maybe a year old or so. I know about it but like you I don't know that I can't bring it to mind. Right. If we find something before we send out the final name. We'll look for it. Thanks for asking. Karen. I want to thank you all also. And I want to say, I know these people who wrote these poems. They feel like they're my Sangha. And I feel this like sense of these are my friends, and just the way the timelessness of them and the way they connect. They connect me through centuries of time to now. And I just really appreciate that feeling of they are like me they are like us I am like them and the breakout rooms I hear people say things there's poetry and the way we all speak. And as we stumble our way into awakening and the defilements and so I just feel really grateful for expanding the conversation over time in this way. It's so heartful and poetic. So thank you. Beautiful. Thank you. There is a timelessness to these poems and actually to all of the poly cannon to my heart at least I consider it to be a link in the strand of living Dharma. Throughout time. So thank you for putting that into such beautiful words. Bill is your hand up. Continuing on that theme. There's a saying, the past is a foreign country. I think what they're trying to get at is the culture was so different. The situations were so different that you have to immerse yourself and past studies to really understand it. But no, in these poly cannon suitors. I find them easy to read and understand the people's concerns and their very way of thinking seems very familiar to me. It's like, you know, get rid of the computers and automobiles and so forth and there's no difference. That was my thought. Beautiful. Thank you. Maybe that's a nice place to shift onward to David. Yeah, we'd like to, you know, we're, we're close to our close and it's nice to hear these expressions of shared sort of gratitude for the teachings and also shared shared sort of friendship around the practice. So it's it's it's it's a nice place to close right about now we're sometimes struck by people's expressions of gratitude and people sometimes ask how can we, how can I support these offerings of the of the study and practice series and. And the city center. We love the way that our joy in sharing the teachings freely is met by, you know, sometimes this kind of upwelling of wanting to make this part of a shared practice to the offering freely of the teachings the offering freely of support. We will include a link in the final email that goes out to await that you can donate to the city center to support teachings to support teachers, and it's also there on the city center website there's a little button you can push to donate so should your practice, you know, move forward generosity of spirit. We love given these teachings freely and we love that people meet that with, you know, a generosity practice when that when that comes up. We want you to hold the dates for the next class people have asked about that. Let me just bring up those dates. Yeah, November 13 1618 20, you don't have to remember this, keep an eye on the city center website but mid November 13 1618 20 will be doing another series that we've done before Saturday Tuesday Thursday Saturday. And we're going to focus, we expect we plan on why speech. So more of a practice and maybe more of a practical focus than some of the other classes we do. We're really looking forward to that. And continuing with you and we expect lots of others in that class. So I'm going to pass it to you for final closing word. Yeah. Just very touched by all the comments and sharing. And the courses is so far. So we'll take a moment to to to gather together as a community, as the kaliyana meet us together, practicing together sharing reflecting and learning the drama. I love that in my Chinese Buddhism tradition. Usually when we get together in this form we're calling each other's Dharma siblings, Dharma sisters and Dama brothers and they weren't really a big family here are sharing a long lineage, where we're a part of a family that we share deep roots of. So, may all the goodness and that bubble up through this course through our gathering together, learning, reflecting, listening and taking into our heart and mind or body deeply. May the goodness become a resources that support your ongoing exploration on the Starma path. And may the goodness become a resources for many you meet. And may the ripple out in all directions. Touch all being. May all beings know peace. May all beings know freedom. Thank you all for being here. And you can unmute. Oh, I just saw a message from Deborah. Yeah. Thank you everyone. We'll see you hopefully in November, or when you will. Thank you for the class. Thank you. Take care.
