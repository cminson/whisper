 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay, so we'll begin with our sieving, allowing yourself to find a comfortable posture, settle in for our time of practice together. And if you're comfortable, please close your eyes, allow the attention to come inward. And just taking a moment to kind of survey the body, the mind, the heart. How are you right now? You know, with the awareness that we are looking at how things are. Perhaps with a sense of appreciation for the opportunity to practice. It's a good use of time. And just softening the body, softening the muscles of the face and the eyes and the eye sockets, allowing the shoulders to release and sink down, softening any holding in the belly, any bracing in the legs or arms, and then sensing into the straightness of the spine. Sometimes it's even useful to pass the attention through the spine from the bottom to the top, just relaxing and aligning each vertebra. And then bringing mindfulness into the mind, just the simple awareness of the present moment. And allowing the attention to settle onto the sensations of the breath. Just the simple in and out movement like a rhythm. Putting the attention there as a resting place for the mind, allowing it to gather its energies. There's nothing magic about the breath, but we can use it, use this natural phenomenon as a support for mindfulness. So maybe just noticing whether the breath is generally long or short. And it might be that the in breath is long and the out breath short or vice versa. They don't have to be the same. And if we just watch the natural breath, there will be a tendency for it to get softer and shorter. There's no control of the breath in our practice. We can broaden the attention, still maintaining some awareness of the breath, but broadening the attention to the whole body. Perhaps sensing the breath in the body or as an aspect of the body. Using the natural occurrence of having a body as a way to support the mind. And it's okay if the body is somewhat uncomfortable or otherwise not up to our ideal. It is as it is, and we accept that and just tend to release any tension that might be in the body, especially tension that's due to the mind, due to the way we are relating to the body, just softening that. Letting the body be as useful as it can while breathing in and out. Thank you. And if we find that thoughts are coming in, that's quite normal. But we can just gently reopen to the body and the breath as if we're releasing the thought like releasing a balloon whose string we have accidentally been holding, just let it float away. Just gently tranquilizing the sense of the body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now opening to the possibility of some kind of joy in the mind, perhaps arising simply because the body is more at ease than it was before. This wouldn't be joy like leaping in the air and celebrating but a simple inner joy that comes from ease and bodily tranquility. It may be very mild or it may be stronger, but we can open to that possibility. If we allow that to infuse the body, perhaps spreading it with the breath. They also feel a kind of softer feeling behind it, more like happiness or contentment. Again, it could be subtle. Even if the mind is fairly active and still not wanting to stay in the present moment, there can be contentment that we're practicing with that, that we're here doing this meditation. In a sense, contentment is always available to be content with being here for this. I hope you'll feel that. Thank you. Thank you. And if you just continue with the breath and the ease in the body, in a sense of inner happiness in mind, that's fine to just rest with that. It's also possible to use the breath and the sense of happiness as a support to open to the process of thinking, to actually use and allow the presence of thinking as part of meditation. And we would stay in the present moment, not do the thinking, but watch the thinking. Watch it like an activity, like a parent watches a child playing, just the playing of the mind with its thoughts. Or maybe there aren't any thoughts. That's fine also. We would be aiming to settle the mind completely. Sometimes that doesn't happen until we allow the activity of the thought and then just let it settle out the way we settled out the body earlier. So trying that and remembering that you have the support of the breath in the present moment and the support of the inner happiness from meditation. Allowing mental activity without becoming active. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Gently allowing mental activity to just settle out. Breath the body, the inner happiness of meditation. It can start to be a feeling of wholeness. Wholeness in the mind and body system. It can start to be gathered around just the present moment experience. Nothing is disallowed. There is no distraction either. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So as we approach the end of this meditation, perhaps just reflecting a bit on the experience of opening slowly to the breath and the body, the support of our inner happiness. of our inner life and then allowing mind to be as it is. Is there a way that this is also valuable in our daily life? The balance of having an inner anchor or orientation or reference point that we stay with and allowing things to come and go as they do, allowing the mind to be as it is. Can there be both a clear sense of inner orientation and a complete openness to how things unfold? And wouldn't this be a support for not only for ourselves living peacefully among the ways of the world, but also a support for others in that we would be available to them, open, responsive, flexible, without losing our own balance and hence providing the support for them. They're not balanced. We don't always have the capacity for all of that, but we can understand the potential of cultivating the mind so that it's grounded and also open and flexible. It's a real gift.
