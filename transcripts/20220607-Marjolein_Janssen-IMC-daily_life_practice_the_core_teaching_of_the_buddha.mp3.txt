The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Welcome again.
So, for those who came in a little later.
I think that Andrea has been talking about daily life practice
past weeks, and I thought I'd bring today's topic also in that context.
And today I'd like to talk about the core teaching of the Buddha.
What is often most emphasized when we talk about Buddha's teachings is the practice of mindfulness, like we've just done in the meditation.
And we get instructions about how to be mindful on and off the cushion, which is extremely valuable and important.
But the question is, is that the core teaching of the Buddha?
What is the core teaching of the Buddha?
And I think that different teachers will give different answers, and probably I would give different answers at different times.
So, I don't think there's a right answer.
But today I would like to take a specific angle in answering this question, what the core teaching of the Buddha is.
And the angle I'd like to take comes from a verse in the Dhammapada.
And the Dhammapada is a collection of verses that are attributed to the Buddha.
And in this specific verse, the Buddha says,
Doing no evil, undertaking the good, purifying one's mind, that is the teaching of the Buddha's.
And a very busy statement that we might be able to argue that it summarizes the Buddha's teachings.
But there's a lot to unpack. There's only four short lines, but a lot to unpack.
And I would like to start with the last line, which is this is the teaching of the Buddhas.
And so these first three lines, doing no evil, undertaking the good, and purifying one's mind, is what the Dhammapada or the Buddha states to be the teaching of the Buddhas.
Maybe you've noticed that it says Buddhas and not Buddha.
And we obviously know only one Buddha at the moment.
But in early Buddhist cosmology, it is said that every once in a while, a Buddha will appear in the world to help all of us awaken.
And each Buddha will teach, and his teachings will be available for some millennia after passing away.
And it's actually, according to the Buddhist scriptures, very rare to live in a time where the teachings of the Buddhas, or one of the Buddhas, is available.
Because the Buddha doesn't really appear that often.
Like only once in a so many eons or something like that.
Not 100% sure exactly.
But each of those Buddhas will teach roughly the same thing.
And that includes things like for normal truths and dependent arising, if you're aware of those things, those concepts in Buddhism.
So that's where the phrase, this is the teaching of the Buddhas comes from multiple Buddhas.
Each teach the same thing, each of them.
And so each of these teachings of the Buddhas is about doing no evil, undertaking the good and purifying one's mind.
So let's unpack the first two lines, doing no evil and undertaking the good.
I see those lines as basically pointing us towards leading a wholesome and skillful life.
Where we try to be not unskillful and unwholesome, and we try to cultivate what is wholesome and skillful.
So what do those words skillful, unskillful wholesome, unwholesome actually mean?
Well, they're translated from the Pali words kusala and akusala.
And Pali is the language in which the oldest scriptures of the Buddha were written down in.
So kusala is often translated in English as wholesome or skillful, and akusala is often translated as unwholesome or unskillful.
Sony A in akusala is like the UN unwholesome in English.
So some contexts we might prefer wholesome or unwholesome, and in some contexts skillful, unskillful depends a little bit.
And today I'll mostly just use wholesome, unwholesome as a translation.
And I will also sometimes use the Pali words so you can get used to them and get the translation also when I use them.
When we do know evil and we undertake the good, then we are basically cultivating wholesomeness kusala.
And what makes something kusala or akusala wholesome or unwholesome?
Well, this is closely related to the notion of karma.
Karma is Sanskrit and karma is Pali.
Karma is a more well-known word, of course.
So karma or karma literally means action.
But we often actually don't mean just action, we mean the results of our action when we talk about karma.
So whether our thoughts, word or actions are wholesome or unwholesome depends on if our intention was wholesome or unwholesome.
And I often use an example that you're walking on a forest path and you're stepping on a leaf.
But under the leaf is an ant, so you couldn't really know that there was an ant and you killed the ant by stepping on the leaf.
So there was no intention whatsoever to do any harm.
And maybe if you had known that the ant was there, you might have tried to afford stepping on the leaf.
And that is completely different from walking down that forest path, seeing an ant, being annoyed by the ant and purposefully stepping on it, killing it.
That would be an intentional act of harming or unwholesomeness.
And the other day I was walking down a somewhat quiet street and there was a car who stopped like in the middle of the road.
And this woman came out of the car and at first I wasn't sure why she had stopped and was coming out of her car.
But soon I saw that there was a little turtle trying to cross the road in this little turtle pace, of course.
So the woman had stopped out of care for this turtle so that she wouldn't run over it and cars that would maybe come behind her wouldn't run over it.
So she brought the turtle to the other side of the road into safety.
And as far as I can tell, this woman acted from the intention of care.
And that would of course be wholesome intention.
And therefore the action is wholesome.
You can maybe imagine that if you're annoyed that the turtle is walking across the street and you have to stop.
Then the intention might be unwholesome because you're doing it from this annoyance.
So kusala akusala wholesome unwholesome have to do with this intention.
And it's just important to stress that we shouldn't, that it's important that we should take responsibility for our actions that were harmful, even though we had a wholesome intention.
Because there's an in difference between impact and intention.
So even if our intention is wholesome and we really want to care and do good, our impact can still be one of harm.
Like when we're stepping on that leaf, well the ant is there.
So, when we notice that we've done harm, it can be really wholesome to then start to take responsibility for this action that we did that has caused harm.
It could be like we said something to a friend that we thought was a caring statement, but then they got hurt by our statement.
So we can then apologize and make up to our friend, even if our intention was one of care.
Or a small example that often or sometimes happens to me is that I try to help an insect to go outside with a glass and a piece of paper.
And then by sliding the glass over the piece of paper, I accidentally hurt the insect.
So my intention was to help the insect to go outside because it was like banging against the window and going to die, you know, so want to help it to go back to its natural habitat.
But it ends up being harmed.
So if things like that happen, this is a very small example, of course, but things like that happen, we can be maybe careful next time in catching the insects, prevent it from happening if we can.
So, how can we, how can we recognize if our minds are wholesome or unwholesome, or the mind status is wholesome or unwholesome.
Well, I can give a few examples, so we can start recognizing it, and some of Kusala wholesome would be things like wisdom, joy, love, compassion, calmness, patience, interest, lightness.
And then Akusala states of mind could be aversion, greed, hate, anger, ill will, sense desire, cruelty, fear.
These are just some examples to give you a taste.
And as you can tell the Kusala wholesome mind states generally feel really good and pleasant, and the Akusala ones generally feel really unpleasant, we usually want to not have them.
It doesn't always exactly map out like that, but it can be a pointer towards if a mind state is wholesome or unwholesome.
And sometimes what doesn't map out is, for example, desire, because we often like desire, we want, the wanting seems to feel good to us.
But when we start to pay really close attention to wanting to desire, we can start to see that desire itself is actually not so pleasant.
The pleasantness is when the desire falls away and we get what we want it.
Then for a few moments, or maybe even longer, we do feel good.
And that's sometimes really hard to see this mechanism, that it's more the falling away of the desire that feels good.
But this general thought of wholesomeness feeling good and unwholesomeness feeling that's a good can help us to build our compass towards orienting towards the Kusala, the wholesomeness.
And we can be aware of our mind states, and in that way also start to learn to differentiate between is it wholesome or unwholesome.
It's usually also has to do with care and not harming, harming versus non-harming.
And when a mind state is present and we recognize there's wholesomeness present, then we can basically assume, or usually we will act from that wholesomeness when we do something.
And then we are undertaking the good as it says in the Dhammapada verse.
And when an unwholesome mind is present, then we will act from that, then we are doing evil as it says in the Dhammapada.
Doing evil we can make it a little broader and doing unwholesome, I would say.
So, of course, this whole thing that I'm talking about doesn't only apply when we meditate, but also during our daily activities and daily lives.
And we could pay attention to, yeah, especially in daily life, I think it's useful to pay attention to wholesome and unwholesome.
Like a simple daily life example could be that we feel really tired after a long day at work and then we get home.
But before we are able to get from our car to the front door, a neighbor starts talking to us and we are just so tired that we just feel irritated and we really don't want to talk to this neighbor.
And then we start to fake some kindness towards the neighbor.
Well, underneath there's this irritation. And in this case, on the outside it might look like we act out of kindness, but on the inside we act from a place of irritation.
So from a place of Akusala, unwholesomeness.
And this is something that we can only detect for ourselves because on the outside something might look different than from the inside.
It's just that I sat with the woman with the turtle, like, to me it looked like she acted from care, but I'm not 100% sure of course I can't now.
So if we, if Akusala mind states are present, we can ensure from that that probably if we're going to act, it will be also Akusala actions.
So our karma will be unwholesome.
If Akusala mind states are present, we can infer that our actions will be wholesome and our wholesome karma will follow.
And that way we can, we can try to work towards doing no evil and to undertake the good, maybe not act when we feel unwholesome, if possible, it's not always possible.
Of course, sometimes we just have to act, even if we don't feel like it.
If we don't feel wholesome.
But it's like everything on this path, it's a practice.
We can practice more wholesomeness, we can practice not acting out of wholesomeness, maybe wait with sending that email and we're irritated until we feel a little better.
Some things we can control.
But if we're like in an argument with our past or something, then yeah, we probably are going to say things that are maybe less wholesome.
And yeah, there's many, many opportunities in our daily lives to practice this.
Interactions with others are really good ones.
When we're at work, when we're with family or a partner.
And when we are exercising, sometimes when I'm exercising, I really don't feel like it.
I feel like I really want to stop.
So I feel aversion and I can be aware of your version.
And just when we're brushing our teeth or going for a walk, whatever it is, they can be aware like what kind of, yeah, tune is there in the mind.
There's joy or happiness or contentment or ease, or maybe aversion or irritation or fear.
Yeah, sometimes it's just neutral.
That's also fine.
Of course, sometimes not really clearly one way or the other.
And when we do manage, when we do notice that my mind states the unwholesome ones are present.
Then it's really important not to give ourselves a hard time because that's kind of, you know, the thing that that a lot of people do we kind of make it hard for ourselves.
And it's our human nature to experience both where probably novice are fully enlightened. So we're going to experience both.
And what we can do is just be aware of it to notice this.
Yeah, the unwholesomeness and it goes off course as well. But we can notice what is happening. We can be aware of it. And we can be aware of the judgments about it as well.
So what if you try it right now? What are you aware of right now when you're listening to me?
Maybe something in the body, the mind sounds of my voice thoughts.
You can, you can just ask yourself, but it's most obvious right now.
You can see maybe is the tone of our minds slightly wholesome or very wholesome, slightly unwholesome, very unwholesome, or kind of neutral.
And that's as simple as this, just checking in for a brief moment.
What is happening now? What is the tone of the mind?
Just a simple reminder.
Be in the present moment.
You can do that throughout the talk whenever you think about it and throughout the rest of the day, of course.
And being mindful in our daily lives, being aware of what is happening, can actually tie into this third line of the Dhammapada verse, which is to purify our mind.
Purifying our mind means that we start to cultivate, to cultivate more and more wholesomeness and abandon more and more unwholesomeness.
And the aggregation of mind can be done through our Buddhist practice.
And mindfulness practice is one of those obvious ones to point out when it comes to Buddhist practice.
And the beauty of this is that we can be mindful of every moment in our way, in our, in our lives, in our waking lives. Also, during our daily lives.
The other, sorry, the audition, yes, is just be aware of everything that happens between the moment you wake up and the moment you go to bed.
Well, in practice, we can't really be aware of everything, but that's the encouragement.
Yeah, and so an encouragement to not only be aware of the wholesome unwholesome, but just everything that is happening, whatever is most obvious.
And if we want to practice with wholesome unwholesome, then we can drop in the question like, oh, what is the tone of the mind right now? Is it wholesome or unwholesome?
Sometimes being aware of what's pleasant, if it's pleasant or unpleasant can be very helpful to see what the tone is, to see if it's wholesome or unwholesome.
Sometimes being aware of what mind state is present can be helpful.
If we notice that there's kindness and compassion or warmth or peace present, and yeah, those are very wholesome qualities of mind and heart.
And if we notice that aversion or cruelty or promptiness is present, then we know that's not so wholesome.
We don't have to know everything at the same time, and we don't have to check in for that all the time. It's more like whenever you feel curious about it, whenever you feel like, oh, this might be nice to pay attention to now.
And when we do pay attention to whatever is most obvious throughout the day, whenever we can remember to do so, whenever we feel like it, then what happens is that we start to learn from that
and we start to gather wisdom. We gather data, which leads to wisdom.
And whenever we are aware of mind states, of what's happening in the body, or both, it doesn't really matter.
Sayada Otechnia says that every time that there's a moment of mindfulness, that the mind is collecting information, the mind is collecting data.
And in that moment that we are collecting data, we might not really like see clearly what it's helping us, or what the wisdom is in that.
We can assume that in the background, wisdom, the wisdom aspect of our minds learns from all this data that's being collected, especially if we have that intention to learn from whatever is happening to us.
Whether it's just, you know, a boring sound of a fridge going on, you know, or whether it's something exciting like bliss in our meditation, whatever it is,
it helps us towards insights, insights into the nature of reality.
And what is very useful in that is, is that we start to also gain insight into patterns and conditionings that are playing out in our lives, that might not be so helpful for us.
Seeing those patterns and conditionings is, yeah, the first step to work with them.
And often they need to see them over and over and over again.
You know, if we see over and over and over again our annoyance at our partner not cleaning the kitchen counter.
At some point, our minds might start to realize that this annoyance doesn't feel so good. Actually, it's suffering.
It's actually not great. Maybe, maybe it costs less energy to just clean the counter myself instead of being annoyed about it all the time.
So very simple example again, of course.
It's good to know that often these kind of patterns we need to see over and over and over again before we start experiencing a choice before we start to see like, hmm, this is this might be not so helpful way of dealing with this.
So this is a plug for not being discouraged, but just keep going on with the mindfulness practice.
Mindfulness is only one of the ways that we can practice the Buddha's teachings to purify our minds, which is the last instruction in the verse.
And there are, of course, many ways that I won't go into all of them, but I'll just briefly name a couple others.
And one of them is practicing virtue.
It's actually part of a trio, Dana, Sila and Ravana. Ravana is the meditation and Dana and Sila are generosity and virtue.
So the virtue part is about the five precepts, the five training advices, and these trainings we can undertake to purify our minds and our actions as well.
And we can have the intention to live by these five precepts.
If we feel inclined so, of course, there's no must.
The Buddha is not, it's not like 10 commandments, it's more like an advice, something we can train with if we feel inclined to do it.
The five are to not intentionally kill any living beings. The first one, the second one is not to not take what is not given.
So no stealing. Third one is to not harm with our sexuality.
The fourth one is not to lie. And then the last one is to not take any substances that clouds the mind, like for example, alcohol or drugs.
So that we have always have a clear mind for meditation, but also we all know if there is abuse of substances that usually not that great for the people around us.
So these trainings can function as guidelines for living a wholesome life.
And then the dana part is the generosity part of the three, but dana, sila, balfana.
And also with generosity, they can purify our minds.
The Buddha points out that practicing generosity counteracts greed and promotes an attitude of letting go.
And sometimes we might be able to feel this internal contraction that greediness brings.
I remember when I was still pretty young and I didn't have much money. I was living on a very, very tight budget.
And strawberries were really expensive, but also really delicious.
So I bought these things strawberries for myself that I was slowly eating over a course of a few days.
And a friend came to visit me, a very, very good friend, so he was just opening the fridge and saw these strawberries.
I was like, oh, can I have strawberries? And I felt the contraction of the greediness of keeping those strawberries for myself because they were so expensive that I couldn't just buy a new box of strawberries next week.
So that's where we can feel the edge of where our generosity is.
We can feel that contraction if we're greedy.
So we can also actively practice that generosity.
Like, in my case, I could have actively thought like, okay, I am practicing generosity, so let's just, even though I feel this contraction, let's just give this friend the strawberry and see what that feels like if I do it.
So the nice thing is that generosity doesn't have to do anything with money. Generosity can be a smile towards the cashier, or supporting a struggling friend, or helping someone carry their groceries to the car, or feeding the cat for a neighbor's cat when they're on the vacation.
So it can have many phases. It can also be money, of course, you can give to good causes, which is also a very generous and beautiful thing to do.
So why would we go to the trouble of doing no evil and undertaking the good, including the virtue and the generosity, and to purify our minds?
And the simple answer is that the Buddha points out that when we think, speak, and act from kusala, from wholesome intentions, then more goodness will come our way.
Well, if we think, speak, and act from akusala, or unwholesome intentions, then more suffering will come our way.
So we can shape our own future by doing good, and by acting from wholesomeness, rather than from wholesomeness.
We also recognize that it just feels so good to do good, feels so good to have wholesome mind states, and it feels good to care about ourselves and others.
And there's one verse, another verse in the Dhammapada, which is about this. It says, if one speaks or acts from a corrupted mind, suffering follows as the cartwheel follows the ox's foot.
If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness follows as an ever-present shadow.
We have these similes that the Buddha gives, or the cartwheel, like it's inevitable that, you know, we are the ox in this example, and the cartwheel will just follow us.
If we keep on walking, it's inevitable.
And also the shadow, and the shadow usually kind of associated with something more negative, but in this case, you know, it's nice to realize that happiness will follow us like our own shadow.
And we also can't escape our own shadow, so we will just inevitably be happy if we do good.
So cultivating the good is a sure road to less suffering, and also to the potential of being free from suffering, potential of awakening.
It's a little step we take in every little moment of mindfulness, every little moment of care for ourselves or others.
Every moment we are generous, we are cultivating the good, and we are contributing to the wholesomeness in our own lives and in the world.
In each moment, we can make the choice to do something good, and we don't have to worry too much about the previous moment.
Let's just worry only about this moment where we have a choice.
And that's what I wanted to talk about today.
And there's still some time left for questions or shareings, things you'd like to share with all of us.
Or things you'd like to ask.
You can also put it in the chat if that feels more comfortable.
Feel free to unmute yourselves and ask something or share something.
Yeah, Fred.
Your thoughts that you shared this morning remind me of a story that I heard recently. It's about someone who observed a woman pulling into a parking place and then going into the store and leaving her children in the car.
And the person's first reaction was, well, I'm going to call the police because she shouldn't be doing that.
But then she thought that maybe the best thing to do would be for her just to stand there until the woman came back and make sure that the children were okay.
And that demonstrates what you were just talking about.
You know, we have choices about how we are going to respond to situations.
Yeah, that's really beautiful. It sounds like she exits from the good in her heart.
Thanks for sharing that.
Thank you so much for this talk really resonated and was very pragmatic and uplifting. Thank you.
To follow up on Fred's thing, of course, I would also have this incredible contraction, a crucible of, you know, needing to tell this woman when she came back, how dangerous this was then of course that would be immediately followed by fear that she would throw
something at me, you know, so that I might, I mean, I'm finding just that I guess the word is the data knows of responding to what is going on all over is pretty complicated.
And I'm so glad that I mean I've heard teachers address this and work with it. Just my difficulty of seeing what people are doing that is making things worse.
And that's the example of leaving her kids in the car. It's just that kind of thing which has always been present in the world. So this is not that unique.
So thank you so much. I will be much more mindful of what's going on today. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing. And one thing that you said reminds me of you said the complexity of the Vedana of the feeling tone pleasant and neutral.
And that reminds me of that, but often also happens it's good to point out is that it is complex, and it's not like oh it's not always super clear like is it fully wholesome is fully unwholesome is maybe it's just a mixed bag.
Sometimes there are multiple intentions going on. Some might be wholesome some might be unwholesome. It's also good to keep in mind, our lives are usually a bit more complex than just all.
It's all wholesome it's all wholesome.
I'll just really quickly say that the word Pappancha, which I think is what happens when one gets caught in the different Vedas. I love that word because that's so describes, you know, the schmutz that goes on when one gets caught.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, Pappancha is often translated as proliferation, mental proliferation. And so it's like all these thoughts and stuff that can go on and like we're just caught in it. It's like this entanglement of things happening inside.
Just kind of a follow on thought. We often, we so often, well, we, we don't know why, why, why other people do things.
And so, you know, it could be that this woman who left her children in the car. The children may have been sick and she was going in to get a prescription and didn't want to expose other people to what the children had.
And so there may have been a very good reason for her to do that, even though it appeared that she was doing something that was not, that was not wholesome.
And so, you know, again, my thought is, you know, how can, how can I be most helpful in this situation? And cause, cause the least amount of harm.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks. Thanks for sharing that. And then that also reminds me of that.
People often have wounds from childhood, other sources, why they, and that might be why they're acting in a way that is just not so skillful.
And like, especially in interactions with people, people get reactive, you know, usually it's because that wound has been touched.
And at least in how I experience it is realizing that can help to, to have compassion for this person, like, oh wait, there's just, you know, more going on than what meets the eye probably.
And it's also a way of, yeah, not getting reactive ourselves in a situation like that.
You just don't know what's going on, what you're saying, like, but it's going on with people, why they're doing things that they do like that.
And, you know, it could be something just rational wholesome reason behind it, it could be a wound, it could be all sorts of things.
You just don't know. And sometimes, though, pointing something out to someone, like maybe engaging with this woman like, oh, hey, maybe, you know, it's not such a good idea to leave your children in a way that's, you know, compassionate and caring.
It might help to this woman that might have been just oblivious to the fact that it's not a good idea to leave your children in the car might have helped her to see like, oh, maybe next time I shouldn't do that.
And so sometimes interacting about something that other people are doing unskillful could be really skillful, could be really wholesome.
It's all just a matter of, you know, the context and stuff.
That's something that I think is very important that I have learned about the Buddhist approach is that very seldom is there a right answer in a situation like that where where it involves in a moral dimension.
And the context is so important.
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.
And yeah, but we're up for ourselves. This is part of the context. Maybe we're not up for, you know, engaging with someone. And we just feel like we'll just leave it and yeah, that could also be perfectly fine.
