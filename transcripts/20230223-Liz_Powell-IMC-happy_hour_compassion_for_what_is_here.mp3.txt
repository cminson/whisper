 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Happy to see everyone this evening. Welcome to Happy Hour. And thank you, Neil, in advance for posting the forum that we have that you can use for information about the various talks. With various talks that are held and also to stay connected. So, delighted to be with all of you. And can you hear me okay? Yeah, okay, good. So, this evening, as we practice any of these four major heart cultivation practices we do during Happy Hour of Kindness, Compassion, Appreciation, which is sometimes called Sympathetic Joy, and Equanimity. These are called in the ancient Pali language the Brahma-Viharas, which Bhikkhu Bodhi translates as the sublime attitudes. Kind of a nice way of thinking of them. These practices are meant to extend to you, too, in the way that you hold the practices and what arises for you as you do them. So, not merely when you say them for yourself, but also as you practice with them. And there's a very important instruction that begins one of the suttas on this subject. So, here's Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation of the first paragraph of the Brahma-Viharas suta. Monks, I don't speak of the wiping out of intentional acts that have been done and accumulated without having been experienced either in the here and now or in a future state hereafter. Nor do I speak of the act of putting an end to suffering and stress without having experienced the results of intentional acts that have been done and accumulated. So, before going on to describe the practices in the suta, the speaker whom I take to be the Buddha is specifically saying that we're not trying to ignore our experience of the results of prior actions that have occurred, our own actions and the actions of other people. And the impact or the consequences those have. And I think this is instructive for us as we offer kind, compassionate, appreciative or equanimous wishes to the typical sequence of people for whom these wishes are usually offered. So, in the classical practice, they're often first sent to a benefactor or a person who's been really beneficial to you, next to a friend, then to a stranger that you see often in your life but you don't really know, then often to a difficult person, sometimes called an enemy. And depending on the teacher, sometimes it begins with yourself or yourself, you offer them to yourself as well, and then all beings. So, many of us find that offering good wishes to one or more of these people is challenging. Especially when we first start the practice, but even, you know, sometimes as we are into it for many years, it brings up prior experiences and how they've affected us. And a really common response to having been on the receiving end of actions that had unpleasant consequences, even if they're things we blame on ourselves, is to not feel particularly kind, compassionate, appreciative or equanimous. Perhaps even to feel still upset, anywhere from a little bit or maybe quite a bit, depending. So, you could feel resentful or maybe not very generous towards someone whose actions had negative consequences. Often easier to know with the difficult person, but even with friends, even with mentors, sometimes there's been an incident or two. So, you're not being asked during happy hour to ignore those feelings or try to wallpaper over them. Instead, you're being invited to turn the attention towards how your heart might grow by first acknowledging the difficulty, and then by offering kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity, even in the face of suffering. So, there are many ways to hold this in your practice. For one, we're not letting our own heart shrivel because of the unkind actions by others or even our own prior unskillful actions. Another way is that we can feel and know unwholesome consequences and because of them, become determined to cultivate what is more wholesome and what's healthier for us in the long run. So, these sublime attitudes are skillful ways of living, ways of refusing to let darkness cast a shadow on your heart mind. There are also ways to learn from the past and not repeat it. So, with that, with those thoughts, this evening I'll guide a meditation that allows for noticing any discomfort or unpleasant consequences to first be known. If we bring up a particular person, you get to first notice not only their beautiful qualities and positive things, images, but also if there is any bubbling up of any discomfort or even a feeling, well, I never had a mentor. I don't have friends or my best friend is my cat. Whatever that is, this can really affect people and to allow that to enter your heart and be seen and turn towards the offering compassion to the effects on your heart mind body and then turning the wishes outward. So, that's the idea. So, with that, we'll start with the guided meditation. And just beginning by taking in the state of heart mind body right now as you settle into the meditation. Any, you know, body sensations, feelings, thoughts that were brought up by my comments or that are following you into this meditation. Just acknowledging how prior conditions are being felt in this moment. Just allowing them, knowing what's happening. Sensing into it. Allowing space for how you are right in this moment. It might be very ready to offer compassion and kindness, or it might feel cautious. It might even feel a little bit constricted. Having a compassionate wish towards anything unpleasant or a little challenging that is present right now. May you be free of stress. And in sending that wish may be free of suffering or stress. Perhaps it's possible to feel a little ease enter, or you might appreciate things that are present that are pleasant or positive as well. And if there's tightness that wants to be recognized, and you can just leave it as it is and notice it. Be aware of it. Any positive or wholesome qualities of heart, mind that you're experiencing, sending the wish, may this happiness continue. Noticing what arises for you. When I say, bring any thoughts or mental images you might have of someone who's been a benefactor, who's been kind to you, who's been mostly beneficial or very beneficial. Could be a mentor, could be an elderly relative, could be a child, any being who's brought benefit to you. Noticing what arises as I pose that. What comes up may be an immediate connection to someone or a person may come to mind but the feelings of how they've been beneficial might not feel that strong. Or you might find yourself having to work at thinking of anyone who fits this role or feel like there isn't someone feeling sad or frustrated. There hasn't been anyone like that for me. Could be anything, just noticing and allowing whatever comes up to be seen. And if you're sending a compassionate wish, may this heart heal from the past. May this, if what's arising is really a wholesome quality of heart towards a person or people, sending an appreciative quality. May this kindness multiply in the world. May you be feeling, noticed your own response to the idea of a benefactor. May your kind wishes to that being or to yourself about the feelings that came up, may you be healthy. May you be happy. May you be safe. May you be at ease. May you be saying the phrases whether they're heartfelt and deep or they're just words at this point. Words with a positive inclination of mind. Either way is fine. Whatever your heart is prepared to do, not some should or idea from outside but from inside what feels right. And gradually with some care, allowing the image or the thought associated with this benefactor idea, allowing those to fade away, taking a few breaths. While allowing yourself to feel what is present in the body, heart and mind right now. Noticing whatever's most prominent. And next, allowing yourself to see what arises as I say, bringing to mind a friend to whom you'd like to send kind wishes. Allowing whatever arises, images, thoughts, feelings about a particular being, including any reactions that come up. There's no need to resist anything. Allowing some ease, receiving and recognizing what's coming into awareness, acknowledging it. There might be some kindness. And sending that wish of kindness. If there's any conflict or regrets or longing, any other kinds of feelings that arise on their own, allowing that. And perhaps sending a compassionate wish. May this heart be well and free from harm. May it be very positive feelings, kind feelings. May your heart continue bringing happiness. And sending any other kind wishes that you'd like to send to the person or people who came to mind as friends, to yourself. Just an intention of inclining the mind in a wholesome and healing direction. Without any need to rewrite the past or pretend things are different than they actually are. Perhaps inclining the mind towards wishes of health, safety, happiness and ease. And taking some breath. And taking some breaths, allowing the mind to take in what's most prominent right now. And noticing what arises when I say bringing a stranger to mind, someone you see frequently but you don't really know. Aware of whatever is most prominent. Whatever flows in and out of attention. As you contemplate sending kind wishes to that stranger, how is your heart around that? How is your mind? Perhaps extending a kind wish, may this mind and heart have the capacity for kindness to a stranger. May this heart and mind heal without denying any feelings and experiences that are present. And sending kind wishes to the stranger who comes to mind or to the feelings that arise, may you be well. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be at ease. May you be at ease. And taking a few breaths and allowing yourself to become aware of whatever is present in this moment. Outtakes. Noticing what arises when I say bringing to mind a difficult person to whom you'd like to send kind wishes. Simply being aware of what arises in the heart-mind body. Whether you notice a person who fits that description or a group of people or it's hard to think of anyone who's difficult. Maybe there is no one. Simply noticing and perhaps sending a compassionate wish to the heart that has difficulty. May any suffering come to an end. May our hearts know peace. If it feels possible sending some kind wishes to the difficult person or to the difficult heart to yourself, may you be well. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be at ease. Noticing what's present, what's most prominent right now. Gently turning the mind towards noticing what arises as I say bringing yourself to mind. Finding images and thoughts to arise of times that you've done kind things or said or thought compassionate things. Times you've been helpful. Giving, recognizing and allowing whatever response comes up in you to those words. Noticing if there are some positive feelings there, some appreciation. Noticing any self-criticism without fueling it. Perhaps sending the kind wish. May self-criticism come to an end. May any stress come to an end. If you've noticed some wholesome appreciation for things that you've done, that you felt good about, may this kindness continue. Sending yourself if possible some additional kind wishes for your well-being, your safety, your happiness, for ease, compassionate wishes. May any suffering that is arising, may that come to an end. Bringing yourself a couple of minutes to appreciate what you've experienced and bring whatever relaxation, ease or settling to the mind and heart. May we all be well and free of suffering. It's very worthwhile and important to begin any kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy or equanimity practice with some respect for your experience. And we all live and learn from challenging experiences. So with that, we'll have 10 minutes for our breakout groups. So in small groups of three people, we'll have a chance to discuss what came up for you and just sharing the time, maybe putting one idea into the circle at a time and then giving the next person their turn and sharing it without commentary about each other, sharing it without opinions or advice, just listening wholeheartedly to one another. So I'll send you off and bring you back in about 10 minutes. Thank you. You you you you you you
