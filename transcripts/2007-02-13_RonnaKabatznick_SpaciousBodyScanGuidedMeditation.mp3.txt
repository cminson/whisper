So you can comfortably either lie on the floor or you can sit up.
Both positions could be done with dignity.
With your hands by your side if you're lying down or your hands on your lap or your sides.
And if I recommend if you have your legs crossed to uncross them.
And again just breathing through the heart center as a way of establishing your awareness.
If you're feeling tired, it's helpful to prop up your head on a pillow or to open your eyes.
Or just to sit up. You're less likely to fall asleep.
Okay. Just taking that spirit of bringing the feeling in your heart and taking a few long deep breaths.
Using the in breath to connect to the body from the inside.
And as you exhale just relax your body. Relax your belly and allow it to just take up some space.
Let go of any contraction.
And just feel your whole body as if you're feeling it for the first time.
How does your body experience itself?
See if you can notice how the impact of breathing affects your body.
The simple sensation of breathing.
For this special time of doing the body scan just let go of your thoughts and concerns.
Put them aside in favor of feeling and sensing your body.
Remind yourself of the intention of this practice.
Its aim is not to feel anything different. Its aim is not to feel relaxed or calm.
These responses may or may not happen.
Instead the intention of the body scan is to bring awareness to any sensations that you are aware of.
And I'm going to guide you through each part of the body in the most really casual matter of fact way.
You can invite yourself to feel the sensations and the warmth and the tingling and the pressure.
Or absolutely nothing at all.
There's no need to judge or evaluate your experience.
What a relief.
Is bring your attention to the crown of your head and to your scalp.
Whatever the sensations are just hold your attention to the body.
Then slowly let your attention glide down to the top of your head into the face.
The cheeks, muscles, forehead, eyes, nose.
Lip to lip.
Your mouth.
Feel what the parts of the face feel like from the inside.
Your ears front and back. The sides of your head.
And allow your attention to keep sliding and gliding and flowing into your neck.
Your shoulders front and back offering your gentle attention.
Presence with a spirit and a mindset of investigation of discovery.
We take the spirit of investigation and discovery.
This refined attention down our arms, elbows, wrists and hands.
Take in the sensory experience of your hands.
What are the sensations? Warm, cold, tingling, heavy, light.
Bring your attention into your torso, chest, heart space, rib cage, spine.
The spine that holds you up. The spine that's against the floor.
Bring your attention up and down that spine.
Let your attention glide to the variety of sensations in the torso.
Again, feel it from the inside. See if you can have equanimity.
Equanimity is balance without judgment. Just feeling the sensation simply, directly.
Whether they are pleasant or unpleasant.
Feel these sensations down into your belly and lower abdomen.
Allow the sensations to cover your hips, pelvis area.
Then let your attention flow into your legs. Feel the legs and knees, ankles, feet.
The mind will inevitably wander. That's what minds do.
It will wander away from the breath and the body from time to time.
This is entirely normal. It's predictable. It's what minds do.
When you notice it, you can gently acknowledge it. Notice where the mind has wandered to.
And gently return your attention to the part of the body you intended to focus on.
You don't need to grab your attention back. Just gently let it glide or slide.
Feel your whole body as best as you can. Take two or three deep breaths.
Feeling as much as your body as you can.
Allowing the breath to cycle through your whole body. The in-breath and the out-breath.
Then allow your breath to return to normal. Letting your breath be as comfortable as possible.
Be with your breath as part of your body.
Let go of thoughts in favor of being with the breath, the body as it breathes.
Let your attention settle in. Letting go of thoughts, worries, obsessions.
Allow your attention to dip into your body as if you're going into a pool of warm, inviting water.
Soothing you, soothing the body, soothing the mind.
Being with your breath and the body.
Be mindful of this experience and what may have changed in this meditation.
Notice a difference in how settled at home you are in your body compared to when you started.
How comfortable are you in your body?
How familiar are you with it?
So to end this body scan, take a couple of slow deep breaths from the heart center where we began.
Feeling that heart space once again in a very intimate way.
The heart is your anchor.
And when you are ready, please open your eyes, come back to sitting position,
gently bring your attention to the space in the room and to those around us.
