The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Yeah, it's good to practice with you.
So William James said, nothing includes everything or dominates over everything.
The word and trails along after every sentence. Sometimes when Gill and I have taught a retreat,
we've done the three characteristics, Zuka, Nietzsche, Anata, and they're supporting opposite,
or apparent opposite. So we open to suffering, but that is paired with consolidation of well-being.
Again, we open to Nietzsche, impermanence, uncertainty, but that's paired with a teaching on stability.
We open to the teachings on selflessness, and that's paired with self-confidence.
And there's a certain kind of importance in pairing teachings.
And so this week, likewise, some pairs that seem important to me, that seem maybe in conflict with each other,
but actually support each other.
So today, the pair, helplessness and power.
So helplessness is a kind of defining characteristic of any animal's life.
And among the most harrowing experiences a human can have, and sometimes I feel like maybe Duke's suffering and helplessness are synonyms.
We are, in the end, small creatures amidst unimaginably vast forces.
And humans, we need a very, very specific environment of temperature and pressure, mixture of gases,
and just a kind of staggering number of things need to go right in our body just to be alive.
And so just to have this breath is done, is a kind of generosity.
And helplessness, the experience, a moment of helplessness is, it's very frightening, it's the kind of most extreme form of vulnerability.
And we scramble to exert our power to keep control, to exercise will.
And helplessness will take almost anything over a moment of helplessness.
People cry, you know, for many reasons, but one of the main reasons I've learned that people cry is a sense of helplessness.
And perhaps our tears are a kind of plea, I need you, I need you.
And the movements of our mind are so much of our cognitive and emotional life is really organized against helplessness.
Organized around the sense that we can always do something, it feels like we can always do something, it feels like something might always be fixed, you know?
Like that is the essence of samsara, this realm, like that something might be fixed, something else might be governed, some facet of our experience, of our life might be governed.
And that sense of what could be, what might have been, what will be, all those possibilities are so deeply compelling to us, and so we can tinker, tinker with the moment from cradle to grave.
And sometimes in order to soften the blow of an itch, of uncertainty, unreliability, we blame ourselves, because blaming ourselves creates the illusion of controllability.
Well, if I just didn't mess up, yeah. And in fact, I think a lot of self-hatred is really our attempt to conceal the truth of uncontrollability from ourselves.
We're helpless in moments to silence our minds, to protect ourselves from pain, to back our ways out of some karmic corners, like we get backed into a kind of karmic corner, and our bed is made, we're going to suffer.
We're helpless or nearly helpless in the face of so much greed, hatred, delusion that seems to animate the world, our species, there's a measure of helplessness in this.
And so it is actually strange alien to hear the Dharma teacher say, surrender, that this is a path of letting go, to actually open to the moment, we can kind of feel like we're doing it, but we're subtly trying to master the human condition,
to really open, not to try to master the moment, not to try to get the upper hand on helplessness, that is profound.
And so we open, we open to helplessness, we let it soften our heart, we let it teach us, everything is teaching us, as is said, and our life, our families, our world, all of that becomes so poignant in light of helplessness.
And when change comes, we're a little bit less startled, when death comes, we're a little bit less startled.
Before we've come to appreciate helplessness, we kind of try to exert our power over all things, over ourselves, over others.
But as we open to helplessness, we stop fighting the First Noble Truth, and then we pick our fights wisely, we pick our fights wisely.
There, from this understanding, we find our power. Studying helplessness illuminates our power.
We're no longer trying to govern all of this realm. Studying helplessness illuminates our power. We actually know what we want, what we actually want.
We're not so lost in the kind of fever dream of egoic clinging, craving. We know what we want.
And we're empowered, we're empowered because through our encounter with the human condition, through our encounter with helplessness, we actually understand more deeply how things work.
And that allows us to exert our force wisely, efficiently.
This is Kittisaro. As our practice of the path deepens, we will naturally grow in personal power. Cultivating Sila Samadhi Panya, plugging into the measureless merit of the triple gem, we potentize our actions for good or for ill.
It's vital to be interested and sensitive to our impact on the world and those around us. Being a teacher or a dedicated Buddhist practitioner, we are waving the banner of the awakened one, representing that extraordinary heritage, partaking of that trustworthy power and prestige.
When one has power, one's wholesome actions are amplified, but so are the unwholesome ones. Everything we do has more impact.
We open to helplessness, we open to it. And through this, we find the places where we can exert power. We come to understand the human condition more deeply, we come to understand others more deeply, we come to understand what we want more deeply.
And this is empowering. This is empowering. We exert our power in wholesome ways, exercise, influence in ways that matter.
And it comes out of this willingness to befriend this most radical of experiences, helplessness.
So I offer this for your consideration. And as always, please pick up what is useful and leave behind everything else.
So thank you for being here. I'm glad we settled into this first day. I'll check the chat over there and we'll keep going tomorrow. So I wish you all a good day. Thank you, Phil, for being a DJing in the background to be continued.
