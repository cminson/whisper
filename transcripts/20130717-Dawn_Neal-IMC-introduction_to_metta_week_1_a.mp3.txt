A really important part of overall Buddhist practice, especially in the Insight Meditation tradition, it involves cultivating an intention. 
And that intention is for goodwill, friendliness, kindness, the kind of open-hearted, receptive love. 
Unlike mindfulness meditation, which many of you have experience in, mindfulness meditation is quite receptive. 
It's acknowledging what is as it arises. 
Loving kindness or metta practice involves intentionally noticing and cultivating tendencies that are already in our minds, using thoughts, visualizations, phrases sometimes, as well as the mindful awareness that happens in mindfulness meditation. 
So loving kindness is a translation of the Pali word metta in Sanskrit that's matri or mitri. 
And alternate translations include benevolence, goodwill, friendliness. 
But love and kindness is sort of a nice translation, at least to my mind. 
And part of the reason why is that it really points to love as an intentional action that we can do and kindness as a choice that we can make. 
So you put together the notion of intentionally creating an action, even if it's just a thought, with the choice or the attitude of kindness. 
And that gives you a really good idea of what this meditation process is about. 
So we're going to be going for six weeks. 
And please come on in. 
There's some seats in the front. 
And over the next six weeks, I'm going to provide an overview of loving kindness as it's classically taught in Buddhism. 
And that includes sort of a receptive, nonverbal form of loving kindness as well as traditional categories of people that we're going to go through. 
The emphasis is going to be on how you can combine it with mindfulness practice and how you might take it into your daily lives. 
And as part of that, I'm going to be including some pre-practices that might be a little bit less commonly taught in insight meditation. 
So those are, we'll get to them later, but they can include things like forgiveness practice, noticing virtues of people or the positive qualities of things, that kind of thing. 
We'll also be including a little bit about the recent science on loving kindness meditation. 
When I'm not at IMC, one of the things I do is I teach loving kindness at UCSF and other clinical environments, a secular version of it that is not drawn on Buddhism quite so much, but is intended for anyone of any faith or no faith. 
And to do that, I did a lot of research into the scientific benefits and the scientific purposes that loving kindness is being applied towards. 
So we'll just touch on that briefly in each class. 
If you have more questions about it, you're always welcome to ask me about it later. 
It's a passion. 
And each class will include some stories, some Q&A or discussion if you're willing to talk to me or each other, and I really hope you are. 
And a couple of shorter meditations. 
So it should be good for those of you who are here who are new to meditation, because we're not going to just sit for 45 minutes straight without talking. 
For the duration of the course, I just want to really encourage you to give over to the practices that we experiment with and explore here. 
Loving kindness only works if you do it, if you practice it. 
So if you already have a meditation practice, I would recommend that you switch over to these practices for the duration of time that we're in the course. 
And if you don't, just come along for the ride and give this a shot. 
Okay, great. 
So cultivating loving kindness, meta, is easier when we pay attention to how we hold or regard ourselves and really pay attention to the internal tone of voice that we use. 
And it's a lot easier to do that when we slow down and have a chance to kind of feel into or take a look about how we're treating ourselves. 
So in a sense, rather than just talk and talk at you for a while, I think it'd be nice if we just drop into a meditation together and I guide you on something and kind of show you a little bit about one way you might consider holding or regarding yourselves. 
And then we can go from there. 
So take a comfortable posture. 
Those of you who are still trying to get in the room, please feel free to come in. 
Folks can, you know, meditation is very much about being balanced between alertness and relaxation in our minds and bodies. 
In loving kindness, we have a little bit of a bias towards the relaxation and the comfort side. 
So unless you're sleepy, I really encourage you in these classes to take a really comfortable posture. 
Don't worry about, you know, if your knees hurt, in mindfulness meditation, sometimes you look at it. 
In meta meditation, move or sit in a posture where your knees don't hurt. 
Really let yourself be comfortable and relaxed. 
A lot of people do meta in a chair. 
If you have back issues, it's also okay to lie down. 
That's fine. 
So please start by closing your eyes and really tune into your posture for a minute. 
Find that balance between relaxation with just a touch of alertness. 
And see if you can set the intention for the next little while to let go of whatever it took to get you here. 
Just maybe take one or two or three deep, slow breaths into your belly. 
Exhale, slow and long. 
Let go. 
Let go of any worries or tensions. 
And let your thoughts just kind of fade to the background. 
And now let's take a moment to pay attention to our internal posture. 
One way of doing this is to imagine or even remember a place like the Hidden Villa Eco Farm or a petting zoo for children. 
There may be some very well-behaved, wide-eyed young children over there. 
And there may be they're being introduced to farm animals for the first time. 
They're allowed to hold a baby chick or a little furry animal in their hands. 
I've never done that before. 
You can probably see in the mind's eye how careful and gentle and alert they are, even reverent perhaps. 
They stroke the chick or the kitten or the animal. 
It's probably really, really gentle. 
One or two fingers only. 
Soothing, relaxing. 
See if you can hold an internal posture towards yourself with that same kind of respect, reverence and tenderness. 
See yourself with the kindness you might offer a sleeping baby animal or a little child. 
Allow your breath to be natural. 
Perhaps even allow the breath to gently stroke or soothe or soften any tense muscles. 
Any tightness in your belly or your chest. 
Any other anxious parts of yourself. 
If you can let your forehead and your face relax. 
Your scalp relax. 
Your jaw and your tongue, your neck. 
Letting the breath soften every area it moves through. 
Letting it soften your shoulders, chest, your back. 
Softening your arms, your hands, even in between your fingers. 
Let your hips relax. 
Releasing any tension in your groin or your thighs. 
Allow your calves and ankles to soften. 
Even soften your feet where they contact the floor. 
Letting all of your weight be supported by the cushion or chair. 
The floor by the vastness of the earth beneath us. 
See if it's possible to relax into feeling supported. 
Be safe here. 
Be safe here. 
Be safe here. 
Be safe here. 
If your mind wanders there's no need to judge. 
Just gently, kindly return your attention. 
Settle it. 
And now into the felt sensations of your breath. 
See if you can ride the waves of the in-breath and the out-breath. 
See if you can ride the waves of the in-breath and the out-breath. 
See if you can ride the waves of the out-breath. 
See if you can ride them. 
As you notice the breath, the sounds in the room, the aliveness of your body. 
See if you can check in again on your internal posture, how you hold or relate to yourself. 
See if you can scan, allow, discover. 
Somewhere in your heart, the wish or the intention that brought you here tonight. 
See if you can allow yourself to appreciate value that wish or intention. 
And perhaps in the quiet of this room, you can again discover some of the fundamental wishes we all share, every living being shares. 
Perhaps somewhere in you might discover the wish to be safe from inner and outer harm. 
It's really a special, beautiful thing to be safe in this world. 
And it's a beautiful thing to wish to be safe. 
And acknowledging that perhaps you might also see if in some corner of your mind or in some part of your being, you might notice the wish to be happy, to flourish. 
Sensing into appreciating that impulse, no matter how buried beneath layers of other concerns, everyone wishes to be happy. 
Connecting with the breath and the body. 
Connecting with the breath and the body. 
Appreciating the life's breath that sustains each one of us. 
Perhaps there's a way you can find to connect that to the wish that each of us share to be healthy. 
Your own wish to be as healthy as possible in body and heart and mind. 
See if another outbreath you can relax and settle even more. 
And if in some deep, quiet space within you somewhere, you might connect with the wish to be at peace, at ease. 
Appreciate what a beautiful thing it can be to truly be at ease with what is. 
To really connect with any sense of peacefulness. 
In the last moment or two of this meditation, checking in with whatever is there in your experience right now. 
Allowing whatever is. 
And ask yourself, what is the mood or attitude in your heart right now? Is there a way to be gentle to whatever is here? Is there a way to be gentle to whatever is here? So taking your time coming back into contact. 
I'm going to invite you to take a moment, especially those of you who are newer at this, to stretch. 
You can stand up if you want, loosen up your knees. 
Thank you.
