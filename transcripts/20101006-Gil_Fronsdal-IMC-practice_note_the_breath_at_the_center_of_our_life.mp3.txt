Dharmette: Being with the Breath  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

For many people , breathing can be a wonderful focal 
point for mindfulness practice and concentration 
practice. Giving attention to breathing, learning about 
how we breathe, what goes on when we breathe, and 
aspects of our breathing, is a wonderful way of learning 
about ou rselves, how to monitor ourselves, and how to 
adjust ourselves to get along better in this world.  
 
I think of mindfulness of breathing as the great 
lubricator . If we can stay in touch with our breath, it 
lubricates our efforts through life. For example, i t’s ver y 
hard to keep the breath tense or tight  or held if you’re 
paying attention to it. And if our breath is not being held , 
then we tend to be a little bit more at ease as we go 
through our life. It’s harder to get worked up ; it’s harder 
to get caught in anger or resentment . To come back to 
the breath and be familiar with it, to be in touch with it 
often , and to make that a habit, so that throughout the 
day you’re dropping back into the breath  – for many 
people , this is a great support in their l ives. 
 
Occasionally,  there are people for whom focusing  on 
the breath does not work. It’s even counter -indicated  sometimes . There are other ways of doing meditation or 
mind fulness practice  that don’t keep the breath at the 
center. But generally, for most p eople, it works , so I’m 
going to talk a little more about it today.   
 
One of the things that I find fun about the English 
language, is that the phrase  “spiritual inspiration”  has 
the word ‘breath ’ in both words. Respire, respiration. 
One of the meanings of the  Latin t he word spiritus  is ‘to 
breathe. ’ It also means ‘spirit ,’ but ‘respiration ’ has the 
word in it , as does ‘inspiration, ’ as does ‘spiritual .’ They 
have the same Latin root. S o ‘spiritual  inspiration ’ 
requires a lot of breathing. It calls us back to our breath.  
 
Paying attention to the breath, b ringing attention to the 
breath – there are  a variety of ways of doing it. I 
recommend that we find a way to go inside the 
experience of breathing , as opposed to being up in the 
control tower in the head, watching it. One way to do 
that is to feel it rather than watch it. And, in fact, I try to 
avoid language of watching when I talk about being with 
the breath. I’ll talk about feel ing the breath, be ing with 
the breath, or experiencing  the breath, rather t han 
looking at the breath , because I find that  looking at it 
tends to create a separation . As the looker , you  can 
easily get tense, or be separated from your experience 
in a way that’s not helpful. But the language of feeling 
and sensing, puts you more in touch with it.  
 I like to encourage people to experience the breath, to 
notice how the body experiences breathing. It’s not a 
matter of you experiencing the breathing. It’s a matter 
for you to notice  how the body  experiences it, because 
the way we sense something is through the body. We 
sense the experience of breathing and how the 
breathing affects our torso, our diaphragm, our belly, 
our shoulders. When we feel the front rib cage rise or 
expand outwa rds, we experie nce that in the area of the 
ribcage. We might know it cognitively , perhaps , in our 
thinking mind, but the sensing experience is in the body 
itself. Notic ing how the body senses it, how it 
experiences it, puts you more in touch with the direc t 
experience.  
 
Then become familiar with that. Spend time getting to 
know what your breathing is like. Find out what it’s like 
in different situations : how it changes depending on 
your mood, your emotions, your reactions, what activity 
you’re doing , so that you are familiar with a wide range 
of ways the breath is experienced.  
 
You can start noticing changes that occur in your 
breathing, because the changes are indicative of 
something interesting to know. For example, you get 
into your car to drive and y our breath is relaxed and 
fluid, and then after a while you notice your breath is a 
little bit held . That might be an interesting indication that 
you’re actually in a little bit of a hurry, or impatient with your driving. It might be the first indication y ou have that 
maybe it would be useful to relax. Maybe you can drive 
in a more easeful way. I t helps everyone else’s driving  if 
you can be a little bit more relaxed and calm as you 
drive. That’s a little example of how you might be able to 
use your breathin g to help you understand where you’re 
at.  
 
I often check into my breath throughout the day , and 
there are plenty of times  where my firs t indication of 
how I’m feeling  is by what’s going on with my breathing. 
It’s like an early warning sign : “Pay attention  to this , Gil; 
you need to notice this. ” 
 
Then where people notice the breathing experience, 
changes from person to person . It also changes in the 
course of the day, or in different situations. When I was 
in Asia,  in both the Japanese  and the Burmese 
traditions  I practiced in, the encouragement was to be 
aware of the breathing in the belly. So I spent much of 
my life, tracking, and being present for my breathing in 
my belly, just below the belly button area. Maybe 
because I’ve done it so much , I feel v ery comfortable 
there, very familiar with it there, and it’s grounding. It 
gives me a low center of gravity. It keeps me in touch 
with a place that is useful to keep soft.  
 
In my early years of meditation , I had a very tense belly . 
I could relax it, but as  soon as I relaxed it, it would involuntarily tense up again. It took me a  long time to 
relax it and to soften my medi tation  until I had a 
relatively soft belly that I could keep that way. Keeping 
my attention really low in the belly helped with 
discoverin g that – keeping  a soft approach in my 
stomach.  
 
Some people prefer to be present for their breathing in 
their chest, and that’s sometimes very comforting , 
feeling it around the heart area, and feeling the 
movement, the rhythm of rising and falling, expan ding, 
contracting  there .  
 
Some people prefer  to be present for the breath with the 
sensations of the air going in and out through the 
nostrils. There can be a little tingling, little changes of 
temperature, vibration as the air goes in and out.  Some 
people like that very narrow focus of that one little place 
at the tip of your nose, because it gathers you together, 
and keeps you focused  in a way  that, for some people,  
may not happen as easily  in the chest  or the belly, 
because they are bigger are as.  
 
I tend to prefer emphasizing feeling the breath in the 
torso because more of our life happens in the torso. 
More of our emotional life gets expressed in how we 
breath in the torso . Our emotions sometimes get 
expressed  in different places with various  tensions, 
holdings, and loosenings in our torso, shoulders, or belly. Not much happens at the tip of our nose. I 
suppose you could tense up there if you really wanted 
to. And also, for some people, the tip of the nose is so 
close to where  they experience think ing, that i t’s very 
easy to slip back into thinking. I tend to think it’s more 
useful to experience the breathing in the torso area. 
Sometimes people don’t get as concentrated as quickly 
in the torso area, but often  the concentration tends to be 
more relaxed and softer, than if it’s at the tip of the 
nose.   
 
It’s interesting to hang out with the breath, get to know 
it, and become familiar with the difference between the 
experience of breathing in and the experience o f 
breathing out. Get familiar with that difference . They’re 
different experiences. I find that in breathing out, there’s 
a natural letting go that happens. I like to go along with 
the letting go, emphasize it slightly, or use the letting go 
of breathing ou t as a way of releasing the thoughts that 
might h ave crept in – to let it go a little more fully as I 
breathe out. That little extra letting go  as I breathe out, 
keeps me more connected, and less likely to wander off, 
and more likely to catch myself if I h ave wandered off, 
and then to come back  and let go of my thought s. For 
me, it allows the end of the out -breath to be more 
smooth and pleasant .  
 
And then there’s a teeny nanosecond of a pause at the 
end, before I breathe in, which  allows the in -breath  to happen more naturally on its own. It’s a  very nice feeling 
sometimes  when  the breath just appears on its own.  
 
When I say , “Pay attention to the breath, ” some people 
find that they’re controlling the breath. Some people 
feel, “I’m not supposed to control my breath ; I’m 
supposed to have a natural breath. ” Generally in our 
tradition , we say, “Don’t worry about that. ” The primary 
thing we’re doing in Vipassanā meditation is noticing 
what t he breath is like. If you have a controlled breath, 
your job is to notice what a controlled breath is like  – not 
to judge it. You  might have to become the world -class 
expert on what the controlled breath really feels like. 
What’s it like to control it? Wha t emotions go along? 
What beliefs go along? How you grapple with it? What 
is control like? What does it feel  like? What part of the 
body gets activated in the control? Just really get 
present for it. That does two things. One thing is that 
you develop grea t insight, great understanding, great 
presence with something – in this case, controlled 
breathing. And the other is, that if you really get to know 
it well, and you’re not  bothered by it, but are just relaxed 
about it and get to know it well, it tends to give up, to let 
up on its own. Sooner or later , it will stop if you have 
that kind of focus on it. I would encourage  you, if you 
find yourself controlling it, to be very relaxed about it 
and just go along, and get to know i t – and then it will 
pass in its own time.   
 If you’re really relaxed, a n interesting phenomen on that 
can happen is that there can be a long pause at the end 
of the out -breath. Sometimes it’s at the end of the in -
breath , but often it’s at the end of the o ut-breath. And if 
there’s a long pause, then there’s a gap in what you’re 
focusing on, what you’re paying attention to , because 
the breath is not happening. And if you don’t direct your 
mind onto something at that point, it’s easy for your 
mind to wander o ff in thought. In our tradition, the 
classic instruction at this point, is to find something in 
your body, where your body’s touching, like your legs or 
your hands are touching each other, or your knees are 
touching the floor, or your lips are touching  – some 
place where there is contact. Then in that gap, before 
the in -breath comes back, go and notice that contact. 
So you’re grounding your attention in some place in 
your body. If the gap is really long, you might, in a very 
relaxed way, move your attention  between the different 
contact points, between the left knee and the right knee, 
or between the hand s or the lips – so that  you’re 
always, in a gentle, relaxed way, letting the awareness 
take in some direct physical experience. That can be a 
little bit of protection from having the mind wandering off 
in the gap.  
 
If you get calm enough or centered enough, a nother 
interesting thing to explore as you’re breathing in and 
out, is staying with the in -breaths and out -breaths  and 
noticing  at what point in that cycle you are more likely to wander off in thought . Sometimes there’s a real pattern. 
A common pattern, not universal, is that the mind is 
more likely to wander off during the end of the out -
breath or during the out -breath. Sometimes people 
release their vigilance a little bit , and the thinking mind 
creeps in there. For some other people , it’s other points 
in the cycle . But if y ou can notice that it’s a regular 
pattern at a certain point in the cycle of the breath 
where mind starts to think and wander off, then you can 
add a little bit of extra vigilance when you come to that 
part in the cycle.  
 
Just remember, “Let me just hang in there at the end of 
the out -breath ; let me just stay a little bit extra , and then 
I can relax when I get to the end of the out -breath 
because I made it. ” Then do the in -breath , and then do 
the next thing for the out -breath so that you stay on 
track  and don’t easily wander off in thought.  
 
The l ast thing I’ll say is that breathing is a wonderful 
companion . I hope , if you give it time  and get familiar 
with it, that you’ll really come to appreciate what a 
wonderful companion it is to carry with you thr oughout 
the day and check in with . Being in touch with your 
breathing  is a great support for a wise life.  
 
Thank you.
