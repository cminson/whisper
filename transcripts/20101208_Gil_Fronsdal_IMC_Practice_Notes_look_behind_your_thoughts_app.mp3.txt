Thoughts

It’s fairly common for many people to live very much  in 
their thinking , whether it’s thinking in words or in 
images . What’s interesting to do is to look behind the 
images, the thinking, the content , to the subjective 
feeling  – the sense of how you feel, how you are, 
behind that. What’s actually going on in a deeper way in 
your felt sense of being in a body, being in a mind? 
What’s the mood, the attitude, the feeling, the emotional 
state that you’re in?   
 
Sometimes, by staying too much in the world of 
thinking, it actually inhibits or interferes with a deeper 
intimacy with one self, with  a deeper way of being 
connected . If you can go behind the thoughts to what it 
feels like to be alive and present now, then that’s 
sometimes a more int eresting place to practice from – to 
breathe with that, to breathe through it, to feel it, to 
make space fo r it, to be aware of it. There are  a lot of 
things that could be there in the background, or in the 
foundation for it all . It’s nice to check in and hang out 
there , and see what happens if you do that.    
As you’re practicing, whether you are doing walking 
meditation or sitting meditation, you don’t have to 
necessarily stop thinking  – it’s not so easy sometimes – 
but can you feel your way behind  the thinking , as if 
you’re listening to someone speak ? You feel your way 
into the tone of their voice . What’s behind it? What the 
mood or emotional sense of how they are, out of which 
those words are being spoken ?  
 
Feel your way into yourself as you walk, as you sit , and 
then see if you can let your mindfulness practice, your 
awareness, flow out of that or be connected to that 
sense. Certainly you’ll be pulled away into though ts over 
and over again, but come back to what’s behind, or 
below, or the wider context for thinking .  
 
That context, that background that’s behind thinking, is 
always in the pre sent moment . See how it unfolds if you 
stay connected there. Although  it’s not necessarily easy , 
you might feel more content about things . See if you 
can f ind this contentment as you go be hind the veil of 
thoughts.
