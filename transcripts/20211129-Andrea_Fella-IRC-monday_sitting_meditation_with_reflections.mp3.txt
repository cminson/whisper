 The low energy, the tiredness that can be here at the end of a day, we might have some resistance to it. Feel like is it worth, is it even helpful to try to be sitting up at this point? Often I think that our relationship with with this kind of mind state is really where the issue is when we're sleepy. And we don't want to be sleepy. We don't like to be sleepy. We feel like it's a problem to be sleepy. We might believe we can't be aware while we're sleepy. Those kinds of ideas, views, perspectives in our mind can radically change the experience. Believing it's a problem. Often sleepiness feels unpleasant. But the experience of sleepiness itself without any judgment or views or beliefs about it often can actually be pleasant. We might have the idea that the experience of sleepiness may feel foggy or thick. It doesn't have that sense of clarity that we think meditation is about. If you have had the thought, I'm too sleepy to meditate. I'd like to propose that you already have enough awareness. You are already aware that you're sleepy. That thought is a kind of a harbinger that there's awareness that you are sleepy. And maybe the awareness can be simple. He'll mention these two at the end of his talk. Simple and clarity. Sometimes we have ideas about clarity, what it means. If it feels like there isn't clarity, maybe we can step to the side of simple instead. Maybe there can be just this simple awareness. This is what it's like to be sleepy. Breathing and sleepy. That's what's happening. Breathing and low energy. Breathing and dull. Anything where it feels like I can't be mindful while this is happening. Maybe there's a simple awareness that can just know this. This confusion. This spaciness. Awareness is so simple. It's like a mirror is so simple. A mirror is such a simple thing. A mirror reflects what's in front of it. It can reflect complicated things. It can reflect detailed things. And it can reflect a blank wall. And it can reflect fog in a room. Some of the exploration about getting familiar with awareness is simple, clear awareness. Is to not mix up what is reflected with this simple reflecting. A mirror reflects fog, steam on the bathroom mirror. It's doing its job perfectly. Simply reflecting every drop of water on the mirror. I find late in the day remembering simple is helpful. Just simply what's here. Maybe it's a drifty feeling or a sleepy feeling. Maybe it's alert. Simple. Allowing awareness to receive whatever is most naturally received. Perhaps letting go of an agenda about what I should be seeing in favor of what's actually already here. What's available? Avail ourselves of what's available.
