 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, for the reflections today, as I mentioned, for today and for this week, I'd like to share teachings on wise speech, which is a very important part of the Eightfold Path. And as I briefly mentioned, even if we don't get the chance to perhaps sit in a particular day, have a formal sitting, formal meditation practice, we pretty much every day engage with speech either externally with others or internally, the way we talk to ourselves, the way we treat ourselves. So, speech is always happening internally, at least, if not externally. And speech forms our personality, forms our mind, forms the person who we are, who we become. And sometimes, actually, our speech may not correspond to who we think we are. And through cultivating wise speech, we can, as a formal practice, taking it on as a formal practice, not as a, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm truthful enough, but no, actually, taking it as a formal practice, we can really engage and shape and support our development. It's a beautiful, and I don't want to make it tight, serious, but it's a profound practice. Wise speech is a profound practice, really profound, in shaping who we are, what we are. So, there are various, there's definitions for what wise speech is, and the Buddha also teaches about ways to, questions to ask ourselves. And this week, I will go through them all. And there are multiple lists, the Buddha has different lists, and if you combine those different lists, one list has four definitions and one has five, and if you combine them, we end up with actually six guidelines, six questions to ask ourselves. And I'll combine, given that we have five days in the week, I'll come one day, I'll cover two of them, so that we can cover all five, all six. So, actually, first, I want to say one more thing about speech. So, in the Eightfold Path, wise speech shows up pretty much right after wise perspective, or wise view, and wise intention. So, of course, the root of everything is our perspective, how we see something, how, what our view of the world is, our wise view, wise perspective, and then our intention, coming, having, make, forming an intention for action. And then the third one is wise speech. So, it's really right after the first two basic fundamental holdings, you know, what everything, what holds the whole practice up is really our view, our perspective, our perception, and our intention, our compass, what we set our compass to be. So, with wise speech, in order to practice it, I would say two general directions that will apply to every question that we'll cover this week. The first is to actually make a commitment, make a commitment to engaging with wise speech, making a commitment. So, that commitment is the second half factor, wise intention, intending. This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to engage to speak skillfully, appropriately, not gossip, not lie, not be unkind, etc., etc. And we'll go through them. So, first is really the intention we make at the outset. And then later, in real time, as we're actually speaking, we pause, we feel into our bodies, if we are about to shape the truth, or tell a white lie, or gossip, feeling into our bodies, what's going on? Am I stressed? Do I feel threatened? Am I trying to self-aggrandize? It's feeling into the body. Oh, sweetheart. Yeah, interesting. That's what's going on. Okay. And can we reconnect with our intention? Can we reconnect with our intention? So, these are the basic ways to engage. And then one more thing to say about the, in Pali, in the Eightfold Path, appropriate speech or wise speech is samma vacha, samma vacha. And the word samma is sometimes translated as right, right speech, wise speech, appropriate speech. And early in my practice, when I heard right, it sounded so puritan, right speech or wrong speech. Whereas actually, the word samma really means appropriate, as in using the appropriate tool. So, for example, the appropriate tool for hitting the bell is the bell striker. It's not a pen or a mug. It's the appropriate tool. So, what's the appropriate speech? What is the right appropriate or wise speech in a given situation? And right. So, okay. So, the day I like to cover the first and the time remaining. There's so much I want to say, but the first guideline really is, is it truthful? Is it true and factual? And truthfulness is the only moral commitment, really, is the commitment to truthfulness. It is said that in the progression of a bodhisattva, from going through many, many, many, many lifetimes to become a full Buddha, the bodhisattva truthfulness, the commitment to truth is so important that that's the only moral precept that a bodhisattva cannot and does not break. So, this not only symbolically, but the sense that our commitment to the truth really is the foundation of the whole path. It's really foundation of our awakening in our humanity through many, many lifetimes. If we have a funny relationship to the truth, yeah, that's our commitment to awakening is a little, not quite straightforward. So, the commitment to truthfulness, the truthfulness. The Buddha talked about how dangerous it is, actually, how lying is dangerous because it has leads to a slippery slope of more lying, more complicated behaviors. And we have to tell more lies to cover the first one and more moral corruptitude. And actually, there is research that supports that. And before I tell you about the research, which is actually fascinating, also, I wanted to mention that, as we know, when we tell a lie, it really betrays trust, it betrays trust in relationship and others have trouble trusting us later. As Nietzsche said, I'm not upset that you lie to me. I'm upset that from now on, I can't believe you. Very powerful words. So, I want to tell you about a study that's fascinating. So, in the study, and I'll tell the very brief version here, basically, the researchers wanted to study lying and how it can progress, how it can impact the brain, etc. So, they made up, they created a setup, a situation where the subjects were tempted to lie, were tempted to lie just a little bit to get some financial reward, which was, again, tiny. So, at first, the participants lied a little bit, they exaggerated a tiny bit, they had to estimate the number of pennies in a jar, etc, etc. Won't get into complicated setup. So, at first, they opted just a little bit, a tiny bit. And when they opted a little bit, their amygdala, the amygdala part of the brain that really is said to be the part of the alarm network of the brain, fear and also this. So, there was a sense of discomfort, like, the amygdala would engage when people lied a little bit, like, okay, I don't want to lie, but I did, like, uncomfortable, there's a sense of discomfort in the body. As the experiment progressed, when people had lied, their lies became bigger, bigger and bigger, so that by the end of the experiment, they were just widely overestimating the number of the pennies by more than 50% or so. It's snowballed, really lying snowballed. But what's amazing, actually, is that their amygdala became less reactive. That's profound. So, their body didn't feel as comfortable, they didn't feel as uncomfortable lying anymore. They had trained their bodies, they had trained their heart, they had trained their minds, they had trained themselves to feel more comfortable with lying. And they had changed through their behavior, they had changed their compass, because our bodies are, in many ways, our moral compass. Have you figured that, you know, with mindfulness of the body, we feel into what's happening in the body, and really, it's our tuning fork, it's our tuning fork. But through our actions, we can shape and form our bodies to become either less or more sensitive to our moral conduct, to our awakening, to our, we can become more and less sensitive to our humanity, to our goodness. Wow, that is astounding. And, and not surprising, right? We know that. So, so commitment to truthfulness really is paramount, really, the first and foremost of these, of why speech invitation. And I also want to mention that in some sutta, it's not just, is it true, the question to ask ourselves, what I'm about to say, is it true? Is it true what I'm about to say? It's actually, is it true and factual? So that nuance of is it factual is actually, is a very important nuance. So, so the truth is not relative. It's not my truth. It's your truth. Because yes, we all have our perceptions and perspectives, but the Buddha suggests that we actually examine, is it supportable? Is this what I consider to be the truth? Is it supportable by facts? Oh, this person is mean, they, they meant to hurt me, Baba. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Are we attributing? Is it really supported by facts? Is it just our perceptions, our feelings? Yes, it is true. We were hurt. Yes, we can say that. But can we attribute intentionality or is it that, okay, well, they said this, I said that. This is, so it's like a third person conversation essentially. You know, there, in, there's one book that I love and highly recommend is Difficult Conversations. And in, whenever you're about, you need to have, and we need to have difficult conversations in our lives a lot. Of course, not, they may not necessarily be difficult, but, but impactful conversation. And for example, in this book, really, which to me is a beautiful Dharma book, talks about how we separate our, the impact that something has had on us from the intentionality. So, one part of the conversation is, okay, what we perceive something to be, and then we can put ourselves in the other person's shoes, what we perceive things to have been from their perspective. And then there is a third person conversation, which is the objective. Just, just objectively what happened? They said that. I said this, they did that just very simple, without any interpretation, without any attribution of intentionality, just it's, it's objective, objective. So, so this addition of, is it true and factual is, is a very important nuance that, that the Buddha, the brilliant Buddha adds. Okay. A lot more to say. Happy to be practicing together and sharing the Dharma. Take good care, have a wonderful day, and looking forward to continuing tomorrow. Be well. Thank you.
