Take a few moments just to arrive. 
To be present here right now. 
This experience might be. 
. 
. 
Being present doesn't mean we have to exclude anything. 
It's the whole of the experience right now. 
And I want to. 
. 
. 
I ask you to bring up in your mind a memory of a situation where you received love, kindness and really turn your attention towards that experience. 
If there's nothing coming up for you, then maybe bring up a situation where you have been giving kindness, love, care, acceptance to somebody else. 
And whether receiving or giving it, let it resonate in your heart. 
Allow yourself again to be touched by this experience. 
Loving kindness has the quality of all embracing, inclusiveness, acceptance. 
Without any condition. 
A situation where you experienced being accepted as you are. 
Loved as you are. 
Loved as you are. 
Loved as you are. 
Loved as you are. 
Loved as you are. 
Imagine a little pearl of light radiating golden, warm light of love, carrying all of these qualities, settling in your heart. 
Loving kindness, care, acceptance, a full embrace that includes everything. 
Settling in form of this pearl of light into the heart. 
Loving kindness, care, acceptance, a full embrace that includes everything. 
And allow it to grow, to feel all of the heart with the warm glowing light of love, kindness, care and acceptance. 
Allow it to radiate and to expand. 
Loving kindness, care, acceptance, a full embrace that includes everything. 
And allow it to grow further radiating through all of the body, filling it with light, warmth, love and care. 
A golden glowing light shining through all of the body, filling it with acceptance and care. 
The embrace of loving kindness and conditionally. 
Loving kindness, care, acceptance, a full embrace that includes everything. 
Allow it to suffuse the body, all parts, every cell with the light of loving kindness, acceptance, care. 
May I be well. 
May I be at ease. 
May I be free from all suffering. 
Or maybe for you there's just one word coming or just a notion of feeling, that's fine. 
And allow the light to extend further over the boundaries of your body, into all directions above and below, in front and from the back, to the right and to the left, to fill all the space around you, as far as it wants to reach. 
Loving kindness is limitless. 
Share it with your neighbour, may you be well, may you be at ease, may you be free from all suffering. 
Cut. 
Cut. 
And allow the light to radiate out even further beyond the limits of this room, this house, as far as it wants to reach, wishing well-being, tall sentient beings. 
May all be well, may all be at ease, may all be free from suffering. 
May all be well, may all be at ease, may all be free from all suffering. 
May all be well, may all be at ease, may all be at ease, may all be at ease. 
Let the light of kindness, of love, of unconditional acceptance radiate into all directions without limitations. 
And let it suffuse everything. 
There's nothing that is excluded from this light of loving kindness. 
It embraces and accepts whatever unfolds. 
It embraces and accepts whatever unfolds. 
There. 
There. 
May all be well, may all be free from suffering, may all beings be at ease. 
There. 
There. 
There. 
There. 
There. 
There. 
There. 
There. 
And gently, gradually, draw the light back towards your body. 
And take a few moments for doing some. 
And gently, gradually, draw the light back towards your body. 
And again, allow the light of love, kindness, acceptance, care, suffuse all cells, all parts of your body. 
Let it be filled with acceptance, with love and care. 
May I be well. 
May I be at ease. 
May I be free from suffering. 
And allow all of the light together in your heart. 
And all of it in this little pearl of light. 
Which carries the light of loving kindness for yourself, for your friends, your loved ones, your teachers, for those that you don't know so well, for those who you find difficult. 
And for all sentient beings, may all be well. 
May all be free from suffering. 
May all beings be at ease. 
And allow this little pearl of light to settle and stay in your heart. 
And when ever you need to, you can return to that. 
And allow it to grow. 
Thank you.
