 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So this morning I want to talk about a simple practice, onward meeting practice, that's really been meaningful for me, beneficial for me, and that is this practice of resting in the sense gates, resting in the senses. So it's a way of, you know, often Andrea will talk about awareness, and this is also an awareness practice, but rather than a focus on the full just salt of awareness, it's a way of very gently allowing awareness to be perceived through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and heart mind. So we'll start, if you'll indulge me, with a little visualization. So you can have your eyes open or shut, it's up to you. But imagine it's a warm day and you're in a beautiful forest, beautiful forest, and you're kind of looking out over the forest, safe and dry, under a kind of rocky overhang or a tree or something like that. And then, as you're there, you hear rain approaching, this wide swath of sounds, perhaps of the wind or water on the trees, a sense of rain approaching. And as the rain gets closer and above you and around you, hearing the individual raindrops, on the leaves, on the ground, the branches, noticing too what smells arise as the forest wakes up in moisture, perhaps the smell of pine or bay laurel, oak or elm or mulch, earth. And then if you wish, you can step out from your little shelter or just stick a hand out. And imagining, feeling into the sense of individual raindrops on the skin, does it feel like they're pleasant or unpleasant, neither? And perhaps opening your mouth and allowing either a raindrop or just a sense of the very moist air on your tongue. Is there a taste? What emotions are present? Perhaps happiness or joy, contentment, or maybe grumpiness, unhappiness, or perhaps a peacefulness, an equanimity, this experience? No right or wrong way to feel. And finally, noticing the awareness of it all, the knowing. And noticing too, for each of these arising, the visualization of the forest, hearing of the rain, the smells, the sensation, the taste, all of these are arising in the mind, the heart. In particular, they're arising in the imagination, right? So that's the little visualization, thank you. I'm going to talk a little bit about why awareness practice, practice of the senses is meaningful to me. It's a very simple practice, and it's one that has evolved over the years that I have practiced. It has become a little bit of a default, especially in walking meditation, hiking practice, even just washing dishes or walking around my workplace. And the simplicity of it is touching to me. And the mere fact that if we are resting at one of our senses, the experience of one of our senses, any of them, we're here, we're not there and done, we're here. And that is so touching, reality is meeting us, we're alive, wow, right? And it's a heck of a lot nicer usually than the alternative that the mind wants to be taking me through. The hamster wheel, right? Even if resting at the mind gate, which I'm going to call it, and I'll explain that in a minute, that's resting in awareness, and that is a magnificent difference between being caught in whatever's arising in awareness, thinking, fantasizing, worrying, all of it. It's this tiny difference that's everything from practice. So I'm going to give a very kind of brief overview of the six senses from the Buddhist perspective. Many of you have heard this probably a number of times, so I'm not going to spend a ton of time on it. So as I was saying, it's everything we experience, and rather than the justalt, the whole, which awareness practice can also take in, and is quite a beautiful practice. This is noticing the individual input, right? Seeing, the hearing, the tasting, the smelling. And it's done through, from an early Buddhist perspective, a combination of three things happening at any given moment. There is the organ, and I'll use here the eye because it's easy to point to on the Zoom screen. The eye. And then there is the arising, what's known as the sense object, or just the appearance, or if you prefer the word form. Whatever is striking the eye, probably my image is what is contacting the third piece, the sense organ of the eye right now. So there's always the organ, the arising, and the contact. And then part of the contact, if we're awake, if we don't have a damaged eye, if we're conscious, is the consciousness of the contact. And consciousness is a big word, and there's like literally libraries of philosophical books probably, dedicated to consciousness. This form of consciousness translates to polyviniana, a very, very simple form of consciousness. It simply means a cognizant of, in this case, seeing. Seeing people for me right now. Right? So the same thing happens for the ear, the sensing organs of the body, and by this I mean the skin for external sensation, and then all of the wondrous nerves running through our body for the internal, interoception within the body. If I'm feeling a warm glow in the heart at seeing an old friend, that's an internal sensation and emotion. So the sensation is the warmth in the heart, and the emotion is the arising at the chitta, the heart-mind. And I can get pulled into memories of an old friend, or thoughts about this friend's future, and then I'm kind of lost, and I can just notice the emotion in the old friend sitting before me right now. So that's the super brief synopsis of the Buddhist perspective on this sentence. And now I'm just going to mention two ways to practice with this, and there's a real invitation here. Please feel free to do this whatever way works for you, and to explore and play and have fun and allow and rest in whatever you discover. Okay? Here are the two that most often arise for me, and that I found really useful. And the first one is one that Andrea Fela taught and continues to teach, but I first heard it from her probably over a decade ago. And this is to simply rotate through the different senses and notice what's arising at them. And this was especially helpful for me in first kind of dropping in, let's say I'm going for a walk, and my seeing becomes quite predominant. It's hard to go for a walk without seeing. And that's just kind of a doorway in, rotating through, okay? Hearing, smelling, tasting usually isn't so predominant. Sensing, sensing the body moving, sensing the grounding of your feet, whether sitting or walking. And then moving to the mind, the heart. This practice of rotating through, I find an easeful, really helpful practice in its own right. It also is a wonderful way of very gently cutting through anything that might be happening that's distressing. For example, I was hiking yesterday, and the mind just snagged itself on this worry. And it wasn't like a particularly even pertinent worry, but it snagged itself on it, and it was starting to do that thing where it ruminate on it, chews on it. I'm sure that none of this has ever happened to any of you. Of course not. And I'd gone a little while, it hadn't been very long, but I was noticing, wow, this is a moderately distressing arising at the mind. And it just, boom, it vanished. Because seeing it as the event, seeing it as the arising in this instigate, gave the heart of mind permission to then just let it move through. This is not important. You don't need to spend time on this. So I keep using the word sense gate. I want to just unpack that a little bit. So in early Buddhism, these are also called sense spaces. But when I use sense gate, I'm actually referring to the combination of resting in the process of, for example, hearing, and any of the input coming through there, but most of all, resting in the consciousness of it, the awareness of it. You can almost think of our bodies as these submarines in the ocean, right? And there's windows all over the submarine, and each of the windows is a sense gate. Maybe there's a speaker that lets in the sound. And this very special submarine allows you to feel the water by touching the wall. We're always immersed in reality. But really, the analogy breaks down a little bit because the submarine is made out of the ocean, and we are made out of the same stuff as reality. So we're constantly feeling at the sense gate, connecting more with awareness, with reality itself. Okay, so I digressed. That was the first practice, rotating through. And I've actually found it fun to imagine the body as kind of a vehicle sometimes of some kind, just sort of immersed in reality. That's another way of connecting. It's a little layer of imagination, but it's pretty thin, right? The second practice will be familiar to all of you from practicing vipassana, but it's a little bit of a different frame on it, and that is resting in the moment and noticing what sense is predominant, right? So at this moment for me, I think hearing and seeing are predominant. Hearing my own voice, I'm seeing all of you. As I'm speaking, I put my hands together and sensing became predominant because, oh, my fingers are a little bit cool on the hands. That's predominant. And just noticing each of those, and as I was just doing gently, if it's helpful and not if it's not, naming it. You don't have to name the specific of it, but just, oh, seeing. Hearing, symptom. It's just enough of an anchor in this wash of what's arising to kind of keep us anchored in the present, right? So this is a great kind of receptive practice, and one that Andrea talks about, especially on her retreats, is the practice of resting in awareness, resting in receptive awareness. That's the mind gate, and it's also resting in whatever consciousness of whatever sense and put happens, right? Just allowing it, allowing it. As I said before, it's very simple, and it is amazing how often it is better than the alternative. Just incredible, really. And I'm talking about even in situations that are just not intrinsically that great. I work in a hospital. I see a lot of suffering in a hospital. And being present with it is so much more pleasant than going into my head about it. There's something intrinsically satisfying about meeting what's actually there. It also can kind of invoke a sense of gratitude. Wow, seeing eyes are functioning great to call, you know, or whatever else is happening. It's a touchstone to aliveness. There's also something really powerful about this practice because of what can be seen in it, and I'll unpack that just a little. What can be seen, what can be known, and I'm not sure of the kind of person who in your mind, it's more about hearing thought, what can be heard, sensed, felt, understood. Let me take a moment to consider how I want to say this. So there's many different kind of ways of describing what can be seen and known in a powerful way. I'm just going to do an overview of three of them, and I'll unpack next week, so I'll unpack one of these then a little bit more because they're all kind of big. But the first is what's known in Buddhist terminology as seeing the fitter, seeing the nut or the binding that arises. And this is the way it's referred to when this practice of the six senses is talked about in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Satipatanasuta. Now, the fitter is, let's just say, noticing the eye, noticing seeing, noticing what is being seen, and noticing any craving that happens based on that. And that can be as simple as seeing something beautiful and adjusting my angle or my view or my day to see it more often, or less enough, right? It can also be seeing something kind of awful and adjusting my angle, my view, my day to avoid it. It can be aversion to either one. It is a form of punha, craving. It can be as simple as smelling or seeing a treat. Noticing the difference between seeing that craving for that treat and acting on it. You can say it is so what, so what, but I remember a friend of mine many years back now was married, his wife was pregnant, she was big, she was kind of, you know, and he very sincerely talked about, in a group of us, noticing, seeing other women, women who are not pregnant, and noticing the inclination of the mind to get attracted. Now, that's a huge consequence if that's not noticed, and there's not Sela, ethics there. But this man had a lot of ethics and very strong practice and would just notice the fetter, and that's as far as it went. Noticing the love for his wife and his heart when he looked at her, he let that blossom. So it can be a very consequential practice, this, right? Okay, so that's subtle. There are other ways of seeing that are a little bit more accessible in daily life for most people, and one is noticing Vedana, feeling tone, at each sense, right? So, thinking back here to the visualization of the forest, what kind of feeling tone was predominant? Back in your imagination, was that primarily pleasant, unpleasant, neither pleasant nor unpleasant, maybe boring? All of those things, or Vedana. And again, very, very simple, right? Very simple and powerful. So I was just at one of my very best friend's wedding over the weekend, and this woman's amazing, Ranta Zen temple, and there's a really can-do kind of person, and would you believe she made her own wedding cake? And wow, okay, so I was cutting the cake, I decorated and cut the cake. So I had access to as much cake as I could possibly want, you know, this thing was huge, and eventually I had one piece, and she made an amazing cake. It was so good, so good. And noticing the Vedana saved me from just way overeating, because at the first bite I was like, oh, this is so pleasant, wow, pleasant, pleasant, and just could really savor each bite. And by savoring it and noticing the pleasant Vedana, it didn't have to go further, it didn't have to go to, oh, I'll reserve a second Dhanapurin piece for myself, or whatever, right? It was a way of grounding. So Vedana, and then the third way of noticing what can be seen, understood, heard, is noticing the kind of emotions that arise as a response to each sense, or perhaps for many of us, it might be noticing the emotion first, and noticing what sense was involved, right? Seeing the old friend. The first thing that might come to mind is not the seeing. The first thing might be, oh, this is warm, this is great. And then noticing, oh, this is a contact through the eye. Or hearing, and maybe I'm hearing something, let's say an ambulance siren, for example. And if there's not a cognizance of the, oh, that little just touch of maybe sadness or maybe urgency to get out of the way of the ambulance if you're driving on the same street, or whatever it is, that can pull the mind into an entire thought process. It's maybe quite unpleasant. But noticing the initial hit of emotion, and in the Madhmana Kaya, the middle-length discourses, these emotions are kind of broken down into three big buckets. Not that different than the Feeling Tone buckets, that they're sort of the next layer, right? And that is joy or happiness. And in that, I would also say contentment, ease, well-being, just kind of a big bucket of good stuff. And then there is unhappiness or distress or grumpiness or mild aversion or irritation, all those kind of go in this second bucket. And then the third bucket is equanimity, equanimity, peacefulness about it, non-reactivity about whatever it is. There are two kinds of these emotions, and this is the topic I'm going to talk more about next week, because as I said before, it's kind of big. But these two kinds of emotions are sort of the normal, everyday, run-of-the-mill response, the householder, that's in air quotes, response. And the response when the meditation is mature, and it's going really, really well. Those are the two kinds. And I'll give examples just briefly of each. One is, let's just say that the simple happiness of walking through a beautiful place and seeing beautiful things, smelling beautiful smells, hearing like pleasant bird chirping or whatever, right? That's the everyday happiness based on these senses. And there is nothing wrong with this. It can come a long way towards connecting us with now, right? With reality. The lot can be done in the practice. Onward leading can be done by simply noticing the happiness, unhappiness or equanimity in the moment towards actual things that are arising, actual sense of context. Then there's the, I would say meditative happiness or joy, the meditative unhappiness and the meditative equanimity. And I'll just give an example of meditative happiness in a moment. And here the Buddha is talking about the happiness of clear seeing, of insight. It could be of the joy of seeing inconstancy and permanence flowing through and not clinging to it. It's a certain kind of joy and it's a kind of joy that is completely independent of what is being seen, right? So that's the meditative happiness. It could be equanimity. And householder version is equanimity about a certain thing. I don't care that I didn't get a second helping of X. There's a much different equanimity that arises when it's an equanimity about our relationship with what's arising itself. Right? Equanimity about anything that is seen. I don't care if it's a rose garden or a garbage dump. It's the, it's another level and it's more in the camp of resting and awareness and an insight. So I'll talk more next week about the sort of liberative process and potential of working, working with, relating to emotions and feelings at the senses. There's an entire discourse on this and it's a beautiful one. And I hope you'll join me for that. So I just want to recap what we've talked about for the last half hour. That is that practicing, allowing, whether it's moving through, rotating through the six senses or just resting and allowing things to happen, is a simple, powerful practice in its own right. It has its own section and the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and it invites kind of a receptive investigation or knowledge of the specifics, the building blocks of this beautiful process, just to what we call awareness. And part of what's powerful about it is because of what we can see and what we're not caught up in when we're hanging out there. So this practice, it's really supportive. It can express freedom and it can also be onward leading towards full liberation. I just want to encourage you, between now and next week, if it's not already a conscious part of your practice, give it a little try. It works, for me it actually works better in informal practice, whether it's walking or washing the dishes, but some people find it very useful in sitting practice. And I'd love to hear what you discovered. Thank you for your kind attention. So friends, we have at least 15, well 10 minutes for sort of Q&A. I'm going to leave the recording on for now. So if you don't want to be recorded, you can put it in the chat and I'll just read it anonymously and then answer it. But you're also welcome to unmute yourself and ask. And then I'll stay on, starting about 10 45 for informal discussion and it will not be recorded for anyone who wants to stay. So any questions or comments either about the talk or about your practice? Yes, Twiti, please. Thank you so much for a beautiful talk. I was so captivated by it. But then I just remember that I need to be aware of what you say and still I need to be aware of it, not just the lost in it. So I just went back to the sitting posture, the posture and the touch, the contacts of the body. So my question is, what's the difference between cognizing and knowing? It's a beautiful question and I just want to say too, I really appreciate the way you were practicing with the talk. One of my teachers in Burma had said, you know, it's fine to just let go and listen. But I think it's also, there's something really powerful about picking something to ground you while you're listening. So to name that. So cognizing and knowing in this talk, I guess I was using them very slightly differently. So cognizing is the simple awareness of whatever's coming in at a sense organ that's actually happening, cognizing. And it's sort of below the level of, for most of us, conscious mindfulness. It's happening all the time. We couldn't drive a car or send an email or prepare or eat a meal without it. So it's very low level. It's just that the fact that the sense contact makes it into the mind or makes it into the heart, that's cognizing. Okay. Okay. Knowing can be used interchangeably with cognizing, but the way I was using it here was more of in the context or the meaning of understanding, really apprehending it and knowing the significance. And not necessarily in a big philosophical way, but knowing that I'm in the present moment versus not in the present moment. Right. Or something like that. I wish I could give you the poly for that one, but maybe by next week, I'll book to that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So, any goodness, any freedom, sense of peace and wellbeing, dedication and sincerity that we have developed here together in our practice. Could it be dedicated to the wellbeing, the joy, the freedom, the wisdom and the liberation of everyone our lives touch and everyone their lives touch, moving outwards in circles and eventually touching all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings know the highest joy of awakening. Thank you all for the sincerity and dedication of your practice.
