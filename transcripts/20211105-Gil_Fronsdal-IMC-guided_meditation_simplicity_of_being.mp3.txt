 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.Adiodarma.org. So hello and welcome. And it occurred to me that I'm teaching about thinking this week and coming to the end. Somehow I happily don't have many thoughts about this topic at the moment. I feel pretty content. So to not need anything, to sit upright, meditate, and let go of needs, expectations, let go of it needing to be any particular way, to be here with the simplicity of being, with whatever is here, including the complications. So lowering the gaze, 45 degrees to the floor perhaps. Relaxing the gaze, loose focus, not really looking at anything in particular. And then closing the eyes. And to be here with this body. This body that we have, that we are, that we're in, this body that just is, can be like the temple that we enter. And we can enter it with our deeper breathing. Breathing in fully, allowing the ribcage to expand. If you deep, breathe deep enough, it lifts the shoulders a bit. With a full deep in-breath, even the belly might expand outward. And then on the exhale, to relax all that, to release. Maybe at the end of the exhale, to let your elbows kind of flap a little bit, swing a little bit, so that there's a looseness in the arms. Letting the breathing return to normal. And continuing to relax, softening the muscles of the face. Releasing the shoulders as you exhale. Softening the belly as you exhale. And maybe also softening it on the inhale. Feeling the touch of your clothes against your skin, your skin against the clothes. And relaxing all along that meeting place of skin and clothes, relax, soften. And gently, on the exhale, relax the core of your being. The most deepest, tender place within. Allow it to trust enough to relax, to soften. And then there's the thinking muscle. Whatever tension or pressure, contraction that you might feel associated with thinking. It might be physical, it might be a mental tension. Whatever it might be. As you exhale, soften it. Let it become calmer. Maybe letting go of any need to think. The pressure to think. The interest in thinking. Put it aside for now so your thoughts can float away like thought bubbles blowing away in the wind. One of the thoughts to let go of is any thoughts connected to time. Even thinking about the end of the next breath is to be involved in time. Do not have thoughts about time. It allows each passing thing to exist while it's present, as if it's there forever. In the quiet stillness of the mind. Each in breath. Moments in forever. No time. Each part of the exhale. Fully there itself, no time. Forever. Breathing in, breathing out. No in, no out. Just sensations. Appearing and disappearing. And when there is no time, no appearing and disappearing. Just is. Each moment. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Loosening up on your thinking. Let it become calmer and quieter. Let yourself very gently. Think about here, just here. Letting go into here. Let that be the content of your thinking. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. And now, letting your thoughts be quiet and soft, calm thinking. Have your thinking remember a time that you received someone's care, goodwill, kindness that was touching for you. Heart softening. Where something inside of you resonated with that care, that kindness. Or think of a time that you were caring and kind. It was meaningful for you, the feeling, the way it arose and lived in you. Quiet thoughts, simple, relaxed thinking to remember how it felt in the body, the mind, the heart. What was inspiring about that for you? And then quietly, calmly, see if you can have thoughts in your own way of thinking, of goodwill, kindness for others. People you know in your life, people you run into, strangers. Very simple, ordinary attitude of kindness and goodwill. What kind of thoughts would accompany that? What place in the heart or what place inside might be awakened with such thoughts of goodwill, of kindness? When the mind is quiet, it can be a meaningful time to think wholesome thoughts, beneficial thoughts, especially at the end of the meditation. To prepare yourself to go into the world with a caring heart. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may you share in that happiness and peace and freedom. May all beings be happy.
