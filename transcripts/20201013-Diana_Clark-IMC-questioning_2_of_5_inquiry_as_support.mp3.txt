Good morning. Hello.
So to build on the guided meditation,
we can use this expression, this inquiry, this questioning.
What is this as a way to bring us to our experience to kind of get a little more connected
if we're not quite connected to our experience?
But it might be that when we are inquiring what is this,
we see that we're unsettled, distracted, or restless,
or maybe we see that we're having the same experiences over and over again.
Like, oh, I'm doing that story again.
Oh, there's that story again. Or maybe obsessing or getting lost in
or really tied up and tangled up with a bodily experience.
Maybe there's an uncomfortable experience in the knee or the back or whatever it might be.
Or maybe this expression that Jack Cornfield sometimes uses,
the unfinished business of the heart comes up.
Some of the wounds, some of the difficulties.
When we're asking what is this, we might feel like we're noticing that we're stuck
or we're not connected or lost in a loop.
Of course, this isn't so uncommon. This is quite a common experience.
But then we can use inquiry as a tool, as a way to help us get unstuck,
as a way to support our practice.
So what asking the question what is this could be a practice
that Buddhist traditions do have that as a key component of their practice
to keep on asking, asking, asking in an open way,
not in an obsessive tight got to figure it out kind of way,
but in an open, relaxed way.
Or maybe you can do mindfulness in the conventional,
I'm using the word conventional,
commonly taught to rest the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
To bring inquiry in as a tool is to add it into the toolkit
of the ways that we might work with difficulties.
So in this way we can investigate these forces of distraction
or agitation or stuckness as a way to understand them more fully
and as a way to help bring some balance in.
Of course it's easier to find freedom, to find ease
from something when we understand it better.
And inquiry can be a way in which we can understand it better.
Many of you know that there's a story that happens a number of times
in the early Buddhist discourses where Mara,
the personification of distractions or agitation or temptations
or all those forces that get in the way of our mind getting settled
and finding our way towards more and more freedom.
So Mara shows up to the Buddha in all kinds of different guises.
And then the Buddha just says,
I see you Mara, and then Mara skulks away.
So this is a kind of metaphor of pointing to when we see clearly,
when we understand something often, not always,
often it can be resolved or diminished or just go away.
So having these forces of distraction or agitation
or unfinished business operates in everyone.
It's not a personal failing.
We don't have to take it personally.
Instead we could use it as a cue to look a little bit closer,
as a mindfulness realm maybe,
is to really get curious about what's happening here.
And to not look necessarily for quick fixes
with the expectation that as soon as we look at it,
it's going to go away.
Sometimes that happens.
But often it doesn't.
It's just the beginning of a gentle, warm-hearted inquiry
to look carefully and to open to them.
For example, by asking what else is here
so that if we're having a repeated, I'll use this word, difficulty,
it most often predominantly arises in one area of our felt experience,
the body or the mind,
or maybe it shows up as a pressure or some kind of vague way.
For example, there's a lot of sensual desire
maybe experienced physically, like a leaning forward,
or often sometimes the chin goes up.
Or maybe there's a tightening in the solar plexus with some desire.
Maybe energetically, if I can use kind of this vague work,
it means this rush of restlessness or maybe that gets felt as this upwelling of vitality,
or there might be a pressure to do something.
There's this kind of vague sense that I have to go get this thing or something.
Or maybe strong desire shows up emotionally as an excitement, as an eagerness.
Or maybe it shows up as storytelling.
It's going to be so great when I finally get that thing and then I'm going to be satisfied
and then I'll be happy as soon as I get that.
So this is just an example of how strong desire can show up physically, energetically,
emotionally, cognitively.
But often if there's a feeling of stuckness,
we may just be paying attention to one aspect of our experience.
So inquiry can open up or make us aware of some other aspects,
some other areas to the same experience.
And the inquiry could say, what is this?
Which might start with maybe noticing that posture is going forward.
And then we ask again, what is this?
Maybe still noticing the posture is going forward.
And then we ask again and then we might notice,
oh yeah, there's this wish to achieve, get, attain, have, obtain something.
So maybe by just asking, what is this?
Repeatedly, the other areas of other aspects of our experience open up.
Open up or we notice them or become available.
Maybe there might be a wound that shows up.
I use this word wound.
I can use all kinds of different words.
Maybe it's a repeated story that comes up.
For example, maybe our parents getting divorced when we were young.
And the story about what happened to which child.
And so we get lost in this story kind of this repeatedly.
Maybe we could open it up to say, well, how does that story feel in the body?
Maybe there's a lump in the throat or tightness in the chest.
Or maybe we can notice like, oh yeah, there's real sadness underneath this story.
So by asking or staying with it with a little bit of inquiry,
we might become aware of layers that are underneath what's happening.
And then maybe a deeper layer.
Often if we find that we're stuck with something,
what's going to help it get unstuck is noticing a different aspect or maybe a deeper layer.
And can't get unstuck at that one particular layer, but underneath or more broad.
And if we also, if we find ourselves stuck in a strew, we could ask ourselves,
is this true?
It's a little bit awkward to ask that question because of course we're thinking it so, it's true,
but is it? And just to ask ourselves, is this true with some openness and ease?
Is this true?
Is this story that I'm telling myself over and over again completely true?
So asking what else is here is a way in which we can discover different aspects to one particular experience.
But it also can help us if we find that we're really stuck and getting into overwhelm.
And we don't want to get into overwhelm.
Certainly our capacities are diminished.
Our best wisdom isn't available to us when we are in overwhelm.
So asking what else is here could be a way in which to bring our attention to something neutral,
something less emotionally charged, less challenging, less sticky.
What else is here can bring our attention to neutral mending experiences,
feeling the chair, a cushion against our body, hearing the sounds.
Good one, of course, is feeling our feet on the ground.
And just to remind ourselves that there is always a collection, always a myriad of things,
a whole host of things that are happening at any moment.
And we're choosing to focus on a subset.
So can we open up our awareness, maybe receive other experiences from neutral ones?
There might even be areas of our experience that are pleasant.
Maybe it feels good to finally sit down and meditate after running around doing lots of other things.
So in this way, inquiry, questioning, we could use as part of our toolkit.
Just to help us discover what's underneath our experience,
especially if we have some insistent visitors, some repeat customers, so to speak,
stories, the top 10 hits that we say over and over again to help us see what's underneath,
what's fueling them.
If we ask, is this true towards a story, maybe we undermine them,
take some of the power out of them.
But we could also ask, what else is here as a way to broaden our experience
so that sometimes we collapse around difficulties or if there's a struggle.
So what else is here is a way to broaden and to notice there's a visual field, there's sounds,
there's pressures in the body.
So inquiry is a toolkit.
So today, as you go about your day,
you might just in a nice, relaxed way ask yourself, what else is here?
It's a way to kind of like open up our experience.
What else is here?
And I hope that when you ask what else is here,
that you find some gentleness, some warmth.
We have some warm-heartedness for yourself and recognizing that practicing in this way is a way to care for yourself.
And from that place, can we help support others?
And what else is here is that can be a way that can help us to show up for others in an open, relaxed way.
So that our practice can be a benefit not only for ourselves
but for others and ripples out from there.
Thank you.
