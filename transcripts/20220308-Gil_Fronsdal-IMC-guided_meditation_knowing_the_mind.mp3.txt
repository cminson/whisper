 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So warm greetings for this Tuesday morning, and for our second talk on the third foundation for awareness. And we are trying to steadily, through this Satyavatthana, to cultivate a heightened awareness, a heightened sense of knowing, attentiveness, presence. And in a sense there's a path through these different foundations, beginning with breathing, and then mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of feeling tones, and then now mindfulness of the mind. It's sometimes considered to be more refined, or more subtle, or more accessible through a settled mind. And so the beginning of this process begins with mindfulness of breathing. So in this meditation I'll lead you through kind of a quick trip through these first two foundations. A bit with the button breath, the body, feeling tones, and then we'll open up to the chitta, the mind, the mind state. So assuming a meditative posture, one that allows you to have a combination of being alert and relaxed at ease, and you might lower your gaze to about 45 degrees angle, looking down at the floor, and kind of loosening the focus, not looking at anything in particular, letting the eyes become kind of soft and relaxed, and very gently, slowly closing the eyelids. And then perhaps letting the mouth drop open a little bit, the teeth apart, so the mouth is a little bit more relaxed. And then gently float the teeth together, so they're almost touching or touching, so the jaws are a little bit more relaxed. Softening the belly, letting the belly hang forward and down. Maybe in softening the belly, feeling the weight of the belly, so the belly almost kind of settles into the, down towards the pelvic cavity. Maybe beginning with a soft belly as you inhale, letting the belly expand, the chest expand. Maybe taking a long, slow, deep breath. And then leisurely, a little bit longer exhale. On the exhale, relaxing the face. On the exhale, relaxing the shoulders, softening in the shoulders, adjusting your hands and arms a little bit if that helps the shoulders. And again, softening the belly. Breathing normally, letting your breath just be, let the breath breathe itself. And become aware of the thinking mind. Is there a lot of energy or pressure, contraction, tension in the thinking mind? Restlessness. Maybe on the exhale, a little longer exhale again. Settle the mind, quiet the mind. Almost as if as the, on the exhale, the mind spreads wide, spreads horizontally, wide and peaceful. No. our our And then settling the awareness into the body, breathing. And it might help you not to struggle with anything. If you think of the breathing, not something to be exclusively focused on, but something to allow to be at the center of all things, as if the experience of breathing is the center of your world. And your job is to sit at the centers, be with the breathing, and allow everything else to be in the periphery. As if for a few minutes at least, breathing is the only thing you need to do, focus on. Just breathing.toe And then knowing how the body moves as you breathe, the movements of the chest, the belly, maybe the shoulders, even the back rib cage. Maybe as if you're float, peacefully floating, in waves gently coming and going across the ocean. Fully resting, floating on the movements of the torso as you breathe. Fully resting. Fully being aware of breathing in the middle of your body. The peripheral attention has a global awareness of your body that receives the experience of breathing. As the inhale settles on the exhale. Fully resting. Fully resting. Fully resting. Fully resting. And as you're aware of breathing, is any of the breathing, anything connected to breathing pleasant or unpleasant? Maybe there's both going on at different parts of the cycle. Some are pleasant, some are more unpleasant. See if you can be equanimous, but pleasant or unpleasant in breathing. Just know it, that's how it is. As if you're breathing through the pleasant, through the unpleasant. Breathing with it. And in particular, feel the pleasant part of breathing. And let yourself feel it more fully, like taking in, drinking, or receiving the pleasure of breathing. And if it's just a small part of the breath. And let yourself feel it more fully. And more broadly in your body, beyond the experience of breathing, are there any pleasant feelings of your body that you can breathe with? Or that you can allow to accompany the experience of breathing? So your attention to the breathing is supported by the pleasant sensations of your body. And notice if there's any pleasant or unpleasant sensations of the mind. Breathe with them. So your attention is more with the breathing than reactive to the mind. Just breathe with how the mind is. Whether it's pleasant or unpleasant. Breathe with it. Breathe with it. Breathe with it. Perhaps relaxing any agitation or tension in the mind as you breathe. Breathe with it. Breathe with it. Breathing in and breathing out, centering yourself on breathing. And with the peripheral attention, gently without too much effort or focus, see if you can know something about the quality of your mind, your mind state. Maybe as if you're breathing with or through your mind, your mind state. Knowing it for what it is, equanimously. Whether it's pleasant or unpleasant. Whether it's agitated or peaceful. passive or kind. Strongly wanting something or being content, whatever way it is. Breathe with it. Breathe through it. Know it. Kind of as a peripheral phenomena as you center yourself on your breathing. Breathe. Breathe.................................................... the attitude, the state, the mood, the energy. And see if you can know it with a knowing that's peaceful, that quantum is not troubled by how the mind is, not desirous for anything being different. And just knowing. And as you know it, almost as if you're roaming around in the mind to feel and know it in different ways, different directions. The end of this sitting, whatever the way that your mind is calm or equanimous, or even if it just wishes it was, or assumes you have some. Considering the suffering of this world, equanimously, gazing upon it kindly, gently, as you would gently touch or clean a wound on the knee of a child to cause the least amount of pain for the child, caring, loving the kid. So look out upon the world, that kind of soft, kind gaze, caring gaze, as if having compassion for the world should be done with respect and gentleness and tenderness. And for all the people who are suffering in wars and poverty and oppression, all the people struggling, can we from our quiet, whatever quiet and peace of the mind we have, wish well on this world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Amen.
