For this second talk on the Second Noble Truth , the 
truth of the arising of suffering , I’m going to talk about a 
variation of what I talked about yesterday  – that the 
Second Noble Truth is about the cause of suffering. 
That’s a common interpretation . A variation of that is 
that the Second Noble Truth, rather than looking for a 
cause, is pointing to the conditions, the conditionality of 
suffering . What we want to discover here are the 
conditions for the arising of suffering.  
 
In the tea chings of the Buddha, t here is a strong 
tendency to avoid what could be called causal language  
– causal in the sense of a deterministic cause  – that 
when X happens, Y will happen. This is b ecause in Transcribed from https://otter.ai -edits _JAS_mg - 2 - deterministic formulations , there  is no movement for 
practice . We will just experience what happened in the 
past. It is implied that  there ’s no point to practice , or to 
do anything different . Because of the continuity of past 
causes, this is  just something we have to experience. 
The Buddha was quite explicit  about  this.  
 
Another reason he was reluctant talk about cause 
seems to be that causal language lends itself to the 
idea that there ’s someone who is the agent of the 
cause. Over and over again,  rather than talking about 
anything that suggests an agent, th e Buddha chooses 
language or descriptions of reality that talk about how 
conditions come together. The flow of condition s, the 
process of conditionality are what  give birth to the world 
we experience. In this regard, the Second Noble Truth 
is looking not at the deterministic cause  of suffering , but 
rather at the condition that needs to be there  – the 
necessary condition for suffering. If the necessary 
condition is present, it doesn ’t have to lead to suffering. 
However,  if there ’s suffering, that necessary condition is 
in place.  
 
So this is getting a little bit more complicated, maybe 
philosophical, but it also has something to do with how 
the process of looking at our lives changes as we 
continue doing meditation practice. In ordinary life, it ’s 
completely natural to look at cause . Causes may be  
seen  over time . For example , if I was angry with my Transcribed from https://otter.ai -edits _JAS_mg - 3 - friend yesterday, and now my friend doesn ’t want to see 
me, I suffer. The cause of that suffering is what 
happened yesterday. That ’s the ordinary way of seeing  
things . But that ’s a more complicated analysis  than 
looking at conditions – it involv es past, present , and 
future.  
 
When we ’re looking at meditative experience, we ’re 
focusing on what the conditionality is in the present 
moment  – what’s happening in the present . When we 
are in the present, there is something about the present 
moment experience, which allows us to  discover 
awakening, real freedom . We don’t hav e to ana lyze, or 
consider , “What was I doing yesterday ?” – and then 
figure out what the cause of that  was. In meditation, 
we’re looking at the moment -to-moment experience as 
it arises.  
 
One of the remarkable things about quiet, deep 
mindfulness meditation is that we can watch things 
arise  – without the arising of any reference to self : “I 
didn’t plan that thought ; I didn ’t will that thought. ” It’s 
almost as if  a particular thought is happening to me, 
within me , but the agent  – me as the agent  – doesn ’t 
seem to be operating. It just a thought. A thought 
arises , and we don ’t identify  with it as, “That’s me. ”  
 
You can watch something arise without identifying with 
it, and it ’s possible to see how, with the arising of one Transcribed from https://otter.ai -edits _JAS_mg - 4 - thing, something else arises – not as a nec essary 
result, but in relationship to the first thing , with the first 
one as a condition. So  for example,  if I have a thought 
about what happened with my high school girlfriend, 
then the next thing  is just a thought that could come and 
go. I might have tho se thoughts periodically over my 
adult life, without any  charge to them .  
 
But it might be that I get angry. The anger does not 
necessar ily follow the thought about the girlfriend. But 
without the thought of the girlfriend, that anger about 
what happened doesn ’t occur. It is possible to have 
both of th ese arise in a certain way , and  we just see 
them in the clarity of awareness . And  in that c larity, 
we’re not involved in them, picking them  up, or reacting 
to them. They just seem to float up, appear , and then  
the next one appears based on the first one. And there 
starts to be a kind of freedom in relationship to it  all – 
freedom from reactivity .  
 
In the meditative mind, rather than looking for a cause , 
we’re looking for condition s. Seeing c ondition ality also 
allow s us to see a bigger picture than we would with a  
cause. Often when we look at cause , we’re identifying a 
single cause. But there can  be a range of conditions 
that add up to our suffering.  
 
An example might be that as I’m driving down the 
freeway every day to work , I see a billboard for some Transcribed from https://otter.ai -edits _JAS_mg - 5 - wonderful product for sale – and I salivate. I ’m really 
want ing it, and it’s hard to not get off the freeway to go 
buy it. Every day I feel this tremendous desire to buy 
that thing , and I suffer because of it. I get to work 
frustrated and anxious . I can hardly pay attention at 
work , because I ’m thinking about this thing I want. And 
then I remember  that I don ’t have the money to buy it . 
So I’m frustrated with mysel f, and the story  goes on and 
on.  
 
The cause of all that suffering may be my desire for this 
thing, but I can ’t give up the desire. It ’s very stuck and 
strong. But if I look at the conditions, one of the 
conditions for that strong desire , that obsession, is 
seeing that billboard. So then I decide , “Let’s just go on 
a different road, and not see the billboard. ” And lo and 
behold, I don ’t get triggered in the usual way. This is a  
silly example, but it points to  how, when we start looking 
at conditions, we can see much more of the situation  – 
and we see more areas where we can intervene.  
 
One of the ways we can intervene in the world of 
conditionality is to allow something just to be. C raving 
arises ; strong desire arises  – and we see it. We know 
it’s a condition for further clinging , grasping , and all 
kinds of other things. But in the meditative mind, we just 
see it as a single event of craving, and we let it be. This 
is known  as cutting the chain of conditionality at the 
point of craving.  Transcribed from https://otter.ai -edits _JAS_mg - 6 -  
It is also said  that one of the conditions for cravin g is 
that we see or experience something pleasant, 
unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant. There ’s 
a direct experience of something. Sometimes it ’s 
possible to see  just the pleasantness of the experience , 
and then maybe we see the desire arise . But because it 
is so clear how one condition exists and the next one 
follows , in a sense  we can allow them to just be 
separate. We don’t link  them strongly together. It is said  
that the chain of conditionality, the sequence of 
conditions , is cut between feelin gs and desire – and it is 
there  that we  find some freedom.  
 
The Buddha talked a lot about conditionality. And 
conditionality is one of the ways in which  the Second 
Noble Truth  has been understood. It can be quite 
helpful to see it this way. As I said, it really comes to 
fruit and is seen clearly in the meditative mind.  
 
What we ’ll see in the next talk tomorrow, is how going 
further the meditative mind, going deeper into 
concentration, lends itself t o the next interpretation  – 
which is p robably the most common interpretation of the 
Buddha’s Four Noble Truths.  
 
I want to thank you , and I look forward to our next time 
together.
