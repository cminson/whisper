The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, so I'd like to frame the reflection this evening around some stories. So I was
out hiking recently and I heard a sound behind me that was approaching faster
than a person would walk and it included kind of a low-pitched rumbling sound. So
my mind put these various inputs together and it produced the perception
motorbike and then I turned to look at what was coming up behind me and it
was actually two horses and riders and the rumble had been kind of the low
winnie of a slightly winded horse. So this is the function of the mind that's
called perception that we looked at a little bit in the meditation. It's the
function that recognizes and means experience. So I don't hear horses very
often so perception made a mistake about what the sound was and perception
relies on memory and it's biased toward what we hear most often. So that was what
came to mind. What came to mind was this motorbike idea seemed to be the
most likely possibility but the way perception works is a little bit like
that function on your phone where you're typing a text and it gives suggestions
for what the next word might be and based on what you started to type so
that's a little bit how perception works. So I came up with this idea of motorbike
based on the various inputs I had had but I did feel I noticed a little bit of
uncertainty about that because of course motorbikes are kind of rarely found on
hiking trails. It didn't quite go together in my mind but you know that was
the best thing it could come up with just from the sound and then when I turned
to look and I included sight, a visual input then there was conclusive
information and the idea of motorbike just dropped away it was just gone you
know that obviously wasn't correct and it was horse. So I want to highlight you
know first of all that it's really fun to watch perception because it's so
fundamental but also makes a fair number of mistakes and and it's an area of note
in our practice because for the very reason that it makes mistakes it can
really influence our what we think is going on in an incorrect way but this
moment of slight uncertainty is really interesting you know like where
perception hadn't quite landed so my mind went ahead and it put a label on
of motorbike but it was also aware I also had an awareness that this might not be
a perfect fit you know there was a little tension there so there is some
aspect of perception that also checks how accurate it thinks its label is so
these moments of perceptual uncertainty are important in at least a couple of
different ways one of them is that they highlight the operation of perception
so perception is actually occurring in every moment well nearly every moment
let's say I mean it's one of the five aggregates so when experience happens
one aspect of it is that the mind labels it conceptualizes it understands it in
some way but when it fails or is uncertain then there's some tension in
mind and there's a feeling of kind of hanging up and and we can see perception
operating more easily in cases where it's not just happening very very simply
and automatically so it's also very useful to when exploring perception to
have this capacity of hanging with uncertainty because we'll notice that the
mind doesn't like to be uncertain so it's a little bit confused in that moment
and that's unpleasant so it wants to put a label on it really wants to stick
something on there but if we can hold the not knowing it will serve us better
in our practice if we're able to be with a slightly tense feeling of not having a
perception because there are insights in Dharma practice that depend on our
being willing to hang out in an uncertain space in the mind and not
immediately resolving it with a concept it's so it's a good skill to learn this
feeling of I'm not sure what this is and just being able to hang with that so in
the case of this horse that wasn't a motorbike my mind actually resolved the
tension pretty quickly it was pretty fast I had the uncertainty I turned and
looked and the uncertainty was relieved because I saw that it was a horse and
this is how it often is in daily life things happen kind of fast and so I
want to also give an example from retreat where the mind was able to be a
little bit slower with this whole perceptual process and just just to
highlight how that can be when and when we're able to do it a little bit more
slowly and so one time I was on a two-week retreat and we were sitting at
a retreat center that was kind of perched on the edge of a valley and one
day I decided to walk out across the valley and practice on sitting under a
tree on the other side of the valley and I was out there under my tree sitting
peacefully meditating and something crawled up my back and sat on my head
and I had a hat on one that didn't have a brim in the back so it could get up the
back so it wasn't sitting right on my head but I didn't know what it was and
so again my mind was hanging in this sort of uncertain state of perception not
being able to land and I was pretty sure though that I wasn't gonna you know put
my hand up onto my head to resolve the tension but and I was pretty far into
the retreat so I was kind of equanimous about this so I just sat there and
watched what my mind did with this unresolved perception I mean I had
perceptions of course that were not unresolved I I had felt it crawl up my
back I could feel something sitting on my head I was very clear about body
sensations there was no so there wasn't like confusion or not knowing anything
but I just didn't have a label for what what that thing was so my mind started
thinking about this and I thought about the fact that it was torrential a
mating season and probably because you know memory operates by what was most
recent and just the previous day over at the retreat center we had seen a
torrential a walk through the grounds in broad daylight which is what they do
during mating season so my mind kind of spun around this memory and I knew
you know I was wondering about this thing on my head and so then as I sat
there just sort of hanging with the uncertainty just I thought well we're
about to see what happens nothing's nothing seems too urgent at this moment
and what happened was I felt my body kind of meaning to the side and I tilt in
my head and eventually the the creature fell off and it was a little wizard
actually one of those little geckos that runs all around so it was so again I
got to see perception snap into place there not the label and you know the
tension is resolved so the tension just vanished and but again and again it was
visual input that relieve the tension so we see also that visual input is
really important we're very visually oriented and we often label things based
on sight you know based on what we see so this is pretty similar to the horse
story but it wasn't as quick of a resolution you know I didn't immediately
resolve that tension so I got to see how the line handled not knowing and there
was a lot of thought activity I actually couldn't so easily just turn my mind
away and go back to the breath or something because you know there was this
ongoing what is that and of course I knew it was still on my head so just you
know just seeing how the mind is operating under all these different
inputs that it's trying to process so if you have an opportunity to watch what
the mind does when perception can't land or is somehow irresolvable give it a try
it's kind of interesting it's very useful because there will be these experiences
in meditation where we don't know what they are you know the mind can through
you know just normal meditation practice it can wander into realms where it
hasn't been before what's happening what is happening in my experience maybe
you've had this in meditation can't quite place what's going on and so it's
good to be able to just hang with that uncertainty and not have to immediately
resolve it so let's see I want to give another example of perception that is in
this case it wasn't a case of it being unresolvable but it also highlights other
aspects of perception that are really useful and interesting to notice so
this is another time I was on retreat I was I was on retreat and I was doing
walking meditation in the parking lot of the retreat center I was walking back
and forth near a row of cars and for the for a long time like you know fair
amount of the walking period I was just doing regular walking meditation where
I was often with sensations of the seats or sometimes I was aware of the
environment around me etc and then but then I noticed that then this out of sort
of out of nowhere a thought arose as often happens and the thought was a
memory that this seemed to be pretty close to where I had parked when I
arrived at the retreat center some days ago which I just hadn't thought about
that until that moment and as soon as I had that thought then I realized that I
was walking back and forth right by my car and you know suddenly one of the
cars looked different it suddenly was my car whereas before it had just been a
row of cars you know I knew they were cars but I hadn't I hadn't really
conceptualized that that one is my car and but as soon as I had that that thought
the memory of driving in there then there was like this specialness to one of
the cars it kind of you know rose up out of the rows of a row of cars as as
different from all the other ones so you know this is a special car so this is a
this is named in the teachings this is called the poly it's called my mom car
mama means mine so this is my making making something mine so we see that
there's nothing about that car that is inherently mine of course it's a
perception it's a perception that is my car that happens to be true in various
senses but you don't have to see the car that way as I proved for the first part
of the walking meditation so it's created in conjunction in this case with a
thought you know the thought that this is where I parked or the thought sometimes
we'll have the thought we're coming out of the store and we have the thought I
need to get home and so we need to know my car and so it pops up so there's
always a thought though if we don't have the thought we don't see things as mine
it's usually so this you know what we're gonna see things as continue to see
things as mine quite habitually I think for a long time that groove has been
worn pretty deep in the mind to to self to do something either creating things
as me or I or mine but it's so useful like in cases like this to if we can
catch the moment where the thought of something that's not me or mine a self
arises it's not bad or wrong that it arises it's useful to know which car is
yours it's fine but it is useful to see that it arises you know it's not there
and then it's there the idea of mine or me or I so when we see that it's not
there and then suddenly it is it's a little bit less sticky to believe that
it's inherently true or that it needs to be true we sort of don't believe in it
quite as firmly we understand that the idea of near mine can come and go now I
would add to this though that we're probably gonna have to see the arising
and passing of me in mind many times before it would become completely free
of it before it's totally unsticky but it's worth the effort it's worth
watching that process in mind and I do hope though that you won't hear Buddhist
teachings of you know we need to let go of the self as oh every time I see
something as mine that's wrong view or that's bad it's actually that's not the
case the Buddha used the word I me in mind you knew those things about his
experience he just didn't have any attachment we still probably have
attachment to that so that's more what we need to watch is the if there's any
dukkha or suffering that comes with it or if it's just a simple perception
that's useful in that moment so in a sense maybe in a sense all labels are a
little bit extra they're all conceptualizations of what's going on but
we do need to use these concepts and so you know they're not they're not
incorrect but they're only partially correct our perceptions are functionally
correct or yeah useful in certain ways so it's helpful to bear that in mind and
just check if they are actually useful or we've added something extra for
suffering around them so if you do get interested in perception maybe just the
last thing I'll say is that in general we can observe sometimes we can even see
more clearly you know a little bit more detail how perception is operating in
the mind so in the mind all the time is receiving sensory inputs through the
six sense bases almost every instant and so what and it has to navigate this
world of continual sensory input and take action in various ways and so we
have a fairly sophisticated sense of perception that tells us what's going on
what that is and then we have other functions of the mind in the realm of
mental formations that tell us what to do with that what does it mean and what
should I do in response but we can watch this unfold so what happens in
perception is that a sense input comes in from some direction into the mind I'm
just analogizing with my hands so something comes in and then what the
mind does is it pulls something out of memory and tries to match what has come
in from memory and so and you know this this is a pretty good match I have a one
hand and the other hand different handedness but it's a pretty close match
they're both hands and so the mind imposes essentially a concept because a
memory is something that that is conceptual so it imposes a concept so
that we know what something is and if we need to take action the rest of the
mind then does something with that the danger with perception is that we
switch over from instead of receiving the next input from outside we switch
over to the concept and we go off with that and that's how we go into thought
trails that's how we go and get lost in memories and plans it's that we've taken
a concept that matched a sensory input either from outside or from the mind and
then we've switched over our attention to the concept instead and continued along
that line and if you can watch this happening it's really interesting and
we see also then we have a little compassion and ease around why we get
lost so easily I mean every moment the mind is matching perception that comes
in so we can know what our sensory experience is so we can live and so
every moment there's an opportunity to take off with the concept and we have to
course sometimes we have to do that maybe we have work that is conceptual we
need to be working with concepts so it's all just information how the mind works
and the more we see it then the you know the less caught up we are and the more
easily we can stay in mindfulness and we can learn to have awareness as we're
doing even doing conceptual things even being on the computer Andrea tells the
story that her early mindfulness practice was done in her work the work
setting she worked on a computer and she would do things like always have
mindfulness when she was switching from windows to DOS things like that and you
know we can do the same thing I sometimes have a practice of looking
around the screen so widening my mindfulness while I'm looking at the
computer screen so that I can see for example the wall behind and the something
about the table that's around I can see around the screen I just open up my
perception for a little while and see that the screen is actually only part of
my visual field and then I can go back a little bit more awareness so I think I'll
stop there with the reflection these are just ways that we can play with and
ways that we can notice the dysfunction of perception in the mind and I'm
curious and if you have any questions about this or comments things you may
have experienced yeah feel free to ask yeah Ali
very interesting you know area of contemplation concepts or everything to
me as you were talking in there at the end is there so so if you're really
mindful I mean we'll just wait for the next moment to come we won't bring in
the stuff from the memory right am I correct on that aspect of it I mean if
you're really watch I mean mindful or the awareness is there the memory card
doesn't need to come up we'll wait for the next thing to arise it's possible
that we can be with an experience and not have perception be so definite or
well-formed that there's a word that comes you know sometimes of course there's
a whole mindfulness practice of labeling experience that comes in the noting
practice but it is possible to hang with what's more more direct experience like
body sensations and not you know not have these words coming in each moment of
you know breath or tension or heat or anything like that but I would just
suggest that perception is still operating in those cases it's just not
as fully formed as making a word which takes sort of a little bit of extra time
so there is still perception operating in a sense that we don't feel that
confusion or tension when when we're not sure what experience is the mind
really reacts when it doesn't know what at all coming in so there is still a
light perception operating we still feel like we are in the realm of what we
generally understand when we're sitting as long as the mind is at ease but
there can be cases in meditation where where the mind gets so still and quiet
that perception doesn't quite form that's a sort of a different state but
you're right that we don't need to you know impose a big concept and actually
remember something and so forth in each moment but I would say that there's a
lighter form of perception that's still operating so would you say on the Jhana
states perhaps there's no perception yeah there is still perception in Jhana
even states okay yeah on on the senses I mean on the things that come to our
senses on the thinking mind so we also bring the memories as I understand it
so I was going to ask you to kind of elaborate on that but more and then the
friend is saying like maybe you know I need to listen more or something along
that and I have a meaning that is assigned to that conversation that I
project on to this someone that's I think is my perception it's easier and
like the seeing things I mean thank you for those examples but with the mind
that is like a tricky as far as like experience that I see like someone
acting or saying something and I think it means something but it actually doesn't
or maybe it does I have no idea okay okay yeah okay so the realm where we
actually put a meaning onto something because for example we remember what
that person did last week or we remember some experience we had in our
family or something that is generally so in in Western psychology that is called
perception but in in Buddhist understanding Buddhist terminology
that's more in the realm of what's called mental formations or some kind of
where we actually bring in a little bit more mental activity maybe I should have
said that earlier is that perception or Sanya in a Buddhist terminology is the
very only the very simple label just the various bear very various concept of
what what something is a recognition of it and then it but it very quickly of
course it's followed by what does it mean what shall I do how shall I respond
and that's that's just the way that perception kind of plays in with mental
formations actually I have an example around this one is one time I was when
I was living at the insight retreat center actually I was one of the
resident volunteers there many years ago and I walked into the basement and I
opened one of the closets there and on the floor of the closet there was a
scorpion this surprised me but so I looked at the I looked in on the floor
and there was a scorpion I know what scorpions are I've seen I've seen them
in books and probably in the zoo and maybe in the desert but never in the closet
and so but my mind you know very reliably delivered the perception the word
into my mind scorpion scorpion and my mind had that moment of confusion that I
was talking about earlier except that the label was correct but it was confused
because I didn't I couldn't get the meaning of that I was like I must have
turned away and looked back three times and each time the perception came up
scorpion yep that's a scorpion and so the label was absolutely correct but the
mind could not grok kind of the bigger there's a scorpion in the closet for what
do I do about that how did it get there you know like these other things came in
and that caused confusion so that area would be some car yeah these mental
formations does that help differentiate those terms a little bit yes yes yes
yes yes it does and I'm just kind of like also thinking about the projection that
you know I think someone feels that way or yeah yeah I mean my perception is I
think it's the projections are just predisposal from my perception of what
he means but what he says to me or whatever I mean at the work or so we
have to we have to watch the mind doing that yeah because perceptions or these
kinds of thought can really get us in trouble yeah yeah well sometimes a way
to handle that is that I'm sure there's you know there are many many practices
but focusing on like remembering now and then that what's what's actually
happening is hearing right or seeing if you're watching someone doing something
we can go back to the basic in which of the six cent stores is happening at this
moment and if it's just if it's hearing I mean of course if you just stick with
hearing you won't process what they're saying but you can you can remember okay
this is sound that's coming in and then there's maybe less space for the mind to
say oh and what it means is and what I should do but he doesn't even like
hearing everything goes through the sixth sense of mind well eventually yes
process that perception is in the mind for example but there is
coming in through the ear the sense of the ear so we can apply that understanding
as a way of cutting off some of that extra that the mind does yeah good
question thank you yeah thank you very much Kim that's helpful thank you
and hi Kim your story was so funny because the first thing I thought of us
you had a bear coming up behind you what a what an interesting thing it
brought up to mind yeah what the mind does with sound and thought I can walk
down the same road at night and have an entirely different awareness level and
an entirely different fear level versus walking down that same road during the
day my brain just takes off and it's it's got all kinds of things in the dark
that I wouldn't normally have around me so that's just one small example like
you're hiking that is it's going to be more interesting to watch that mental
process take off I'll be more aware of that something yeah maybe I don't know
you'll have to check in your own mind your own experience but maybe it has to
do with you don't get as much input in the dark you can't see things as well
you can't hear things as well and the mind has more space into which to wonder
about what what it could be nice example yeah okay so I noticed that it's 8 30 so
if anybody needs to leave maybe we'll formally end at this point but I'm happy
to stay on a little bit longer afterwards but let's let's turn off the
recording
