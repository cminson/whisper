Dharmette: A Good Enough Practice

We have a ping-pong  table at home , and two days ago I 
was playing with my fourteen -year-old son. L ast year we 
played a lot , and periodically , we still play a lot . A year 
and a half ago he was  intensely competitive, really 
working hard to beat me . Eventually , about a year ago , 
he got pretty  good and beat me regularly. T hen we 
didn’t play for almost a year . But in the last couple of 
weeks we ’ve started play ing again . Right now he’s not 
as good as I am , and mostly I’ve been beating him . On 
Monday night we were playing , and I won the first two 
games . He was trying his best, working really hard . He 
used to have a really good return  – it was almost 
defenseless for me . But he doesn’t quite have that 
technique now. So we played two games , and he  lost. 
Then he wanted to play one more game , and said, “With 
this game , I’m just going to be rea lly relaxed. I’m going 
to relax.” I n fact , he stayed really relaxed . All he tried to 
do was relax when he ’d get the ball back . That’s all he 
tried to do  – and he beat me  [laughter] . 
 
I thought that was a great lesson for him. And, in fact , 
the reason I thought of this is that  it represents a nice 
lesson for many areas in life . When I came to IMC to teach  that evening , only a half an hour after the game, 
someone came up to me and described how he had 
been involved in three very intense conversations that 
didn’t go well for him . He realized he was too a ttached 
to wanting things a certain way , and he was self -
righteous, which tur ned people off so they didn’t  want to 
listen to him . I told him that story  – how sometimes , if 
you’re relaxed in what you want, people will listen to you 
more carefully . And then, if you are not so intense about 
it, maybe you’ ll be more likely to get what you need or 
want.  
 
I think the same is  true with Buddhist practice . It reall y 
helps to be relaxed about it  – relaxed about yourse lf and 
about what you are doing . But n ot so relaxed that you 
are not diligent . The balance  is about being diligent , 
making good continuous ef fort – doing your best, but 
being relaxed. W hen you do Buddhist practice , 
sometimes you don’t want to give it all the effort you 
possibly can , because if you give it your all, you will 
probably  mess it up . Some people feel they h ave to try 
a lot, and be a good practitioner . But I think that if you 
try to be too good a practitioner , you’re in trouble .  
 
Probably what works best for the unfolding of practice is  
for your practice to be  good enough . If you try to do 
anything more than good enough , you might get in 
trouble. People strive, push, have expectations, 
measure themselves , and they end up  like my son who lost his f irst two games. In the game he won, he didn’t 
look like a hot playe r. He just gently tapped the ball 
back. T he returns were not that dramatic . But what 
happened was  that I wasn’t able to make the correcti on 
fast enough.  I wasn’t able to get relaxed fa st enough to 
match his being relaxed. I was still trying  a bit too much . 
So maybe next time , I’ll try to do t he rel axed thing  in 
ping-pong . 
 
One reason  this works in Buddhist practice is  that the 
heart of what we are  trying to do in order to free the 
heart is to let go of how we’re tight , or clinging , or 
attached. B eing relaxed is like the doorway thr ough 
which it is easier to let go of what you’re clinging to or 
holding onto .  
 
For some people it’s counter -intuitive to relax , becaus e 
it’s so important to do, to accomplish , and to be the one 
who can do it . This makes some sense , because when 
many peopl e come to any kind of spiritual practice , 
there’s a huge need for the kind of support and 
guidance a spiritual practice can provide . It’s not 
unusual for people to come with grea t personal needs , 
crise s, and challenges . Sometimes the need i s so great 
to get help that the idea that you’re supposed to relax is 
counter -intuitive . So people grab on and hold on . They 
huff and puff , and try really hard.  
 
Then there’s the other end of the spectrum  – the pendulum can swing . Sometimes whe n practice i s 
working  – when,  for example , meditation is comfortable , 
and you settle down and learn not to strive , then the 
danger is complacency . If people are too relaxed , it’s 
easier to spend a lot of meditation  time – years 
sometimes – falling asleep , dozing , being lulled by 
meditation. E verything’s cool. So managing  the balance 
between bein g relaxed and diligent is a very important 
aspect of practice.  
 
Some people think things have to be  only one way. I n 
terms of meditation practice , I think  maybe it has to b e 
at least two ways at the same time . It has to be both 
effort and relax ation . It’s n ot just about making effort , 
and not just about being relaxed . It’s about doing both 
simultaneously . How do you balance that? How do you 
find balance where both are going on , so that it’s not 
just one way , but two ways?  
 
A lot of people in America emphasize the value of 
practicing  acceptance when  doing mindfulness practice  
– to be very accepting of your situation . But if accepting 
is all you do, then it’s too easy to  become complacent, 
to condone things that shouldn’t be, and to actually 
strengthen qualities of mind that shouldn’t be 
strengthen ed. Acceptance has to be paired  with real 
discernme nt, recognition  – an evaluation of what is 
helpful and what’s not helpful . To really see that , yes, I 
can accept everything  – meaning I ’m not going to cling , nor resist anything  – but I’m also go ing to look at what is 
useful and not useful .  
 
If what I’m doing now is not useful , and I can acce pt it in 
a certain kind of way : I’m not going to resist it or cling to 
it. But it doesn’t mean I just have to  let it continue 
merrily on its  way. I’ve known  people who have been 
too much o n the acceptance side of Buddhist practice , 
and t hey end up just accepting a wandering mind . “Oh, 
it’s just a wandering mind. I just have to accept it. It’s 
what my mind does , and I just let it be . I’m learning a 
little bit about what my wandering mind is.”  This doesn’t 
serve them well. If anything , it may  reinforce a certain  
addiction to thinking.  
 
So, next time you play ping -pong, try a balanced, 
relaxed effort .
