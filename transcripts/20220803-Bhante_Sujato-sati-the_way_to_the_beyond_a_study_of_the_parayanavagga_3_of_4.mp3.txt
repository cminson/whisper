 The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org. And welcome everybody. Sadhu, sadhu, sadhu. So good to see you. I hope you're all doing well in your different parts of the world. G'day, Will, Coracott, Kim, Alex, and everybody else who's there joining us. And I'm coming to you. Eric, how's it going? I see you've got your camera working. So I'm joining you today, as always, from Harris Park in Sydney, just near Parramatta. And this is the traditional land of the Barramadigal people of the Darug nation. And we pay respects to their elders, past, present, and emerging. For the last couple of weeks, we've been doing a series of classes on the Parayana Vodka of the Suttanipata. And I've been reading through my translation of the Parayana Vodka and talking a little bit about the meaning of the text and how it's formed and why we've chosen to translate it in this way and so on. And this week, we will continue with that. The first week, we look mainly at the introductory narrative and we noted the somewhat lowbrow emphasis of the introduction to sort of get people involved and get people excited. And if somebody was reading it and they were looking forward to having a good story about curses and black magic, they were probably going to be disappointed with the second part, which was all about very advanced states of meditation. And throughout this, we are seeing a glimpse into the meditative culture in the time of the Buddha, particularly how the Buddha responded to the meditative culture of the most, what appear to be the most advanced of the Brahmanical rishis of the time. And clearly, the questions and the culture and meditative culture around these discussions is reminiscent of the teachings of the Buddha's former teachers, the Lara Kalama and the Gurama Putta, with a special emphasis on the dimension of nothingness, one of the former suttaments. And in addition, I would suggest that it's likely that these are generally that these Brahmanical rishis were of the school of the Upanishadic school, perhaps related to that of Yajnavalkya, a bit difficult to specify this exactly. And I'm sure there was a lot more diversity and richness to these cultures than even we're aware of. So I wouldn't want to sort of push this too far in terms of identifying the people, but just as a general affinity of ideas as certainly as that. And I also suggested that one of the reasons for the framing of the narrative in the way we have it today is as a conversion narrative, and especially bringing the Dhamma to new lands. And so this is very interesting because I'm speaking to you from Australia, the most of you, many of you listening from the United States. And these also are new lands where the Dhamma is being introduced to. And in a similar way, we find ourselves having to find a way of articulating the Dhamma that is going to somehow connect with the people in these different countries. And of course we're not going to do that in exactly the same way that was done in early Buddhism, but it's still I think interesting to listen to how that was done and to see what things there are to learn from that. And one of the overarching features of the conversion narratives in Buddhism is that the narratives are much more interested in incorporating and subsuming and relating to the things that they found in the other places, rather than in replacing them. And so we see in Buddhist cultures today that it's very common if you look in Sri Lanka, you know there's a devala at each temple or many of the temples like a Hindu shrine in Thailand, there's a like a spirit house or something in China, then the Chinese Buddhism, the Dhamma is related to kind of folk Buddhism and so on. And it would be a mistake I think to imagine that these were sort of late accretions to Dhamma. In fact, I believe that right from the beginning that these things were part of the Buddhist culture. And what they do is that they express a relation of, if you like, friendliness and connection with the beliefs and practices that are found around in a particular culture, rather than a very contested and aggressive relationships. The Buddhists have never felt that they had the need to sort of displace or replace or eliminate people who are believing and practicing other things. On the contrary, our main motivation has always been to try to uplift people and free them from suffering. Now that said, let us continue with the discussion today. The chat is open. Please ask questions in there. I'm going to try to take it a little bit more slowly today, and leave the opportunity for you to ask questions as you would like. So let's begin with the next one of these series of questions. I should also just mention just like a kind of a meta comment on this is that, you know, what we've got is a series of questions. It shows how important that is, that the Buddha's, the manner of the Buddha's teachings was shaped by the kinds of questions that people were asking him. So to be able to ask good questions is a skill all in itself. So this is number 5.8. The questions are that Nanda, people say, there are sages in the world so benefit Nanda. But how is this the case is someone called a sage, because of their knowledge, or because of their way of life. Those who are sages do not speak of a sage in terms of view, oral transmission or notion. Those who are sages live far from the crowd I say, and troubled with no need for hope. Those aesthetics and brahmins said Venerable Nanda who speak in terms of purity, in terms of what is seen or heard or in terms of precepts and vows or in terms of countless different things living self controlled in that matter, have they crossed over rebirth and all the age, could sir, I ask you, blessed one, tell me this. As to those aesthetics and brahmins who speak of purity in terms of what is seen or heard, or in terms of precepts and vows, or in terms of countless different things, even though they live self controlled in that matter, they have not crossed over rebirth and all the age I declare. As to those aesthetics and brahmins who speak of purity in terms of what is seen or heard or in terms of precepts and vows or in terms of countless different things, you say that they have not crossed the flood sage, then who exactly in the world of gods and humans has crossed over rebirth and all the age, could sir, I ask you, blessed one, please tell me this. I don't say that all the setics and brahmins replied the Buddha are shrouded by rebirth and old age. There are those here who have given up all that is seen heard and thought and precepts and vows who have given up all the countless different things, fully understanding craving, free of defilements, those people, I say, have crossed the flood. I rejoice in the words of the great hermit, you have expounded non attachment well, Gautama. There are those here who have given up all that is seen heard and thought and precepts and vows and who have given up all the countless different things, fully understanding, craving, free of defilements, those people, I agree, have crossed the flood. All right. So here, Nanda wants to ask about the idea of a sage of somebody who's become free. Now this idea of a sage, a Muni is a, I don't know if it's unique, but it's certainly a very characteristic feature of the Indian tradition. And from a very early time, even long before the Buddha, there was somehow this idea in the culture that it was possible for a human being to find some kind of transcendence, some kind of perfection. That it was possible to recognize the chains, the sufferings, the things that are binding us to this world. And through that recognition by acting in the right way to become free of them. Now, in a certain sense, that understanding is quite common sense and quite empirical, because we've all seen that happen, at least to some degree. I mean, we've all been subject to some kind of suffering, some kind of being entrapped. And through some way, we've been able to get free of that. I don't even mean little things, but still, we have some idea what that means. But the Indian tradition says that it's possible to do this completely, that that this being of entrapment is not inherent to who we are as human beings. Nothing is inherent to who we are as human beings. There's no such thing as having an inherent nature of any kind. And so if it's possible for us to be entrapped, then it's equally possible for us to be free. From a very early time, people believed that there were these sages and, of course, not easy to know who is a sage and who is not, who is really freed and who is not. Why do we believe this? Because of their knowledge, because of their way of life. And these are still similar kinds of criteria that we have today. We don't say that someone's a sage because of their view, because of oral transmission or their learning or because of a notion. Now, I'm going to just comment a little bit on these terms here. In terms of view, I might actually revise that translation. I'm not sure if that view is correct there. I'm going to have to double check that. In any case, normally here when we have this ditya suttya nyanena, it means what is seen. Oh, it's ditya. Ditya. Again, I'm going to have to just review this a little bit. Normally, what this means is in terms of seeing what's heard and what's known. And this is referring to the different kinds of epistemological sources of knowledge that were recognized in ancient India. So these categories and these ideas are used extensively throughout the suttas. Most characteristically in the Atagavaga, the previous chapter in the suttani pata, but we're finding that we also occur here in the parayana vaga. So the vision, we see somebody who's a sage. They look like a sage. They strike us as being one. It's still very powerful, isn't it? Very powerful thing to be able to see somebody and to recognize us as a sage because of oral transmission, because of their learning, because they have been part of a lineage. And again, very, very common these days. So on so and so on from such and such a lineage, so and so on from such and such a lineage, therefore they must be a sage. Or from a notion. And this is the word nyanana normally translated as knowledge. But when we find it in this kind of usage in the Atagavaga, it's often used for a kind of mistaken understanding of things and misrepresentation of things. And so I use notion when it's used in this kind of sense. So sages live far from the crowd. I'm troubled with no need for hope. So nirasa. So the word asa is probably the closest word in Pali to what we would have in the sense of hope in English. It's not exactly the same, but it's still that idea that you're kind of you're not longing to have to realize something in the future because you have already realized it. Precept and vows, of course, being another of the criterion by which people are sometimes judged as being sages. So on so is very ascetic. So and so is keeping all of these precepts. So and so has these vows and so on. And these things can be very impressive. So the Buddha says that anybody who understands purity in this way has not crossed over rebirth and old age. So if you believe that all of these things, your knowledge, your transmission, your tradition, your precepts, your vows and so on, if you believe that these things grant you purity, then you've not crossed over our old age. But then who has crossed over? So one of the things that this dialogue is getting to is that the things that we use to judge spiritual practitioners, the things that are obvious, the things that are on the surface. But those things are ridiculously easy to be fooled by. And as somebody who does this professionally, I can just tell you, honestly, as one of the tools of the trade, that there is like nothing easier than fooling people who want to believe. And I know once I can tell you some of the tricks of the trade, if you like, for example, if you as a monk, you meet somebody and you want to impress them, you just sort of silently nod and say, you meet someone for the first time, you silently know, ah, we meet again. See, that's all it takes. And then they're going away. What does he mean? Has he seen us in past lives every time this level? That's all you have to do. And so it's ridiculously easy to convey these kinds of things. And unscrupulous spiritual practitioners are doing this kind of thing all the time. Like it's literally going on as part of the business of religion, business of spirituality has been since the time of the Buddha. And it doesn't matter what, whether it's Buddhism or Hinduism or whatever it is, you know, it's exactly the same all the time. And it's so easy, you know, I remember one time I was at this temple in Singapore, I was doing a talk. And so it's kind of a fairly large temple in Singapore. This, you know, sometimes with these big places, you might have different people doing different kinds of things. So the people who invited me were kind of the they were the, you know, the sort of meditation group in the temple and they wanted me to come and talk about meditation and so on and so forth. And so I was, you know, I was in the Dhamma hall giving a talk. And at the back of the Dhamma hall, you know, it's a large hall so it wasn't interfering with us but at the back of the Dhamma hall there was a monk who was doing blessings and ambulance. And as I was giving my talk, you know, I was just sort of keeping an eye out for what was actually going on at the other end, you know, and you could see, like there was this line of people coming to see this monk, constant, constant line of people for the like and each one he would give some blessing, give us a short chant, sprinkle a bit of holy water and give them an amulet, and they would give him money. That's it. So they would give money and then they'd get this stuff in return. Okay, next, next, next, next. There was this a purely material relationship. And that's just how it works. And you can see what these things that it's so easy to slip into these kinds of things. So the Buddha redefine somebody who's free not in terms of the things you can identify but in terms of what they've let go of. They've given up all of these different externals they've given up all of these attachments have given up craving and they're free of defilements. These are the ones who have really crossed over the flood. So who is that? How do you tell? Well, not easy, right? Not easy. And still today, people still wonder about these things and it's kind of a hot topic of conversation who's enlightened and who isn't enlightened and you know there's a it's easy to make a nice list of all of the red flags that are going to show you who isn't enlightened. Not so easy to tell who is. Anyway, I'm not sure if I can solve this problem for any of you. But my only consideration would be to say, at the Deepangviharata and the Buddha said rely on yourself, rely on your own wisdom. There's nobody out there who is going to be able to save you. If you can find wisdom, it doesn't matter if you find it from a coffee mug or a fortune cookie or from a Dhamma talk or from the dog next door. It really doesn't. You can find wisdom wherever it is. But you can also find delusion and attachment wherever they are. And you can go to all of the great teachers and do all of the great retreats and all of these things and then do nothing but increase your own attachments. And so just try my, you know, just always try to encourage people just learn the Dhamma, learn the simple principles of the Dhamma and then just try to let go and be peaceful. Don't be in too much of a hurry. Don't try to skip things over. Don't be like, don't be caught up in the latest new thing. Right? The latest short cast and the latest kind of method and all of these kinds of things. Anyway. Okay. Nancy's asked to have one of these sutras read through in Pali. Oh, that's an interesting idea. Sure. The movie, Kim has mentioned the movie Kumare is about a man who plays at being a fake guru. He was shocked when he succeeds. Also, Monty Python's The Holy Grail being another one, right? So the the the the Buddha's Buddha's response there. So to answer Debbie, the Buddha's response there is to to talk about whether a sage defines themselves in terms of their purity through those different kinds of things. And so a sage is somebody who is pure, but they don't define their purity by those external things. Advice on addressing charlatans. Yeah, not easy. Not easy. There's a there's a great. I was just reading just yesterday the great podcast and so on of conspiratuality, which if you're not familiar with is really excellent and really good resource. And I think one of the things to do with these things is to become familiar with the patterns because usually these things are pretty like they're not, you know, you're not like dealing with the upper echelon here. Right. I mean, they're not they're not like they're not, you know, I mean, it's like, you know, if you'll have sex with me, you'll get enlightened. You're like, I don't know. That doesn't feel like you have to sort of strive for great wisdom to be able to see through this kind of nonsense. You know, I mean, most of it is most of it seems like pretty pretty straightforward. So, you know, have your own inner strength. Don't be afraid to check in with people. There are a lot of a lot of frauds and pseudo gurus around the place and stick with the dumber and just be just be cautious. But if we familiarize ourselves with kind of the means and methods of cultish behavior, then that can be I think that's really important. Okay. Okay, let's go on to another. So the next sutta and I'll try doing something partly. Okay, so we've got a nice short sutta. So I'll read this through in Pali, Pali and you can read the English as we go. So there you go. There's the Hemaka Maarava Puja in Pali for you. All right. So hopefully you were reading along with that. Now, the first part of this is a very interesting one and this will reappear at the end of the sutra as well. Kurango to Masasana before Buddhist teachings was thus it was also it shall be. Itchi aasi iti bhavisthi. All that was just the testament of hyeise. Iti hiitihang. All of that just fostered speculation. Takka wadanam. I found no delight in it. So Hemaka here, you know, I mean, Hemaka has come from a Brahmanical background where, you know, studying under one of the great sages of the time. And he has no doubt devoted a large amount of his life to studying the Vedas, probably studying Upanishads, listening and studying to, I don't know, probably a lot of traditions that have been lost and we don't know anything about. And yet he says before he until he came to Buddhism that everything was just hyeise. Thus it was itchi aasi iti bhavisthi. So it shall be. Now, so this is a really important perspective to notice. It's a perspective that is echoed a number of times in the suttas that we find Brahmins discussing their own tradition and having a variety of sometimes critical views about their own tradition. And it's not just in the suttas that we find that because we find similar discussions in the Brahmanical literature itself. And so we find expressions of skepticism of questioning and of doubting within that tradition as well. So it's really important to bear in mind that when we speak of a tradition, whether Buddhist tradition or other traditions, that we're not talking about a monolithic block of people who just uncritically accept everything that's within the tradition. I mean, clearly, Hamacher found something worthwhile, you know, perhaps the lifestyle, perhaps his companionship, perhaps the support for meditation. But there was something at a root level which was really dissatisfying about what he had encountered within his own tradition. And of course, this that that sense of missing and that sense of longing for some meaning is, of course, we find that all around us today. I'm guessing probably most of you have been through something like that. Certainly, that was the case for me, that when, you know, you come to Buddhism and start reading Dhamma, practicing Dhamma and so on, that you'd begin to, for the first time, realize, oh, this is something that's talking about experience. It's not just a theory, it's not just a speculation. It's actually about the reality of how I'm living my life. And it's given me a capacity to be able to live better and become a better person. So these that that spirit of inquiry and that spirit of questioning and disillusionment with where you come from and that feeling of recognition almost like coming home to Buddhism. This is something that will find recurs in the prāyānāvāgā, especially in the last chapter. So this one isn't actually really quite a question. But the Buddha here, it's kind of an implied question. So how do you destroy craving? The removal of desire and lust for what is seen, heard, thought or cognized here, diptā, sutta, mutta, vinyaka. And once again, we find that similar list we saw in the last set of poems. You may have noticed when I was reciting it that this particular line is hypermetrical. So they're usually eight syllables. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. So twelve syllables as opposed to the normal eight syllables. So I'm not quite sure what's going on there. Perhaps. Yeah, I won't speculate too much, but just to notice that that particular line is hypermetical. It sounds a bit clumsy when you're reciting it. Young viditva sato charang taraylo ke visatikang idhadi tasutta mutta vinyatesu piroopesu hermaka. So it's noticeably quite longer and different rhythm. OK, for today. So today, another interesting question. An interesting question here. Subtle one. In whom sensual pleasures do not dwell, said Venerable Todaya, and for whom there is no craving and who has crossed over doubts of what kind is their liberation. Right. OK, so the Buddha is talking about all of these things which are like the qualities of an enlightened sage. Right. So they've got they've got all their attachments and they're not having more craving. They're crossed over their doubts, all of these things. That's fine. But then what is that freedom? What is that straighter freedom that you're talking about? What do you actually realize as a result of that? The Buddha's response in whom sensual pleasures do not dwell, will hide the Buddha, and for whom there is no craving and who has crossed over doubts. Their liberation is none other than this. Imoko Tasa Nāparo. So this is a slightly tricky translation. Another possible reading would be their liberation is one from which there is no return. But I don't think that's what the sense is there. The point that the Buddha is making here is that there's not like another thing, which is the liberation. It's the freedom from those things that is itself a liberation. So, again, to contrast with other metaphysical or religious systems where you might say, well, I will become free of my worldly attachments and then I will achieve union with Brahma. And so for Buddhism, it's that we become free of those attachments. And it's the state of what we call nirvana is not like a separate state that you go to when you're free of attachments. Nirvana is simply a word that we use to describe that state of freedom from attachments. Are they free of hope or are they still in need of hope? Do they possess wisdom or are they still forming wisdom? Osaki and elucidate the sage to me so that I may understand or see it. It's a Manta Chaku. So here today, again, not quite clear about the notion of the sages. Are they still growing? Are they still learning things? This comes back to the point that I made a little bit earlier about the nature of a realized one. That there is this kind of conception that there is, I guess, an end of the road, that there is a state of perfection and a state of freedom. Normally, of course, we think as human beings that to still be have hope, to still be looking to the future, to still be longing for better things. Is part of our nature as humanity. And it seems hard to imagine what it would be like if you were like, actually, no, I'm not longing for better things. This is fine. Just as it is. And a similar thing with learning knowledge. So the Panya Kapi again, Panya Kapi is slightly difficult word to translate here. I think I've got a footnote. Yeah, so anyway, you can read the little footnote that I've got there. So Kapi, I'm taking it in terms of Kapi, the idea of forming, creating or making. So are they somebody who is in the process of forming wisdom? Are they growing or do they already have it? And again, it seems almost a bit kind of arrogant, doesn't it? I mean, normally we think that humanity to be humble that we always should be in a state of growing. And of course, normally that's true, right? We should always be wanting to learn and wanting to grow. So it doesn't mean that in life and person can't learn anything. Obviously, they can still learn things. But in terms of what matters for their spiritual freedom, they're not sort of growing or evolving spiritually in that way. They've already reached that state of freedom. Or at least this is the question. So the answer, the Buddha's answer, they are free of hope. They're not in need of hope. And so this idea that hope as something which is bound to the future contains within it the seeds of fear. If we are hoping for a better future, then we are dissatisfied with our present and we are afraid of a worse future. Whereas somebody who is truly freed, they're content now and they'll also be content in the future. They possess wisdom. They are not still forming wisdom. That today is how to understand a sage who has nothing unattached to sense your life. So here the Buddha is making a strong claim for his notion of what a sage is. Questions of the student, Kapa. So I should think I mentioned before, but each of these is called the manava, which are the Kapa manava, which are the questions of Kapa and Kapa and manava is a word meaning a student or Brahmanical student. Literally, it means a follower of Manu. So many of you have probably heard of Manu, the mythological first man in Hindu or Brahmanical mythology. So manava is like a follower of Manu. All right. Now Kapa's questions are less philosophical, more existential for those overwhelmed by old age and death. Adventable Kapa stuck midstream as the terrifying flood arises. Tell me an island, good sir. Explain to me an island so that this may not occur again. For those overwhelmed by old age and death, replied the Buddha, stuck midstream as the terrifying flood arises. I shall tell you an island, Kapa. Having nothing, taking nothing, this is the isle of no return. I call it extinguishment, the ending of old age and death. Those who have fully understood this, mindful, are extinguished in this very life. They don't fall under Mara's sway, nor are they his lackeys. All right. So this is quite a famous one. The imagery of the flood and overcoming the flood is an often quoted verse. It's not a comforting image. It's particularly spoken in India where flooding is quite a regular occurrence, certainly in the Ganges Valley it is because of the runoff from the snow melt from the Himalayas. But we regularly find stories of travelers getting caught in floods. So an island or refuge so that this may not occur again. Nāparāṇṣita asiya. One of the characteristics of the Buddha's teachings and the way the Buddha responds to people is that he doesn't minimize or dismiss their fears and experiences. And sometimes when we're put in this kind of situation, our compassionate response might be to think, oh, we need to comfort somebody. We need to say, oh, they're there. It's OK. It's not really that bad. You'll be all right. I'm sure everything will be OK. And so we give these kind of comforting words when somebody expresses a state of terror, depression, anxiety, fear and all of these overwhelming emotions which people have. And so one of the problems there is that when we give people sort of generic words of comfort in those circumstances, we're not really hearing what they're talking about. In a sense, we're implying, well, you're going through a bit of emotion now and just just calm down and everything will be OK. And obviously, there are plenty of occasions when that's a perfectly fine, valid way to do it. But when the Buddha is responding here, you notice that he's not minimizing Kapa's experience. Kapa is clearly expressing this existential fear. This existential fear reminds me of the Ata Dandasutta in the Ata Kavaga, where the Buddha speaks in a similar way of his own experience of existential fear and terror before he went forth. And one of the things that drove him to go forth. So this idea that we're surrounded by a world which is shifting and where there's no stability and looking for something that we can find some stability on. Now, while the Buddha affirms and shows Kapa that he is listening to him and taking him seriously rather than dismissing him, he also, he's not, the Buddha is not like the Buddha is not how to put this, the Buddha is not extreme about this, like he could have said to him, yeah, it's overwhelmed by all age and death. Everything is impermanent. Deal with it. Right. This is another he could have gone to that approach of being like overly harsh. Right. Yeah, that's just how the world is. Everyone's going to die. Get used to it. And sometimes, you know, it's tempting to speak in that way as well. But the Buddha doesn't. He says, yes, I shall tell you an island. You are right. Yeah, this is terrifying. And all of these things that are happening genuinely are scary. And and I shall also tell you an island. Very, very psychologically skillful approach. What is that island? That place of solidity. Right. That's an island, right? Dry land, something solid. Having nothing, taking nothing. This is the Isle of No Return. I don't know about you, but it doesn't sound all that solid. So the Buddha is offering him this island. But when he defines the island, he defines it purely in terms of negatives. I call it extinguishment. Nibbanang itinang brumi, the ending of old age and death. So, again, the Buddha's rhetorical style here, always when he's speaking about nibbana. Right. If you want to if you want the most simple and powerful key to understanding how the Buddha spoke about nibbana in the suttas, I'll give it to you. The Buddha spoke about when the Buddha spoke about nibbana, it was always psychologically positive and ontologically negative. It's psychologically positive and ontologically negative. It's an island in the stream. It is blissful. It is the place, a state of peace. It is a state of freedom and all of these very attractive things that's going to make you feel like you want it. But then when you try to say what it is ontologically, well, it's nothing, taking nothing. It's not born. It's not aging. It's not dead. And so this is always these negatives about what nibbana actually is. So nibbana is psychologically positive and ontologically negative. Those who have fully understood this mindful are extinguished in this very life. They don't fall under Mara's sway, nor are they his lackeys. And again, just a sort of passing note, I guess. But it's always interesting that how often mindfulness is mentioned throughout these verses and throughout the suttas always. I mean, of course, there are plenty of other virtues and so on which are mentioned as well. But, you know, that simple practice of mindfulness that we all try to do, right? And we all try to practice mindfulness. We know what it is. As we're sitting here, I hope we are being mindful of our posture, being mindful, trying to be present, being mindful of our mood. And that simple practice of mindfulness, again, here, the Buddha is saying is characteristic of somebody who's freed from old age and death. OK, so. OK, so I've got a few comments here. Thanks, everybody. Korokok says seems to go in the nature direction of the nature of liberation. That is very true. Eileen says having nothing, taking nothing seems to advise us to let go of possessions as we age. Yes, definitely. And so those words are, you know, they do have that dual meaning. They definitely mean like having no possessions as well as letting go of attachments. Yeah. And yeah, as we get older, it's easy to accumulate stuff. But that's more and more important to be able to let go of things as well. So Josh says is extinguishment the go to translation of choice for nirvana and insight into this choice? Yes. Well, that's how I translate it. There are obviously a number of different translations. Exinguishments are pretty literal translation. I usually use extinguishment, although I sometimes waiver with quenching and I use that occasionally. That's K.R. Norman's translation. So these are both fairly literal translation. Main metaphorical basis for the idea of nirvana, of course, is the going out of the flame. We saw that last week with the questions of all perceiver. And so many times that idea of nibhuta being the going out in the extinguishment of the flame. So in just sort of a note on translations in my translation project, I decided to try to translate every single word into English rather than leaving technical terms and so on in Pali. And one of the reasons for that is because words have meanings that are not like Pali words have meanings that are not necessarily the same today as they were then. So even like a word nibhana is such a pregnant term. You can leave that word in there. Everyone knows you're talking about nirvana, but what everyone understands nibhana to be, of course, can be very different things. Another good example of that is the word bodhisattva. And if you Google bodhisattva, it will tell you the meaning of bodhisattva is somebody who delays their own enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings. Whereas in the suttas, the bodhisattva is specifically somebody who goes home, goes forth from home in order to seek their own enlightenment. And so it's actually quite a different kind of meaning. So this is why I always try to translate everything rather than leave it in the Pali. Eric asks, is the psychologically positive only applicable to nibhana with residue? I wasn't really meaning that nibhana itself is psychologically positive. There's more talking about the way that it's talked about. So it's talked about in a way that's attractive, right, that makes you think, oh, that sounds good, draws you in. So the Buddha has this kind of way of drawing you in and then pulling the rug out from when you're there. Right. Oh, yes, that sounds good. It's blissful and it's safe and it's happy. Oh, there's nothing there. Whoop. And then you're OK. So that's more. It's more. It's more talking about the manner in which the Buddha discussed nibhana. Mike mentions that the assembly is a little confusing. He would have thought nibhana was the far shore and an island would be just a temporary resting place. Of course, that comment by Mike having far more poignancy, given the fact that he's writing from New Zealand and. Yeah, look, sure. I mean, it's just a simile, but, you know, the Buddha is just responding to that, that particular thing. But generally speaking, an island is is is used in the suttas as a place of safety at the deep end. Having nothing wonder of having nothing, taking nothing speaks to the culture he's addressing. Yeah, I'm sure it does. And I mean, remember that that a kinchena, the same word was used in the introduction of. Bhaavari, right. So his teacher was described as being a Brahman who had nothing. And so through the whole thing, it has actually those different meanings, having no possession, also the meditation on nothingness. And he also of nibhana as well. So clearly it was an important word, an important idea for these particular Brahmins. OK, so let's go ahead and we'll read one more set of questions before we wrap up for today. OK, so this is the questions of Jatukani. Hearing of the hero with no desire for sensual pleasures, said Venerable Jatukani. Who has crossed over the flood. I've come with a question for that desire this one. Tell me the state of peace. Oh, natural visionary. Tell me this blessed one as it really is. Bit of a comment here. The exact sense of the unique term sahaja neta is open to interpretation. Surely Norman's omniscient one following the day. So it's not right. So the term here is the sahaja neta. Saha neta meaning one who sees like a net being an eye. Saha jaa is an interesting term. Saha meaning together. Jaa meaning literally born. So sahaja jaa meaning born together. So the visionary one born together. But sahaja is also used in the sense of being something which is nature or natural. So I've translated as natural visionary. And you know that but it's but that that idea of nature as being sahaja is also I think quite a nice idea. So it's the idea that nature is something where everything is born together. Everything arises and is dependent on. OK, so I'll just finish up with this one that I'm doing. And here we go. Sound OK. Great. Saha jaa neta. OK, good. All right. So it's the natural visionary that sahaja neta. For having master sensual desires, the blessed one proceeds as the blazing sun shines on the earth. May you of vast wisdom explain the teaching to me of little wisdom so that I may understand the giving up of rebirth and old age here. I love these this verse here. I love the humility of it. Remember that these are these are these are accomplished great sages who've been practicing learning, studying and meditating for so many years. And this is the attitude that he brings. He's a Buddhist. I've come to the Buddha. May you. And he's not he's not being like excessive about it or anything like that. Just saying, you know, I've finally found somebody who understands. Please tell me so that I can understand the sensual desire to spell. Set reply to seeing renunciation as sanctuary. Don't be taking up or putting down anything at all. OK, so just a few comments on this line. Nekamandattu kamatho is a line we see a few times in the suttas. A bit of an unusual line linguistically. Dattu is to see kamatho is as sanctuaries and ablative form here. Now the word kamma is usually translated as safety or security. But kamma is actually not dissimilar to the deeper as the island. It's actually a place of safety and refuge. And originally was probably the oasis which was reached at the end of a day's journey by the Indo-European wanderers. So kamma is a place where the animals and the people will live in harmony. Where there is water, where there is food, where there is plenty. And so kamma has this very beautiful connotations of safety and ease and sanctuary. Don't be taking up or putting down anything at all. Now this idiom of taking up or putting down ughitam nirahadwa is extremely reminiscent of the atakavaka. And it's one of the most characteristic forms which we find throughout the atakavaka in slightly different ways. One of the things that I learned in my translation of the atakavaka was that we have to be very careful about how we're phrasing these past participle forms. And if we translate them with I think excessive grammatical literalness we would say nothing has been taken up or put down. Which seems a bit weird right because we know what is always saying well we should we should put things down, we should let go of things. But in fact in all these cases we can see this by looking at the variety of uses of similar idioms through the atakavaka. That these are past participles that used in the present perfect sense. So what they mean is that we are not engaged in that process of having of taking things up and putting things down. And so an arahant is somebody who has already put everything down so they no longer might go in and take things up or put things down. So this is an idiom which took me a long time to get my head around actually. And it was always something for me when I had read previous translations of these verses that had always been a bit puzzling to me. And so it took me quite a while to actually figure out what was going on. What came before let wither away we saw sehi and after let there be nothing mahu kinchena and again this idea of kinchena right? There could be nothing a kinchena. If you don't grasp it in the middle you will live at peace. So we already saw in one of the previous sets of questions this idea of the two ends and the middle. And here we find the same idea in a slightly different form. And in this particular case it seems that the one extreme is the past and other extreme is the future. And the middle presumably is the present. And if you recall in the previous case when we looked at that series of questions of the past, the one extreme, the other extreme and the middle, that this was actually one of the interpretations that was offered to them even though it wasn't the actual interpretation in that context, it wasn't the intended meaning in that context, but it was still one possible interpretation. But here it's more specifically that this is what's being made. One read of greed Brahman, the whole realm of name and form has no defilements by which they might fall under the sway of death. Asavasana vidhyanti yehi makchua sanktihi. So again notice the use of the term name and form, namarupa. Many of you will be familiar with the concept of namarupa as I've spoken about Buddhism, but I think it's really important to bear in mind that it is in fact a Brahmanical term. And we'll find it a number of times through the next few years. And in this kind of case, I wouldn't look to, I wouldn't sort of insist on a particular technical understanding of what my name and form is. In this particular case, really what it means is just that whole world of phenomenal reality, everything that we know and see and experience and think of and name and this whole kind of world of appearances that we're surrounded by. So approaching in the end, I'll just see if there's one more question here from Josh. Let me say the names of any of the questions be translated or they kind of like American names, not really having much apparent meaning. I wonder if the term where internet connection was lost, that's the sahajat nethi, alludes to understanding relationship with seeing objects aside from contact. Yeah, I'm not sure. Like I said, it's a bit difficult to nail that one down, although I mean, the interesting thing is that it was spoken to the Buddha and the high Brahman. So it does suggest that perhaps was one of those very many terms and epithets was used in the culture. I have to say, if the theme of taking up or putting nothing down speaks to the theme of no tingness or that you're talking about the meditation on it, I think it can do, although in these cases, it's more talking about nirvana. But just to come back to the point about the names. It's actually quite common in Pali that names will have a cup. It will be more of a kind of epithet than they are really in English. So the names have that kind of they retain more of the sense of the meaning of them. And in a number of cases, it's quite common in Pali that names are given, which are clearly kind of backformed as an epithet from the story that they're attached to. And a good example of this is the various Bharatvajas, which we find in the suttas, the Bharatvaja being a common Brahmanical name. And it seems to be used as a kind of a generic term for Brahmins and then attached to the kind of thing that we find doing. So for example, if you have a Brahman who's yelling abuse, then they're called Akosaka Bharatvaja, the abusive Bharatvaja. If they're doing a fire ceremony, then they are Agika Bharatvaja, the Bharatvaja doing a fire ceremony. So a lot of the times, there is that tendency to use these kind of epithets where we find names. But also, obviously, not all the time. And you know the Buddha's name, Gautama, means dark cow. But I don't think anybody was thinking of dark cows when they use the word Gautama. Thank you. Well, we've managed to make it through another lesson. And we're doing pretty well on the apocalypse a meter right now, like in Australia, there's no floods, no fires, mild pandemic situation. So not too bad. Hopefully, that will remain similar for the next week. Hopefully, the world won't completely come to an end before we can have our next class. I mean, look, if the world's going to come to an end, we might as well study Dharma and practice Dharma. Right. I mean, what else is it? So I hope that you all stay well. And I hope that you all find something of usefulness and some wisdom, some joy to find the Buddha's teachings. And I wish you all the best and good luck to sing with you. Thanks for watching.
