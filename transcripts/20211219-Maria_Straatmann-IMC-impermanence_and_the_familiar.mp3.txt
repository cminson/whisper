The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, so Gil was unable to make it this morning and that's kind of a lovely
thing for me. As I said earlier, I haven't been here in a couple of years and
that's unusual. It's an unusual circumstance. Even driving here this
morning, I thought how familiar it all was. How familiar and how much it has
been absent. The absence of what was once so familiar. I have an electric
car and it saves addresses and IMC is saved and defaults every every time I
get in the car it defaults to coming to IMC. And so for two years I've been
putting up with what has become an irritation. And this morning it was
true. Whoa. And sitting up here is familiar. Although I haven't set cross-legged
since I fell the 1st of September, so I'm experiencing unusual hip movement. So
that's just how it is. You know, we come into this day and this is
how it is. And that's what I'd like to talk with you about this morning. I want
to talk about impermanence and the familiar and how they intersect and
when they don't. And what this means for us in our practice. So while the
teaching of the Dharma has not changed over the last two years, the context, the
context for talking about the Dharma has changed a great deal. I've noticed a lot
of changes in my own personal practice. I do online groups, practice
discussion groups, which have never tried, I really invite you to try. They're
quite wonderful. And each time I meet with a group it is a realization that
these people are showing up in this moment with these issues, with these
conditions. And that each time is unique. Each breath is unique. There is a
patina of the familiar sitting in this hall. You know, that's sort of the
coating that goes over surfaces, the patina. This statue has a particular
patina over the bronze that keeps it this color. And the familiar life that
we live does the same thing. We don't often think about how the familiar
becomes a condition for this moment. We talk about it in different ways. You
know, we cultivate skillful practices so that it becomes a habit for us. But it
turns out that largely we humans have kind of a plan for how the day is going
to go. I'm not talking about the agenda plan. I'm talking about what we expect to
happen in the next moment or the next hours or the next days or the next
weeks. We expect things to be a certain way because we become accustomed to
thinking about things that way. We become accustomed that this is how
life works and this is when it feels right. Now sometimes there has to do
with our ideals, how we'd like things to be. But it's the basic assumptions that
we have about how things are, the assumptions we have about how things
are without noticing how they are that becomes the trap for us. We have a plan.
I call it an experience bias. My experience leads me to believe. What I
think about that experience leads me to believe. And so, of course, this is what
it's like to sit in a hall. Let me tell you how different this is. Never have I
given a Dharma talk in a mask. Not only do I hear my voice and feel my hands and
now I'm feeling the breath inside this mask and I, it feels a little muffled and
my voice sounds a little muffled and generally it's the same but it is not
the same. It is according to the conditions of this moment. We have an idea
about what should be happening and then, you know, life happens and we have
strategies, right? So this morning it's not as noticeable here but where I live
up by 280, it's extremely foggy, very dense fog and there was a
bicyclist that pulled in front of me. I was going up Sand Hill toward 280 and
there's a place where the bicyclists have to cross the line of traffic going to
San Francisco to get in the bike lane to continue out Sand Hill and it was so, so
thick. I just barely saw him and I saw the fear in his eyes. You know, I blinked my
lights to let him know I had seen him as he was crossing that line of traffic but
I imagined how frightening that could be and how fortunate it was that I was
actually looking for a bicyclist because I'm familiar with the area and
therefore I saw him and that that moment of uncertainty and the my
preparedness for a bicyclist made it more likely I would see him but it wasn't
a given. And one of the things that's been on my mind, particularly this morning,
was from the talk that Gil gave last week where he was talking about time and he
made a statement that has really stuck with me and he said hurrying is an
attachment. Going fast is not and that we can behave in a certain way but when
we are attached to some outcome of that behaving a certain way that's when we
create suffering. When we're attached to what is normal that creates suffering.
This folks where we are sitting now, wherever you are sitting, is normal.
Everything else is a fantasy. It may not be what we want, what we hope for, what
we dream about. My family right now is in London. To me that's terrifying. What are
they doing going to London? They're all multiply vaccinated and you know they
haven't seen their in-laws the other side of the family for three years and
they're old and they want to see them. I get it. Normal for me is worrying about
my family in the context of the pandemic. That is normal. If I treat it as an
imposition, I'm denying this is how it is. This is how it is. Sometimes we embrace
it, you know, the unexpected, then not according to plan. I would put winning
lottery winnings in this category. You know, how great, how lucky can you be? This
is wonderful. Sometimes we marvel. You know, I get to be a grandmother without
ever having children of my own because I married someone who had children. How
great, how lucky for me. So I get the delight of that. I embrace that. The
unexpected can have pleasant outcomes or unpleasant outcomes. They just are. The
things that happen in life, the experiences we have are just those experiences.
And somehow we have this idea that we should be able to control the nature of
those experiences, which is denying the fact that there are very few conditions
that are conditioning this moment that we actually have any influence on, much
less control over. Now we can we can name things like the pandemic or the weather
or taxes. But the very air we breathe, we don't have control over it. What we have
some measure of influence on are the ways that we approach this moment, the
attitude with which I meet this moment. We tend to think of our experiences not
in increments, but as a continuing stream. You know, my life happened. It's these
things happened and they led to those things and led to those things and led
to those things and led to this moment. And we have this idea that life is this
stream. And we don't really think of it as packets of experience. And it's this
continuing stream bias that we have that leads us to think that the familiar is
what is right, that the familiar is somehow something we can navigate. But
we're really creating the familiar in our minds. We're creating the familiar in
our minds. There are two things that I read a lot of besides Dharma things. And
those are neuroscience and the pandemic. And I'm that's a former scientist. I
spend a lot of time reading the scientific papers. And neuroscience is
doing amazing things these days. And our assumptions about how the brain works,
how the mind works, are mostly obsolete. So I was reading a book by Lisa Barrett.
And I just took this line out of it. It says, every thought, memory, emotion or
perception that you construct in your life includes something about the state
of your body. Wow. The book is about how in fact we don't think about our emotions
and react to our emotions, but that the thinking is just justifying the emotions
that are already there. The emotions we actually construct by information from
our bodies. And sort of absorbing what that means lands us right in the middle
of our Buddhist practice. It implores us to be aware of what's happening now
because that's what's creating, constructing our emotions. And that the
habits of mind that we have are the ways in which we react to what's happening.
But the brain is busy just gathering data and sometimes makes decisions without
the data, the current data. It's based on what's happened in the past. These
conditions are there and therefore this is what is required. But it doesn't know
about these conditions. We can be aware of these conditions.
Resistance to what we think of as normal. Resistance to now is not being normal.
Resistance to normal are all still resistance. If I get in a slump because
things just aren't as lively as they used to be. They aren't as, oh, I don't get to
travel as much. I walked in the hall. I saw friends. I wanted to hug. I
couldn't hug them. What's that about? Well, that's the condition of now.
Why in order to feel affection in my heart do I need a more familiar way of
engaging people? I can ignore the rising of affection in my heart and dampen it
by what I am missing, or I can just feel the delight. And those choices have to do
with how I relate to what is familiar. I invite you to become well aware of what
you constitute, how you influence and condition your life, your body, by what
is familiar. Which is not to say that familiar is bad. It is a great joy to me
that I can sit this way on this dais in meditation pose and I haven't
tried it for a couple of months and look at that. It's not only possible. It's
very possible. Oh, I can be delighted at that. Or I can think about all those
missed opportunities, which didn't exist. Didn't exist. When there are too many
deviations from what we think is familiar, from what is familiar to us, we begin
to build up a set of resistances, resentments. We feel a sense of betrayal.
It's very common to hear someone say, well, you know, they promised us this
would be over by now. Well, based on the information that was available then,
that's what it looked like. Okay, that's not how it is. How do I meet that? I
can have the thought of betrayal, of not fair, not fair, just feels not fair. Oh,
what's that about? I'm not feeling something not, oh, I'm not getting what I
expected. Fairness doesn't have anything to do with it really. If I if I notice
that thought, I don't banish the thought, I say, what's where do I feel that not
fairness? What's what's not fair? And I feel the wanting, the leaning towards
something else. I can feel that is in being mindful of this notion and saying
what else is in this notion? What else is here that allows me to keep from
putting something in a box I label familiar and say, oh my god, I'm so
depressed. If we're truly in touch with impermanence, with the arising and
passing away of all things, we recognize that we have to disentangle from this
idea that everything is this continuous stream with a well-known past and a
projected future. Life appears to be a stream just as we appear to be a
continuous person. Even though even the cells of our body are sloughed off every
couple of months, they're totally different. But, you know, the overall
pattern, the overall familiar part is, well, that hasn't changed, has it? It
appears not to change. Because we have this continuing stream, this continuing
stream of what we think experience is, and we link all our experience
together and we give the meaning. What you notice when you contemplate this is
it's all about how we think about experience. What we think about what's
happening now, what we think about, it's all of those thoughts rearranging the
experience into a pattern. I'm taking all these clumps and I'm making it look
like this, and it is the collage of my life. But if we can become disenchanted
with our own story, we have the opportunity to just meet these experiences,
these experiences of this moment, with fresh eyes. When we follow our breath,
we're not thinking about how the breath was yesterday, we're really just
following our breath. That practice of nowness, of suchness, is not just for
breathing. It's about the experiences of our lives. If we can disentangle ourselves
from the story of my life, then it becomes possible to more closely see what
is arising in this moment. What's arising in this moment as distinct from our
experiences of the familiar. This happens in unexpected ways, this
attachment to the familiar. I've lived with my husband for over 30
years, maybe 35 years, I've stopped counting, and he has some habits that
irritate me, as I do from his point of view. This is not a one-way street, but
one of the things he does is he has a much higher tolerance for clutter than I
do. That clutter pervades. He has his own office space, which I do not enter,
because I will immediately start picking things up, which of course he finds very
irritating. But the shared spaces I bump into often. And while we have grown to
accommodate each other over the years, I can see when the conditions are right,
when I am maybe in a hurry, that his clutter, notice that's his clutter,
clutter left by him, not picked up by me, becomes especially irritating. And I
notice that irritation and that jitteriness. And then I remind myself
that it isn't about him. It's not even about me. It's about attachment to an
outcome that that clutter is getting in the way of. But because it has become so
familiar, it becomes very easy to blame him for my attachment to some outcome.
And sometimes I even notice that happening, right? I'll go, okay, this is not
about him. Not about him. This is you wanting something. And that allows me to
be consistent with one of my intentions in life, which is to be kind to my
husband. And in the moment that I realize this is not about him, I become aware of
that intention also. And my heart softens. That happens. It isn't about me saying,
I'm not going to behave that way. It's about a series of realizations that
happens in the now. Okay, irritability. Irritability? Not him. I can feel
irritability in my in my body. He's not in my body. This is in me. This
irritation. Irritation. Irritation. It's not that my knee hurts. It's irritation
because I'm rushing, rushing. Oh, I have a plan. I have something I want to do.
Realizing that in a moment, it isn't that I'm a bad person. It's that I see
attachment to some outcome. And that pause, the pause created by that seeing
allows me to recall my intention of kindness. And the heart softens. I don't
order my heart to soften. That would be a useless instruction. It happens in the
course of seeing clearly. This is the real value of mindfulness and the
acceptance of impermanence and not allowing the pattern to become the
defining characteristic of now. I'm influenced by the pattern. I'm subject to
the pattern. But if I see the pattern,
other possibilities exist. I'm remembering a time when when I told my
mother-in-law who is no longer with us, that my next house, our next house, was
going to be more Zen like. And she said, and who will you be married to? She
then apologized for not bringing him up correctly. This is all a sense of patterns
and how we think things should be. How we think about our experience becomes a
condition of the experience. So it becomes very important to notice how we're
thinking about what's happening. To be aware of how the mind is imposing some
thought pattern on the experience. And to get it as closely as possible to the
rawness of that experience. And not stop with the first word we come up with to
say, oh this is what this is.
What is closest to us? Try to get as close in that mindfulness as possible.
What else is here? What else is here?
I'm restless. I'm jittery. Well jitteriness is here. If I don't identify with
the jitteriness, with the restlessness, I have an opportunity to see what else is
present. I don't have to jump in the vat of restlessness. I can see discomfort.
Maybe I don't have to name discomfort. Maybe I don't have to give it a familiar
name. Maybe I can just say unpleasant.
I could argue that the smell of a ripe treat cheese can be unpleasant and it
can also taste delicious.
And any moment that we experience unpleasantness, we can look at the
unpleasantness and the very act of seeing, oh this is unpleasant, allows us to
slip back and settle into a place of seeing that is a moment of ease and
equanimity. Maybe it's just the briefest of moments, but notice it. It is in the
noticing the awareness of what's happening that we become, that we form
memories and that we form other patterns. We give the brain other information
that it adds to this store of information when it's making up its vision of
what familiar is. And we can become familiar with the aha. In the same way
when we're meditating and we notice that the mind has gone off into a story and
we say, oh that's the very moment when we are here. The very moment and we can
say, oh I'm here. And this becomes a practice for any moment. Any moment when
we are aware enough to say I am here is a moment of being awake, a moment of
just thisness, of just this experience. It's not that we arrive at this place by
some magical absorption of qualities or, you know, some practice that makes us
all of a sudden aware of every moment. It's just this moment. This moment is the
only moment that we can actually be responsible for. And I can allow myself
to wander off into some place or I can notice my hand drifting off into the
air. And in the noticing, there is a form of awareness here that is a
registering. When we talk about mindfulness, we remember that there is the
object. There is the knowing the object. And there is knowing we know that last
step, that awareness step is crucial in coming close to what is happening in
this moment. Now I can say I'm sitting here, but unless I'm actually feeling
and noticing my bottom on this cushion, I'm not really aware of sitting. I know
it, but I don't know that I know it. I don't know what's behind me. Okay, that's
not going to work for me. So Gil gave me some advice last night and he said you
should have the YouTube running so you can keep track of chat, you know, what
people are saying, which is good, but then I don't have a computer, I have an
iPad and it doesn't work the same way. I'm unsuccessful at doing that. So for
anybody who has a chat item that they want me to notice, I'm just not, I'm not
up on it, so that's not going to happen. That's the moment. Okay, that's
not going to happen. I can be moaned that or I can just say that's not going to
happen. It's just this. It's just this impermanence is the arising and passing
away of all things. And when we think about impermanence, we mostly think
about the passing away. We think about the loss, we think about what's missing,
we think about the deterioration, you know, my hip is giving me trouble because
frankly, I'm old and I have arthritis and I fall and you know, stuff happens. And
as time goes on, I can become overly aware of aging or I can just say, well,
now those are things I do and those are things I don't do. Last night, my husband
and I went looking for something on a trail that he had lost and it was going
to be a long trip around to get to this place and the, it was past dusk. So it was
really kind of foolish for us to be looking anyway, but we were good. So there
was a steep rise up to the path right where we were. So I scrambled up and
then slid back down because I didn't have scrambling shoes on and then I did it
again. And we made it, not gracefully, not elegantly, but we made it. Okay, that's
how that went. When I left the house, I didn't plan to do any scrambling up the
side of a steep path. Okay, we did not find what we looked for, but it felt
pretty good just to do that. So if, if we're focused on the only, only successful
outcome was that, we would have missed the full moon that we got to see on the
path over the balans. And that's the thing about mindfulness. It doesn't have
to be what you choose to be mindful of. It's really the, the blessing of
mindfulness is in the unexpected. It is in the arising part of arising and
falling. This is the primary thing that I have been exploring for myself over the
last few months, that impermanence is not about loss and going away any more
than it is about what is arising. What is arising? If it doesn't arrive, it
doesn't, we don't lose it in the first place. It doesn't go away in the first
place. This emphasis on what is arising brings me more closely into the moment
and more close and more intimate with what my experience really is. So I've
adopted an infant emphasis on arising. What is arising? And I don't rush to name
it. I notice something about it and say, so what else? I got dressed this
morning and I was trying to decide what to wear and I don't know what
the note on the web says something about it might be cold because of the
high airflow and there's these new airflow things and you know my
temperature management is not as good as it used to be and how can I get warm
and anyway I got dressed and as I was sitting down to breakfast with my husband
I said you know these clothes actually feel nice. I just got to realize this
feels the fabric feels nice. What a delight came out of nowhere. It isn't
like we're constantly searching this, this, this, this, this. I'm going to be
aware of everything in my life. I'm going to be awake about everything in my
life. It's just being open to the possibility of discovery. Open to the
possibility. Mindful of the suchness of the moment. Reminding myself it's like
this. How is this? Damned unpleasant. Well, that's an attitude. Where's that
coming from? Attitude, attitude, attitude, breath. It's still unpleasant but I have
already a fresher approach to it just by taking the breath. It is in the
cultivating of the not knowing. It is the cultivating of not relying on the
familiar. Not becoming attached to the familiar.
When we sit in meditation and we're following our breath everybody has kind
of a different strategy around following their breath and what feels
familiar. And over the years that I've been practicing my approach to following
the breath periodically changes because it's no longer because it begins to
feel like it's a rhythm and it's too familiar and I'm not actually in the
moment because it's just so familiar. So yeah, the breath, breath, breath,
breath, breath, breath, breath, breath, breath. And so I choose something about the
breath that is current. One of my favorites is to notice the null spot
between the in-breath and the out-breath. That null spot is not about the air at
all. That null spot is when the muscles have changed the direction of the air
flow. A breath, you know, a breath is sort of a construct. It's a concept that we
have around breath. What we're really following is the movement of air as a
result of the body's muscles opening and closing orifices. The air that we breathe
in is absorbed into the body and some other air is what's expelled. And so this
moment in between where nothing is happening is kind of an interesting
place to be aware of. It's not a thing. It's just a marker, but it's a mental
marker for me. And it is just a noticing of the stopping of the air flow. And of
course the air flow is still happening. It's going into the blood. It's coming out
of the blood. We don't control that. The body just does that automatically. And
even if we don't have the feeling of a bolus of air moving one direction or
another, they're still leaking. Well, air in, air out. You notice this very
specifically, excuse me, hold on a second. You notice this very explicitly if
you've ever been with someone who's dying. And we have this notion that
somebody takes their last breath. Sometimes that last breath is an in-breath.
It's a stopping. That helps me to follow the breath. I'm gonna do another clear
here. That allows me, when I'm sitting in meditation, to be aware of the nowness
of the air moving. It's just air moving. And focusing on the movement of air is
getting at that very thing that is happening now. It is being intimate with
my body. Intimate with this moment. That's the intimacy that we want to
cultivate with all of the experiences of our lives. That's what it means to be
alive. It isn't about all of the constructs we have about how we would like to be or
what we'd like to leave behind or what we think of our children's or our lovers
or what we think about anything. It is noticing when I think about my lover
that my heart lifts. It doesn't mean something different than that. So that my
life becomes the home of being here. One of the big intentions in my life has
been to be open-hearted. I spend a lot of time thinking about what that would
look like, what would be necessary, how do I cultivate that. It begins with be
open. It isn't about what I become or how I get to some place. Be open. Whoa, that
brings up all kinds of thinking about stuff. How open do I want to be with
strangers? How open do I want to be with people in my immediate family? What
does it mean? How do I experience being open? Not what does it mean? How do I
experience being unguarded? What is arising in this moment? What is arising?
It doesn't have to be a world that is about how I need to be. It can be a
world about how am I in this moment. Not who do I wish I was. Not how do I become
a better person. But how aware am I at this moment of what is arising? And if it
is unfamiliar, how do I relate to the fact that it's unfamiliar? Do I want to
know? Do I say, oh great, unfamiliar. I get so excited. I notice excitement. In the
noticing, we become less driven by the familiar and more in the place of these
conditions. And if I notice, if I put my attention, for example, right now on my
hip, I can say, oh you know there's pain there. It kind of hurts. And I can try to
do something about the pain. I can go into the pain. I can think about the
plane. I can manage the pain. Or I can say, yes the pain is here. And this is
happening. There are all these people in this room with me. How amazing. I'm not
throwing away the awareness of the pain. I'm just shifting my attention from the
sharp edge around the corner. And I'm aware of also this, also this, and this. It
becomes a life of and and not a life of either or. So I invite you to notice the
influence of the familiar on what you think is right. To notice that if for
you, the familiar is boring and restricting and closing down, that you
notice that and don't blame it on the familiar. Don't be led around by the
familiar. Become intimate with your mindfulness. Notice the rawness of your
experience. Try not to shield yourself by putting something in a box that
misleads you. Allow yourself to notice this. Whether it's pleasant or
unpleasant, it has the virtue of being closer to seeing clearly. And in seeing
clearly, we do not choose to suffer. It gives us room when we are feeling full
of ill will and discomfort to notice a softening that's possible by a deep
breath. Not as a prescription to fix ill will, but to say and this is here. And
with my awareness on this is also here. My mind heart is less focused on the ill
will, unhappy, unpleasant things of life. And I am also aware of the possibility
for delight and ease and equanimity. And these are what I wish for you. May you
know the joy of intimacy with the moment, of the arising part of impermanence, so
that joy can be a part of your life in the most dire of circumstances. And you
no longer rely on what you'd like to be true. You become disentangled from what
you would like to be true to be open to the possibilities of delight in this
moment. Thank you very much. So I am open to questions. If you would like, if
anyone here has questions, I'm not sure how our timing goes this morning. Martha,
can you give me a hint here? Okay. Does anybody have something they'd like to
say? I'm afraid I went on the whole period. Yes. We need a microphone. Yes. I'm
often find myself to be afflicted or a victim of misconception. When I look at
something or I notice something, I seem to expect that something to be what my
mind creates. And very often it's wrong. Can you explain that perhaps? Okay. So I
apologize, but things are a little muffled, so I'm not sure I got it. But so you're
aware that the mind creates a description of what has happened. And you want to
know how that works? Well, I'd like to know how do I not to be victim of that
misconception that I create in my mind about something that's out there that I
perhaps is not even remotely similar to what I create. Right, right, right, right.
So how do we become aware of the possibility of delusion or misconception
or getting trapped by whatever the mental process is? And that happens.
That's something that arises. And what I found useful is to say, okay, I get it.
And what else? And the what else is here question often allows me to see things a
little more clearly in a way that doesn't condemn the previous conclusion, but
allows me to see a kind of evolution of that what the thinking is. And usually
that works best by asking myself that conclusion I've come to. How do I feel
that in my body? Where do I feel that? And that very act of saying where do I
feel that? I'll notice my shoulders are up or my jaw is clenched or my belly is
tight. And that noticing something in my physical body reminds me that there are
many things that have that effect of my belly clenching or my jaw clenching. And
when I notice the jaw clenching, it gives me the opportunity to recall,
mindfulness. Sati also means recalling. To recall, oh, that's not the only thing
that causes my jaw to clench. It's focusing on the body gets us out of the
head, which is busy constructing these scenarios and impressions, and moves me
into a place of possibility. Because once you focus on the body, the body
changes. And as soon as you say, well, my shoulders are hunched, immediately they'll
go down. It's an automatic response. The body wants to go, oh, no. And that very
act has shifted something. And so it's a process so much that is not so much of
condemning the mind, but saying, yeah, that's true, maybe. And what else? And it's
in that being open to what else that we become not so trapped by the decisions
that the mind makes. Does that help? It's just a process of not condemning or
criticizing. But what else? Thank you. Okay, anybody else back in the corner? Thank
you. How do we think about things, conditions that are true, that also
involve loved ones who are suffering, and how, or loved ones who are in
trouble, and how that suffering or troubleness affects others in the family?
Yeah. There are no families that are free of that issue. We, including mine. And
sometimes it becomes very difficult to not want to fix everything because the
heart is moved by pain, both of the person who is troubled and the people
that that person affects. And so what my practice, I don't give it as a
prescription, but my practice has been to realize that an aspect of equanimity
practice, which is, despite what I may wish for you, things are as they are. May
I see things just as they are? May I meet the arising and passing of all things
with equanimity and balance? And it reminds me that the most important thing
is to not allow ill will to grow in my heart, because it is only when my heart
mind is peaceful that I am able to skillfully navigate that space. And being
present for someone that I wholeheartedly disapprove of the behavior does not
mean that I cannot be with them with an open heart, and I wonder, what is the
pain that they are experiencing that is driving this? Being aware of my own pain
and watching it allows me to realize that this is coming not because the person
is an evil person, but because the pain is very extreme in them. And it allows me
to be beside them, not in them or supporting them, but to be beside them
and look outward, and that being present for them can have amazing results. Not
trying to convince them or change their behavior, not condoning or welcoming the
behavior. I don't accept the behavior on myself as a burden, but I feel it passing
through. I'm sorry I can't do any better than that at the moment. Thank you all.
May you all have a wonderful holiday season.
