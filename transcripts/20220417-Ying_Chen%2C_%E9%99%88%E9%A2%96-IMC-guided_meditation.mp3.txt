 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. Good to be with you on this Sunday. We will do a meditation, offer some light guidance for us to begin, and then followed by a silent sit together. We will enjoy each other's company, and practicing together. Arriving. Arriving. Arriving here and now. Taking a few generous moments to arrive. Not rushing through this arriving process. Coming to your meditation questions. Cheers. Maybe just take a few moments to allow your feet to really settle on the ground. Maybe the body still needs to move. Riding with the movements of arriving. Arriving. Arriving. When you're ready, allow the contact of the body with wherever you're sitting to be in the forefront of your awareness. Noticing that you have arrived here. Maybe you have arrived now. Rolling and sensing into the contact of the body with the floor and the earth underneath of you. Surrounded. What's the felt sense of grounded here and now? This body with this breath. Maybe the bubbly energy that you came with settles down ever so slightly. Maybe the movements of the breath become more visible. What's the felt sense of grounded here and now? Let yourself savor in the sense of groundedness centered from this grounded place. Open the awareness to receive whatever is present right here and right now. Movements of the breath. Sensations in the body. Wavy emotions. Lingering thoughts. Nothing excluded. Nothing. Being with the ever changing experiences. If the breath is prominent. Resting. Grounding in the movements of the breath. Being with the breath. Nothing to do. Nowhere to go. Just to hear with the movements of the breath. Strong sensations in the body arise. No problem. Open the space of awareness to be with the sensations in the body. Just as they are. We're learning to be. To be with what is here. Whatever is here. We're learning to be with. We're learning to be with you. We're learning to be with you. We're learning to be with you. We're learning to be with you. We're learning to be with you. We're learning to be with you.
