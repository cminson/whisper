 It's nice and hot isn't it? The amount of pyramine we're building up, who wants to meditate on a day like this? It's one of the toughest, the toughest who endure. It's actually quite good, the heat has advantages, it makes you more relaxed, and a bit more as we say in Thai, sabai sabai, sabai chai means everything is okay kind of attitude. And it's not such a bad thing because our tendency is always to think that things are not okay. We keep finding energy through repeating to ourselves, our subconsciously, we're not okay. This is not okay, I'm not okay, the weather is not okay, the room is not okay. Whatever, you know, the criticism is often what fuels our desire to move and act. Guilt and criticism. Many people suffer from that. And it's an unfortunate situation because we don't have to make ourselves, we don't have to, we don't have to be motivated by these mental states. And yet, it's really habitual isn't it? It's so habitual. So it feels so true as well, there's a kind of element of somehow, it feels so real that to generate guilt, remorse, to feel that life is not okay, and I'm not okay, is a means of progress. And it's true, I mean that realization that things are not satisfactory and things are not, they're not in harmony, but that realization in itself is maybe a moment of awakening, a moment of seeing clearly the nature of life, because most of life is really not in a state of, it's not stable, most of life is, in fact all of life is unstable. You never know what's going to come around the corner, you never know what's going to happen. We never know how people are going to respond to us, and yet we try to make life so predictable always. We spend a lot of energy just trying to make things predictable, not realizing that in that desire to have things predictable, there is also an element of death. It's a kind of an element of, a kind of a deadening element, because to make things predictable you have to control them, and control itself is not, you know, control itself unfortunately often come from our own will power, come from the sense of self, it doesn't come from wisdom. There is, you could say that that which controls our mind at some level is a restraint that comes from seeing clearly insight, insight into the danger of a mind that is completely, that is unruly, and just following its own desires, its own biases, its own delusion. So when we look at the mind in practice like in a way we have done today, what we find is, from what people have told me over the many years now, is often an entity there who keeps hanging on to the past, keeps hanging on to all the things that went wrong 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 1 year ago, 6 months ago, 6 days ago, that kind of clinging to the past, because the past is much more predictable than the future. Even though it's still, we only remember half of the stories, it's more predictable to hang on to the past and to let go and go into the unknown of the future. So this is why we get attached to our past history. As we walk along and continue to practice, most of you who have done this for some years realize that by now I'm sure that we're not here to get out of our predicament, we're not here to move out of our human condition. Even though maybe at the beginning you thought, oh if I practice long enough, maybe one day I'll be really happy forever and ever. I will kind of, oh my problem will be completely eradicated, oh my relationship will just be wonderful and I'll be always feeling super good, on top of the world, in control, and everybody will love me. I will love everybody. I'm sure by now we've woken up from the dream of reality, the dream of imagining what the practice is about. And there are various levels of practice, you know. Each one of us have complex entities. Sometimes our meditation goes very well. We remind, get concentrated, or is at peace, and we can deal with the difficulties that come up. We can handle the obstacles of the mind, you know, whether we are in, we can see clearly the changing nature of thoughts, and we can observe how the mind lets go and so on. And then at other times when we feel stuck and nothing seems to be working, we translate often wrongly those moments. We turn the moments when things go wrong, our life is in a mess, our relationships keep breaking up, you know. We lose our job, our partner just slams the door and says goodbye. Our children are creating havoc in our lives, hate their mother, they hate their father. You know, we hate our mother and our father, or we hate our teacher, or, you know, we get disappointed and we feel really, we're the best center in the world, and they become just another boring perception in our mind. You know, we, we, we at that moment identify immediately with those experiences often, don't we, as if having encountered a difficulty was not supposed to happen somehow. Yeah, the Buddha talks about karma, doesn't he? He says the reason why he is because of karma, of past actions, we have created, you know, we are in this body, in the human realm, and he points to the fact that this life is very precious, that being born as a human being is as rare as a turtle navigating on the ocean, as rare as the possibility of a turtle passing her neck through a little rubber ring that will be floating on the water of an ocean, on the water of an ocean. It's as rare to be born as a human being as the possibility of this turtle getting her neck through the ring, rubber ring, that would float on the ocean. So, obviously we've done something good to be here, otherwise we wouldn't be around practicing dharma. You know, we wouldn't be able to even hear the dharma. We'll be out there killing, hating, and stealing, and lying, and so on. You know, we will not be able to be sit still and listen to the dharma and be patient with ourselves, be able to endure the heat, be able to endure the restlessness of the body, the mental states that make our life miserable and so on, just to be able to be present with that. So, we assume at some level that human life is supposed to be easy, happy forever. We don't think we assume, do we? We don't actually think like that consciously. But the amount of disappointment that we get in life is a sure way of knowing how much we expect from it. If you look at the amount of disappointment you've had in your life, you can see they are proportional to the amount of expectation you had about your life. And so, at some level we can stay and get stuck, just feeling disappointed, miffed, or we can move on and start realizing that life is like a flow, like a river, and there's all sorts of things that we can encounter in this river. You know, boulders and waterfalls and drops and all sorts of maybe even dangerous fishes and creatures and so on. So, in meditation we have to be very careful. We have to be very careful. We have to be very careful. We have to be very careful. We have to be very careful. We have to be very careful. We have to be very careful. We have to be very careful. So, in meditation we have to be very honest with ourselves. We can't hide anymore. We can still hide from people, but we can't actually hide from ourselves. It's not possible to practice and hide at the same time, even though we still have the habit of trying to avoid looking bad, trying to avoid looking silly or looking somehow. We're frightened to disappoint people. We want to please. We want to be charming. We're very frightened to not play the role that this society is asking us to play, to drop the mask that we are asked to wear all the time. We fall prey. We are attached to looking good and frightened of its opposite. Unless you bring a clear understanding and mindfulness to the mechanisms of the mind that keeps moving from one to the other, you will not be able to free yourself. It's very simple. Because we can have as much conceit trying to think that we are inferior as trying to think we are superior. In the Buddhist teaching there is a very nice explanation of the way conceit works, the sense of self, conceit, that which you conceive as yourself. The Buddha says, whether you think you're superior, equal or inferior, it's all conceit. It's all a way of conceiving a sense of self. That was a great relief when I read this years ago. Because when you think you're superior and you can judge this, you think, oh, this is bad, I'm thinking I'm better than they are. So you try to make yourself inferior, but that doesn't seem to work either because you don't feel comfortable there, doesn't seem to be a very good thing. And feeling equal is actually the hardest one. We find it impossible to experience equality between each other. The mind, it's not that you personally have difficulty in doing that, it's just the way the mind is conditioned. We always want to put somebody up or somebody down. Have you ever noticed that? We can't put anybody on the same level because there's no one there. So when we create a sense of self, it's always up or down. And sometimes we can get mistaken and say, oh, we're all the same, but we're all equal. I see this with some of the women I've encountered in my life. They think they've practiced, so they think they're as good as none, or they all know what we know. It's like, yeah, I know what your experience is, I know exactly what it is, I've lived in community myself. So they're trying to make us all equal. Another form of conceit, unfortunately. So where does that leave us? It doesn't leave much room to cling, does it? You think right now, you know how many people you know, and where do you put them? The box up or the box down? But there's not many people on the same level with you. The desire of the mind to cling to some image that is better than us or to be empowering ourselves through clinging to an image of someone being lower than us or worse than us is very strong, very strong mechanism of conditioned mind. For women, for example, many women feel disempowered or lower than men, and societies keep reinforcing that quite a lot. And then the men who don't even feel particularly more powerful than the women have to pump up the kind of muscle that makes them feel more powerful somehow, better. Because that's what society wants them to be. And so as women, for example, we often feel inferior, and we need a man or somebody else who is going to raise us up. We're still at that level where we need somebody else to make us feel elevated. We're still instead of... So this is a conceit that's projected out, you know? We don't cling to the superior person in oneself. We create ourself inferior, and then we cling to somebody else out there who is superior to us, and we identify with that person. That's what we do a lot with teachers and student relationships. They know, I don't know. It's true at some level. People may have more experience than you. But to reflect back and see that, yes, even though people have more knowledge, more experience, more understanding, more practice and so on, you know? And maybe that example in teacher-student relationship might not be the best one, but just look into your life, how many times in your relationship you tend to... You tend to either raise somebody up or create somebody lower than you. Not as good, not as cultured, not as knowledgeable. So that way that conceit, the capacity to conceive oneself as being a certain way, needs to be seen, needs to be really... Painted through, you know? You need to see through that. Otherwise we are kind of at the mercy of the mind that think like that. The conceit. Sometimes we think conceit as somehow a mental state or a state of being which I create, which we create ourselves, but we don't. If we ask any one of us, none of us would want to be conceited. And yet the conceit arise through clinging to the self, to this entity, this kind of amalgam, amalgam? Amalgam. Amalgam, you know, of thoughts, emotions, memory, perception, which we solidify and create as a self. Often the self is compared to a yarn of wool that's been totally entangled, yarn of wool. And then through meditation we start disentangling this tangled yarn of wool. Start disentangling little by little. So when I told you this morning that the mood of the day was not just being mindful and being aware and putting a lot of energy, but also to relax deeply and to be kind and have developed compassion towards yourself during the day when things are difficult. Why is that? Because compassion and relaxation allows a space for the thread to be disentangled. You know, you've seen when you want to disentangle something and you go too fast or you're too much in a hurry, then things just kind of get tightened up. If you look at the example of a yarn of wool, everything gets tangled up. I've experienced that many times with many different things, you know, I mean, just even externally. Disentangling, disentangling under threads or cords that get, you don't even know how they can get entangled the way they do, just extraordinary. You know, the shadows or the, you know, those blinds that you go up and down and you find the cord just completely entangled. How did that happen? You didn't even do anything. And so to disentangle that you need to go very gently and have very much time to do that and you have to look at where the thread is going through, which way and how it's kind of all stuck together. And it's a good image for the mind itself, you know, because our mind gets entangled all the time. And that sense of self, which is not an unhealthy thing, if we don't cling to it, we just use it as a convention rather than ultimate reality. You know, we need that as a Buddha says, even though there is the unborn, uncreated, unoriginated, unformed and so on. Still, when I look at Louis, he is not just an empty space for me or for everyone else. He's a man. He's the hair like this, t-shirt like that. And when I refer to Louis, I call him Louis. I just don't call him Shunyata. You know, when I talk to Jill, I relate to Jill. She's American. She's not French. She's from San Jose. She's not from, I don't know, Moscow. So you relate to people on a conventional level. But what we do, instead of a conventional reality, for many of us, become an ultimate one. It's like, if the conventional reality doesn't work, it's like, oh my God, I'm lost, you know. I've lost it all. So when you lose a job, or when you don't get the marks that you're supposed to get, you know, often we get, some people kill themselves. They haven't realized that there's more to it than despair. And more to life than just get completely desperate, selfish, greedy and miserable. Even though, of course, you could say, well, if a man or woman who have four or five children lose their job, I mean, they have really the right to feel desperate. Sure. Of course they do. But another level, if there is no, somebody is not practicing with that, then they will feel even more desperate and even more lost and even more, you know. But just knowing, you know, that there's time for failure and the time for success, the time for disasters and the time for good fortune, the time for breaking up relationship and the time for bringing them together, the time for being sick and the time for being healthy, it's like, you know, you know, this Chinese story, it's a story of a Chinese story that I think I found in the story of the heart, story of the spirit from Jack Conefield and Kristina Feldman. There was a story which really illustrates, in many ways, I don't know if I remember all the details, but it illustrates the way, you know, the wisdom we can develop in life. It's a story of a man, he's a farmer in China, and his son is called to go to war. Then just before that, so people say, oh, what a terrible thing, you only have one son. You know, how are you going to cope with that? And the son get an accident or sort of, you know, get hurt, and then he doesn't go to war. And I don't know if, do you know the story? You know, you know enough of that story to know that it's a good for us, it's a good example to remember that. That when we've done the pit, that might be actually the beginning of light, you know. And it's often the case. So one, let's say, one miserable situation actually turned out to be a very favorable one. You know, one situation that seemed like a complete disaster and a complete failure turned out when you look back 20 years later or 10 years later to have been perhaps the best thing that happened to you. You know. But don't we forget that so often. I try to remember that, you know. But like you, I forget too, again and again. Because the power of wanting things to be a certain way and to feel somehow that, you know, that if you lived correctly and if you lived well and if you did write the right thing, somehow life should never fail you. You know. Life should never give you this kind of situation where you feel that, what did I do wrong to get this? So karma, you know, when we look at the law of karma, you know, we may not be able to find out why we are here, but the Buddha says it's a very special thing. It's very unique to be able to be born as a human being. Because as a human being, as maybe you've heard many times, we have a good balance between dukkha and sukha, between happiness and suffering. And so because of that, then we get really miserable because we cling to happiness and we try to push away unhappiness or misery. And that creates enough of a friction for us to want to wake up to that. Without that friction, we'll be asleep, you know. It's like those heavenly realm, in the tusita heaven or the, you know, or the tavatimsa heaven, you know. They're just happy for eons of time. They never wake up, you know. So it's not such a good deal when you think of it. Imagine yourself with, you know, going through this blissful state of jhanas, you know, and just staying there for eons of time. And not getting liberated. Wow. That would be fun, wouldn't it? Just getting stuck in a kind of blissful state forever and ever. I don't think we could because we'd rather get stuck into the hell realm forever and ever. This is more familiar somehow. Isn't it true? You know, how many people, you know, people talk to me today, but I've heard this again and again. And I've seen it in myself, you know, that if we've done something wrong in the past, let's be really have a wretched time ourselves. The more miserable we'll be, the better, you know. So we can really pay off our debts about karma. This is the Buddha says this is damn stupid, you know. This is really silly. You don't pay off bad karma by perpetuating suffering, you know. You pay off bad karma by just bearing with it when it comes up. Whatever result of your karma has been from the past, whatever result from past karma you have to experience now, just allowing to come up and releasing it, it's, you know, is enough. That's enough of suffering, don't you think? You have to sit on the cushion on the zafu several hours remembering the conversation you had with your mother 20 years ago and how she mistreated you or your boyfriend or your girlfriends. How a myth do you wear? And encourage on 20 years later still remembering that moment where you smacked her. And she kicked you. You know, when your mother told you what a terrible girl you were, and still be influenced by that nowadays. Don't you think that's enough or pay off? I mean, do we have to make more with or? We stay, we laugh but we're not convinced of it, are we? We still do it all the time unconsciously. Still making our self, somehow recreating that sense of being a bad girl, being a bad man, being terrible, being nasty. Somehow because we just looked somebody in the face, you know, it was a nasty feeling in the heart. So we have very high expectations about our self. And the only way to free our self from karma is to begin right here, right now where you are. Because that's where karma is piling up. You've got a whole trash can there, sitting on this trash can. And you might as well let it go, you know. In a trash can only it feels better when it gets empty, doesn't it? And you can start feeling it as well. And not feeling up again. But the only thing that really fills up the trash can and emptying it is a sense of self still, you know. Because you only fill the trash can because you still believe in your own self who is in control and somehow should be good, should never fail you, should be on top of the world, successful and not make you suffer. So karma, as you know, the word karma means to do. It comes from the word root ka, you know, and karonti, and I'm not a paddy expert, you know, but I've learned a bit of paddy. But the root itself means, you know, to do. So it's not a fatalistic kind of notions of you have to really pay all the, you know, sort of pay for all the terrible things you've done. You can actually even lighten up your karma by starting living your life skillfully. You can lighten up. You know, even the time of the Buddha, you think he got off without karma after his enlightenment. Some of you may remember, 45 years he lived, 45 years he taught, thousands of people, 10,000 of people. He still had karma, you know. His body became old. He had to rest and lie down in the afternoon like all of us feel like doing sometimes. You know, sometimes he will not teach. His back hurts and you will be sitting against a pillar and lie down and rest. Then people try to throw boulders over his head and try to kill him. And he only got a little scratched toes. But if he hadn't been a Buddha, it would have been squashed, reduced to a little pool of something or other. You know, people try to kill him. People try to accuse. Women try, one woman try to accuse of him having made her pregnant. And you know what he said to her? It was wonderful, wonderful response when she came to, she was really under the spell of a group of ascetics who were trying to, you know, trying to destroy the Buddha's reputation. And so she made herself, as she was pregnant, she put stuff under her belly, under her dress. And she went to the Buddha and said that he made her pregnant. And he looked at her and he said, well, sister, only you and me will know that, can know that. Isn't it a wonderful response? Not frightened. He said, only you and me will know that. Whether I make you pregnant or not. He wasn't frightened. And he knew, you know, he knew the truth. He didn't have to defend himself in other words, you know. He said, you know whether I made you pregnant and I know whether I made you pregnant. That was all he said. He didn't defend himself. He didn't try to prove something or another thing. He didn't try to justify anything. He just said, only you and me can know that. So the Buddha had karma, you know, his cousin, his cousin, his very cousin tried to, you know, try to destroy him, wanted to take over his order. Monks were a pain in the neck, you know, they were always trying to give him such a hard time by proving that all that he had established was just nonsense. That they could do so much better by having sex, eating three times a day, leaving the way they liked. They could do very well too. They did not need all these ascetic practices and this path of restraint, you know. He tried to prove to the Buddha that his cousin, Devadatta, tried to force the Buddha to establish vegetarism as a norm and the Buddha said, no, he didn't want to enforce vegetarism because monks and nuns of the Buddha were arm's mendicants. They were dependent on the generosity of other people. So forcing vegetarism would mean that only some people would be able to offer food to the monks and nuns. So it wasn't that he was against the killing of animals, but out of compassion for the donors, he wanted everyone to be able to offer food so he never forbade meat, for example, or animal products. Only in certain circumstances could you refuse to meet, for example, when an animal had been killed, especially for you. Certain meat, like elephants' meat, snakes' meat, and two or three different kinds of animals as well that you could refuse. So he had karma. He had also to bear with the result of past action, not from even his own life, but from past lives. And the teachings are filled with those stories of people having to bear in this life what happened in past lives. So he became much less personal at some level. You realize that there was a much broader space and expenses to your life than just what happened to you when you were a child. Even though, sure, one's childhood will definitely influence the way we will live as an adult later on, but still there are more to these lives than we can see, we can imagine. So I find that helpful to remember that there has been past lives, there will be future lives. There has been past lives because in a way, I never thought of this as being very helpful for many years or just even interested in that at all. But having listened to a number of the teachings of his Holiness of Dalai Lama when I was for 10 days in Dharamsala in 1960, listening to him teaching for 10 days, the old day, and when he said, I don't know if it was on that occasion, but he said, it's actually quite nice to think of several lifetimes, especially for Westerners, because we're so much in a hurry, and always wanting to reach the goal as quickly as we can so we can get there first. You know, we can be the first one to get there. Actually, thinking of those several lifetimes, we start relaxing a little bit, and give ourselves a little bit of the space we need to disentangle that yarn of wool we call the karma of our personal karma. Of course, the danger, it can make us lazy as well. It's like, you see, oh, I can do that next lifetime. Like the diet that all of us did as young women, we're all what we'll start tomorrow. We want all to get slim and thin and looking good, but how hard it is, you say, well, I'll start tomorrow. So, this is when reflecting on the danger of unskilful karma becomes important and gives really an incentive and a sense of urgency to our life. When we realize that just even a small, just the way we think can affect our life so deeply, so profoundly, even though nobody sees it, no one can see what, you know, unless people are mind reading, which happens a lot in the East, but here, I don't think people have to bog down with their own thinking, I think, to even start reading anybody's mind. But most of us are, you know, we can't think all day long, the most stupid thought, because nobody is actually watching. We're much more conscious of our actions, aren't we? We will never do what we think because we will be so embarrassed. So, that's why the Vinaya, the discipline, is actually only dealing with action by body and speech, not with action by, you know, through the mind. So, you can think anything, really, and that is taken care of by your meditation practice. But the Vinaya, or the discipline, the monastic discipline, the precept that we commit ourselves to, they're really to restrain our actions and our speech. You know, the five precepts, for example, to refrain from killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, and taking drugs and intoxicants that dulls the mind. These are addressing our actions, you know, drinking, sexual activity, or even just sensual indulgence. It's not just sexual, it's just the way we use our energy through any of the senses, the indulgence, sensual indulgence. And to refrain from stealing, to refrain from killing, this also, you know, we may want to kill somebody, we may want to kill, but the precept is here to help you to not act on it. We may want to steal, and the precept will help you to refrain from stealing, from taking that which is not given. We may want to maybe have sexual intercourse with someone, you know, who is maybe married or maybe is in partnership with somebody else. The precept reminds you to not act on that, you know, to refrain from unskillful actions. And talking, the precept on speech, you know, to refrain from lying, gossiping, backbiting, slandering, and so on. So those precepts remind you of not following unskillful habit by speech and unskillful actions by body. Yet, you know, the karma, as I was saying yesterday about this man who in his office in New York, with a Thai consul, I think, has this, if I remember correctly, this little line saying there's nothing more powerful than karma. And it's true. Even the Buddha in one of his suttas says that if we knew, if we knew the power of one acts, one small act of generosity, if we knew the power of that, we will never go, we will never go, we'll never go without sharing what we have. We will never let a day pass without sharing something, you know, if we knew the power of generosity. The magnitude of generosity, a simple act of generosity. So you see, we don't see very clearly the way things work. You know, none of us, I don't, you know. I get more sense for it because through my own experience, you know, I get more of an understanding. You know, all the power of one moment of anger. In the Tibetan tradition, I remember many years ago, they would say one moment of anger, you destroy all your skillful karma, all your, that's very powerful, isn't it? But in terms of practice in our tradition, we work, let's say, we emphasize more, you know, the actually, how we can handle that anger without, of course, you know, destroying any hope of, so any hope of ever coming out of this unskillful karma, you know. So the anger, for example, in this practice, you know, just to be able to, you know, we might not be able, we can't get rid of the anger, we can't get rid of it, we can't, so we spend a lot of time judging it, criticizing it, sitting on it, forgetting it, distracting ourself from it, and so on. Spend a lot of energy trying to ignore it, suppress it. And yet, you know, if there was not a strong sense of self-identification to this anger, it could just arise and pass away. And because of the precepts, you have a strong commitment to restraint, you know, the restraint, not acting on unskillful things. So, you know, the way we deal with anger is not very clever, not very wise, because instead of releasing it, we tend to suppress it, judge it, criticizing it, and through this way of dealing with it, we enforce the sense of self associated with anger. Any thinking that you do around, you know, any thinking which has not a nature of contemplation, you know, a nature of reflecting on something, you know, from the heart, of really intending to learn from your anger. You know, thinking about it, keep recreating a sense of self, and that's karma. So, even though we think we're doing the right thing by obsessing ourself with the thought of how bad we are for being so angry, and how terrible we are, recreating a sense of self which is inferior, remember? I'm a bad person. And then we get fat up at some point, and when we start being superior by actually projecting it on somebody else, they're wrong. I've got the right to be angry. My anger is justified. I'm supposed to be angry. This is good, because if I'm not angry, they'll never change. So we become, we get into the superior conceit. And the equal will be, well, she's angry, I'm going to be angry too. Tit for tat kind of thing, you know. She's not going to get away with that. If she made me angry, no way he or she is going to get away. I'm going to make sure they get what I get. So we're both angry. So this is quite a, you know, you can see how entangled it is in ourself, how the tangle is not just a nice image or some kind of poetic metaphor. An expression of the mind as a kind of some sort of sweet image. It's very, very real. We're very entangled in that sense of self, which is always trying to prove that it's superior, inferior or equal. We're still that entity that is, that tightens up everything. So the Buddha didn't say that he should kind of walk around as if he were an empty box, you know, with a name Sunyata on it. No self. It says there is a conventional self and there is also, ultimately there is not a self. But there is a conventional self. So, you know, in his time there was many ascetics or groups of people, philosophers or metaphysicists or who were advocating all sorts of theory about the nature of self and no self and so on. But the Buddha says there are two levels of reality. And we need to incorporate both in our life. We can't just be on a transcendent no self, walking around, going to work and telling your boss, you know, that suddenly the whole corporate world is turned into anicha dukkha nata and this actually doesn't exist anymore in your mind. That's not how you're going to get paid at the end of the month. You need to relate to both levels. So the sense of self is not a bad thing. You know, to remind yourself I'm Mary and I'm, let's say, a doctor. I'm supposed to be here treating my patients, you know, and to cling maybe to attach to the fact that you remember you're Mary. That's not a bad thing. If you don't, probably in our society, you call loonies crazy. You don't remember who you are, what you're supposed to be doing. So there is a level, you know, which we need to attend very carefully. I'm a Buddhist nun. There's something I'm supposed to be doing. I represent something. I resisted it for years. I didn't want to represent anything. I wanted to be me, me, me, me. Free. Do what I want. I don't want to represent Buddhism. Yet, you know, as you mature, you realize that, yes, that's what you have committed yourself to, you know, respect of your commitment. You live in accordance to what is appropriate with that particular identification, or not identification, but as a particular way of life. I have chosen. And so many of you will be mother or grandmother, or you'll be working in this situation or that situation, as a therapist, as an artist, as a painter, as a lawyer, as a doctor, or whatever, or as a teacher. You have still to relate to the conventional world with wisdom. Don't walk around thinking you're just an empty shell that has realized the ultimate, the unborn, the unoriginated, because you had a few moments of peace. Even the few moments of peace, it's not the end of the, you know, as I've told you many times, it's not the end of the journey. The end of the journey is really having penetrated through all the obstacles, all the attachments that we have in this life, which come in many disguises. And conceit is perhaps what disguises it most, thinking that we know, or thinking that we have accumulated things, thinking that we are somehow better than others. There's a very strong conceit in all of us, which you don't even realize until you move out of your situation. Like when I went to Thailand for two and a half years, I realized the conceit of the Western mind. It was very clear how we believe totally that this world we live in is a real world and the only world. And whether we are American or French or English, we look at the Asian world or the underdeveloped countries world, you know, from our perspective, but they look from their own perspective, it's very different, their world. But we assume that our world view is the only one. So when they suffer out there in a certain way, you don't even notice it, but when they look like, you know, they look as, you know, you totally, when you project onto them the way you would feel if you were there in their place and you think, oh, this is terrible suffering. But where they are, they actually don't suffer at all. They're fine. And sometimes they suffer because you can't actually perceive, you know, you can't conceive or perceive what they are going through, then you don't even notice their suffering. For example, when I was in Asia and, you know, people that have always, always told me that they were so fed up with Indian people or Asian people who used to tell them every time they asked for a direction, they will always be told, yes, I know where it is. And they always ended up lost. They had no idea where they were taken. And they got so annoyed with the, with those people thinking how stupid they are, you know, they tell me they know where to go, and they don't have a clue, and they get, they get me lost. They don't have any idea where to go. Well, when I was in Asia, it's really interesting when I understood that somebody told me in Thailand, you know, that the first polite thing I did was to say, the first thing you'd say is you always say yes. So the first is good karma, yes. For them point of view, you never refuse anybody, anything, you know. So the first thing you say, yes, I know where it is. It doesn't mean they know where it is. They just say, I'm willing to take you wherever you want to go. And then of course they don't know where to go because they have no sense of direction in the way we have, you know, that they know maps, they have, you know, some of them living in their villages for years, the whole life. So when you say where is Udartani, you know, Ubon Rajatani or something, you know, they have no idea where is the next village. They don't even, they can't count in miles or anything like that, you know, they have no idea. They don't even go out of their village most of the time, you know. And so we assume that they should know the maps in the way we do know the maps, you know, with all our anxiety about how many miles we're going to walk in. But that's not even a problem for them. They can walk for days and not mind, not sleep for nights, several nights. They don't mind. They don't count in terms of, you know, how many hours do I sleep and, you know, when they have faith, when they are uplifted, you know, when you go to Sri Lanka or India or Thailand, you know, they can't sleep. Thailand, you know, they can do the most amazing things, you know, that we will never think of doing. So you can see the difference, you know, it made me aware of how much we assume that other people think like us and should think like us as well. Not only that they do, but they should. And if they don't, there's something wrong with them. When I was younger, my father used to say, you know, yes, we're very good at helping underdeveloped countries. We bring them toilets, bathroom, as if they needed bathroom. You know, they've got a hole with nature to go and pee and poo. But, you know, instead of food, maybe we'll just bring them good bathroom. So, you know, that's, you know, I'm not going to be very long. We're going to stop in a minute. But that sense of conceit is really strong. And the karma of that conceit is that we, you know, we feel very separated from the rest of the world because we assume that our world is right. You know, the sense of self, if I want to give you, it's not a secret really, but it's something that I have discovered over many years of practice. And it wasn't, it's, you know, it was, it's been very, very, very clear to me that whenever you feel isolated, alienated, separated, you can be sure, if you want to know what the sense of self is, that's it. That's exactly what the sense of self is emotionally. Isolated, separated, alienated. It's quite sweet really. It separates us, you know. It took me a while. It would come up, you know, just like a, like a breeze suddenly. It would come up and then suddenly I felt isolated, alienated, separated. I said, what's going on here? And what was happening? I was just in my little world for a minute, you know. It was just even, it wasn't even like a great sense of self around there. There was just suddenly that condition was going through, going through consciousness, you know. Suddenly there was a desire. You know what the sense of self is? It's I want or I don't want, you know. And I'm describing this with no judgment. It's not like the sense of self is bad. I want is bad. I don't want is bad. It's not, the teaching doesn't explain, doesn't explain the practice like that. It doesn't say the self is bad. Or no self is good. Or I want is bad. I don't want it. It's not that. That's why the Buddha's teaching, the core of his teaching is a form of truth. It said, look at the pain it creates. Does it create pain? No, I'm fine. Okay, fine. You don't need to practice. Does it create pain? Yes. Okay. And now instead of being a victim of your sense of self, you can just start incorporating, you know, and the pain itself can become a catalyst for transformation, for releasing the knots of that tango, yarn of wool. It's releasing every time you breathe through the suffering without moving away from it without wanting it to go away without wanting another. Every time you start this entangle this entangling a bit more than knots of your mind. And so look at, you know, our greatest obstacle is not so much what the wrong thing we do, or the stupid things that we do. Our greatest obstacle is to think that we are in charge of our karma. So because we think we are in control, then we also suffer because we can't actually control anything. This is our greatest, you know, our greatest sort of tragedy is that we think we are in charge. Karma is in charge. Not us. Karma, you know, the law of karma is just following its course. And we're just channeling it all that, you know, we just have to become just a recipient of it and let it pass through. But it's not always obvious, you know, when we are really confronting a difficult situation or painful encounter with someone, you know, you don't think of that as just, you know, karma resolving itself. You think, God, you know, I blew it again, or, you know, he blew it again, or she blew it, you know, she, you know, I've made a mess of that again. That's why we have the container of practice in the presets so that we can continue to be more like a channel through which all this past action can get, can come to the point of resolution and be finally put down. Let go of. So, I review all these words. And if there are any questions, we have a few minutes for questions.
