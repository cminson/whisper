Dharmette: No Distractions

One principle  in the kind of meditation we 
practice here at IMC is that there is no such 
thing as a distraction. Often w hen people try to 
meditate, they will try to focus on the breath, try 
to be calm, and try t o be in the present moment. 
But they will have trouble doing that because the 
mind will start thinking about something or 
imagining something. Or they will get pulled 
away by their feelings , or by strong  sensations in 
the body. T he common response to that kind of 
experience is to think that this is taking me away 
from the meditation. This is a distraction. If only I 
weren’t thinking so much, if only I weren’t upset, 
if only my knee weren’t hurting, then I could 
meditate. Then I could get calm and focused.  
 
But the approach to meditation that we do here 
is to try not to have that kind of attitude . We say 
that there are no distractions. Whatever is 
happening in meditation that makes it diffic ult to 
meditate  – that becomes the meditation. That is what we pay attention to. What we are trying to 
do in mindfulness meditation is to be mindful of 
what is  happening, not to get rid of anything , or 
to make something special happen, but rather to 
be pre sent for what is happening.  
 
I will give you an analogy. Many years ago I was 
teaching a retreat in the Santa Cruz Mounta ins. 
Running down next to the meditation center  was 
a little  creek with shallow, clear water. If you 
looked int o the water, you could n ot see if the 
water was flowing.  But if you took a stick and  put 
it vertically into t he water, a little wake would 
form at the edge of the stick because of the 
current. Then  you could see that the water was 
moving.  
 
So when we try in meditation to focus on the 
breath, it is kind of like putting a stick into the 
river of your life. It is hard to know the currents 
of your life. It is hard to know well what is really 
going on. Sometimes y ou might kind of know 
what you ar e thinking about; but it is hard to 
know really well what is going on, what feelings 
are operating, what concerns are operating.  
 
But if you have the reference point of the breath , 
rather than thinking that being distracted is a problem, you can se e how t he breath highlights 
the busy -ness of the mind . You now notice more 
fully all of these issues and concerns. There is a 
big difference between being lost in your 
thoughts  – being caught up and preoccupied so 
that you hardly know what you are thinking or 
feeling – versus clearly seeing and knowing 
what yo u are thinking and feeling . If you can 
stay with your breath and get calm, that is great. 
Congratulations. If you can’t be with your breath, 
that is not a mistake. If you can’t be with the 
breath, the attempt  to be with the breath helps 
you to see what is going on for you in a way that 
you can’t see as well if you don’t have that 
reference point.  
 
What are some of the thin gs you might see that 
make it difficult for you to be present? In o ur 
tradition we name five common activities of the 
mind that make it hard to stay in the  present 
moment. They are  things that hinder our ability 
to be  present in a high quality way , and so  are 
called the hindrances. These hindrances are not 
considered distractions. They are ju st something 
that hinders our ability to be in the present 
moment. The idea is to stop  letting them hinder 
us by turning our attention toward them and 
seeing them directly. If you see them with such directness, then you are no longer caught in the 
grip of them.  
 
Here are the five. The first one is desire : wanting 
something, wanting anything at all. The mind 
gets caught up in its desires and fantasies. 
Something has to happen. I want something to 
happen. The mind gets pulled into fantasies and 
thoughts about what it wants. The  second one is 
aversion, ill wi ll, disliking something. It is easy 
for the mind to get caught up in  thoughts and  
feelings of dislike. That is the hook that pulls the 
mind. Generally when people have strong desire 
and strong aversion, it is about somet hing. It 
might be a person we  like or we don’t like . We 
might lust after the person , or we might have a 
really intense dislike for them  – or for a thing or 
an experience. What we do when we try to be 
mindful of strong desire and strong aversion is to 
train our mind to stop focusing on the t hing we 
want or don’t want. And i nstead, turn the 
attention around 180 degrees to notice what it 
feels like to have that desire or aversion.   
 
What does it feel like – inside of you – inside 
your body, your mind, your heart, your feelings – 
to be caught up  in wanting something badly?  
What’s it like?  [Participants respond]:  
Stressful.  
Depressing, crippling, freezing.  
Blissful.  
Yes, even if you don’t get it, it can be pleasant 
just to have the desire  – just wanting it . That 
sometimes can be a  hook.  
 
What we do with mindfulness meditation is to 
turn our attention away from the object, the thing 
that we want, and notice in the immediate 
present what it feels like in our body and mind to 
be wanting. I might want this bell , but if I focus 
only on the bell I ma y fail to notice how my tight 
grip is hurting my hand , how painful it is to grip 
the bell. When we meditate, we don’t have to 
have no desires, but the idea is to turn directly 
and honestly toward the desire, and notice it. 
This is what is making it hard  to be present.  
 
The trick is that when you really see desire 
happening in the present moment, then you are 
present. Then w hat most people find is that 
turning around and looking at desire and what it 
feels like gives them more freedom from it. And 
chances are t hey are not so  caught in the 
desire.  There’s some  freedom from it.  
 The same is true with aversion. If you really 
have strong dislike of something, it is usually an 
object. Rather than r epeating the same story or 
idea and focusing on what you don’t like, which 
is stressful  and crippling , turn the attention 
around 180 degrees and feel what it is like in the 
body , in the mind,  and in the heart to have this 
strong dislike. Be with that. Feel that. Then learn 
to be free of it by seeing it clearly.  
 
Those are two of the five hindrances. Another is 
resistance or lethar gy. Not just being tired , but 
more  like being so bored  that you just can’t 
stand it. Or you just don’t want to deal with 
something; it’s just too much. When I was about 
ten years old, my mom would take me to the 
department store to buy clothes. I hated it , and I 
would get so tired in the department store that I 
could hardly keep myself from falling on the 
floor. But when we wo uld leave the store, my 
mom would ask if we should get ice cream,  and, 
boy, was I awake! I had all the energy in the 
world. The resistance, the lethargy was a 
strategy for “I don’t want to be here.”  Sometimes 
that is what makes it difficult to meditate – this 
strategy of lethargy and resistance.  
 
Another hindrance is restlessness and regret making  it hard to be present  – this current of the 
river in the form  of restlessness and regret. In 
the same way as with desire and aversion, we 
turn the attention around to really be  there  in the 
present moment in our body with the 
restlessness or regret. And feel in the body what 
it is like. And breathe. Just breathe with it.  
 
The last hindrance is having doubt. To be 
caught in the grip of doubt may be about oneself 
or what one is doing, or doubt about meditation. 
Doubt about the value of being present for 
whatever you’re doing is one of the powerful 
forces that keep people from being present. So 
we turn  the attention around and really look at 
doubt right in the eye. Really see and feel what it 
is like.  
 
The idea is not to take anything as a problem in 
meditation , but to take it as something new to 
meditate with, to be mindful of, to turn toward 
and real ly see. The hope is that when you turn 
toward something and really see it clearly for 
what it is, you are beginning to discover how the 
act of seeing, the act of clear  knowing, is  a place 
to be free and peaceful.
