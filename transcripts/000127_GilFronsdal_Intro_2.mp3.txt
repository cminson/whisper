 So welcome to the second class of our five-week introductory course in mindfulness practice. And for those of you who might be new, these five weeks are devoted to teaching you some of the basics of mindfulness practice both as a meditation practice and as a practice that you can bring into your daily life, how to bring more attention, how to use attention as an aid, as a support for a wiser, more awakened life. Before I start with what I'm going to talk about this evening, what I'd like to do at the beginning of each day of each class is to give you a chance to ask any questions you might have. The idea is that as you do the class you're practicing at home every day and from that you might have some questions from the week before from your own experience. So does anyone have any questions or anything they want to report or say before we start? Yes? Do you have a simple definition of the word mindfulness? A simple definition of mindfulness is as simple as paying attention. It's attentiveness. The mindfulness is a little bit different than just the ability to give attention in the field of our awareness. So we can be aware of things. We're aware of many of things going on in this room. Some of the stuff that you're being aware of in this room you might not be giving your attention to. Supposedly you're giving your attention to me speaking because I'm the speaker and you might be doing that but you might be aware of other people in the room and other things going on but you're giving your attention here. Mindfulness is the capacity to give our attention to something to see it clearly for what it is. So in mindfulness practice what we're learning to do is to rest in the field of awareness, have enough trust of life so that we can rest in the awareness and then in that awareness to then give our attention to what we're going to pay attention to. So for some people a lot of what they're learning as you do this practice is learning to trust. Many people are very mistrustful, very fearful or hanging on to things or resisting things and with their awareness with their very presence. And in order for this practice to unfold it unfolds better more easily if there is a sense of trust in just being present, just being sitting here being alive, if you sit here being unguarded, undefended. Other questions? Yes. I was a neophyte. I found that the monkey mind was calmed quite a bit by focusing on breath. But after a while it can do, the monkey mind is clever, it can do both. I found that another thing I'm not sure is any good but interested in your reaction was to cause a physical sensation of some kind that I could focus on. It wasn't abstract, wasn't mental, wasn't even automatic like breath. I'm simply, in my case, just pressing a thumb against the finger, focusing on that, to draw attention to something mindful or very mindful. This is what we're going to be talking about today, is how to include our body with physical sensations within the field of mindfulness. So hopefully the whole class today will address maybe what you're interested in here. And if it doesn't, then maybe the end of the evening you can ask again. But yeah, the mind is very tricky. And the monkey mind, the mind that wants to be distracted, often will resist in all kinds of clever ways our desire to be attentive, to be present in the present. And we have to contend with the tricks of the mind. Yes? Well, being a very visual person, I had a similar experience to that in that there's this constant moving size of sound. And one thing is it was very much where they opened my eyes, sort of looking at the rug in a kind of blurry, half-looking way. And at least kind of turn the movie off or down. Because you can see things while you're looking at something else that lessens, not having darkness, lessens that. Great. Yes, that's quite good. Different people, some people are more thinkers. Their thinking mind takes the form of more words. And some people it takes more of the form of visualizations or images. And sometimes for people who are easily caught up in images, as you just said, it can be quite helpful to open their eyes a little bit so the imaging doesn't happen quite as easily. Yes? I'm sure actually practicing meditation is the best way to learn it. But is there a particular book that you would recommend? If a person is... There's no particular book that I recommend, but a very nice beginning book that doesn't give the instructions for mindfulness, but gives kind of the understanding for the practice of mindfulness, is a book by Stephen Levine's first book called The Gradual Awakening. These very short little chapters, each of them kind of containing some of the kind of understanding that goes with this practice and can be very supportive of this practice. Yes? I have very vivid visualizations, but it's just a pattern and I look forward to it. And I've been looking for it and looking into it. I would say encouraging it in a way would I be better off trying not to do that? For the purposes of mindfulness meditation, you're much better off not encouraging any particular experience. And in addition to that, not giving any special interest or value to any particular experience, because that tends to perpetuate our involvement, perpetuate the entanglement we have with it. What we're trying to do is to discover an unentangled mind, an untangled heart. So when visualizations arise on their own, then as we'll talk about today, the practice of mindfulness is to just see clearly this is what's going on in the present moment, as opposed to knowing what's going on and then getting involved in it. There's a kind of independent ability to be aware of what's happening that we take refuge in. This is what's happening right now. So as I talk today, maybe that becomes clear. So I like to distinguish, it's very important for the purposes of mindfulness, to distinguish between our direct experience that we have and the concepts, the ideas which we have of that experience. And most of us tend to live in the world of our interpretations, concepts, ideas, judgments about experience. Much of our thinking sometimes is about things, as opposed to being, we live in a world of aboutness, as opposed to living in direct contact with our experience and with life. And maybe this is illustrated with this example I like to give. Some years ago, a number of years ago now, I was watching football on television with two other meditation teachers. And one of them had the mute button. And as far as I know, all sensible people, when the commercials come on, they push the mute button. And so he did that and we started talking about something for a while. It was very nice. And then at some point, the football game started again. And we stopped our conversation and started watching the football game. However, my friend who had the remote in his hand, he did not push the mute button again to bring on the sound. And so we were watching the silent football game. And I thought, this is a teacher of mindfulness, of paying attention. And certainly he must know that the sound is not on. And this seems somewhat unusual that he would choose just to watch it without the sound on. And so rather than nudging him, I'm just going to sit there and find out what this is about. So I watched for a while the football game without the sound. And it was quite easy for me to follow what was going on with the game. I mean, all these guys, they line up, they fall down, they line up again, they fall down. And then every once in a while, some guy breaks through and catches the ball. And you can see me going down the field. It's very nice. You see some other guy that's chasing him and the other guy catches him and he falls down. He can see, oh, it's kind of near the goal line. He almost made it, but he didn't quite. So it's all kind of matter of fact. But then at some point, he turned the sound back on again. And the difference was that with the sound, we had the commentator, the sportscaster, who was making commentary about the game as we went along. And I suspect that part of the job description of the sportscaster is to excite the television audience to get you into the game. And in fact, that's what it did. It isn't just simply, oh, these guys are standing up and falling down and he's going down the field and looks like he's going to make it. That's very nice. Like, oh, you get up and you stand and you're always going to do it. Yes. Oh my God, he got tackled. And because somehow it's contagious, the excitement of the commentator. But the experience of watching, well, most of us don't distinguish, is the difference between the football game in and of itself and the football game as we experience it through the voice of the commentator, the sportscaster. And those two things are entangled in us. And so our experience of watching football on television is they're completely entangled. For those of you who don't watch television, maybe it's canned comedy on television where they have canned laughter. And so it actually increases your sense of delight for many people to have that, you know, it's contagious, right? To have that laughing, that canned laughter kind of to tell you when you're supposed to feel funny. And so the experience is not just simply the joke. The experience is a joke through the filter of the laughter that you hear in the background. So our experience of life is often through, it's mediated through commentary. And this happens also in our own minds. Our minds have said sportscasters, newscasters, gossip, columns, you know, it has it all. These people, you know, it's doing it constantly, making commentary, oh, I like that. That wasn't so nice. Why didn't he say it a little bit differently? Or I wish I had said that, or, you know, or whatever. People go on and on, you know, with our commentary of what's going on. And our commentary is not the same thing as the actual experience. It's a commentary about it. It's flavored by interpretations and judgments. Now it's a normal thing to do, to live in the, to have commentary, but many of us live in the commentary. And our whole experience of world is through the filter of commentary, through our ideas and judgments of stuff, rather than seeing things as they actually are. Some of us have that experience. If people see us through some old category, which is no longer valid, once upon a time, you know, you're never angry, but once upon a time you were angry. But the last person, the only time that person met you was at one time. So now every time this person sees you again after that time, they assume you're an angry person. They're seeing you through the filter of that commentary, that idea. And it feels oppressive. Someone who only seen as being, you know, a spouse of someone else, you know, it feels a little bit oppressive to be in that category only. So, and we do this to ourselves. It's much harder to see how we do it to ourselves. We put ourselves in our commentaries or interpretations. We see ourselves through a filter of ideas, interpretations, or judgments. And so then that, you know, we don't experience ourselves directly, but we have these often ancient ideas that we've gotten from our childhood or from any part of our life. But, you know, I'm not competent or, you know, I'm super competent or we have all these ideas we have and we carry those with us. Rather than let ourselves be who we are in the moment, we see ourselves through some idea. It can be seen very clearly sometimes in meditation practice, especially if someone's a beginner. So sooner or later someone will have the idea, you know, I can't do this. I'm not a very competent person. You know, this is too difficult for me. That's an interpretation. You know, you probably don't have enough evidence to know that, but we very quickly kind of will put on the commentary and see it through that. Or we have the opposite commentary. We really inflate ourselves. You know, I've never done meditation before, but it doesn't seem very difficult. And who are all these people around me who are having difficulty with it? You know, I'm on the verge of Buddhahood. And, you know, and that's another form of commentary. So the idea in meditation is to shift the attention, shift our presence out of the commentary into something larger, some larger sense of self. It isn't that you have to stop the commentary, but you need to see the commentary as commentary. Maybe not necessarily believe it. And then shift. And can you be more present for things as they actually are? Can you be with your breath as it actually is, as opposed to the idea about your breath? Someone can have a shallow, difficult breathing, and you can just be aware of that in and of itself. Or you can have this idea, oh, it shouldn't be this way. The breath shouldn't be shallow and deep, shallow and tight. Shallow and tight means that I'm uptight. I'm uptight because of the kind of work I chose. And I chose the kind of work I chose because the kind of childhood I had. And therefore, I have the wrong parents. And so the commentary gets quite elaborate, you know, very quickly. And the original experience was very simple. Just your breath was tight and shallow. So why don't you just leave it there? Leave it that way. Why do you have to get into your parents, you know? Just here, I'm a human being with a shallow and tight breathing. So what we try to do in mindfulness practice, and what's very restful in the long term, is to learn how to rest in that direct experience, rather than taking up residence in all the commentary most of us live. So with that as a general introduction, let's do our first sitting this evening. So we begin by taking an alert but comfortable posture, having your spine be a little bit more alert than maybe you normally would have it. And then gently close your eyes. And then in the beginning of a period of meditation, it's often nice to take a few deep breaths. And as you breathe in deeply to let that inhalation connect you with the inside of your body, with your body. And then as you breathe out a little bit more fully than normal to let the exhalation relax you, let go with the exhalation. Breathing in deeply, letting go into your seat, into your cushion. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And there's no right or wrong way of breathing. Just the way your breathing is fine. Just let it, let breath breathe itself. And it can also be helpful in the beginning of a sitting to relax some of the muscles in your body that might be tense. And I find it useful to begin with a forehead, to soften the forehead. As you breathe out, relaxing the jaws, the face. As you breathe out, relaxing the shoulders. Letting the chest be soft. And to whatever capacity you have to let the belly be relaxed and soft, letting the belly hang forward. So that an extended belly supports your diaphragm, supports the rest of your torso. And let your awareness be relaxed. Take a few moments not to be aware of anything in particular, but just to let awareness kind of float and let whatever occurs appear in your awareness. There's no right or wrong thing to be aware of. Just be aware of whatever appears that's happening in the present moment. What in your present experience comes to awareness? And then within that awareness, gently give your attention to your breathing. Or give your breathing to your attention. So you become aware of what it feels like to be having a breathing body. How does your body experience your breathing? So you become aware of what it feels like to be able to breathe out. And then you become aware of what it feels like to be able to breathe out. And then you become aware of what it feels like to be able to breathe out. And then you become aware of what it feels like to be able to breathe out. So notice whatever tendency you have to get involved in your thoughts, you've lost in them, or to get involved in commentary. And simply shift, relax your attention into your breathing again. Begin again, feeling and sensing your breathing. In the way that gently rocking a baby soothes the baby. So let the alternating rhythm of breathing in and breathing out calm or relax your mind, your heart, let it cool the fires of the mind. So when the mind wanders off in thoughts, there's no need to have any commentary about that. Just simply begin again, being mindful of your breathing. It can be quite a relief to know that you don't need to have any commentary. You can just be with the way things are. So notice if you're caught up in your thoughts. The very act of noticing that is to be mindful. The very act of noticing that you're involved or lost in your commentary is to begin to be free of it. Appreciate that moment of free of disentanglement. And then very simply come back to your breathing. The breathing helps us to be very simple. Let yourself be as simple as your breathing. And then as we come to the last period of this sitting, let go of the breath in terms of what you pay attention to. And bring your attention to whatever physical sensation in your body is most pronounced. It doesn't have to be very strong, but whatever happens to be the most pronounced physical experience in your body. And without moving or doing anything about the experience, very simply give your attention to that sensation, allowing the sensation to be there. Seeing if you can separate your attention from your commentary about the sensation. Separate your attention from your ideas about what the sensation is. And let yourself be really simply present for that sensation in your body. If in an easy way it makes sense, let yourself become more intimate with the sensation. Feel it more carefully, but allowing it to be there. And notice what happens to the sensation as you're present for it. Does it get stronger or weaker? Does it go away? If it goes away, then find a different sensation. But discover what it's like to bring a very simple awareness to a physical sensation. As if awareness creates lots of room around this physical sensation. Letting the sensation exist in the great big spacious room of awareness. Being aware of the sensation. And then you can let go of physical sensations and just come back again very simply for another minute with your breathing, the last minute of sitting. Regardless what is happening to you, see if you can be fully and completely and relaxedly present for your breathing. So the word mindfulness that we use in English as a translation of the Buddhist word sati perhaps gives the wrong impression because it has the word mind in it. And I think we often assume that our awareness resides in our mind. And it's a kind of a mental thing, they're paying attention that we do. There's certainly a mental side of it. But I think we might just as well translate mindfulness as bodyfulness. Because a very very important foundational part of mindfulness practice is embodiment, is to be in our body, is to let the body be the vehicle or the antenna, the receptor for our experience of life. To begin, mindfulness training is a training to help us start living our life through our body and with our body. So the body and mind are partners in all this as opposed to the mind thinking that it's an independent operator ready to go off and do whatever it wants to do. Someone just a little while ago told me that she teaches mindfulness-based stress reduction at Kaiser. And she wants to teach mindfulness practices to people and corporations. And she says it's really unfortunate that people don't really start taking real serious interest in their health or their state of their mind or start learning something like mindfulness until they're really suffering. And really be better if they did beforehand. We have these minds which don't want to kind of admit that often they were limited. And we're kind of racing off in the head of ourselves. And we live not only in the commentary about our lives, commentary what happened in the past, our prophecies about the future, but we also live in our drivenness, drivenness of our mind. We're driven in all kinds of different ways. We're driven to do a lot of things. It's a wonderful modern word, multitasking. I suspect that a hundred years ago you asked someone to define multitasking and they would look at you and thought you were crazy. What's that mean? And what happens with multitasking in a sense is the mind is going in different directions at the same time. And all this momentum is going. And it's the momentum of the mind which gets interested in multitasking, the demands, the needs, the fears, the ambitions, the drivenness. And so we get caught up then into in the world of our mind, the mental world. And that world then drives what we do. And the body is just this slave that just has to kind of take commands and follow along as best as can, you know, and do all the instructions. And if you are a really sound constitution maybe the body will hold up and do a lot. But if you don't have a strong constitution sometimes the limitations that the body puts on the mind occur much earlier than for other people. We tend to live in mind time, the time which our mind sets. And the mind can live in very fast time because the mind can want things at a phenomenal pace. You know, how many desires a minute is it possible to have? I think it's possible to have a lot. And so the mind gets in this very fast hectic mode, getting things done, getting, you know, or maybe it's not very fast, it's just frightened, you know. So the fear is such a preoccupation. We get so concerned in the fear that we enter into this mental world of the fear and not aware of what's happening with our body, not aware what's happening in the present moment in the particular situation we're in. Not recognizing perhaps that in the moment, in this particular moment, this particular time and place, there's absolutely nothing to be afraid of. The fear has nothing to do with here and now but has to do with some possibility outside of here and now. And if that's the case, isn't the here and now a place that can be relaxed into more, that we can be more trusting about? You'll find that you're able to relax and trust the present moment much more. You'll find you'll be able to be much more relaxed if you make the choice that, in fact, the present moment is much more trustable than you're granting it. So we tend to live for some various reasons in our minds, in our thoughts, in our commentary, our ideas. We often are then ahead of our bodies. And one of the ways this takes is that we often are looking after relief. The mind mostly wants relief. The body, I think, in its deepest whatever, doesn't really want relief. It wants release. And there's a big difference between release and relief. So, for example, if you feel really tight in your shoulders, and you can see there's often meditators, they sit down, they're kind of tight. There's some middle of the sitting, they feel kind of tight in their shoulders, and they start stretching, stretching your neck, doing all kinds of nice stretches. And there's a certain impulse for relief, for avoidance, for improving things. And we think that the way to provide that relief or that release is by stretching. And to some degree, we can get some relief, but we don't get release necessarily from stretching. Part of the reason is that the tensions in our shoulders arise because of tensions in our mind. And if we're only addressing the physical part as a mechanical thing that we can stretch and pull, then the root cause is to splash out at something. And there's a kind of a feeling we want to just kind of follow through on that impulse. America is about, in a kind of stereotypic way at least, is about the freedom to do whatever we want. Buddhist practice is not the freedom to do whatever you want, which is maybe disappointing to some of you. But Buddhist practice teaches us to be free from our impulses. So the impulse to want something arises. And there's a certain kind of relief that can come from giving into that and following through on it. If you're really angry or someone and you want to punch them out, if you do that, there's a kind of relief that comes. It's kind of feel a little better for a moment. But that doesn't really get down to the root that allows a deeper release that needs to happen. And in fact, some activities, if you keep acting them out, reinforces it as a habit. What we do in mindfulness practice is we bring, rather than looking for relief, we bring our attention. We give our attention very carefully to those impulses and feelings and sensations. And to feel it very carefully, in the feeling being present for it, discover how to be released in the middle of it, not to be caught by it. To discover how to be independent of the impulses and by giving lots of space in terms of lots of awareness, to let that impulse or let that feeling sensation unravel itself. The unraveling of itself is much more powerful than is our acting on wanting relief. Often we want relief. It's mostly the mind kind of negotiating and figuring out and manipulating and fixing how things should be. But we can drop down into the body and feel how it is, how things are actually felt in the body. The body itself, the conscious body, the body that's felt consciously, will more often than not release itself in its own time in a way that you can't really engineer from the mind's point of view. I don't know if all this makes sense, but to kind of get around this from another angle. Fundamental to mindfulness practice is being embodied in our body, to be present for us in our body and experience our world through our body, to live in body time rather than in mind time, to discover that it's useful to let the body take the lead in the pace in which we live our life, as opposed to letting all our mind kind of racing ahead of itself, to feel our body, to let the body then become a sensitive instrument that connects us to the world around us and that connects us to ourselves. If we live in the mind all the time in the commentary and thoughts, we tend to be quite removed from all the information the body is ready to give us about how we're feeling, how we're reacting and responding to the world. It's all there in our body ready to be read, ready to be felt, ready to be experienced. The body is, I find, is phenomenally wise. The body has phenomenal amount of information, of wisdom, to tell us about how to live our lives that is not accessible to us if we're always caught up in the mind, in the thoughts and commentary and ideas that we have. So a very central to mindfulness practice is learning to pay attention to our body and perhaps you can say more deeply, learning to live within our body or to say it even more intimately, to let ourselves be inseparable from our body. So it isn't that, you know, famous question. Are you your body or are you in your body? Are you in your body or are you your body? And then many people kind of at least operate in the notion that, you know, my body is just a stuff that kind of I have to carry around with me and I'm kind of in it directing the show. I'm the, you know, the stage director. But there's a tremendous intimacy between the intimacy between our mental and physical life, so much so that you can't actually make that distinction. I think it's much in some sense more accurate to say we are our body. More accurate than to say that we are in our body. And those of you who know Buddhist doctrine know that there's more to it than that. But so then part of mindfulness practice, a very important part of it, is beginning to train ourselves to sensitize ourselves to our embodied life, to our felt life, the felt experience of living as opposed to the thoughts about living. What's the felt sense that you have right now being alive? What's the felt sense you have right now of sitting here in this room? How easy is it for you to make commentary about that felt sense? How easy is it for you just to rest in the felt sense as you sit here right now? So in mindfulness we train ourselves to begin paying attention to our physical body. Now in the simple instructions of mindfulness meditation, it's explained this way. We first sit down to meditate and we give our attention, we relax, and we give our attention to our breathing. We feel the breathing arising and passing. And we've kind of in a sense we place our breathing in the foreground of our attention. In the background of our attention there may be many things that you're aware of. Sounds, thoughts, feelings, sensations, itches, emotions. As long as those things are in the background, you can just leave them there. As long as you can keep, stay with the breath. The breath is in the form you can stay there with the rising passing of each breath. Just stay there, hang out there, get to know your breathing better. When some physical sensation in your body comes into the foreground, then the instruction is to let go of your breathing and give your attention to this physical sensation. So some people are trying to hold on to the breathing as if the breath is what you're supposed to pay attention with no matter what. And sometimes it can arise attention then between the sensation in your body that really wants attention and your idea you're supposed to be staying with the breath. There's no need for that tension in this meditation practice. Rather what we do is relax, let go of the breathing and give our attention to this sensation in the body, the physical sensation. And it could be the whole gamut of sensations that might appear predominantly. If you're new to meditation, it might be an uncomfortable sensation. It's quite common for new meditators to feel, especially if you're sitting on the floor, to essentially or later feel some discomfort in your legs or your back, your knees perhaps or something. And then it's a very common commentary to have, oh if only my knees didn't hurt, then I could really meditate. They're standing in my way of meditating. I'd be a great meditator if this back was just a little bit better. But there's no need for that kind of idea in meditation. There's some other experiences in the way of developing mindfulness. Rather what we do is we take those sensations of the knee or the back or whatever and we bring our, we give our attention to it. We feel it. It becomes the meditative subject. We feel it. It becomes the meditative subject. It becomes what the meditative mind becomes aware of. We receive it in the meditative mind, those sensations in the body. And this is very different than how many people relate, especially to discomfort. Many of us, when we feel uncomfortable, want to fix it. We want to manipulate it. We've grabbed for the aspirins. We want to stretch our legs. We want to do anything we can to try to avoid having discomfort. And there's a lot of support in our culture for that strategy. I knew one mindfulness teacher who, one of his students got really angry with him when he taught kind of an introductory course like this, because he was saying, when you feel some discomfort in your body, some pain, bring your attention to it. He spent his whole life trying to avoid being with it. And he was being told, now he's been told, bring your attention to it. That seemed like the very opposite of the relief that he wanted from his pain. But in mindfulness, we bring our attention to whatever is the strongest sensation. And if a strong physical sensation predominates over our staying with the breath, then that becomes the meditation, that strong sensation. Sometimes it can be a very strong, pleasant sensation that arises in meditation. A lot of warm tingling or vibration or pulsing some places in the body. And in that case, we matter of fact, they bring our attention to that and feel that. And the idea is to feel it in a non-reactive way, without commentary or at least not without getting caught up in the commentary and just feeling and what it is in and of itself as a direct experience. Getting to know it better, exploring it. What's very fascinating is that because many of us live in the world of concepts, we actually keep ourselves removed from our direct experience. And we don't really know what things are like. And this can be seen very clearly with physical pain. We keep ourselves quite a distance from physical pain. We have all these ideas of what it is. But if you bring a very careful, attentive mindfulness to the pain itself, it very quickly appears very different than what you thought it was. For example, rather than being some solid mass of pain, you might see it's made up of a variety of different sensations which are sparking or pulsing or rising and passing. And it isn't a solid substantial pain, but it's actually a constantly fluttering and moving sensation around the knee, the rising and passing and dancing. And if it's dancing and not staying in one place even, maybe it's a lot easier to stay with it. When we see it as a solid mass of pain, it can be very difficult to stay with it. As we investigate the physical pain, we might see the ways in which our mental reactions to it cause us to suffer. We feel physical pain and we suffer because we resist it, we tighten around it. I mean, one great way to suffer more is you feel some physical pain. And then you have so much aversion to it, the muscles around that tighten up even more, and then you feel even more pain. We have judgments about it or about ourselves for having it. You know, how could I have been so stupid to come to a meditation class? I mean, I could be out dancing this evening, you know, or there's all these more better things to be doing than sitting here with leg pain. I mean, what in the world was I thinking? So we have this all suffering about, you know, blaming ourselves for our choices. So did you have mindfulness in the most compassionate way you can imagine? Just see that tendency of how we react, the judgments we make about it, and see that those things are different from the actual pain. And then train ourselves just to be with the direct pain itself and see what happens. The same thing with strong, pleasant sensations when they arise. To just bring our attention and matter of fact, we just see it, be with it, give our attention to it, and not to make a story out of it. You know, oh, you know, this is the best, you know. And I think I'm going to sign up for that 90-day meditation retreat because, you know, I really deserve 90 days of this kind of bliss. And so the mind wanders off, you know, holding onto that. And then the next day you sit down to meditate that time. Physical delight is not there. And then you spend the next 45 minutes of meditation kind of looking for it and just, where is it? And upset because it's not there. The mind does all this stuff. The training in meditation is to become really simple. Just let it be where it is. Pleasant, unpleasant, just let it be. Discover that freedom of mind that can just let things be as they are without getting all wrapped up and entangled in them, that they have to be different. So sensation arises in the body, and it's more pronounced than the breathing. We let go of the breath, and we bring our attention to that part of the body, and we feel it. It can be very helpful in that process to, in a very subtle, quiet way, name or label that physical sensation. Because, as I said last week, to very simply name it like pain or hardness or tightening or tension or warmth or coolness, to have a very, very simple obvious name to it. It's using that part of the mind which thinks to help you stay focused on what you're paying attention to as opposed to letting the thinking mind be idle so it can think about whatever it wants. And then I'll think about Tahiti, you know, or pizza or something. One of the most amazing things to me is, you know, you can have this tremendous spiritual inspiration and intention to kind of, this is like the most important spiritual practice you know, and your full spirituality is kind of being channeled into sitting down here, and you're going to sit here and really be present for yourself and give yourself lots of compassion and accepting presence, and sit here and can be fully liberated, you know, because you're used on fire, your spiritual fire, and you sit down with all this intention, and then in 30 seconds you're thinking about pizza. It's kind of amazing, isn't it? Or some equivalent of that. So to begin training ourselves to be present for what's actually happening for us with what's actually happening, being present for the physical sensations, that's what's predominant. And physical sensation also means all the sense doors, hearing, smelling, tasting, I suppose. So for example, if you're sitting and meditating and there's a strong sound, dog barks outside or neighbor yells or whatever, many meditators first assumption is, oh, that's a distraction from my meditation. You know, if that dog wasn't barking, then I'm sure I'd be fully enlightened. But there's no, you know, if only, it's like if that's what's happening, if that's what's pronounced as a dog barking, the sensations, the sense, the feeling, experience of listening becomes the focus of meditative attention. And when you're still listening meditation, hearing, hearing, we name it hearing in this case, hearing, hearing, just hearing, just hearing, hearing, that sensation, being present for what that's like, developing the ability to be in the present moment, encouraging yourself to stay in the present moment on your staff to hearing the dog bark. It's a little bit disappointing maybe because the breath, you know, has this great spiritual association, you know, it's feel like you're doing something spiritually important. The dog barking, you know, what's kind of spiritual importance of that? It's important because what we're doing is training our ability to be in the present moment for what is most pronounced in the present moment, to rest in our awareness and give our attention to what's really most pronounced in the present moment experience. And that ability, of course, translates to all kinds of benefits in the rest of our life. If you have the ability to give yourself to what's most pronounced, what needs attention, you know, you give yourself, you're able to develop focus at work and focus on your relationships and all kinds of situations. One of the great highlights of this particular meditation practice is that there's no such thing as a distraction. There's just something else to pay attention to and to discover the ability to have this luminous, independent freedom of presence in the midst of whatever life gives us as opposed to demanding that life should be different so that we can be free. So that's a simple instruction on, hopefully, it was simple enough on how to begin including your physical sensation as part of your meditation practice. Do you have any questions about that? Or anything I've said tonight? Yes, David. Yes, you keep on saying pay attention to the breathing. I mean that's a very big thing. It's like my belly is moving, my chest is moving, my muscles and my upper back are doing. Pay attention to what you're saying or to pay attention to a particular aspect of the breathing. The usual instruction is to give attention to that part of your breathing which is most pronounced. For some people it might be the belly rising and falling, for some people it's the chest, for some people it might be the air going in and out through the nostrils. Whatever aspect of the breathing process seems the most pronounced to your experience. Let that be, we call it the anchor or the home for the attention. And so that's where we're cultivating our awareness in that place. We get really familiar with one place. So you know, you know, as you wonder where should I be today or you know, that's your anchor, that's a place you tend to go to. And also it's very helpful if you know where that anchor is, that place, because if you go off and pay attention to something else for a while like your sensations in your body or if you get lost in your thoughts for a while, when you wake up and you have time to come back to your breathing, you used to automatically know where it goes like your default. Okay, my place is the belly rising and passing, so I just go there. I don't have to wonder where is the breath now? Is it all? Make sense? Yes. What if that changes all the time? It seems like a form of monkey mind for me. My breath is here, my breath is there. If I were to choose one spot, it'd be kind of arbitrary. Yeah, it's not a big deal. There's no right or wrong. Just choose some place that's most predominant generally or what's most comfortable or most appealing to be at. And just choose that. And if you're watching your breath there in this whatever place you choose, and then the predominant sensations of breath begin to move as you're watching it, maybe from the stomach up to the chest, you can just follow it then. But you have this one place which is a default. If you don't know what to do, just bring your attention to that one place to keep it simple. So you don't have to be guessing or wondering or engineering. Make sense? Yes. I have a question about the experience I had earlier on this evening. I was sitting here listening to your talk and I became aware of some real tension in my thighs, in my arms and my legs. And my impulse was to get up and go exercise. Did he do that? I sort of tried to feel it, but to go away was sort of got worse and worse and worse. And then from another practice I tried saying what I was feeling under my breath. I said it under my breath. I had tension in my arms. And I said that with sort of emotion. I was aware of that and thinking it, but by saying it, then it's sort of disicating. And I'm wondering, is the meditative part just to be able to think it more? You said that the thought of moving or identifying it, can that be a physical identification? You just sort of think that. Well, this is a good question. Mindfulness, a very important element of mindfulness is a very simple rudimentary recognition of what's happening in the present moment. So if you have tension in your legs, you need to recognize, oh, the tension is there. But it doesn't have to be verbalized, that kind of level of recognition, just recognizing, oh, there's tension there. A lot of people, it makes sense. I mean, it's not like it's an abnormal thing to want. A lot of people, when they feel some discomfort, we want to have some relief. We want to have a solution. We want to fix it. And it's a fine thing to do. And in much of our life, that's kind of the way we operate. But in mindfulness practice itself, it's leading us to something much more transformative, much more powerful. And that is, rather than using a mindfulness practice, we become aware of something which we think is a problem, rather than relating to it as a problem needs to be fixed. We relate to it as a way to discover how to have an independent presence in the midst of it. Even if it gets stronger, we discover an ability to not be reactive in relationship to it, not be judgmental in relationship to it. We explore how we can strengthen, develop our ability to be present, to be mindful, to be aware, to have an awareness which is so much greater than our preoccupation with a particular problem. So that's very unsatisfying to people who really strongly have this momentum to always fix things and have relief. But in the long term, you'll discover a much deeper kind of release, or even relief, from that ability for the mind, for the awareness, for our presence, to be in an unreactive relationship to the world around us. Because a lot of the deep tensions in our life arise out of that reactivity. Now as we bring our attention this way, oftentimes we've been careful attention to tension, or holding, or pain, or body. Sometimes it'll get stronger, but it's often the experience that sooner or later it tends to dissipate just from the act of attention itself. So you might get relief just by doing the practice itself, but the point of the practice is not to get that kind of simple relief, but rather to go much more deeper into our psyche. Does that make sense? Yes? Can mindfulness be a, ultimately be a kind of psychotherapy in the sense that earlier you spoke about how many of us are driven and are compulsive, take for example, compulsive eating, or compulsive sex, or compulsive work. How is it that becoming more in touch with your body and your body experiences, how can that kind of disentangle one from the kind of compulsive problems? Very good, yeah very good. Many of the compulsive drives, like the ones you mentioned, come with ideas, come with thoughts, come with objects. And we tend to believe, both the ideas that go with the compulsion, we tend to believe the compulsion. This compulsion, this compulsion kind of comes with, it's very convincing, it's like this needs to be fulfilled, this needs to be done. And so we tend to act on it, kind of. It's very powerful to learn how to feel the impulse without acting on it. So if that sort of thought, that compulsive thought comes to mind during a sitting, what I'm getting is that you're just supposed to discard that and go back to the breath. What I would be more interested in is in somehow or other, you know, to be the goal. There's probably, you know, I understand that there's not supposed to be any goal except to be in the moment, but you know the idea is to get rid of the, to become undriven rather than driven to become uncompulsive. So how is that achieved? How is that, I'm just wondering what the dynamic is. You know how, you know, someone is compulsive almost in a way, you know, can't help themselves. The almost in a way, there is a little out, there's a little possibility and that's what we work on developing. And one of the powerful ways of dealing with compulsion is to have a very dedicated sitting practice where you're committed in the sitting practice, you're not going to act on a compulsion, you're going to sit there, not move. And then you train yourself to just feel in your body what's going on in your body in connection to that compulsion. And we can learn how to ride out the desire. It's quite interesting to ride a desire out. The desire will rise and get stronger and stronger and then it'll peak and break and then it'll just pass away. And if we learn, it gets a real confidence in our ability to ride out the desire. Then they stop losing some of their compulsive nature. And a very powerful way to do that, to train oneself in doing that, is to do that in meditation where we say, okay, at least here in my life, I'm not going to move. I'm not going to act on it. Can you give me a, for example, for, let's say you're sitting all of a sudden, you want to go to the refrigerator and get a pizza. Right. So then you get, then you start getting a new bodily sensations. Yeah. For right now, since today's mostly instructions, mostly I'm trying to expand the instruction into the body. It's very, very effective from oftentimes to drop down into the felt sense in the body of what's happening. And if there's a strong desire for pizza in the refrigerator, there's a kind of a leaning forward, a kind of tightening of the stomach, a kind of upwelling energy in the body that kind of wants to go or kind of wrestle this in the legs, let's get, let's go, you know. And all these sensations are coming. And so what we do is we just sit there and experience them and ride them out. And we learn to develop the discipline, the skill, the inner strength, the confidence that we can see it and recognize these things for what they are and then ride them out and not be driven by them. They can still arise. But many times people are really compulsive. They don't even see it coming. They just kind of, but as the mindfulness gets stronger, you see it arise and might arise quite strongly. And you see, you do have a choice. You have a choice between acting on it and not acting on it. And not acting on it, let me feel it. It's very powerful to feel it. If you don't feel it, it might actually kind of begin operating in kind of subconsciously way, you know, but to drop down and feel it. And so you learn those things I talked about, about how to ride it out and you get this confidence and strength. And in addition to that, as you can feel it, that compulsion in your body and your emotional life more and more fully, because you're really present for it and not giving into it, it just really shows itself. It gets really big, you know, really powerful. You get to see it in a way you can't see it if you act on it. And if you really see it well and really experience it as a physical thing, you might see there's something under that's driving it. That our compulsive drivenness is being driven perhaps by fear. It's a secondary expression of something else. And if you can really use the mindfulness, really be still and really sit quietly, really look deeply and see, really see first see the compulsiveness really for what it is and then look through the cracks of it. You might see this sense of fear, insecurity, or the desire for love that's under it. And it becomes a whole different game then. And it's much more healing to go to the roots than it is to just deal with the surface of the compulsion. Good luck. It's great. Riding out desires like a rodeo sometimes. Yes? What's the mind? You gonna tell me what the mind is first? You can tell me to come back next time. Well you know it is an introductory course. And you know you're not allowed to think yet you guys. I mean we cover thinking on the fourth class. I'm assuming none of you are thinking in your meditation until then. You haven't been told that it's okay. But the what is it? I don't know if you need to have a what. It's enough to know that there's awareness. There doesn't have to be a subject or an agent of the awareness. We often, one of the traps that many of us fall into is we always expect there to be an agent who's in charge. And so we attribute things to an agent. And as the practice gets quite deep you'll discover that there is no fundamental agent that's driving the show. It's a little bit scary sometimes to realize that. But that's later. You don't have to worry about that. So let's end with a brief sitting. Take one deep breath and relax into your body. Take another deep breath and see if you can just empty your mind the best you can. And then become aware of your body. Not so much as you're up in the head watching your body. But as if you're inside your body. You are your body. As if awareness occurs in the body. Feel and sense your body's experience of itself. In whatever way bodily sensations appear to you, let them just appear. Whatever sense of physical presence is there for you. Let it just be there. As if your body is a dear friend that you're receiving in your awareness. As if your body is just a dear friend that you allow itself to show itself to you. Become aware of the inhalations and exhalations. Trust yourself to your breathing. Trust yourself to your breathing. Entrust yourself to your body. Trust yourself to your breathing. Entrust yourself to your body. Trust yourself to your breathing. Entrust yourself to your body. Entrust yourself to your breathing. All right. All right. All right. There's an ancient teaching in Buddhism that your best friend is your body. Are there ways, are there times in your daily life where you can have a greater respect and connectedness to your body? Where you can be more awake to your body's experience of being a living person? So thank you very much for this evening. And next week we'll talk about how to incorporate emotions as part of the mindfulness practice. Something that interests a lot of people. But it's a lot easier to understand how to incorporate emotions into the practice. If you really begin understanding how to include the physical body as part of the practice. Now the better you understand how to include your physical sensations as part of mindfulness, you'll find it easier it is to be mindful of emotions. So practice this next week in your daily sitting as sensations in the body become more pronounced than your breath. Bring your attention to those. When they pass away, come back to your breathing. Or if other ones arise and become even more pronounced, go to them. Whatever is most pronounced in the body, let that be your meditation. The mind wanders away, bring it back. In your daily life, you might see if there's more look for opportunities in your daily life to be more connected to your body, how your body feels. And one of the very interesting places to do this, you might try this for the next week. If you find yourself in situations where you feel like you're going to act compulsively, or you find a situation where you get angry and very reactive or very confused, and maybe you get confused and you have a habitual unhealthy way of responding out of your confusion, and you feel like you have to do something or say something, try doing nothing. But don't be passive. Rather, do nothing. Give yourself a pause and give your attention to your body and feel what's going on in your body. Give yourself 10 seconds, a minute, some period of time to feel what's going on in your body. And then see if that changes the whole situation and gives you a better sense of maybe how to respond. Some of these compulsions that we want to act on, if we feel them carefully, have very short lifetimes. And the last thing to say is that for those of you who might be new tonight, we have two baskets out in the hallway for if you want to make a donation for the class. And one basket is help pay for our expenses for putting on the class and renting the room and such things. And we suggest that everyone put in $2 in what's called the expense basket. And the other is the teacher basket. And the suggestion is that it's a $10 donation for each class for that. But it's a donation system, which means that you do whatever you wish. And we really want it to be available to people of any kind of means so they can come freely and the money, that's not an issue if it is an issue. So thank you very much and see you next week.
