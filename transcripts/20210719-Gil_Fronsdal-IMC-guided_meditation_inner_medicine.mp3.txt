 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So warm greetings. I'm happy to be back and I had a wonderful time backpacking, long hikes, beautiful places, and adventures with California fires and mostly the smokes and closed trail because of the fires. And now I'm happy to be back and happy to be here with you all. So in the kind of meditation world that we practice in, this kind of spiritual life or this inner life that we develop and turn inside out, there's a principle that wherever there's an illness there is the medicine. And now we're talking about kind of a spiritual or dharmic illness, but that if you can recognize where the suffering is, the dukkha, the illness is, that the recognition is clear enough that you could also, it's possible to find the medicine right there. So if you clearly recognize your mind is agitated, chances are right next to it, close by, is the medicine, which is a calm mind, calm attention. If you're caught up in greed, the clear recognition of it, you can see or feel that potential or that place in the mind, the heart where there's no greed. That's the medicine for greed. Same for hatred and delusion. And to some degree it's also true for fear. The capacity to clearly recognize fear and then to look around and not be contracted or not be fixated on the fear, preoccupied by the fear, but to see it clearly, but then look around along the edges of it, beyond it, underneath it or below it, somewhere within. And you'll see that there is the medicine for it. There is courage, there is confidence, or there's peace, something that's non-fear. And so this clearly involves recognizing what is going on inside. Without that, there's no medicine. But the medicine comes with a clear recognition. So it's kind of a wonderful good news that each of you, each of us has within us the mental medicine, the spiritual medicine or the mental medicine that we need for spiritual illnesses. But it's a little hard to pull ourselves away enough from the illness, the so-called illness, the so-called dharmic dukkha that we might have, to pull away or to disengage or not be overly preoccupied with it so we have the capacity to see something else. And so one of the things that we can do in meditation is find something that feels basically healthy and appropriate or good to focus on. That's very simple. Something like the breathing. Or some people use clear recognition itself, the simplest clear recognition of what's happening. And as a way of not giving the energy of attention to the illness to feed it even more, to not feed these mental kind of preoccupations that we call illnesses or dukkha. And just stay with the breathing, stay with the breathing, and then slowly the interest, the preoccupation, the feeding of these kinds of spiritual illnesses abates without us having to do anything, without using the medicine even, until we find ourselves settled enough, calm enough, unagitated enough that the medicine kind of spreads through us throughout. The medicine of peace, of calm, of non-reactivity, the medicine of non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. So taking a comfortable posture that will also promote your capacity for attention, for clear recognition. And to gently close your eyes and take a few long, slow, deep breaths. And if you take those long, deep breaths unhurriedly, it can start being medicine for our hearts and our inner life. As you take a deep breath, maybe relax and soften the body as you exhale. Perhaps allow your body to settle as you exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And as you exhale now, the medicine of relaxation. And as you exhale softening the face, softening around the eyes. As you exhale softening the shoulders. As you exhale softening the belly. And gently as you exhale to soften in the mind. Relax the thinking muscle, whatever contraction or tightness that they're associated with thinking. Maybe you can identify in your mind, your heart, somewhere within. Something that has the potential to be medicine for your, for whatever ails you spiritually, mentally. Maybe there's some spaciousness or calm or peacefulness or compassion, care, inner respect for yourself. And then to settle into your body breathing. Simple caring attention to breathing in and breathing out. Carefully receiving the inhale. Careingly allowing for the exhale. Exhaling and allowing, inhaling and exhaling one after another. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling.

Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, when we learn to recognize the inner medicine, the heart's medicine for what ails the heart, that very medicine is the medicine that the world needs as well. And to appreciate the value of your inner medicine as a contribution to this world. When we are unagitated, it's medicine for the agitation of the world. When we have compassion and love, it's medicine for the world's hate. When we have generosity and contentment, it's medicine for the world's greed. When we have wisdom, clear seeing and recognition, it's medicine for the world's delusion. And when we encounter the suffering of the world, it's medicine to see it honestly and clearly and caringly without being oppressed by it or destressed by it. And may it be that this meditation that we do today and may it be medicine for the world, knowingly and unknowingly, intentionally and unintentionally, may we live our lives so that we make this world a better place. So that all beings may be happy, all beings may be free of suffering, all beings may be free of fear and distress, that all beings may be free of oppression. May all beings be happy, may all beings be well, may all beings be peaceful, and may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
