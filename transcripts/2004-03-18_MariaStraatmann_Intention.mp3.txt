 What I was thinking about on my way here tonight is that it's been a long time since I did a talk anywhere where I didn't have a PowerPoint presentation and a laser pointer. And I thought, well, that's going to be different. I don't have any props. But then I realized that the really difficult part for me was that when I give talks, I'm usually wandering around a lot. I get up and I move and I wander over to that side. So if you see me waving my hands, that's what that's about. It's getting all of that energy going. What I want to start with is a story about Milarepa. Milarepa was a Tibetan monk and yogic, yogi expert. And he lived in the 11th century. But before he became a monk and did all the wonderful things he did, he used his considerable yogic skills to limit, to punish, to harm the enemies of his family. And at a certain point, he decided it was time to stop doing that. And he wanted to take up the Buddhist path. And he went to a teacher by the name of Marpa. And he said, I'd like you to teach me. And Marpa said, well, OK. But what I want to start with, he said, I want you to build me a tower, a stone tower right over there in the field. Build me a tower. So Milarepa said, OK, fine. And he built the tower. And he came to Marpa and he said, I finished. And Marpa said, you know, I really didn't want that tower there. I really wanted the tower over there. Would you just tear it down and build it over there? So Milarepa tore it down and he built it over there. And he came back and he said, OK, I've done that. And Marpa said, oh, no, no, no. That's not where I wanted it, really. I think it would be better over here. Tear it down and build it again. Milarepa said, OK, OK. So he tore it down and he built it again in another place. This went on 10 times. He rebuilt this tower before Marpa would accept him as a student. And what he was doing is he was trying to find out if Milarepa was really serious about wanting to do this. He was testing his intention and his resolve. He wanted to know, do you really want to do this or is this a game you're playing? He figured he wouldn't build that tower 10 times if that was the case. So that's what I want to talk about tonight is intention. And I think a good way to think about intention is to think about how it informs our lives. Intentions are really different than goals. I may have an intention. I've always got an intention to lose weight. But the goal is to be someone who's skinny. I don't have to ever worry about that, but that's one of the goals. And the difference is with intention, it's a reason for doing something. It's not the goal itself. It's not the end point. It's more than that. It's the motivation for our goals. It's the way that we get to our goals. It's the strength that we need in order to get something that we want in the future. The thing about goals is they're very important for envisioning the future and deciding what you want to see in the future or what you want your future to be like. But they don't have goals that don't have very much to do with what's happening right now. And intention is what's happening right now. Intention is bringing you into the present moment. It only has to do with what's happening now. And that's a very important thing about intention. I have a quote here from a guy by the name of Toby Johnson. He writes for the White Crane Journal. And he says, intention just sets up the conditions for the future. In a way, intention isn't actually about the future at all. It's about understanding the present. Being clear on your intention is not about what will happen someday. It's about what you're really feeling and thinking and being conscious of right now. In that sense, investigating how you see the world and what you hope for from it is a reminder to be aware now, to live in the presence of what's coming into creation in the only time there is the present moment. That's Toby Johnson. Setting up conditions for the future. That's really what intention is. Setting up the conditions. There was a 20th century philosopher by the name of Maurice Merleau-Ponty who wrote extensively on intentionality. And he said that intention leads to what we notice in the world. So if you have an intention to do something, or my intention is to be a certain way, it turns out because you're thinking about that, that you start noticing things that are related to your intention because it tends to be reinforcing. That's the real value of intention. And also, he said, it's a way of assigning meaning. That intention ultimately brings you to the point where you assign meaning to anything that sort of reverberates with that intention. And he felt that was very important for how we live our lives in the world, which says that intention is something we better not only pay attention to, but use wisely. So how does intention relate to goal? Because obviously they're related. And an important part of intention is that intention has to do with forming a resolve. It's not just that we have an idea that we'd like something to be true, but we also say, I'm going to do something to make that true. So part of intention is I decide I'm going to do something. There's some power in that decision. So we stick to some plan or form, adopt some paradigm, something, some practice that will lead us to whatever our goal is. But the important thing is that it's actually independent of the goal. When I have an intention, I behave in a certain way according to that intention. My goal may or may not happen, but my intention is pure. It's right there. It's how I'm being in the world. So it is dissociating yourself from the outcome. So you set something in motion and you do it because you have a goal. But the intention really has a life of its own and it operates independently of whether you ever reach your goal. That's what gives its power and that's what makes it really useful for practice. So when I began meditating, I didn't have an intention to become enlightened. And I have to say that I read Buddhist texts for a very long time before I finally sat down on the cushion, like 25 years. Because it all seemed like too much stuff. I liked the ethics part of it, but I didn't quite gather what the virtue of sitting on the cushion was going to be. So when I started, I didn't really have a goal. At least I told myself I had a goal. I didn't have a goal, actually I did, but I'll come back to that in a minute. I read a series of books by Ken Wilbur. The first one was A Brief History of Everything. And in that book he talked about, he has a theory, a philosophy that there are stages of, for lack of a better word, let's say consciousness. So there's evolution that occurs. And that people who meditate have access to levels that people who don't meditate don't have access to. And so I was curious about that. And I said, so what would happen if I actually meditated? At the time I was very depressed. I had just left a major job. I was out on stress disability, actually. I was a wreck. I thought, well, I'm not doing anything else. Maybe I'll try that. And one of the things he said, that Ken Wilbur said, is that the contemplative traditions are all based on a series of experiments in awareness. Basically people did the same thing. They said, what happens if I do that? What happens if I watch my mind? What happens if I dig deeper into my consciousness and get beyond the point of self and ego? What is that like? Is that a reproducible experiment? And the adepts at contemplative traditions had done that and they've become, they pronounce all sorts of interesting things that seem kind of dubious to me at the time. I thought, well, I was pretty attached to the idea of a self. And so no self didn't say much to me. So one of the things Ken Wilbur said is, if you really want to understand what these people are talking about, you have to do the experiment yourself. That's the only way. Because unless you can do that, then you can't judge it because it's not something that can be measured in the sense that we can measure other types of reality. You can only measure it if you have the tools to measure it and you have to meditate to do that. I said, well, okay, fine. So that's why I did it. Now, when I said I didn't have a goal, I could go back and say, well, I wanted to be like those guys. That could be the goal. All right. So I did that. And I said, well, the other thing, he said one thing that was very interesting to me at the time. This is a quote from his book out of the eye of spirit. He said, in the eye of the spirit, we all meet and I will find you there and you me and the miracle is that we find each other at all. And the fact that we do is one of the simplest proofs, no doubt, of God's insistent existence. That's interesting. Meet God. That sounds like a good point. So I took up meditation. So I really did it out of a sense of inquisitiveness, curiosity. Now, the good news about that is that's actually a pretty good intention. It was accidental. But in retrospect, it's a really great way to start. What happens if I do this? What happens if I sit and watch my mind and see where it goes? And so if my intention is to find out what happens, I'm very present because I'm watching them. Many times when when we start on a spiritual path, the idea is that we're going to become a better person. I'm going to meditate. I'm going to be better. I'm going to be more calm. I'm not going to be angry. I'm not going to be irritable. I'm going to be free of pain. We have all kinds of ideas about what will happen if we're on the spiritual path, we will be better. If I were a better person, these bad things wouldn't be happening to me. Right? How many times have you said that to yourself? I've said it. No anger, no sadness, no abandonment. I'm going to meditate and all is going to be better. Well, Pima Shodron, who is a was a meditation instructor, is up in Nova Scotia, calls this kind of approach to going on a spiritual path, a form of aggression against yourself. Because you're starting out by saying you're not good enough and you're going to fix this thing. Instead, she says intention should be one of being gentle, precise and open. The gentle part has to do with being easy with ourselves, good heartedness toward ourselves. I have to tell you, when I first started meditating, this is not what I found when I looked at myself, that I had good heartedness toward myself. I was very depressed and I was sure it was all my fault. And in the way it was. Secondly is precision, the idea of precision, which is seeing what actually is. So we are expressing good heartedness toward ourselves and we look at what we see and see what's really there. And what I noticed is I was not only sad, I was also angry. And I was not only angry, I was fearful. And as I followed that track back, I realized I was also very judgmental. I spent a lot of time comparing myself to everyone else. And so I had this story that was running in my head, but it didn't really have to do with what was actually true. There was just story. The third item that she mentioned was being open. And the openness she calls letting go of preconceptions. That's where that story was. I had all those stories that I told myself about why I was the way I was. When a lot of the reason I was the way I was, was habit. It was the way I operated in the world. So following this idea of being gentle, being precise, being open, what it amounts to is we get to know ourselves. That's really what a spiritual path is about. Really coming to grips with knowing who we are. So that happened to me. And after I had practiced for a while, I began to notice things. I noticed how I was in the world. I noticed what hurt me. I noticed anger. I noticed fear. I noticed what made me happy. I started noticing when there was joy in my life. I could feel it in my body. I could feel things. Oh, isn't that interesting? I can feel happy. I also noticed how few stories I had about being happy. I had a lot more stories about how inadequate I was. What was actually happening is that I was noticing what was happening. As opposed to running along in my life just sort of listening. It was about this time that I started doing metapractice. How many people here are familiar with metapractice? Pretty well. Okay, just briefly, metapractice is a concentration practice and it has to do with wishing well for yourself and others. So it consists in repeating some phrases over and over again like, may I be well? May I be easy? May I be peaceful? May I be free from harm? May I be happy? And then repeating them and repeating them and then moving on to other people. So I started doing this metapractice and a very interesting thing happened to me. One day I was doing this and all of a sudden I broke down in tears. I was just sobbing from the bottom of my soul, just sobbing and sobbing. And I realized for the first time in my life I actually felt not sadness but compassion for myself. I realized I had been working so hard and I had set such high barriers for myself and that I was really doing the best that I could do. And it was such a revelation for me that I started thinking about what it was that was going on in my life that was making me so intolerant toward myself. And I realized that my heart was just closed up and that it needed to break open. And I adopted for myself the intention to be open hearted. This was my intention. And at the time I think it was a kind of goal. But over time it has evolved into my intention for how I live my life. I want to be open hearted. I intend to be open hearted. Now what this means can probably have special meaning for me and it would have a different meaning for anybody in the room. But I'll give you an example. There was a woman named Nahid who is the head nurse at Zen Hospice Ward at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. So the ward at Laguna Honda has 26 beds in it of people who are dying and she's the chief nurse there. And she was speaking to a group of us one night and she was talking about what it was that brought her, she's been doing this for 25 years, what brought her to doing this work. And she said, you know, I'm a lover. I'm a lover. I love people and I love everyone who comes through this hospice. They're really important to me. And it enlivens my mind, enlivens my life. I love these people. And someone said to her, how can you do that? Don't you get attached to these people if you love them? And then you get attached to them and they die. Doesn't that hurt? And she looked really puzzled. She said, you know, no, no, because attachment happens in your mind. If my heart is open, people, things come and they go. It's just open. It can't attach itself. That's not what it's about. It was a beautiful teaching. I loved that. If my heart is open, everything comes and it goes. It doesn't get caught. She was just a beautiful person. So yesterday I was talking to a woman and she, we were talking about intention because it was on my mind, because I knew I was going to give this talk tonight. And she said, you know, it's really been a long time since I did what I'd really like to be doing with my life. And I said, so why is that? She said, well, because I think that if I do what I really want to do, that my husband will leave me. Wow, that's pretty bad. So we talked about it and I said, why do you think that? You know, what is it? And she says, well, I'm just afraid. It comes out of fear. We talked about the specifics. They're not too important. But she finally said, you know, I've always been afraid. I don't remember any time when I wasn't afraid. And so I asked her to really think about that, you know. You've never had a moment when you weren't afraid. And one thing you should know about this woman, she's kind of unusual. She's a, she's a psychic and she has worked with law enforcement departments to help find people, for example. She's a very intuitive woman. And she said, well, you know, come to think of it. There is a time when I'm not afraid. She said, when I'm really open and I'm just letting something flow through me, information just flow through me, I'm not afraid. And I said, you know, that's really amazing. You have absolutely no control at that point. And that's when you're not afraid. And she said, oh, my God. Oh, my God. She said, here I am spending all my time kind of trying to control my life to protect it. And the only time that I'm not afraid is when I'm not in control. Want to read you something here. This is a poem by Mary Oliver called The Journey. One day you finally knew what you had to do and began. Though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice, though, though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles, mend my life. Each voice cried, but you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do, though the wind pride with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough and a wild night. And the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds. And there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own. That kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do, determined to save the only life you could save. Determined to do the only thing you could do, determined to save the only life you could save. I think that intention has a lot to do with how to save our lives. It has to do with how we want to be in the world. When we form an intention, it's a kind of energy. It has power. When we perform an act with intent, it has a kind of psychic trailer that goes with it. It kind of continues on. There's something connected with it. I'll give you an example. If you look at a knife, a knife is just a sharp metal object and it can cut. And I might cut my finger accidentally, inadvertently. And there was no intent to cut my finger, but it's cut nevertheless and it's bleeding. It's a problem. Now a knife in someone else's hands, who's maybe not so classy as I am, might have some very different effect. A knife in the hand of a surgeon can be a very useful device. And a surgeon has an intent to heal. And he'll use that knife to cut out something, to cut open something, to retrieve something. It has a very positive energy. His intent with that knife has a positive energy. The same knife in the hand of a thief may have a very different energy. It can also cut me. But the intent of that knife is negative. The intent is to do harm or to get something by threat of harm, which is itself a form of harm. So the knife is neutral, but the intent changes it. The intent has an energy for with it. And what that means is that there are kind of two aspects to intent that are important. The power that comes with intent both reinforces our actions and forms habits. That's where intention really has its value. So I have a sitting practice. And one of the reasons I have a sitting practice is because of my intent to be open-hearted. In order to be open-hearted, I have to be willing to accept everything and push away nothing. That's what being open-hearted means to me. Accept everything, push away nothing. In order to do that, I have to know what's happening. I have to really be in tune with what's happening now. In order to do that, I sit, I meditate. In order to develop the practice of seeing what is. So sometimes I find it's really difficult to sit. Sometimes because I don't have time. Sometimes because I'm very irritated. Sometimes because my energy is strange. But I sit because that's part of the resolved portion of taking care of my intention. So I'll sit. And what I find is that it's reinforcing. It's not like every time I sit, I'm starting over. Because when I sit, I'm learning more every time. It becomes a larger piece of what I know about myself. And that's important to know what's happening out there but also in here. So that I can keep track of it. You actually do get better when you meditate. Better, more skillful at concentration. It becomes a different place. It's much easier for me to sit because it's a... I like sitting on the floor. I'm soon going to have to stop because my knees are a disaster. But I really like sitting here because it's become a habit form. I sit on the floor cross-legged with my hands on my thighs and I'm home. It's a place where I know where I am. And it's reinforcing to the practice. It sets up the conditions for me to realize what's happening. So I like doing that. I remember one time having a conversation during a retreat with Joseph Goldstein, who is a major teacher. And I was complaining to him that Buddhism in the West is really kind of a strange experiment. Because we have such a strong lay practice tradition. And I said, you know, I'm feeling like I can't really get from here to there. Because I practice so erratically. Let's say I practice for 45 minutes every day and I go on a week retreat once a year. I'm not really going to make much progress. And he looked at me and he said, what is your problem? Where is it you're trying to go? What are you trying to do? You have everything you need. You have great teachers. You have places to practice. What's your problem? And the truth was I was trying to go somewhere else instead of just being where I was, which is a good place to be. And what I've discovered. So first of all, sitting is reinforcing as I as I sit more, it becomes more reinforcing. It's also habit forming. My mindfulness does get better with practice. I more often catch myself before I react to something. I'll feel I'll recognize the feeling in my body and I'll say, oh, I know this feeling. I'm really irritated. So maybe what that person is saying to me isn't so bad. Maybe I'm just irritated. And maybe I ought to think about what I'm going to say before I say it. Just that little that little split second that gives me that much advantage helps me to accept things and not push things away. That knowledge about myself leads to choice, which is a freedom that comes that is very important to me. The other reason I continue to sit is that things happen that I don't expect. You know, sit down and I think, okay, I know exactly what's going to happen. And you know what? That doesn't happen. Something else happens. One of the things that happens is sometimes I'm when I'm feeling very agitated, it's right before I have some major insight. So I'm just sitting there thinking, oh, I don't think I can sit here. Don't not going to be able to sit here. And then I realize something that has led me to that point that the reason I'm so irritated and so agitated and so restless has to do with something that I don't think I can sit here. And I'm just not willing to see. And lo and behold, there it is. Recently, I was talking to someone and I. It was a situation where I was talking to somebody I greatly admired. And we were talking about something that I might do. And I was talking to someone that I greatly admired. And we were talking about something that I might do with this person. And suddenly he said to some something to me that pulled one of my very old threads of stories about myself. And I got very angry. And even I was surprised at how angry I got. I could not believe it. And we quickly ended the conversation and I went away and I walked along the beach for a while. And that's when I was very angry. I walked along the beach for a while and that didn't work. And I sat down and I meditated for a while. And I still I couldn't figure out why I was so angry. And I said to myself, well, I know the reason I'm angry is once again, somebody was telling me I couldn't do something that I could do. They were saying, well, who do you think you are? You don't have this training or this experience. And they're telling me I can't do this because of that. And I was really pissed. And it took me probably about a week before I realized that was what was really true is I was afraid I wasn't going to get to work with this person. But what I did was switch off into this story that didn't have anything to do with what was true. It isn't even what he said. Later I talked to him and he said, can you tell me what happened? And I said, yeah, you know, you said so and so he said, I didn't say that. And I said, oh, I know you didn't say that. That's what I heard. Now that caught me by surprise. But the next time it's going to be less likely to catch me by surprise because I noticed right away that I was angry. And I noticed that it shouldn't have been happening in the context of that conversation. So that noticing becomes very important. And that's the practice that comes from the intention of being present. The other thing I do when I get really too irritated is I'll do walking practice or if all else fails, I don't have time to sit. I have to go. I do. I do Zen hospice shift Monday mornings at nine o'clock and I live an hour and a half from Zen hospice. So, you know, you back up. I have to get up pretty early and sometimes I don't have time to sit. So what I do is on the way in, I recite to myself the metasuta. And the metasuta, the reason that that works for me is that what everything in the metasuta serves to reinforce my intentions for myself. And it starts out, this is what should be done by one who is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace. And then it says what should be done. So I repeat that to myself because I know that it's important to me to reinforce what it is that's my intention. So intention is made up of two parts, thought and commitment. You have the idea for the intention and you have the resolve to carry it through. So the Buddha said that there is suffering. There can be an end to suffering. Suffering is caused by clinging or aversion. It's possible to end suffering and the way to end suffering is through the eightfold path. Right intention is one of the eight factors in the eightfold path. And it's very closely tied to right effort because of course that's what you have to do next. It puts some effort into it. But it begins with right intention, forming an intention that will give you some space in the world that gives you some benefit. It's not something that is out in the future. The nice thing about that is it's very hard to fail an intention. An intention is about being. It's not about accomplishing something. It's reinforcing. It's not about accomplishing something. It's reinforcing. It's reinforcing. It's habit forming. It helps you be the way you want to be in order to reach the goals that you wish to reach. It's a very powerful, powerful feature. Wholehearted resolution and dedication. Wholehearted resolution and dedication. This is what intention is about. Franco Stasecki says, prior to any action of the body, thought or speech, there is a moment of intention that we need to be aware of because clarity about our intention gives us choice about how we can proceed. Clarity about our intention gives us choice about how we can proceed. A moment of contact with our intention can break our habitual patterns and keep us from operating on automatic pilot. Right intention is like muscle. If you use it, you can build it up. It becomes stronger. If you ignore it, it wilts. It does nothing. So it's very important to nurture your intention. So how might we do that? How do you nurture your intention? First of all, the first thing is to notice what your intention is. Ask yourself, what's my intention in this moment? Why am I here? Why am I doing this thing? What's this about? I have many intentions in my life. I was driving, I live out by Point Ray Seashore, and you get there by a very wild twisty road. And I'm pretty sure I was put on this earth to learn the virtue of patience. And I have a difficult time following some people along that road, because I know the road pretty well now. I've driven it quite a bit, and a lot of people who drive the road don't know it at all, and they're very cautious, as they should be. And I get impatient. And I noticed yesterday I was driving along the road, and I had this image that I was reaching out and grabbing this car in front of me, kind of like a child's Hot Wheels, you know? I was going to lift it up and just put it behind me. I was going to lift it up. And then I thought, what is that all about? What's my intention? Am I late? Do I need to be somewhere that requires this person to get out of my way? What if I were the person in that car? Would I want someone to pick me up, move me? And I decided none of those things were true, and that in fact I just wanted the exhilaration of driving it at the speed I like to drive it. And I decided that wasn't an adequate intention. And so the really nice thing for me is once I decided that, it was okay. I didn't need to go any faster. It was just okay. Because it didn't have anything to do with the intentions that were important in my life. So it was a real joy. So one thing you want to do is monitor your thoughts. I'm going to read you something from the Dhammapada. We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make the world. Speak or act with an impure mind and trouble will follow you. As the wheel follows the ox that draws the cart. We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make the world. Speak or act with a pure mind and happiness will follow you as your shadow unshakable. How can a troubled mind understand the way? Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much. Not even your father or your mother. So monitor our thoughts. Think about what we are doing. Because what you are thinking about really manifests what happens. It's the power of intention. It is the energy that goes with it. I've had people ask me, usually when I meet somebody and we are talking about what we are doing and I say something about Zen Hospice, they'll say to me, how can you do that? I could never do that. And they start ascribing all sorts of marvelous virtues to me that I don't have. It's very embarrassing for me. So what I do is I say, oh well, the truth is I get far more than I give. Which by the way is true. And I've said it so many times that I'm starting to wonder about my motivation for going to Zen Hospice. I mean I really get a lot out of it. It's really great. It's an absolutely wonderful experience. So I'm thinking about that. I want to be really clear about what my intention is. So I noticed I was talking to the people that I share my shift with the other day and I said, you know, one of the really nice things about coming here is that when I'm here, I am totally present. I'm not thinking about anything else. When you're in the presence of people who are dying, there's just nothing that's as important as being with them and being present with life. Really, life. And it is so absorbing. I said, you know what I realized? The reason I do this is it's a wonderful place to practice open-heartedness. It's very safe. I don't have to worry. I'm being totally open and somebody is going to hit me upside the head. It's absolutely marvelous. So I've decided that the intention is okay. A second thing you can do with intention is enlist support. Be with people who share your values. This is really important. I had a very good friend who was a friend of mine for many, many years and we've kind of fallen apart. Not deliberately, but really because we don't share our values anymore. I think she thinks I'm crazy. But being with people, coming to the Sangha, it's reinforcing to your intention, whatever your good intentions are. Use a coach. Find somebody who can travel with you on the path. And sometimes the best teacher is the person that irritates you the most. So look for ways to nurture that intention. Join regular gatherings for learning opportunities like listening to me. Or go on retreat. Retreats are quite wonderful. They're really good for getting in touch with what your true intentions are. Create daily reminders. That's what I do with the metasuda. It's a daily reminder of what my intentions are. Set aside time. Make sure you have time for your intentions. Make space. I have a space in my house where I have my cushion, my meditation cushion. And I have a candle. I have a little Buddha icon. And I have a stone that was blessed by the Dalai Lama. And that's a kind of altar. They're just sort of sitting on a window ledge and my cushion is under it. But when I pass that, that's my place. And it's a reminder for me. And it's a place I go all the time when I sit. And it's part of making that habit, that reinforcing of intention. And the final thing is engage in an activity you love. I think the most wonderful thing about intention is that it doesn't have to be a serious thing. Serious in the sense of being burdensome. It can be a very light thing. I have a little quote here from Rumi. Today, like every other day, we wake up empty and frightened. Don't open the door to the study and begin reading. Take down a musical instrument. Let the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground. So we have about 10 minutes. Does anybody have any comments, questions? Yes. Great. And I've only been meditating this mindless meditation for three months. Mindless? That's what I'm talking about. Mindless meditation. Anyway, I've been only doing this for three months. I'm really new with this, right? I'm reading all this stuff about intention today. And I kept thinking, you know, you really need to go on a Thursday night because you never go on a Thursday night. It was just so lovely. Look at all this stuff. But what this book was saying about intention that I was really struggling with today was how when the mind continues to wander, when I'm sitting and I'm trying to focus on the breath and all that, the mind just keeps taking off and I have to keep bringing it back. Sometimes it's really annoying. You know, you just keep doing it. But this book was saying there's an intention there. There's an intention that the mind has of its own. And I'm getting in touch with that intention, the intention of why the mind leaves and what that purpose is and then bringing it back. And I was trying to understand what that was about and I don't understand it at all. And I understand the intentions that you were talking about today. But when the book was talking, and maybe I didn't even understand what I was reading correctly or if I was saying it correctly, but it had to do with my mind. You know, I don't have the concentration yet. I'm still working on it. It's not very new. But it takes off and I have to keep bringing it back. But the book was saying there's an intention there. And it's the reason why it does that. And the stories and the scenarios that we advocate in our head as that's happening also have their own intention. And that's where you start to learn about those deeper levels that you are is by understanding what those are. I don't really get into that. I kind of get it, but I'm not sure I get it right. Well, I don't know what text you're reading. So I have a question for you. What is your mind? No. Are you your mind? And I am your mind? No, I don't think so. I think my mind is a part of you right now. Is your mind, does your mind have a will? Really. Is it a person? Their thoughts. Do thoughts have intention? See, I think you have, I think you have intention. This is a little tricky here, who you are. But the mind, what you're following are your thoughts. Right? I'm not even sure that I would say that your thoughts are your mind. Thoughts just come and go. They're their specs. They're their wisps of things. They don't have any concrete reality. They're just processes. So while you're sitting there, you're having thoughts about what's going on in your life. And you have sort of trains of thoughts. Right? There are kind of tapes that are running. I don't believe those tapes have intent. I think that you can have intention. And when you're bringing yourself back from wherever you've gone, that's an intent to be present. When you follow your thoughts out, I don't think that I would personify your mind into having an intent to take you out. What you might do is think about it this way. As these stories start spinning, you might say, and you notice, ah, I'm in that story again. Feel in your body where that story is. Try to find a feeling in your body that corresponds to where you are with that story. And that'll bring you back. It'll also tell you where that energy rests in your body, whether it's anger or pain or sadness, whatever is associated with those stories. That your psyche is trying to work through this. And you're sitting here just watching. That's all you have to do is watch. If it goes, it goes. That's okay. Watch it go. And then bring it back. When you realize that, then you can come back. But I don't think that there's some, I think there's something that you can gain by where you keep going and say, oh, that's a story. And you can label that story. But I don't think that there's, I'm not quite sure what to think about this idea that there's intention. I think I'm a little bit over here. I should probably read that chapter again. Because sometimes, I don't remember the name of the book. It's not your book, it's another one. But, um, I've got to read. You know, sometimes, because it's all so new, that it gets very complicated. Right. Right. Right. I have a comment on the questions. Comment is my understanding that thoughts arise on any sort of random. And that, um, I'm thinking that intention predisposes thoughts from what I was saying. And my question is, um, what is, you said intention is composed of two things. What would it be? Commitment. Idea in commitment. I've done, the other thing is, um, I'm hearing kind of several ideas or definitions of intention. One is kind of, kind of the thing that directs the work at all, whether you reach it or not. And the other is that which is happening in the present moment. Which, as I said, sort of conditions for things to arrive. Maybe even directs, directs what it's going to say. I think, I think that's true. Um, one of the things that I didn't say that I had in my notes, has to do with the, what I see as the relationship between intention and karma. Which is that, uh, that karma really has to do with conditioning of the present moment. Intention has to do with conditioning the present moment. And the more that we do something, the more that arises. So it is about conditioning the present moment. And it is, um, and what that means is that your thoughts can influence what happens next. And that your thoughts are in turn influenced by your intention. So it's very, it's very connected and interwoven. I think that's true. I think that's how it works. I think that's the way it works. That, and that's the importance of intention. That it does create karma. It does create what happens. It's where you go. Yeah, thank you. Okay, I have one more thing. One last reading. This is called Notice. It's by Steve Kowat. K-O-W-I-T. This evening, the sturdy Levi's I wore every day for over a year and which seemed to the end in perfect condition, suddenly tore. How or why? I don't know. But there it was, a big rip at the crotch. A month ago, my friend Nick walked off a basketball, a racquetball court, showered, got into his street clothes, and halfway home collapsed and died. Take heed, you who read this, and drop to your knees now and again, like the poet Christopher Smart, and kiss the earth and be joyful, and make much of your time, and be kindly to everyone, even to those who do not deserve it. For although you may not believe it will happen, you too will one day be gone. I, like those Levi's ripped at the crotch, for no reason, assure you that such is the case. Pass it on.
