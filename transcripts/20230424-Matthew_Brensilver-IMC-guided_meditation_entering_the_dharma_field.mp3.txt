So welcome, welcome folks.
Yeah, nice to see, I'm familiar with a lot of those names.
Very sweet to see you in the chat.
And yeah, happy to be with you this week.
So let's do a thing we do and kind of just take the posture and trust that the Dharma is there waiting for us.
Thank you.
Maybe we've sat enough times contemplated the Dharma for enough months or years.
Just taking the posture reminds us of everything.
The poignancy of our life, the endlessness, suffering in this realm,
strength and fragility of goodness,
the miracle and blessing of this path.
I wasn't feeling all of that five minutes ago.
But in seeing your names, taking the posture, it's all right here now.
Thank you.
Let your breathing remind you of the Dharma.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Our practice, of course, is about opening to the intensity of this realm.
But it's also about refuge, protecting ourself from intensity.
We use the simple ways of directing attention, the rhythm of our breathing,
as a way of taking a kind of shelter for the heart momentarily.
As a way of putting down the riddle of our life temporarily.
The world gets as small and as big as our breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Whenever our mind goes tending
to what we imagine our life is,
we just fold that into the breathing, just fold it all back into the breathing.
It's like we feed it, we feed our thoughts, ruminations,
anticipation and memory, we just feed it all to our breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Excitement, agitation, hope.
We put all our hope into this moment, this breath.

Ajahn Sajita sometimes uses the language of entering,
entering Dhamma fields.
Sometimes like we're just pointing the attentional spotlight to the sensations of breathing.
But more generally we're entering a field, Dhamma, Dhamma field.
Entering a realm where everything, including our so-called mistakes, our Dhamma,
everything reminds us of Bure Dhamma Sangha.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
