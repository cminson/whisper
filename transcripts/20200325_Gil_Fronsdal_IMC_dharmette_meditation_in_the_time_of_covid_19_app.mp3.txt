 
 Dharmette:  Meditation  in the Time of 
COVID -19 
 
Transcribed  and edited  from  a short  talk by Gil 
Fronsdal  on March  25, 2020  
 
 
I’m very aware  of the challenges  that many  people  have  
– in our society  and around  the globe.  In Redwood  City, 
a few people  here and there  go for walks  or run. It’s 
pretty  quiet.  It seems  like a very nice time to be walking  
on the streets.  It seems  like things  are peaceful.  But 
there  are plenty  of people  for whom it’s not so peaceful.  
There  are challenges  of all kinds  that come  with being  
sheltered  in place : not having  work,  or even  having  a 
place  to live perhaps.  There  are challenges  with being  
sick, being  concerned  about  becoming  sick, or being  
concerned  about  loved  ones , or people  in New York,  
Los Angeles,  the Bay Area,  Spain,  Italy,  Japan,  and 
Thailand.   
 
These  are extraordinary  times  we’re  living  in. For those  
of us who meditate,  these  are times  that we can call 
upon  meditation  as a support.  But the question  that all 
of us can ask is, “What kind of support  do we want  
meditation  to provide  us?” It’s useful  to become  clear  
about  what  that support  is. Is it simply  a support  to not 
be distressed , or to be a little bit calm  and peaceful?   
 That’s  valuable.  We need  people  who can be calm.  But 
is it to be calm  and removed , or is it to be calm  and 
somehow  present  and supportive?   
 
Is it a time for us to meditate  so that we have  greater  
compassion  and care for others?   
 
I’m in awe of doctors,  nurses,  and medical  professi onals  
and what  they have  to do now,  what  they’re  gearing  up 
to do, or fully involved  to do. Some  of them  have  
responsibilities  at home  with children  and parents  to 
take care of. And now they’re  caring  for people  who 
have  the coronavirus,  not knowing  whether  they will 
become  sick, and where  it all is going?  
 
We share  this experience  of the pandemic  with our 
society.  We feel like we’re  in it with everyone  else.  So 
how can meditation  support  us and help us in how we 
share  it? If we share  it only with our fear, challenges  or 
distress,  then perhaps  we’re  not really  sharing  it with 
everyone.  If we’re  only aware  of our own challenges  
and difficulties  right now,  maybe  meditation  can give us 
the space  to understand  that we’re  really  sharing  these  
difficulties  with millions  of people,  hundreds  of millions  
of people  or billions  of people.  It’s a shared  human  
experience.   
 
What  does  that do to us when  we open  up and see it as 
a shared  experience,  that what’s  happening  to others  is  
 in some  ways  happening  to us? Even  in the isolation  of 
being  sheltered  in place,  what  if this is not a time to just 
be thinking  about  and taking  care of oneself.  How can 
we think  wisely  and usefully  for others?  How can we be 
informed  in ways  that make  us a better  person  for the 
world  around  us? How can we empathize  and care for 
people  far away?  How can we symp athize  with the 
plight  and challenges  they’re  in?  
 
This is a time for lots of love and compassion.  If any of 
us have  been  cultivating  love and compassion,  this is 
the time for it. This is the time to tap into our capacity  to 
sit and meditate , as a way of tapping  into our capacity  
for care and compassion  – our capacity  to be a 
companion  who holds  the suffering  of others  and 
accompanies  the world  – just as others  accompany  us 
in our challenges  in this time and place.  
 
I think  it’s really  important  that medit ation  at this time in 
our society  be understood  to be something  that 
supports  and connects  us to others.  It has a role and 
place  in how we as individuals  meet  the situation  we 
find ourselves  in, so that we don’t  close  in or push  out 
the world  around  us, or try to just hunker  down  and take 
care of me, myself  and mine.  If meditation  is helping  us 
to only do that, maybe  we’re  not really  living  up to the 
full potential  of what  Buddhist  meditation  is about.   
  
 We want  to find a way to meditate  so that we have  the 
capacity  to breathe  easily,  openly,  and kindly  as we 
read the news,  talk to friends  and family  members,  and 
go through  our own challenges  – with food,  family  we’re  
living  with, our health ... It goes  on and on. 
 
So we pause,  like the whole  globe  is pausing , in order  
to reflect  deeply.  I’m really  fond of the idea of the word  
‘contemplative. ’ People  may have  different  associations  
with it. But for me, a contemplative  is someone  who is 
living  their life from the depth  of their heart.  They’re  
reflecting  deeply.  They’re  connected  to something  that’s  
spiritual  and sacred.  They’re  connected  to the depths  of 
awareness,  presence,  and compassion.  A 
contemplative  is trying  to live from a different  set of 
values  that come  from being  deeply  connected  to the 
inner  life, and the outer  life. What  a time it is to be a 
contemplative!  What  a time it is to be a contemplative  
within  the world , as part of the world!   
 
What’s  been  on my mind  today  is the many  people  who 
have  challenges  and are suffering.  Some  people  say  
there  is a tsunami  coming  in some  places  in the world.  
The number  of people  getting  the coronavirus  is going  
to increase  dramatically  in the next few weeks.  We don’t  
know  what  kinds  of challenges  our society  will have.   
 
I hope  that meditation  makes  us someone  who is better  
prepared  for addressing  how we are in relationship  to all  
 this – that our meditation  is relevant  for what  the world  
is going  through , and that we become  a contemplative  
in heart,  body,  and mind.  I hope  that, in some  small  
way, we are not an island  in the world , but rather  a raft 
for people  in need . I hope  that somehow  our calm,  our 
care,  and our support  make  a difference  for the welfare  
and happiness  of others.  That is certainly  my heartfelt  
wish at this time.   
 
I hope  that in whatever  ways  we’ve  sat and meditated  
today , that any benefits  these  teachings  might  help 
provide  for the welfare  and happiness  of everyone  on 
this globe.   
 
Just as this virus  has touched  almost  everyone  on this 
globe  in one way or another,  may it be that our care and 
love – our collected , shared  humanity,  concern,  and 
support  for each  other  be spread  out so that we will 
remember  this time of the COVID -19 virus  as a time 
where  everyone  came  together,  supported  each  other,  
and helped  everyone  get through  this.  
 
May our meditation  help that to be so. Thank  you.
