Are you aware?
Being aware, being with experience, this quality of awareness, sometimes it can feel
as if we are looking at experience, kind of separated from experience as an observer looking at
something. That is one way that awareness can function. And that way of awareness functioning
can be kind of emphasized in a way by the language that we use for being aware. We use
often the language of observing, witnessing, looking at. And that does emphasize the sense of
separation, observer and observed as separate. The way
awareness is functioning in a particular moment may have that quality and be completely balanced
in a way that awareness is knowing experience. Sometimes there's a different quality to the
awareness, which feels more almost internal to the experience, not separated from the
experience. I used the language, mindfulness can infuse the experience earlier today. This
doesn't have a quality of observing at a distance or looking at. It's more, and sometimes the language
we use to express our practice to ourselves can influence or the language we use about how
we practice can shape or condition the experience. And so I just also offer some other language for
awareness, being with experience. Can we be with what's here? Feeling into, touching into
experience.
We may have a kind of a preference or a conditioned habitual way that we tend to be aware.
And with that kind of habitual way of being aware or sense of kind of a landing in that
familiarity, we might miss that there are other experiences that other ways of being aware that
are equally infused with wise attitude.
At one point, Sayodo asked me what the experience was like when there wasn't any kind of reactivity
or defilement in the mind. I just went off to explore that. And I came back and described
to him, you know, sometimes Sayodo, it feels like I'm separated from the experience, like
the mind is just observing kind of from a distance. And sometimes it feels like I'm
right in the middle of the experience. And his response was the mind in those two situations
is having a different emphasis on what it's interested in in that experience. He said
when there's the sense of separation, there's the observer and the thing observed and the
sense of looking at it from a distance. He said in that situation, the mind is interested
in the fact that the observing and the observed, the object and the awareness, are different
functions in the mind. They're different, different things happening in the mind. The
knowing and the object, the awareness and the object are different. He said in the other
situation where it feels like they're happening at the same time, where they're happening
together, that kind of the awareness is inside the experience. He said in that situation,
the mind is more interested in the fact that the knowing and the observed thing, the object
and the knowing, are happening at the same time, that there's no separation between them
in terms of that. That investigation for me really helped to kind of shake up the idea
that there's one way that it feels when I'm aware. It sparked a curiosity to just be curious
about, well, awareness is here. What is this like? How is the awareness? How is it knowing
the object? Reminds are such creatures of familiarity. We will so often seek out what's
familiar. And in this practice, we might think of ourselves as being more of an explorer.
Instead of gravitating towards the familiar, we're exploring the unknown, exploring what
is unfamiliar. That can take some courage because we really like the familiar. And yet
there can be such a delight at times in the opening to something new, opening to the Dharma
each moment, each moment new. Truly, that is the case. It is mostly our concepts that have
us believe that this moment is the same as the one before, that the next days will be
similar to this one. We are in a place in time right now that that is pretty clear that
days are different than they used to be. And we're not sure what's to come. It's actually
a really powerful condition for us. One teacher, Philip Moffat, uses the phrase liminal space,
kind of a place where we're in transition. This time is very much a time of transition.
There's a lot of power to that. If we can open to it courageously. Are you aware?
What is obvious? And how are you in relationship to the experience?
That's
