Arriving. 
Arriving in this moment, in this place where you're physically located. 
In this time, opening to how you are right now. 
Here and now. 
However you are, can your heart open to that? Allow how you are to be so that it can be received in awareness. 
Receiving your experience as it is. 
This can take some trust at times to open to just how you are in this moment. 
Trusting the value of that. 
Trusting the value of opening to what is here in this moment. 
When we open to our experience, from a particular perspective, a perspective of curiosity and openness and allowing, what is this experience as a human experience. 
That perspective begins to let wisdom grow, begins to let the possibility of transformation happen. 
It doesn't necessarily happen quickly. 
And yet the power of mindfulness and wisdom to transform our hearts and minds. 
It's one of the strongest powers or potencies there is in terms of transformation. 
When we can rest with just what is here, if that's confusion or anger or fear or love or compassion. 
Wisdom and awareness help us to understand and feel the difference between more wholesome responses, helpful responses to the world and less helpful, unskillful responses to the world and to our experience. 
At some point the Buddha called our experience and said, what I call the world is this experience of the sadhana body. 
The internal and the external coming together in our experience in this moment. 
Well, sometimes this exploration of being with, of allowing what's here, sometimes can feel passive. 
The power of wisdom and awareness together is not passive. 
It works, those forces work on our hearts and minds. 
Begin to support this transformation of letting go a release of those energies that create struggle, distress, suffering, both internally and externally. 
So can you for this time, sitting together, explore this possibility of cultivating this perspective of curiosity of what is this experience? What is this human experience that's arising right now, here and now? Can the heart hold it, be open to it, feel the suffering or the joy of what is here? Whatever is happening for you, whatever is unfolding, it's allowed in this field of awareness and wisdom, even anger, to be allowed. 
This transformation and joy are allowed. 
This activity of allowing and receiving isn't the only way to engage with experience, but it is a crucial support of helping us to understand what the skillful and the unskillful are. 
When reactivity, when states based in greed, aversion, delusion are arising. 
The holding of them with compassion and love and allowing is possible. 
And that place can lead to transformation both internally and externally. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
