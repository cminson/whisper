The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So I would like to talk about compassion today.
And it is one of the great ideals of Buddhism.
Some people associate Buddhism with compassion and wisdom.
And I can confidently say that I would not be sitting here today
if it wasn't for people who had compassion for me or experienced their compassion.
And if compassion and experience of it struggles with it, we're not at the center of my own life.
It's been a very important part of shaping me as an adult, as a practitioner, as even a teacher.
But having said that, I would also like to say, because it's kind of an ideal, ideals are dangerous.
And people will often come to Buddhism for answers.
And answers to life's big questions or answers to the personal challenges and whatever.
And it depends on the perspective.
Maybe you could say, yes, Buddhism has all kinds of answers.
But for today, I'd like to say that Buddhism doesn't provide answers.
What Buddhism provides is a very clear mirror in which we can see ourselves.
So we can find the answers here within ourselves.
Not because you've thought it out, you know, the reason they're all out to the answers.
But there's something deeper, some deep seeing of ourselves that we do through Buddhist practice.
And so that's a very significant statement that the answers are not in Buddhism, but they're in ourselves.
Because that's an encouragement to turn the attention out of trying to get a PhD in Buddhist studies or the equivalent,
which some people do, and instead to turn the attention deeply in and see what we discover there.
So in relationship to compassion then, compassion is not a singular thing, a singular state.
And so, but many people will think it's the singular state.
It just is what they think it is.
It is how they've experienced it for themselves.
And then when they're being compassionate, they just have one option of how to be compassionate.
But that one option might not be the best option.
It might not be the range of options of what compassion can be.
Many years ago here in this room, on Monday night, I asked the people,
how do you know you're aware?
And it wasn't a rhetorical question.
I was just curious what people would say.
But I was surprised by the answers.
And what surprised me was how wide-ranging the answers were.
And I realized that I had been naive as a teacher, or somehow.
I also had this operating idea that whatever I thought awareness was, and I teach about awareness,
that I assumed everyone else had the same idea.
And when I heard all the different answers, I was so in awe and so appreciative.
And so, wow, there's a lot of things.
When I say awareness, people are receiving it in different ways.
And maybe each of the different ways is a good idea.
Maybe because their idea is good also, it works fine.
But so the same thing with compassion.
I think there's many, many ways in which people hear the word compassion have what they have in mind.
Sharon Salzburg tells a story of going to Russia and teaching in English with a translator.
And she would use the word compassion in a talk, the kind of talk maybe she would give in the United States.
A talk that usually had people kind of inspired when they heard the word compassion.
You could tell by the audience's expression.
And when the translator translated into Russian, everyone got sunk and depressed looking.
And so finally she asked, you know, what's this word you're translating as compassion?
And I don't know what it was exactly, her book that she wrote about it and says it,
but it was like maybe misery.
And so the reference point for what compassion is is different.
And in fact, the same thing is true in Buddhist languages.
The word Karuna or the way these words are translated or understood are very different
than some of these other Asian languages in the English word compassion.
And if it was translated more like how people understand it,
I think some of us would maybe not be so, you know, it wouldn't quite click for us in English speakers.
So that's a way of saying that maybe many things are compassion.
But the emphasis of the talk today is you're welcome to have compassion as you think it is, maybe.
But rather what I want to stress today is not what compassion is,
but what compassion is accompanied with.
So maybe there's an ecology of our hearts or minds,
and that ecology comes along with all kinds of different species.
And maybe compassion is just one of those species.
And how that species operates in a particular ecology depends on the other species that are there.
There might be a lot of invasive species which are causing a problem,
or there might be other species that can't extinct, and that causes a problem.
So there's all kinds of things that might accompany compassion.
So what accompanies your compassion?
What accompanies your care, your love for other people or for yourself?
And that I think part of the kind of the opening up, what is this?
And the other thing is what are some of the inner mental activities, qualities, states that contribute,
that are the foundation for you to be compassionate.
And as I've taught recently on YouTube in 7 a.m.,
there are different kinds of awareness that people have, just like I pointed out in the beginning,
that different people say different things as awareness.
We actually have many things that could be awareness, many ways in which we attend,
many ways in which we have attention for different things.
And so if we only have one idea of what awareness is,
then as we are aware of suffering in the world or in ourselves,
that one way of being aware might not be the best one for the circumstance.
Maybe if you're a feeling person, only feeling compassion and identifying with compassion of someone else
might actually be harmful for you, might not be actually a good thing.
But if you have this idea, I'm supposed to be compassionate, and this is what I think compassion is,
and then you get completely dispirited by it or exhausted by it,
the problem might not be with compassion.
The problem might not be about other people's suffering is too much.
It might be the way in which you receive it, the way how you're aware of it.
So rather than emphasizing the feeling of it, you emphasize the knowing of it, a little more cognitive,
that might actually create a more balanced and healthy kind of connection to suffering.
So the how we're compassionate, what accompanies it is part of it.
But before I kind of go into that more, I want to, wonderful, I think it's a wonderful kind of etymology game,
the root of words.
The Sanskrit and Pali word, Indian word for compassion is usually, in our scene, is karuna.
And that comes from the root ker, which means to make or to do.
And so some people will see that karuna is sacred action.
It's a very special kind of form of acting in the world.
And what I like about this is that it involves an activity.
It's a creative aspect of what we do.
It's not about being a victim.
It's not what the world does to us, but rather what arises and merges from us as we meet the world.
So it's a kind of action of sorts, a mental action, action of the heart.
And to see it as something that merges rather than something that reacts to,
something that we contribute rather than something that, as I said before, maybe the victim of.
Possibly experiencing, you know, we're possibly experiencing suffering in some way and we have compassion just.
So it might, it might arrive intuitively.
It might arrive without something we make happen.
But still it's something that emerges in response, which might change the kind of orientation we have about what compassion is.
That often, too often people, I think, who are troubled by compassion or get exhausted, they're allowing themselves a little bit to be the victim of it.
It's happening to them rather than being centered in the place where we kind of are the agents of our life or the source of our life.
I like to remember the agent, maybe the source of our life.
And as we sit in meditation, there also we're not supposed to end up becoming passive people who just kind of passively aware.
It's a whole process of discovery, the mere feeling here to let go of, to shed all the unhealthy ways in which we're attached, clinging, hateful, unhealthy ways of being afraid.
And let, let all that fall away to discover that we have a capacity, a wonderful source within that animates us.
A wonderful source within that is a source of the sacred action, a sacred kind of place of where life can, or inner life, how we live in the world can come from.
And that the more free we are in Buddhism, the more that inner source that emerges replaces the controlling mind, the figuring out mind, the reactive mind.
And there's something beautiful here for us to come from.
So compassion is this interaction that emerges as a response, but not as a reaction.
So one of the meanings of compassion is, is to be in the presence of suffering.
And I say it that way carefully.
So I'm not saying feeling suffering.
Empathy, as wonderful as it might be, also has many meanings.
And sometimes empathy, people interpret it, I have to feel what other people are feeling.
And if we're straight out equally feeling their suffering in the same way they're suffering, we're feeling their suffering the same way they're feeling it, we're in trouble.
You know, it's just, you know, if it's, you know, it's so, you know, are we supposed to feel as bad as they are?
No, that's not the point.
So for some people to feel someone else's suffering, how do we, how would we be present for it to be attuned to it, not to ignore it, not to be a distance, not to kind of hold it at bay, but to be attuned, to be in harmony with it,
to be present for it is a very different kind of language and experience than to feel other people's suffering.
Now, some of you might find this troubling, I'm saying this, and maybe your way of feeling, it just works really wonderful, because again, there's many ways in which people feel the word, right?
You have to feel sorry for Dharma teachers, I hope, because we have to use words, and that's why you should feel sorry for us.
Because, you know, words have definitions, and definitions are, different people have different definitions for words.
And so we might miss you, or we might be partial, we can't say it all or something.
So, so, so you might have a wonderful way of feeling that works fine and keeps you in balance.
But in terms of this mirror that Buddhism is, what I'm teaching here about, maybe this is a mirror for you to look, the way that I feel other people's suffering, is that really the best way?
Is that being attuned to myself and others? Is that being in harmony with it?
What does gil mean by harmony with suffering?
So that's a good mirror to consider, like, is there, rather than just feeling, what would it mean to be in harmony with it, or attuned to it?
And one of the things I'd like it to mean is you're not a victim of the suffering, that you're not taking on it as a burden, you're not caught up in taking responsibility for it,
which has been, maybe still is a little bit, my Achilles heel, to feel responsible. I have to do something here and it's up to me.
And if that's what comes along with the feeling of suffering, you know, feeling it, that is not really, in the big picture, so healthy.
So part of the definition I'd like to offer for compassion is to be in the presence of suffering, ourselves and the suffering of others,
and to have the aspiration for it to end, the aspiration for it to come to an end, and kind of eliminate that simply.
What's lacking in that definition of compassion is doing anything about it, the action part.
So I would like to bracket that for now. And first, what compassion in its simplest forms, I would propose, is to be present for suffering in some way,
and have within us the aspiration for that suffering to come to an end, or to be weakened or lessened in some way.
And I use the word aspiration very carefully as well, because I'm inspired by the word aspiration, more than I'm inspired by the word the desire,
or even the wish, rather than desire that suffering not be there, or the wish that not be there.
Aspiration for me is part of this emergent, deeper quality, I think because it's related to the word breathing.
And so to aspire, like respire, to aspire comes from some place deep inside that is not reactive, doesn't come from fear, doesn't come from this kind of
heady idea of responsibility, doesn't come from shoulds that we've learned from society. It comes from something deep inside that can only come when our breathing is easy,
an easeful breath, a relaxed breath. And the Buddha has this word in Pali that's translated as assurance, to feel assured.
And the literal meaning of the word is to breathe easily. And so this meditation practice and Buddhist practice, one of the goals is to live a life
where you can breathe easily. Someone asks you, what is meditation? Breathing with ease. Wouldn't that be a nice definition?
So the aspiration, what comes when you breathe with ease? So when you're in the presence of suffering, what happens to your breathing?
That's part of the ecology. That's part of what accompanies compassion. How you're breathing, as you're breathing, as you're breathing tightened up,
as you're breathing getting short and shallow, you're hyperventilating. What's happening with your breathing? And somehow have you lost touch with an easeful breath?
And you might then argue, well, I'm not supposed to have an easeful breath now. This is a serious thing. This person's having it. I'm supposed to be tense.
Be careful with that assumption. The reason why you should be careful with this is that you have to be tense.
One of the reasons is so the other people think is because then other person can see that I care.
One of the most significant early experiences of compassion I had was when someone I was very close to was almost looked like the person was going to die.
And there was a Zen teacher who I was standing in a courtyard a little bit and I was explaining my situation.
And this person was so relaxed and at ease hearing all this in the way I wasn't and had the most level of compassion and understanding of what I was going through.
Anybody else that I've ever talked to about it. And that combination of clearly he understood, clearly care deeply.
And clearly there was a kind of love present. And the person was at ease.
It was calm. I had never seen that combination. And that was one of those things that changed my life to be in the presence of that.
So to breathe easily. So aspiration. Where does the wish for someone not suffer come from in you?
It can come from fear. It can come more from your own discomfort than the discomfort of the other person.
I can't stand this. This is too much for me. Let's get the aspirin. Let's get whatever. Let's get this to stop.
So I have to do something here. We have to fix it. And that's my compassion.
I can guarantee that if you're too overtly acting that way, you're probably not helping the person you're helping, trying to do.
It's mostly about yourself. So this breathing easily is aspiration.
And then what else does it come with? This being present for others. What else is there in that presence and that attention?
The aspiration. What else is there? It's not uncommon that it can come with a lot of conceit.
Maybe not the kind of conceit that we talk about. That person is conceited.
But a lot of self-concern. How we look to other people. How we appear to them. And how they judge us.
And what they'll think of us. And what I'm supposed to do. And what kind of person I'm supposed to be.
I'm supposed to be compassionate like, I don't know, someone.
So all this selfing. All this self-identity. All this self-concepts that are coming into play.
That are making the whole, that's kind of muddying the water. Agitating it all.
That makes it hard for the easy breathing. Making it hard for it to kind of just flow in some natural way.
So I think for many people this idea of self and me experiencing it. Me doing something.
It's complicated because it's a magnet for ideas. You have what is supposed to be a good person.
What it's like to be a bad person. I'm not supposed to be.
And all those things. Can they be shed? Can they be let go of?
Maybe not easily. But if you keep doing a regular practice of meditation. You'll learn how to drop some of that.
All this extra baggage that we carry around so much. Often extra baggage around self.
And so if you really want to be compassionate in this world.
Meditate. Be mindful. So you'll learn how to shed.
The concepts of self that complicate your capacity to breathe easily in the presence of suffering.
Does aversion arise? Some people have so chronically or so consistently have aversion in their life.
They don't even know they have it. And so their idea of compassion is inseparable from having some aversion.
It might be aversion to the suffering, not the person. But it's still there.
Some people operate with a kind of chronic or perpetual forms of wanting something. Needing something.
And so when there's compassion, that sense of neediness is also kind of entangled with a compassion.
But we don't see it because we have no experience.
It's invisible to us how much we're always operating with desires all the time.
And this again is why mindfulness and meditation is so helpful.
As we get quieter and stiller and more stable meditation, what we start seeing better and better.
The inner drives of aversion, of hostility, of anger. The inner drives of desire and neediness that might be there.
And when we see it better, that's good news. Most people think it's bad news.
It's good news because if you see it clearly, then you start becoming free of it.
It might still be there, but the doctor doesn't have to influence what's going on.
So even just what I've said so far is explaining that a different way of being with compassion than maybe you ever thought about.
It's practicing with it. It's taking a second look. It's stopping with it.
It's something not just to assume as one thing, and you have to do that one thing and be that way.
But it's actually something to stop and take a good look on.
Have the mirror of mindfulness really. What is this? What's going on when I'm compassionate?
What definitions of self are complicating it? What's happening with my breathing?
What are the desires and aversions that are operating? What are the fears that are operating with it?
And how do they influence the compassion? What is my confusion and doubts?
Are there confusion and doubts in it?
And so to look at this, and then on the more healthy side of it, which is what I talked about this last week at 7 a.m.,
is there wisdom operating together with the compassion?
And the wisdom is to really look at how we're aware, look at how we're engaging.
Can we recognize what direction are we moving?
Not what's happening to me, but what direction am I going here?
I think there's a lot of people who overemphasize what's happening to them, as if they have to understand it and be with it and struggle with it.
But in Buddhism we're often looking, where is this going in the next second, in the next minute?
So if I really feel like aversion to my confusion around the suffering I'm experiencing,
if I kind of get caught up in that aversion, I have to fix things there, I have to change things, I better, you know, whatever,
I can immediately, with wisdom, you can immediately sense, oh, this is going in a bad direction.
This is going to make me more tense. This is feeding aversion.
If instead you see that, yes, I'm full of confusion, but if I bring mindfulness to the confusion,
yet that's going in a better direction for the next few seconds.
Look at that. So to bring wisdom to bear on our compassion,
and shorthand of what I talked about the last five days, is to have these questions.
Where is this going right now? What momentum? How is this leaning?
And then by seeing clearly that we always have one of two options.
We have the option to make it worse, the situation, or make the situation better, in some way or the other.
At the minimum, mindfulness makes all situations better, just to be mindful of it.
Distractedness, being distracted and not mindful generally makes things worse.
Being self-critical makes it worse. Being self-accepting, self-loving, makes it a little bit better.
So that path. So is there joy with a compassion, or is a compassion sweet?
I like the word sweet. Again, what I mean by sweet and you mean by sweet might be very different.
What I mean by joy, you mean by joy every different. But is there something that feels really right?
Something that you value, how you feel when you have the compassion?
If you don't, something is probably needs to be fine-tuned.
The attunement is not quite right. The harmony is not found.
It's not easy to find the sweetness of compassion, but it is possible.
And so if you start kind of looking, there's more to compassion than just a singular idea.
Compassion has these things accompanying it, and those accompaniments make a big difference.
So is there sweetness? Is there some degree of tranquility? Is there some calm with your...
If you're tense, probably it affects your breathing.
If you're tense, probably that compassion can't be so attuned and in harmony with the situation you're in.
Is there some equanimity? An equanimity here I define as non-reactivity.
It doesn't mean non-responsiveness, but as reactivity is this kind of...
In Buddhism, reactivity is not healthy. This emergent responsiveness is a whole different animal that we're looking for
that can only really happen well when the breathing is easy.
Imagine that. Breathing in an easy way is like one of the great keys to a good life.
It's a key to wisdom. It's a key to finding our way in this life.
But to say it is so simple, but to do it.
Breathing is one of those great mirrors. We're always looking for mirrors in Buddhism.
Because the answers are here in ourselves. And breathing is one of those mirrors.
So all this I'm saying today is before you act.
So that's a big list of things to do.
Gil, if someone might say. You're telling me to go spend the next two hours going through a checklist
before I help my neighbor who needs groceries.
But to start doing the practices, looking at using this compassion mirror to understand yourself better
and over the days, weeks, months and years you do it, this will become second nature.
Some months you'll be focusing more on your breathing. Some months more on the sweetness.
So you begin finding your way with it. And this is a practice that will develop and mature your compassion
over the years that you do it. And it will become second nature.
And if the person needs to go to the emergency room, don't go through the checklist of all these things.
Don't worry about if your compassion is off. Just take them to the ER and then deal with it later yourself.
But the idea is to become wise, really wise about what the compassion is.
So when the aspiration for the suffering to end is in a time and place where you can act,
you can act for a really good foundation.
And so maybe you become for someone else what that Zen teacher was for me.
Turns out that what you do for the person will change their life less than the fact that you are able to be there
in a caring, loving way, really present understanding and have a deep sense of ease, palpable sense of ease.
And that those all came together in such a way that, wow, is this possible in this life?
And maybe you'll change someone else's life.
Maybe you manage to get them their groceries or to the ER.
But how you did it was what changed their life.
Not that the fact that they had more food to eat or that the doctors helped them out in something.
So I think it's a sacred work, this work of looking deeply and practicing with our response to and our presence to suffering in the world.
And our compassion, our care, our kindness, our friendliness.
It's sacred work because it has a lot to do with our connectivity with other people.
How we live in the presence of others and that bridge, those relationships that we have.
That's not sacred.
I'd like to know what you think is.
And maybe we're both right.
But it's a sacred work to find an attunement and harmony and aspiration in the world of compassion and suffering.
May you find it towards yourself.
May you find it towards others.
And may all of us be nourished by the sweetness of compassion.
Thank you.
So we have about five minutes before we scheduled ending.
And then I'm going to go up pretty quickly after that to set up for this community meeting we have.
But if any of you would like to have a comment or a question about any of this.
Especially if you feel like you'd feel unsettled without asking it.
Or you have a testimonial about compassion.
Hi. Could you provide the Polly word for assurance and breathing easy again?
It's the Polly word. I don't think I would have it accurately anymore.
But I think it's Asada. I think.
Your story actually reminded me of something that just happened in the last year. My father-in-law had a heart attack.
And my husband of course was distraught over it.
And he lives in India. So of course you can't do anything right away.
Like you can't hop in a car and go see your father-in-law to make sure things are taken care of.
But that's of course what my husband wanted to do is like find the flight and like let's go as quickly as possible.
And I said wait, just take a deep breath. Even if we get a flight right now, it won't leave till tomorrow.
So just take a deep breath. Let's assess the situation. Let's just take a moment to figure out one.
Do we need to go right now? Maybe we can, if he's stable, we can leave in a week and we'll go see him.
And it'll be okay. Anyway, a lot of things ended up happening. We didn't end up going to India.
But the point was just being able to just take a moment to calm before rushing to do this, that and the other thing really helped.
Ensure that we didn't just react out of compassion.
And you had enough calm to offer him a different perspective so he could kind of relax a little bit.
Yes.
Wonderful. I wish you'd been around me sometimes in my life.
I mean I've had times in my life, it's been a good number of years ago now, where I reacted quickly.
And recently I was reminded that I once called the fire department and they came because I didn't take a second look.
If I just paused long enough to take a second look, I would have realized that nothing was needed.
So the last one. If you could take the mic.
The question this lady raises is a very important one to me.
I wonder if the kind of situation they were facing, was it compassion or was it program response that you were supposed to do a certain thing in a certain way?
Because we all faced that.
So you're a little slower. So the program response?
Yeah, as opposed to compassion.
A program response I suppose is acting on habit or on policy that we see from our society.
This is what you're supposed to do.
Exactly.
Yeah.
So I think that if we keep using this mirror of mindfulness to look at ourselves, hopefully we'll recognize what's driving our, if it's a program, if it's a should,
then I would put that in the category of reactivity because it's a kind of a surface response that comes from the concepts, ideas of what we have.
And I would take the time then and really delve, settle more deeply in and see if there's a deeper source for the compassion.
Or it could be either or it could be a combination.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay, so again, so one of the things I did in this talk I think is to, I distinguished or separated out the aspiration that someone, the wish that someone suffering ends from our acting on it.
It doesn't have to be so separate, but by distinguishing them and separating them, it's an encouragement to pause and settle back and wait and see where the action might come from.
And in that looking more deeply, it's a whole ecology of what is accompanying what you call compassion.
And you might discover there's a lot there that's worth taking into account and practicing with and before you act.
So thank you very much.
