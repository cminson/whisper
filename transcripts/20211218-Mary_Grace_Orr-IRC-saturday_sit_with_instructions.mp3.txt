So, this morning we come to, we are in already.
It's later in the morning for you than it is for me.
We are in the last full day of practice.
Sometimes when I come to the last full day, I like to realize that if it were the only
full day of practice that I had, how precious it would be.
And sometimes I remind myself not to leave the retreat before I leave the retreat.
So the encouragement is for you all to be here as fully as possible, present with mind
and body and heart, present, simply present.
There is no lineage of practice that I've ever heard of that does not encourage us
to be present.
So here's a simple image to hold the instructions for practice together.
It's one that many people find very helpful.
And that's the image of the spider in her web.
Her attention is the spider, and she hangs out, as most spiders do, in the middle of
her web, hanging out with awareness of breath, the sitting, breathing body, just resting
there.
The breath is known for calming and collecting the mind, also a great assist in concentrating
the mind.
It's a very good way to begin any period of practice.
And of course it's a great place to go back to if you get lost or confused.
So we just sit with the breath, giving it our attention, one breath at a time.
This is the way the breath is.
This is the way this breath is, long or short, deep or shallow, sweet and delicious or raggedy
and uncomfortable.
It's not your job to make it be a particular kind of breath.
It's your job to meet it, this breath, this amazing breath that sustains our mind.
It sustains our life.
But if you've ever watched a spider for any length of time, occasionally things come along
and bump into her web, or his web, their web.
And when that happens, the spider leaves the center place and goes and investigates, what
is this?
And I eat it, and I take it in.
And so sometimes in our meditation web, things come along that are really intense, and they
make it difficult to stay with the breath, if not impossible.
Sometimes it's a strong body sensation, an itch or some pain or some heat or some cold
or sound.
And so we leave the center of the web and go and sit with that experience, maybe naming
it if that's helpful to you.
What is this experience of hearing, or what we call itching, or what we call heat?
Really getting interested, seeing what happens when you penetrate it with your attention.
Sometimes it begins to seem a bit different from our initial experience of it.
And it is helpful to notice the pleasantness or the unpleasantness or the neither that allows
us to stay with it just as it is.
And then when it subsides, or it's less interesting, returning to that center place, returning
to the breath.
Sometimes what comes is a strong experience of the heart-mind aspect of our being.
It might be a wave of grief or a wave of fear or anger, one of the more aversive states.
It might be a strong experience of desire or happiness or joy.
It might be a storm of thoughts or one kind of obsessive thought.
So when that happens, again, the spider leaves the center and goes to investigate, oh, what
is this?
What is this sadness?
Sitting with it, allowing it to unpack itself a little bit, penetrating it with our awareness,
not thinking about it, just being with it.
What is this experience of desire and letting that unpack itself?
And then again, when it's less intense, not so interesting, or it subsides, going back
to the center, or sometimes something else is bumped into the web, you're hanging there
with your sadness and all of a sudden your back is so painful, so you go from the experience
of the back to the experience of the pain and then back to the center.
Now I don't think it happens too much with real spiders, but in our case, sometimes we
fall out of the web and then we get lost in that thought storm or some daydream or an
attack of sleepiness and we're not in that very moment, we're not meditating.
But spiders are pretty good at climbing back into their webs and so you can take your attention
back into your meditation web, taking it back to the center and beginning again.
There are no rules about what can bump into your web.
There's nothing that you cannot be mindful of, so whatever comes, that's where you rest
your attention and then take it back to the center, to the breath, the simplicity of the
sitting, breathing body, and as a refuge, as a place to rest.
Gell-Way Cannell says in a wonderful short poem that you can carry around with you, he
says, whatever what is is what I want.
Only that, but that.
Whatever what is is, is what I want.
Only that, but that.
Moving in the sitting, breathing body, as other events arise, events of the body, events of
the heart-mind, moving the attention there, letting the sitting, breathing body be a bit
in the background, returning to the breath as a place to rest as an anchor.
Coming back every time you get lost.
And throughout it all, noticing when it's pleasant, when it's unpleasant, when it's
neither, sometimes it shifts and changes, that's not so important, just noticing that
in order to help you stay there, resting in the simplicity of the present moment.
Moving in the sitting, breathing body, as other events arise, as other events arise,
Notice what is happening right now, if you are resting with the breath in the body,
if you have moved to an experience, another experience of the body or of the mind-heart.
If you have wandered off and you are lost in a daydream or a plan, come back and begin again.
Come back simply and gently. No need for judgment or comment.

Notice what is happening right now, if you have gone off in thought or daydream or plan, come back.
Come back, come back, come back over and over and over again.
Learning to come back, practicing to come back.
It is one of the great gifts of this practice that we are learning to come back as many times as we need to.
Gently, kindly, with compassion.

I was told that I believe it is at Wat Panana Chat, which was the monastery in Thailand that was founded specifically for people who were speaking English.
And there was a sign that simply said, this is the way it is.
So that's a great one-line instruction for practice.
This is the way it is.
And Ajahn Smeta, who of course became a monk in that world, is entirely how he teaches. This is the way the breath is.
This is the way an itch is.
This is the way hearing is.
One moment after another.
And sometimes this is the way the crazed mind is. And you get to sit with your crazed mind.
It's very fun. It's usually a bit unpleasant, but it's kind of interesting actually sometimes.
I invite you to use that as a simple instruction, maybe particularly for this last day of retreat.
