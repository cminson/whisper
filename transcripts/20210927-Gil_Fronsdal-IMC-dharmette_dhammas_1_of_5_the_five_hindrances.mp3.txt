 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. So, hello, and for this Monday, for this week, I would like to discuss the fourth foundation of mindfulness. The foundational teachings on mindfulness practice comes from a text by the Buddha that's sometimes called the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. It has these four different areas in which to cultivate this clear awareness of mindfulness. Over these last four months or so, I've given weeks on each of the first three, starting in June, maybe one June, one July, one August. Today, I would like to do the fourth foundation. Some of you have been there for the others. If you're interested in this topic, you could always go back and listen to those. The fourth foundation of mindfulness is called the foundation of the dhammas, the dharmas. It's commonly said that the word dharma has many meanings, and in relationship to this fourth foundation, people have struggled to figure out what the proper meaning is here. My proposal is to call it the action or activities. One of the meanings of dharma among the many is it can mean actions, but not just actions that we do actively, but just activities, but actions of the activities of the mind here. And here, what we're doing in the fourth foundation is building on the foundation of the previous three. We're now taking an interest in the activities of the mind that either keep us in bondage or which set us free, either those that keep us in the karmic stream or those that lead us into the dharmic stream following the topic for last week's talks. These five are laid out as many things are in the suttas progressively, almost like a little map of practice as we go along. It begins with the five hindrances. The five hindrances are something that used to be, I don't know if it's still the case, but used to be the standard talk to be given at week-long or ten-day-long insight meditation retreats. Usually the second day or so there's a talk given on the hindrances. And it's really invaluable to understand how these work. These are five forces in the mind that act as kind of like black holes, like a black hole star. That is gravitational force is so strong that light doesn't come out of it. In our case, the pull is so strong that awareness doesn't come out. Our awareness gets sucked in and we get involved in this or lost in this in a way that's unproductive for clear awareness. And these five are sensual desire, ill will, sloth and resistance, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, regrets, and then doubt or uncertainty. So it begins with sensual desires. One of the reasons it's taught at these Vipassana retreats, it's like the courses, often the first line of mental activity that gets in the way of getting settled in meditation. And it has a lot to do with desire for things. In fact, the whole first three parts of this fourth foundation can be seen as expressions of desire or manifestations of desire, but in particular for these hindrances. There's desire for sensual pleasures, the desire for getting rid of something, pushing it away. There is sloth and torpor, sloth and resistance. Especially when you call it resistance, it's kind of a desire to not participate or shut down or go numb. And so sloth and torpor is just innocent being tired. It's kind of like wanting not to pay attention, not to be here in some way and being deflated. And maybe deflated because our desires, we can't fulfill them, we're not being satisfied with our desires. And then the fourth one is this restlessness and kind of regrets. And agitation, restlessness can often come because of unfulfilled desires. We don't know how to fulfill our desires. And regrets can often come when we had a desire that was not fulfilled or we didn't do what we had hoped to do or we did something that in retrospect we realized we wish we hadn't done. Because our desires were a little bit of skew, a little bit off. And then doubt is not sure what to do in relationship to all this. So we get pulled into the world of objects, the world of things, of experiences, of people. And these five can be the fuel for getting lost in that world, sometimes for decades. And so mindfulness practice is to... So if we settle that down, then we're ready to take on something more subtle that keeps us distracted or keeps us from getting really settled. And that has to do with various kinds of attachments or identifications as self. And so we're working through these kind of ideas and deeper ideas of self. And that's just called the five aggregates. The third one, when that's settled, there's a simpler kind of desire that goes on that's left when attachment to self is no longer there. And that's just simple desires for anything and everything, just simple experiences in the moment. We hear sound and there's a movement for or against it or a taste or whatever it might be. And this is called the mindfulness of the sense spheres of how we experience in the moment the sense experience at all the different sense doors. And once we kind of quiet that down, then the Dharam Extreme has a chance to surface. And then there can be the arising of seven factors of awakening, seven wonderful qualities of this Dharam Extreme that begin coursing through us like a stream almost when it gets strong. And this is kind of like a core state of meditation that are setting the foundation for quiet, calm, steady mind that then can see the fifth part of the fourth foundation, which is the Four Noble Truths, having the insights that lead to liberation. And so these are kind of progressive and we can go through them. And so today, let's talk a little bit briefly about the hindrances and then we'll go through the other four. So it's kind of a whirlwind tour of these big topics. And in these few minutes I'm going to talk about the hindrances. I could also say that I have given classes on the hindrances that are on Adhyodharma and I've covered this before. So you could go and look it up and if you want to catch up more depth around them, which I strongly encourage. I'd like to think that Vipassana students should become experts on the hindrances and think of Vipassana practice, especially in the early period of one's practice, as a kind of a de facto study to get a PhD in the hindrances, to really understand them, to see them coming, to be able to recognize them, to know how to work with them. In the way that the Buddha discusses in this text, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, he says very simply, when there's one of these hindrances, when it's there, when recognize it's there, when it's not there, when recognize it's not there, before one has arisen, if something hasn't occurred yet, a hindrance, when is there present enough and bright and clear enough to recognize it's arising? And this idea of seeing the beginning of something, the arising of something, we'll talk more about this as we go along, but it's phenomenally important. It's only possible if the mind is steady and stable so that we can see the arising of things. And then we see, we recognize that we've abandoned it. We recognize that it's gone away. And then we recognize, yeah, it's really gone, it's not coming back. Wow. So as the mindfulness and concentration gets stronger, one has the ability to let go easily. And seeing it go is an event to inspire faith and confidence in this practice that we don't have to, we're not stuck in these hindrances. We have some agency around them and we should exercise that. There is a healthy desire to let go of the hindrances. It's not easy to do, and that's why I say we want to do a big study, you know, get the equivalent of a PhD in the hindrances. So we really understand well how to do this and how to prepare the ground so that we can avoid getting caught in the hindrances. So one learns to let go of it, and then one recognizes there comes a time when the mind is so stable and so beginning to have a feeling of freedom that one recognizes the hindrance is not going to arise again. I mean, in the short term at least, in this state that we're in, it might later come back. But it's such a nice feeling. So good. Oh. Especially if someone's been caught in the hindrances for a long time and struggling with them. It's such a relief to have them, you know, go away and then feel confident that for now they're not here. The word that we're translating as hindrances, nivarana, is literally means covering. So the hindrances are what covers over the depth of what goes on for us, covers over our freedom, covers over a clarity, and covers over wisdom. And part of the function of reason to practice with hindrances and have them quiet down is so that we can see clearly and wisdom can begin operating in relationship to what goes on. And part of that wisdom is to begin to understand the nature of desires and know which desires are healthy to have and how to have healthy desires in a healthy way. And so if I no longer get pulled into the world of desires of the hindrances, then we can start, have more freedom, more ability to have this healthy desire to, yes, what I'm going to do is to practice mindfulness. What I want to do is to be present here. Yes. Recognizing what's happening in the present moment is better than not recognizing and wandering off in the highways and byways of my mind. So the five hindrances, the fourth foundation of mindfulness, have a journey from our contracted, difficult states to liberation. So thank you.
