Practice Note: The Heart of Buddhist 
Practice

There are so many different ways of looking at Buddhist 
practice, but today I ’d like to suggest that Buddhist 
training has two aspects. The first part is all the 
preparatory practice and training. We train ourselves to 
be mindful. We train ourselves to be calm, to be 
concentrated, to be patient, to be compassionate. 
These many things in which we train ourselves are  all 
preparation . The second aspect of training – and this is 
the most important part – is when things are not going 
right,  when something ’s not happening the way we 
want. That ’s really the heart of it.  
 
For example , today, there was street work out side. 
Perhaps some of you  thought, “Well this shouldn ’t be 
happening. ” That’s good that you should think that , 
because that ’s when you really start practicing. T hat’s 
what  everything else is preparing you for. Or your knee 
hurts, or your mind is busier than you want it to be, or 
you have some kind of angst or fe ar or anxiety about 
something . Sometimes when all these things happen , 
it’s like, “Oh this shouldn ’t be happening. ” As soon as you hear yourself say that, or imply that, then you ’ve 
come to the second stage of practice. Before that , you 
were  just at the first stage of preparation.  
 
You can congratulate yourself for graduating t o the 
second stage [laughs]. A nd then the idea is to look at 
that, and look at what you ’re holding onto, what you ’re 
clinging to, what your expectations are. There are so 
many different things going on. For example, i t was so 
noisy here, relative  to how  it usually is . Then in the end 
it got really quiet . I don ’t know if you noticed , but it was 
really peaceful and quiet – a different kind of silence 
because of the contrast. It was very pleasant , and then 
they started talking again . So there was this movement  
towards the peace, the pleasure of that, and then a 
reaction, perhaps, to the lack of the pleasure. So there  
might be holding onto pleasure or  comfort. It could be 
that you ’re holding onto how incredibly important this 
practice is. This practice is going to save you, and don ’t 
they reali ze that out there [laughs]. That ’s where the 
clinging is holding onto something.  
 
So two very important parts of practice are the 
preparation you do , and then the real practice when 
things aren ’t working right. If you can t rain and do the 
preparation , do that as best you ca n. And when you ’re 
not successful at preparing yourself for the real practice, 
then it ’s started [laughing] – the real practice has started 
then.   
Enjoy it.
