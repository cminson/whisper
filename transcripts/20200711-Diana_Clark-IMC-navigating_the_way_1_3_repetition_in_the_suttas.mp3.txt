The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, okay. Thank you, Ying. That was beautiful.
So now I would like to talk just a little bit about this idea of sutta study
and kind of look at the sutta and put it into some context
and to help us have a greater understanding and appreciation.
For some of you, this might be a new thing to think about suttas.
So one thing we can look at is the setting.
That why does it seem that in the beginning of the sutta, for those of you who have read it,
that there are a number of details, like where this is taking place,
to whom the Buddha is speaking, and how they greet the Buddha.
So one thing I'll say is the kalamas don't have a big role
in these thousands of suttas that we find in the discourses of the Buddha
in the Pali Canon. However, for those of you who are familiar with
the life story of the Buddha, you may know that as before he became
awakened, he went and sought some meditation instructions from a teacher,
and one of those teachers was Alara Kalama.
So this is kind of all we know about these people is that,
A, they had this meditation teacher that the Buddha sought,
and then B, that they were perplexed when a whole bunch of different
teachers were coming in their town, and they were denigrating
one another or saying, I know what the truth is and others don't.
But we can get another hint about them.
Again, in the beginning of the sutta, where there's this description of
some people when they go to greet the Buddha,
they greet him in a number of different ways.
Some state their name and clan, some bow, they pay homage in different ways.
So this suggests that they have a mixture of traditions
or a mixture of practices.
So we can just imagine that it's not one homogeneous group of people
there in the Kalamas.
So another thing that becomes obvious if this is the first sutta you've read,
probably if you've read any suttas, is that there is a lot of repetition.
That there's some phrases that are said over and over again, like verbatim.
And there's a number of ways to think about this and to hold this.
One is that to consider that these are thousands of years ago,
a long time ago, they're not, weren't written, but they were preserved orally.
It is passed on from one person to the next by what a person had remembered.
And so a way to remember things is to have some,
I like to think of it as kind of a musicality to it, a rhythm,
a way in which there's certain passages that get repeated
and makes it easier to remember them.
And also helps with what there's going to be some chanting,
just like we have modern music today where there's a chorus and there's a bridge
and different parts of it.
In some ways the suttas, maybe like that, is to think about a group of people
chanting them together and memorizing them together.
And if you do chant these out loud or you ever hear them spoken out loud
in poly and in English, you'll see that there's a certain rhythm to them.
So unlike contemporary reading, like right now, especially if you're reading fiction,
you kind of expect to be brought along on a journey or maybe if it is nonfiction,
you expect to be brought along into greater and greater understanding.
Well, that may happen in the suttas.
They're having this third aspect that is a, I'm just using this word musicality,
a rhythm to them.
In addition to the content, the specific information.
So that's one characteristic about the suttas.
And I know from many people in the beginning, they're like, oh, this is kind of annoying
and boring and off-putting all this repetition.
But I'll say now I find it a little bit endearing that like, okay,
it's an encouragement to settle down, not be impatient.
And it points to just how like meditation practice is the same thing about how we,
maybe we have an object, maybe it's the breath and then the mind wanders
and then we just keep on coming back and then the mind wanders
and we just keep on coming back.
So there's the same kind of movement that in reading the suttas
and there is with a meditation practice.
So I'll talk about that in general.
But of course, the repetition doesn't happen only within a sutta.
If you've read the suttas, you said there's a, as I said,
you'll notice there's a significant amount of repetition.
But between the suttas also, and this becomes really evident the more you read
of the suttas, you're like, oh yeah, okay, this is what the scholars call a perikope.
That is, I think of it kind of in modern terms,
a little bit like a cut and paste.
There's these stock phrases that are sprinkled throughout the suttas
to describe things that are often described in suttas.
An example might be practicing mindfulness is kind of a stock phrase
or practicing loving kindness.
Some of it is a stock phrase or the way that people greet the Buddha
or what they do after they hear a teaching from him is a stock phrase, a perikope.
So I'd like to share a slide with you.
And the point here is not to read everything on this.
It's a little bit too small. You can't read it.
You will get this. I will email this out to you.
But what I'd like to highlight here is that I highlighted our kalama sutta
and I put in highlight what passages appear in other suttas.
And this helps to highlight what's unique.
What is it that is specific to the kalama sutta?
Was there something here that really stands out?
And both scholars and practitioners often are looking for this.
Like what is unique?
Because that might be a hint about maybe it's in a different setting
or it's to a different audience that has different needs.
Or maybe the Buddha is emphasizing something as well as just a general, very, very general.
There is a movement towards greater and greater systemization.
This happens not only in Buddhism but in all teachings.
So maybe if things aren't standardized, maybe it's a little bit earlier
before the things got more systematized.
Okay, so with that as a big introduction, I'd like to share my screen
and to show you, again, you won't be able to read this.
It's more just to look at the colors.
And that is, so this is our sutta.
And what's in green is in other suttas.
And what's in blue is in maybe one of three other suttas
that have a lot of the same material as the kalama sutta.
The kalama sutta is the most famous.
But there's a lot of the exact same words in other suttas.
So, for example, the greeting here is a standard greeting.
This blue part here is, it's fitting for you to be in doubt.
Doubt has arisen for you.
Please do not go by oral tradition, this list of ten.
And then we have this big section that we find in other suttas
that are very similar to the kalama sutta.
And then some standard parikabee.
This is what's in green. This is talking about the Brahma vaharas.
And then there's a lot of white here.
The white means this is unique to the kalama sutta.
And this is about the four assurances.
And we'll be talking about this in a later sutta.
And then the ending is green.
It has kind of a standard ending.
So, again, we'll send this to you with the details.
But just pointing out what's unique
and what is not unique about the kalama sutta as well as
it can be interesting and fun to put it in this setting.
Like, who's the audience? Who's asking this question?
And how is the Buddha responding to them?
Okay, thank you.
And now I'll hand it over to Kim.
Okay, thank you, Diana.
So we're nearing the end of our session.
And, but just before we come to a kind of a wrapping up,
we have a few things to say about the rest of the course
and also some suggestions for things you might want to do
before our next session on Tuesday.
But before that, let's open it up for any questions
that you might have.
And again, using the blue hand
will help make that an easier process.
It could be about the material we've covered today
or it could be about the sutta in general
if you've read it in advance
and had some questions about it.
Or just anything else from what we've covered.
Any comments?
Yes, Nula, you can go ahead and unmute yourself.
Thank you.
It's just a little bit of a technical question.
I was really fascinated to see the stock passages highlighted
in one color and what was unique left another color.
And I was wondering what magic made this possible.
I really enjoyed comparing different sutta.
So I don't know if there's...
Diana, maybe you could speak to that.
Yeah, we don't know exactly.
There's a few things, but one could be,
it might be that there was one single text
when different communities kind of dispersed
over the years and had some geographical differences
that they might have remembered them a little bit differently.
And then when these communities came back together,
they realized, oh, but ours who does in this setting
and yours is in that setting,
these must be different teachings.
That could be one way in which to think about it.
There was one original one that then got changed.
Or maybe the Buddha's teaching,
he gave the same teaching in different settings
and different places.
And maybe I'll say, just as a quick aside of the other suttas,
one of them is not given by the Buddha.
It's given by one of his disciples to somebody else.
So maybe one of the students,
somebody learned from the Buddha and gave it to somewhere else.
And I would just...
I have different ideas.
Yes, David.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It didn't mean to interrupt at the tail end.
I just wanted to say that Nula's question
might have been interpreted to mean
what magic software was able to recognize those passages.
And I just wanted to say,
I think that software's name is Diana.
I think Diana recognized those things and did that.
So wetware and not software.
But still, yeah, that's Diana's little scholarship at play there.
Incredible work, Diana.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Okay.
Chris, why don't you go ahead and unmute yourself?
This isn't so much of a question.
But I was a little nervous taking this class.
And first of all,
I want to thank all four of you.
How comforting it is to just approach this
in the way you're bringing it forward already.
It's just quite wonderful.
But how I did prep for this class,
and I'll just offer this out to the other attendees,
is I YouTubeed it.
And there's a ton of Kalama Sutra.
There's cartoons.
Bantiguturatsana.
Gil's got a great talk of the Kalama Sutra.
And my eyes are fatiguing now.
So I find listening to stuff,
as I'm chopping carrots or whatever,
has been just really, really a wonderful way
to approach any learning now,
but in particular, Sutra.
Thank you.
Yeah, we're fortunate in our modern era that there are
sutras,
many of the sutras are online, particularly at, yeah,
it's kind of a strange conjunction of ancient wisdom
and very modern technology.
Laura, did you also have a comment or question?
It was very humbling for me to see the importance
of holding the five precepts.
Maybe we'll talk about later,
because it shows that how, if you hold the five precepts,
and it's for non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion,
and wow, you know, every retreat I repeat the five precepts,
and it's just kind of going one year and going the other,
and wow, to read it again in the Kalama Sutra,
and how then that is the kind of the condition
for, you know, the Brahma Viharas,
and then it leads to the four assurances.
It's just wonderful.
So I just wanted to make that comment.
Thank you.
Thank you, Laura.
Okay, well, maybe since we're approaching the end,
I will say then that you may have noticed
that we have an unusual schedule for this class.
It's a Saturday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,
and that's brought to you by the magic of having it online.
It seems to be a good way to have a little bit of an intensive look
at this sutra over the course of a week.
We do understand, of course, that maybe I have to fit in with your life somehow,
and so what we've done is for the Tuesdays and the Thursday,
Tuesday and Thursday, we're going to have a structure to this class
where it's still 8.30 to 10,
but we'll do all the teaching between 8.30 and 9.30,
and then there will be a guided meditation from 9.30 to 10.
So I'm all speaking in Pacific time.
So if it works for you only to come for that first hour because of your work
or something else, just to know that that last half hour
we're considering optional, although, of course,
it'll be integrated in with the teachings from that day,
and then Saturday we'll again have a session more like this
where it's all integrated together for the hour and a half.
So then we do have some suggestions for what you may wish to do with this material
between now and Tuesday.
The first is to read the Sutta again.
I think we'll probably suggest that every time
because it's very helpful to keep looking at it.
It seems like different things pop up at different times
and based on what we've heard.
And then in terms of practice, two ideas.
One is to observe where you put your trust
and your energy when hearing information.
Most of us take in information every day.
Maybe we read the news or we get stuff through work
or things that our friends and family send us.
We are getting exposed to information.
How do you decide what to believe and where to put your trust and faith
and interest and energy?
So it's not a question of whether it's,
you're doing it right according to the Sutta,
but more just like what's your mind, the orientation of that.
Sometimes we haven't noticed that explicitly.
And then in terms of sitting practice,
we can also observe what meditation instructions do we use.
We may have been sitting down and habitually doing the same practice
for a very long time where we have certain ideas
about how we should approach it
when the mind wanders away from our object.
And so it's not again,
it's not an idea that there's a right way
and you're checking whether it is,
but just what is it?
What is it that your mind is doing on the cushion
and also in terms of information in daily life?
So I think that's what I had for now
and I'll just invite if any of the other teachers
wanted to say anything to wrap up this class.
Yeah.
Yes, I also mentioned because there are some people
who in their emails kind of appointed out
that this next Saturday there is a retreat
that's going on inside retreat center
and you may be missing the last class
and so we will be recording the session
and that's the way to kind of catch up
if you need to.
Yeah, I just mentioned that.
And I want to just offer my deep bow.
I feel I'm really looking forward
to going on this journey together
and exploring together and hearing from you all.
It's really wonderful.
The four of us, we love the suttas
and poking around in them
and talking about them, practicing with them
and it's just great to share this with everybody.
It's really great.
So we look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
Until then, take care.
