 
 1 Dharmette: Peaceful Mind  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on October 5, 2016  
 
 
This morning I’d like to read the first two verses from the 
Dhammapada,  and then discuss them a little bit. In the 
ancient anthologies of the early Buddhist teachings, 
sometimes the first teaching in that collection is 
particularly important. It’s kind of the entry -way into the 
rest of it, or is the foundational perspective f rom which 
everything else follows. So here are the first two verses:  
 
All experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, 
made by mind.  
Speak or act with a corrupt mind and suffering 
follows as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of an 
ox. 
 
All experience is pr eceded by mind, led by mind, 
made by mind.  
Speak or act with a peaceful mind and happiness 
follows like a never departing shadow.   
 
So, it gives priority to the mind. In the ancient world, the 
word here is citta, which some people prefer to translate 
as ‘heart.’ It focuses here on our inner life, wherever we 
feel it resides, and the quality of that inner life, the  
 2 landscape of our inner life, the attitudes that we carry 
with us have an impact. Here it [the Dhammapada ] 
makes it so important that our experie nce of the world is 
very much shaped, it says, by the mind itself.  
 
The word ‘experience’ is a very important word to 
understand. It’s the way that we register, the way that 
we interpret. We don’t experience things innocently, as 
if we were just a passive  recipient of the way things are. 
A big part of how we interpret the world or relate to the 
world has a lot to with what our mind does, the attitudes 
we have, the interpretations we have, the beliefs we 
have, and the motivations we have.  
 
In Buddhism, ther e is a priority given to understanding 
what our contribution is. What are we doing? What are 
we doing to contribute to our experience that we are 
having at any given moment? So the idea of taking 
responsibility for oneself is hugely an important part of 
Buddhist practice.  
 
The Dhammapada  goes onto say: speak or act with a 
corrupted mind, suffering follows . So with certain 
attitudes, certain motivations that we live with – we don’t 
get off, or get a free pass. There are consequences to 
how we live our lives  and the choices we make. It is a 
very evocative word ‘corrupted mind.’ Some people 
maybe prefer other words. I think it is kind of an 
umbrella term for any kind of movement of the mind  
 3 where harm is being caused: harm to ourselves or harm 
to others. So if  you intend to cause harm – even 
unintentionally – if the mind is somehow grappling with 
movements like anger, resistance, self -righteousness, 
fear, or something that could cause harm, that would be 
called ‘corrupted mind’ in this ancient  language. If we 
act on that unskillfully, then it brings along suffering.  
 
But if we act from a peaceful mind, and the word 
‘peaceful mind’ is also an umbrella term for all kinds of 
ways of living in the world that don’t cause harm, that 
bring  benefit and well -being. A pe aceful mind is kind of 
a light mind – the mind is not heavy, forceful or 
aggressive. Then happiness follows.  
 
The similes that are used for each of these are telling. 
Speak or act with a corrupted mind and suffering follows 
as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of an ox. An ox 
pulling a wagon heavily weighed down is an image of a 
lot of work. Like being kind of shackled, being yoked, a 
heavy, heavy burden you are carrying along with you. 
And this poor ox sweating and working hard to get the 
wagon to go. So t here is this feeling of being weighed 
down – it’s a hard trek to make.  
 
The image that goes along with “speak or act with a 
peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never 
departing shadow” is of a shadow that has no weight. 
And a shadow provides no resi stance, no obstacles for  
 4 the person who is walking along. Your shadow isn’t 
going to cause you any problems, as far as I know. You 
can go for a walk or long trip and most people don’t 
even think about their shadow. It has no weight; it ’s light 
and causes n o obstacles. It doesn’t interfere with our 
path as we walk. So, I think these two images give a 
very different feeling of the effect on us.  
 
The idea that we can speak and act with a peaceful 
mind, that the happiness we can get, has a light feeling 
to it. It’s not an obstacle; it’s relaxed; it hangs onto us 
the way our shadow hangs onto us. We are not clinging 
to it. But if we suffer, there is something about what 
Buddhism calls suffering or dukkha  that tends to be 
sticky. It tends to cling to us or we cli ng to it. It creates a 
burden, a heaviness. It slows us down. It makes life less 
free to walk through it. So the difference between living 
a life of freedom and living a life of bondage – here the 
image would be living the life of something that is as 
light as a shadow or something as heavy as a big 
wagon that you have to be an ox to pull.  
 
So all experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, 
made by mind. So what is your mind like? Or what is 
your attitude like? What attitudes do you bring with you 
as you go into the world? Are they attitudes, qualities of 
mind, motivations of mind, that feel like they support 
you, that help free you, that bring happiness? Or are 
they attitudes, motivations, thoughts or beliefs that tend  
 5 to weigh you down, and tend to creat e obstacles for you 
as you find your way through the world?  
 
So to have this inner reflection, to understand ourselves 
through these guidelines, through these perspectives – 
not just to be present for life as it is, but to be able to be 
present so that we can see the differences or the 
consequences of our inner landscape, of what we do in 
here. To not just be a victim of what the mind dreams 
up, but to be able to have some ability to work through 
that, and find a way to live and act from a peaceful  mind 
– from a free mind as opposed to a ‘corrupted mind’ or a 
mind that’s caught in bondage, that’s not free.  
 
I think this is one of the core aspects, or core 
opportunities that the practice of mindfulness can offer 
us. So… that is what was on my mind t his morning. Do 
you have any questions or comments on that, that you’d 
like to make?  
 
Practi tioner #1: Thank you Gil, I think it is a really 
important point that I remember some years ago 
hearing about just noticing, just noticing, just noticing… 
and there ’s a lot of value in that… but if I’m noticing for 
an hour how crazy my mind is, then want to do an 
intervention like how I can bring some calm and peace 
to the mind, whether it’s saying some mettā phrases 
and what -not. It took me a while to hear that some times 
you don’t let the mind be in its corrupted state. It’s  
 6 skillful to do some interventions, so I’m really glad you 
bought that up. It’s maybe not often talked about or if it’s 
talked about, at least I know when I was new, I didn’t 
hear that point. I he ard a lot about noticing and being 
aware.  
 
GF: Great, thank you.  
 
Practitioner #2: So, as I become more and more 
mindful, I notice that there are triggers in the external 
world that will elicit a certain kind of emotion that is pre -
verbal, that goes back a  very long way, and it doesn’t 
feel like it is ‘mind’ to me. It’s not a thought. Certainly 
there can be thoughts that can arise afterwards. But to 
me it felt like there is something else that precedes 
thought.  
 
GF: So now that you know that part of you, t hat 
knowledge and that awareness that is operating, how 
does that change things for you?  
 
Practitioner #2: Now that I’m aware of the thoughts….?  
 
GF: Yeah, that happens, that dynamic happens.  
 
Practitioner #2: I guess I more and more m eet that with 
compass ion, realiz ing that I’m not – it’s not volitional; it’s 
unintentional, and so what I choo se to do, or how I 
choose to re act, or respond to that and what thoughts  
 7 arise of that, are definitely within my ability to make a 
choice about.  
 
GF: Great. So that’s acting and speaking with a 
peaceful mind in relationship to it. Because to do the 
opposite, to act and speak to it with a corrupted mind, 
what would it look like for you?  
 
Practitioner #2: I would just feed into… you know 
whatever… usually fear.  
 
GF: The reason I asked you to answer the question that 
way is that we can only be responsible for what we can 
do. So if we see a place, how to shift or respond, and 
respond in a more useful, productive, valuable way, 
that’s where the Dharma, the practice is found.  That 
which arises that we have no choice over, that just 
happens by itself, then that’s the way it’s working for the 
time being, and then our job is when we see that, is to 
figure out how to be as most responsible to it as we can. 
How do we respond?  
 
Over  time, I think what happens is that – well hopefully 
what happens – is that the mind works through the 
layers and layers of the mind. We start seeing more and 
more places of choice, more and more places where we 
can make a difference, and we respond in dif ferent 
ways.  
  
 8 Things which can initially seem unconscious, that it’s 
not us doing it, it’s just bubbling up from some deep 
place that is a mystery to us. Maybe after a while, it 
stops being a mystery – maybe not everything, but we 
start seeing more and mo re how the mind works. We 
start opening up and seeing a wider range of choice. If 
we don’t see the choice, there is no choice. But 
mindfulness kind of creates more choice, by showing us 
a wider range of what’s going on.  
 
Practitioner #2: It just seems lik e the term ‘mind’ – not 
quite sure that always kind of fits. Never mind. 
[Collective laughing with the sangha community on the 
pun].  
 
GF: Great. Well thank you both and all of you. And I 
think that one of the implications, or one of the implicit 
ideas beh ind all of this is how important your mind is, 
and by extension, you are – that you are important, that 
you are valuable, that it’s worthwhile caring for yourself, 
caring for your mind. It’s a wonderful tool we have that 
can serve us, to bring out the best  in us. So I hope that 
the best in you is something you can share with the 
world.
