 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning. Oh yeah, we finally, I've finally grasped all the technology of this morning. Welcome, welcome. Welcome to this moment. Those people are in the room, those people who are not in this room but in their own rooms. I invite you to join us, all of us, in this moment of just being here, just breathing, just this, just this. There's no time, there's no need to do anything. Take a deep breath, let it out, and just breathe, just breathe. Let's just sit together. My intention for this morning is not to lead a long meditation but rather to invite you to lead your own moment of just here. So I won't be speaking much until later. Just be here. Just breathe. Wherever, whatever is conducive to feeling in this moment, that is what you do for now. For now, this person, this person, just be here, just as you are. And just breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Give yourself over to just sinking into this moment. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. As you sit here, recall this is what it is to be this person in this moment. This is this person sitting here, being here. This person. This body. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. Nothing else. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. Stillness. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person. This person.
