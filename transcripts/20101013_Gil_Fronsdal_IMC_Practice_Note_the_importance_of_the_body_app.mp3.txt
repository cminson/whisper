Practice Note : The Importance of the 
Body

I’d like  to say a few words about the practice this 
morning that  might be helpful, or interesting for you to 
consider, and that is to emphasize the tremendous 
importance that our bodies have in this practice. I think 
our physical, embodied sense of being present through  
our body is often overlooked . Some people champi on 
the body as being the temple – I like to think of it as the 
monastery .  
 
So much of the practice unfolds through our body . The 
body is an amazing part of who we are because it 
responds both to our inner impulses  and to the world 
around us. It’s an amazin g place to interface with the 
world . The body is like an antenna  – it picks up much of 
what goes on around us . If you stay present in your 
body, you’ll feel how you react to what goes on around 
you.  
 
You can see it in the posture you take. You can see it in 
bodily positions you take. You can see it with the 
tensing up of your muscles. You can see it in all the holding patterns in your body : how you respond to the 
world around you, and whether you’re tight, or closed, 
or open to it.  
 
You can also pick up on some of the more subtle things 
going on around you as well . Often the body feels  it’s 
way into what’s happening , through all the different 
senses we have. When you’re listening to a voice , you 
don’t just listen to the content of  what the person’s 
saying . But your body, your ears, pick up the tone of the 
voice . The tone of the voice affects us, whether it’s  very 
fast, or very sl ow, or loud, or soft. There are  all kinds of 
cues in the environment that we can pick up on through 
the senses of our bodies . 
 
The body also expresses our impulses from within . 
When we have reactions, desires, aversions , or feelings 
of any kind, they are  experienced through the body , and 
expressed through the body. If you’re sensitive to what 
goes on in the body, you pick up cues from your inner 
environment as well . One of the reasons why the body’s 
is often said to be a  repository of wisdom is that the 
body reveals all this information about what’s going on 
around us, what’s going on within us , and the interface 
between the two.  
 
In addition, the body has the  advantage for our practice 
of always being in the present mom ent. The body is not 
going to be anywhere else but here and now. It’s very safe to be in the body. The body is like a refuge for us 
because it helps us stay in the present moment , and it 
gives us access to all this information about what’s 
going on , so we can be wiser. Also, the degree to which 
you are in your body, is the degree to which you are not 
lost in your thoughts . So it’s a very he lpful antidote  to 
the tendency to be caught up in thoughts and 
preoccupations. Just come back here in your body.  
 
One of the little sloga ns for mindfulness practice is 
“Yield to your body.”  Relax into your body. Whatever is 
going on, pay attention to what’s happening. Notice how 
it’s being experienced in your body . If you have a lot of 
thoughts  and preoccupations, feel wh at it’s like to have 
those preoccupations in an embodied, physical way. 
What kind s of tensions , feelings , and energies are in 
your body?  
 
When I was i n Burma, when the monsoons came  and 
you’d have this sudden torrential downpour , the first 
thing I would do is I would feel my body. What’s it like? 
Air pressure? Humidity? How does it change with this 
downpour? It was very interesting to feel, and not just 
think about, “Oh it raining.”  But to feel w hat’s shifted and 
changed?  
 
Whate ver happens  – strong   feelings, loud sounds, or 
all kinds of thoughts and concerns  – yield to the body . 
Drop into the body, and feel what’s going on there. Be mindful there. It changes your whole i nner environment 
if you feel  your life through your body, r ather than 
experiencing  your life through the filter of your ideas and 
thoughts.    
 
This morning you might experiment a little bit what it’s 
like to experience things through your body.  
 
I hope you enjoy the morning. Thank you.
