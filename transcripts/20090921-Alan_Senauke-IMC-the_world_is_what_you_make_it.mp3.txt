The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening. It's really nice to be back here.
I'm always a little daunted because you guys are about like
two or three steps ahead of us technologically
in Berkeley. Berkeley likes to think it's the center of the universe, but
we follow in your footsteps.
It's been a while since I've been here. I think the last time
that I was here was when we did the Dharma Music.
I don't know if any of you were there, but I always
really enjoy coming down here and especially nice to come
on a Monday evening and sit for 45 minutes so that
our energy, my energy, is really settled even though I had to come down
on the freeway and had a busy day.
And also I always appreciate being asked by Gil
to come because we are Dharma brothers.
My root teacher, Sojin Weitzman, is his
Zen teacher. He's a great teacher.
My root teacher, Sojin Weitzman, is his Zen teacher
and we both have Dharma transmission in
Suzuki Roshi's tradition from Sojin Roshi.
I appreciate that.
I also always remember being at
Tatsuhara with Gil when he was the
Tonto or head student in I think 1988.
And I really looked up to him and I
still do. So this is the community that's
evolved and I always like to see
how it is and what's going on down here.
So
enough preamble because we don't have a hell of a lot of time.
I've had this song knocking about
in my head and I'll sing you a little piece of it
and then the lecture will be why it was in my mind.
And perhaps
the lecture will touch on things that are of concern to you
both in your meditation practice
and in your life. In our tradition we don't separate
them particularly much
but there both is and isn't a
difference. We can talk about that. So I've been thinking about this song.
Have any of you heard of this? Do you know of this Irish...
I'm getting some echo here.
Irish singer Paul Brady. Is there anyone who's heard of Paul Brady?
No, there wasn't in Berkeley either.
He's a mega star in Ireland
as an interpreter of traditional music.
As an interpreter of traditional music and as a
songwriter.
There it is.
You know this was in tune when I brought it from home.
I'm going to do without this.
So the title of this song is
The World Is What You Make It. I'm just going to sing you the chorus
and then one of the verses.
There ain't no happiness
without no pain. New day
heartbreak working up an attitude.
Pick up the pieces, hit the road again.
The world is what you make it.
The world is what you make it baby.
The world is what you make it.
The world is what you make it.
The world is what you make it baby.
The world is what you make it.
The world is what you make it.
This is at the heart of our practice.
I've been thinking about it.
We had a study retreat at Berkeley's
chapter over Labor Day weekend and we studied
this old Zen poem from China
called The Jewel Mirror Samadhi.
And in The Jewel Mirror Samadhi it talks about
this sort of ancient
way of looking at our practice.
The two truths. Is this something that you've talked about?
It goes back to the earliest Buddhist teachings.
It's very simple.
You can think about it in a variety of ways.
While Sojin Roshi was lecturing,
I made myself a list.
So there's various ways of looking at the world.
You can look at these two truths
of the absolute, the truth of the relative.
As the truth of dark, as the truth of
light, as the truth of emptiness,
the truth of form,
truth of stillness, the truth
of activity, the truth of
nirvana, the truth of samsara.
The host, the guest,
the upright, the inclined,
essence, phenomenon,
oneness, difference,
ocean, wave, ocean wave is very, ocean and wave are very good
is because it gets to do you have
if you have an ocean
inevitably their waves
and the waves make the ocean. So you have these
various ways of looking at
reality. I had a philosophy teacher
in college who
I remember just about nothing from college.
I don't know about you guys, but this I remember.
So there's two kinds of people in the world, those who divide things in two
and those who don't. And if you think about
that for a while, your brain will melt down, which is
good. In Zen we talk about not one,
not two. So we talk about the interpenetration
of form and emptiness. We talk about
the interpenetration of the absolute and the relative.
But one of the things that Sojin Roshi talked about
maybe a month or two ago
came out just in question and answer
from a Dharma talk. And
people are always wrangling with, well
what about the relative? What about the absolute? Isn't the absolute
better than the relative? Shouldn't we be aiming to live in the absolute
and
what he said was
this formulation of the two truths.
The first truth is the reality of things
as they are, precisely as they are.
Everything, beyond good and bad,
beyond stillness and activity,
is just that everything is as it is.
And the second truth
is the truth of the way you feel about it.
This really got
my attention. I went and talked to him afterwards.
I said, well, where does that come from? Can you
cite chapter and verse on this? Because
did you have a source for this? The truth
of the way things are, as they are, and the truth
of how you feel about them? And he said, no, it just
sort of came out. It actually meant a lot more to me than it meant to him.
But this is often the case. You will find this is the case when you
have a teacher.
But what it says is
so just to be clear, the truth
of how you feel about them, about things, is not
necessarily true.
If I picked up
this guitar and I felt it was in tune,
that would not necessarily be the truth. But if I picked up
the guitar and strummed it,
you would have the truth of this guitar's
tuning just as it is. Does that make sense?
It might not sound good. In fact, it didn't, which is why I put it down.
So that's not the truth.
This is where people
get in trouble. And I've heard this again and again
when we
stand on a position and say, this is my truth.
Now, we need to know
what we feel is compelling.
At the same time,
as we have to realize that there is
conditionality in it. So, this is what
this is actually
what I've learned to be doing,
not in some analytical way, but while I'm meditating.
And sometimes you take this on as an actual,
you might take this on as an actual practice, as a
component of mindfulness, examining the nature,
the very nature of your feelings.
And in this sense, talking about feelings in a very technical way, what's arising,
do you feel positive, negative, or neutral about it?
One of the great teachers of
the Mahayana tradition, our ancestor Nagarjuna
said, seeing into
the world of impermanence, investing in the world of impermanence
is raising the thought of enlightenment.
So it's looking at things as they are.
That includes, though, looking at
how you feel about them.
And how you feel about this, how you feel about things
creates
or co-creates the reality that we live in.
So we have to be very thoughtful, careful,
and attuned to how we're feeling moment by moment.
And
realize it can lead either, it can lead any way. For example,
I'm going to get to more
difficult examples, but an example, something that came
up for me Saturday, I was helping
with a wedding for someone who's in our community.
And I was helping a priest who came in, who I know very well,
and the way this person was doing things
well, let's just say, it was not how I
would do things. And I kept
noticing it, you know, in one little
how you held this or how you held this or where you moved or where you put things.
So this is very, we're very formal in Zen, right?
And I, you know, I just noticed that
this kind of attitude was coming up in me
and I thought
and then I looked around the room
and I realized there's nothing wrong here.
Actually, everybody's having a good time.
This couple is very much in love. Their parents are thrilled.
There's a good feeling in the room, you know, what's my problem?
And I
investigating that way, I realized
well, you know what, I have some
choices here about how I want
to be. You know, I can
somehow let my crankiness
or persnickliness leak in such a way
that it will affect other people
or I can accept
what I just realized. Actually, it's perfect.
So I had feelings about it and I had
that moment of choice that whether I wanted to
how I recognize those feelings or whether I
wanted to inject that into the world. That's called
karma, right? As soon as you, there's karma that
comes from just thinking about it, which is not so heavy. As soon as
you say or do something, it has more of an impact.
And what
was that discomfort about?
I'm not quite sure somewhat about my preferences.
The more I dig, the more I feel
there was some fear in me.
Some fear of somehow not being seen or not being
acknowledged. Something
self-dependent or ego-dependent that was
if I let it go,
it was going to really poison the moment. It was going to certainly poison the moment
for me, but it would poison the moment for the other
people, which is precisely what I didn't want to do. I can live with my own problems
if I have to, but to inject that
into a wedding, it's like, this is very bad karma.
So this is
why I was thinking of the world as what you make it.
It's the choices that we make
about how we feel
that then condition and reshape things
as they are. So far,
that makes sense? And this is our practice.
I often think of this meditation hall or the Zendo as a kind of laboratory.
It's pretty quiet.
As long as we're sitting here, we actually get along really well.
And we get to
investigate ourselves, which is where all of these
tides and rhythms and energies
are generating from. So where this leads
me
has to do with
the reality that we live in in this country.
Which I find tremendously disturbing.
And I have to preface this by saying
because a couple of people called me, I gave a talk on this subject
a couple of weeks ago at Berkeley Zen Center, and people want to know if I assumed
that everybody was in agreement with me.
And I didn't, actually. But I think, but I know
them. So that's, it was a little clear to me,
I don't know you. So it's presumptuous.
It's presumptuous for me to say, to think that you all
you don't think the way I do. I don't think the way you do, each of
you. I don't know that you're going to necessarily even, that we would
agree on a political basis. Although I think
given that we're in Northern California, there's probably some
there's something to speak to that.
But it's really, I want to be very careful
about that. And I want to make room in my mind
and in this room for everybody's, for how everybody
feels, because that's part of the truth that creates the world.
So I've been thinking about healthcare.
And I've been thinking about all this stuff that
been seeing in the news, you know, about the
birthers who believe that President Obama was
not actually a citizen. And the deathers who believe that
he's going to create death panels. And the
10thers who believe that the 10th
Amendment to the Constitution prohibits any spending programs
or regulation. The oathers who believe
that he has already completely violated his
oath of office. These are things that are a foot.
But I want to
again, I want to backtrack and say, I think we would have
probably a very lively discussion in this room about
healthcare and, you know, what we agree on and what we don't agree on.
From both sides, I would assume. You know, people
who are uncomfortable from the left and people who are uncomfortable from
the right. But as soon as you start creating these blocks
birthers, 10thers, these fantasies and these stories
what's the root of that? The root of that to me is fear.
And
it's the projection of fear
of a real existential fear. Biologically
it's not so hard
to understand. You know, as animals
we have a certain reactive
we have
a reactive basis for
wanting to preserve our existence. But as
humans, what we often do
is then we project it outwards. We project these fears outwards.
And that's how we feel
that becomes the truth of how we feel.
And when we form groups and blocks
and ideologies, which inevitably we do
I don't think you can get away from that. But can we
investigate these in such a way that
we are simultaneously aware
of what it is we are afraid of?
I'm afraid about health care.
It's impoverishing
of us, my own family. It costs
so much. And it's not reliable.
It's like when I've experienced it myself and I've seen other
people experience, just when you need it
is, I've seen, that's when you get kicked off.
These are not
unfounded fears. And then you fear for your
well-being. You fear for the well-being of your
people who are concerned about death panels or concerned about the fear for their
parents or perhaps for themselves as they're aging.
There are all kinds of conditions
that understandably give rise to this.
But the question is how do we
the projection, I would say the projection on Obama
who as our first African American president is
he's like one of the greatest fields for projection
that we've ever had. So how could you have this guy
who's simultaneously a communist, a fascist, and a racist?
And now
some of you may think that's one of one or another
is the case. I can accept that
people think that. It doesn't necessarily make it true.
But there's a basis for how we think about these things.
So this fear is
an underlying delusive
force. This is a really primary
motivating factor for taking up the practice.
It's why some of you may have
come to this practice by virtue of your birth and your family tradition.
But a lot of us if I look around this room I would assume come from
other traditions.
I came to practice when I just
didn't know what to do. And it was very frightening.
I had to do something.
And I walked into the meditation hall
and in some mysterious way I felt at home.
And then
but that's when the work had to begin. That's when the work
of self investigation had to begin.
So this, I want to read you a few things
and then maybe leave some time for discussion.
But I'd like to say
each of us needs to take responsibility for our greed,
our anger, our delusion, our fear.
Because there's nobody but us that's making
the world.
And one of the things we do by forming organization
or political organization, any kind of organization, somehow
it's like we think we're kind of spreading the responsibility
but still there's nobody but us. There's nobody but me.
There's nobody but you that's making this world.
We take this complete responsibility.
I
wanted to read you a few things from Suzuki Roshi.
I've been digging around in his archives this week
and found a few things.
So speaking of, well here's how he talks
about the mechanism
of fear in his unique way. It's from a lecture
of his in 1967.
Once you are involved or concentrated on something, your mind will crystallize
and you will have some clear idea of yourself
subjectively and objectively of yourself.
That's what will arise. That crystallized self-reflection
projects itself on the world.
And then you have various feelings about the
object. But that object is the
projection of your mind.
If that feeling is good or the
object is good, the object that you project out in the world
which is your idea of the world,
if that object or feeling is good you will naturally cling to it.
But when you cling to some object
it means you are clinging to yourself at the same time
because that object is the projected
self. And that attachment will result
in some fear.
That's where it goes. That attachment will result in some fear.
Because you attach to it and try not to lose it
you want to hold on to your security.
You want to hold on to your joy. You want
to hold on to this person that you love
and who is ill. He says,
but nothing is permanent. Everything is changing.
Though you cling to it, that object will change
even though you have a fear of losing it.
The more your mind is particularized or crystallized
you will have uneasiness. So uneasiness is just
one of the myriad ways of expressing dukkha
which I'm sure you talk about all the time here.
How does guilt translate dukkha?
What?
Unsatisfactory? Yeah.
There's various kinds. You can break it down at different times.
But in the broadest sense it's just this feeling that
something is wrong.
It's just uneasiness.
The more your mind is particularized
or crystallized you will have uneasiness.
The more you believe your feelings
you will have uneasiness. On the back of my car
is if you believe in
the power of bumper stickers
this is a good one. Don't believe everything you think.
But think it.
That's the other thing I want to encourage you. Think anything you want to think.
Really go where your mind
explore where your mind wants to go. But just don't believe that that's necessarily
the way it is. Anyway, that's a digression.
That is what will result from your ordinary effort.
What I think he means is that is what will result. This
uneasiness is what will result from your habitual activity.
While zazen practice
or meditation practice will not result in this kind of fear
or attachment. Well, sometimes it does.
But right in the meditation is the opportunity
to be free from it. That is the
tool. That's what happens as we sit.
I think it's
almost universally true. We find ourselves caught someplace
and then we find a way to let go of it.
That feeling doesn't hold on. It moves.
If we claim to it, if we're stuck on it, then it gets worse and worse.
But if we can just breathe into it and allow the
mind to change, then we're looking
into the nature of impermanence. Which, as Nagarjuna said,
is actually raising the thought of enlightenment.
He says, well, meditation practice will not
result in this kind of fear or attachment. Our effort will lead in the opposite
direction. So the more you practice, the more
your mind resumes its fundamental state.
Big. Where there is no feeling of attachment,
no discrimination, no fear.
This is how we express the difference between
your effort in meditation and
your effort in the habits of
ordinary life.
I want to read one more thing. This is from a question and answer
at Tasahara in 1968.
A student asks,
Roshi, what should I do about the fear that causes small mind
or limited mind? Suzuki Roshi says,
fear looks like something that will
cover your entire being. But if you wait,
if you watch it, watch the fear, watch
yourself, there will not be any more fear.
So if you can actually fully engage
with the practice of
mindfulness, the practice of awareness of what is arising,
then fear is just part of the river that's flowing
through. I'm sure many of you have experienced this
and yet we're not done with it because we're not
fully enlightened, we get caught.
But every time we're caught, we can also release.
So he says, whatever it is, it's necessary
to drive your fear.
It's a little awkward expression, but what he means,
Roshi often said, you be the boss of you.
What he means by that, not boss, like boss around, but it's like, don't be driven
by your feelings.
Don't be pushed around by your feelings, but if you take responsibility
for them, then if you stand up
to your feelings rather than believing in them,
then you have some freedom. The follow-up question
was, Suzuki Roshi, love is love and
hate is hate and love is empty and hate is empty.
It wasn't a real question, it was just this kind of formulation
and he says, well there you will have a great sorrow
or longing, the loneliness of emptiness.
It's a beautiful expression, the loneliness
of emptiness, which means
perhaps the yearning, longing for the infinite
that we have, the longing to connect
the feeling that sometimes there is just simply
a gap. And yet
I feel this as a
bittersweet experience, like
really good dark chocolate
that it's very rich.
There's some bite to it. It's very rich and fully satisfying.
And to recognize that
each of us carries this
loneliness of emptiness. One of our ancestors
Dogen Zenji in the 13th century,
one of the things he said was, when Dharma fills your body
and mind, you realize that something is missing.
When Dharma fills your body and mind, you realize that something
is missing. If I were to
add a gloss to that, I would say, you realize that something
is missing and that's just fine. Instead of
our habitual American way, if I will
of trying to fill up
concretize, consume
anything we can to get rid of
this feeling that something is missing.
So when we tried to do that, then we're caught in this
fear. So Suzuki Roshi says, you will have a great sorrow longing, the loneliness
of emptiness. Until you get accustomed to this experience,
you cannot get out of trouble or fear or whatever it
is. When you can remain still with some
composure in the pitch dark, you will have
true, deep composure.
This is what our practice is
to just be still
and accepting
of whatever arises in our mind without pushing it away
without clinging to it
and to something we do together. You come, you know, there's about 70 people
in this room who came here on a Monday night to do this same kind of thing.
So we help each other
just by being in the same room together.
We help each other. This room full of people
is making the world.
This room full of people, some of you don't even know why you're here,
I'm sure, but just
this is what I'm doing tonight. This is what I've said I'm going to do.
Some of you feel really connected
to the group of people. Some of you probably feel lonely,
like not fully connected. Some of you may
be new. Some of you may be tired from working all
day. And yet we come and we practice here
together with whatever is arising.
And this is how we make the world.
Now, of course, I'm oversimplifying
because then there's all kinds of
other problems and policies and things we have to figure out.
But if we're willing to sit and actually see
what it is that we are afraid of, then we can
communicate with ourselves and communicate with each other.
And I urge you to do that
and I'm just inspired
and encouraged to
visit and be with a group of people who are doing it. People are doing this.
This is a very natural human activity.
I say this, I've been working in a prison for 12 years, women's federal
prison. We have a very strong group there, about 25 women.
And it's amazing. It feels just like being here.
Really comfortable. We have a lot of intimacy with each other.
As I said, this is a fundamental human
experience and yet so rare and precious as well.
So I think I'm going to stop there. It's almost 9 o'clock. I'd like to leave
a couple minutes for questions and
responses and also I'll stay around for a few minutes after.
Anything.
Hi. Good to see you.
You said something about love and loving
and then you passed right over it and said love is empty and
hate is empty. That was not me. That was somebody else.
I was reading something. I don't know
what she meant. It was a she now.
What's your question?
Did you really mean anything or would you disagree
with the statement that love and loving and all that is
emptiness? There's emptiness about it? Yes, but
depends on what you mean by emptiness. What I mean by emptiness
is emptiness to me
is the expression of complete interdependence.
When we say
empty, for example, we call this
provisionally a guitar, but which
part is the guitar? Is this part the guitar?
It's empty
of itself nature. It's made up of
things. It's made up of strings, of wood, of metal. You're made
up of flesh and bones and brain.
Emptiness is about complete interdependence.
Of course, love is empty because it's the greatest interdependence.
It's not a pejorative
sense. The word empty is problematic in English.
It has a negative value in
shunyata, which
doesn't exactly mean emptiness.
It doesn't mean empty like
scary empty. And this is a problem.
We actually are afraid of emptiness. We're afraid of letting go
of ourself. We're afraid of dying. There were other
quotations I could have read.
But really, nothing is born and nothing dies.
And if we recognize
that, then the love that we have
for every being, including those we're in conflict with,
there's space for it to arise.
We could talk about this for several years.
Maybe one more
because I'm aware of the time.
I understood most of your talk, which is unlike most of the Zen teachers
that I listened to. So I thank you for that.
In helping future Zen teachers,
is that the standard Zen definition of emptiness, complete
interdependence? That would help me understand future teachers.
So what's the opposite called?
What is it called when you aren't interdependent?
I mean liberation or whatever.
No, no, I'm serious. Delusion. To think that things
somehow have their own self-nature,
which is sort of a platonic ideal
of the glass
or the guitar.
You think about the
wonderful quotation from A Chan Cha
who said, this glass is already broken.
It's seeing,
this is a glass because it's functioning like a glass.
We make it a glass. Otherwise, what is it if it doesn't have any water
in it? And if you don't know the name for it.
So the question is, in your bare perception,
how do you accept things without even necessarily knowing how they are?
But in the reality that we live,
everything is co-constructed. This is, if you
study this basic
discovery that the Buddha made, the most basic
discovery I think is the notion of dependent origination,
which is, I don't know if you study it, very complex, but it's all about
how everything is co-constructed.
Because there is no fixed self.
The self is just the interaction of
various kinds of elements and causes and conditions. And that is
emptiness. That's very helpful. Thank you.
We should probably end it's after 9.
Thank you very much. I'm going to stay around for a few minutes.
I enjoyed being here with you.
