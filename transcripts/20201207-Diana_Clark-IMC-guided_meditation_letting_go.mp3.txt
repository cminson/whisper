The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening. A really warm welcome to everybody.
It's so nice to practice with others. Makes a difference.
Hmm. Yeah, so tonight we'll begin with a guided meditation.
And as sometimes happens when I sit down, my voice gets a little scratchy.
I'm just going to clear my throat here.
Hmm.
Okay, so hopefully that's better.
And it's, of course, you guys don't see it, but the configuration of camera and stuff is a little bit different here this evening.
And so for me, you look different.
Maybe I look the same, but okay, it's a little silly.
So for a guided meditation, no matter what configuration your seating arrangement is or where you're sitting,
whether it's how it usually is or if it's a little bit different,
can we just arrive? And I really like this expression to sit and know we're sitting.
It doesn't take a lot of mindfulness. It doesn't take a brute force.
Instead, it just requires that we incline the mind towards what is this experience.
So to sit and know you're sitting.
And if there happened to be a train nearby, just note hearing.
And bringing our attention to the sensations in the body.
Are there any obvious places that have some tension, some tightness?
It might be that just bringing some gentle awareness to those areas helps create the conditions in which there might be some softening, some relaxing.
In some ways, it's like different areas of the body just need some attention, some care.
And if it's the case that you bring attention to areas that have tightness or tension,
maybe it doesn't soften, doesn't lessen, doesn't go away, can you be okay with that?
And softening and letting go of the idea that it has to be different.
Can there be some ease with there not being ease with the absence of ease?
We can just fold that unease, the tension, fold it into our practice.
This too, this too, is included, not excluded but included.
It's something we can bring our attention to in a simple, gentle, relaxed manner.
And then resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the movement of the abdomen or the chest or maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose.
Also in a relaxed, gentle manner.
One way to view practice to consider
practice is that we're letting go of distractions, we're letting go of preoccupations as best we can.
And we're using our attention on the sensations of breathing as a support for that letting go.
And we might find that letting go is too strong of an expression.
Maybe it's something like relaxing or softening or letting be.
Maybe it's something like allowing, making space.
Those kind of movements, the opposite of holding on tighter.
Of course we can't just let go because we hear about it or think about it.
But we help create the conditions.
In which letting go might arise.
We can't just let go.

A big part of practice
Maybe even all of practice
Is to support this letting go
Letting go of things
That aren't helpful, aren't supportive
Don't support freedom
Peace, ease, awakening
So of course
Then this letting go
Can be expressed in the way that we meditate
In the way that we practice mindfulness
And as we let go of those things
That aren't helpful
We find that we might have more capacity
More space
More availability
For what is helpful
Which of course helps us
To be available, not only for us
In our own practice, but for others
So that our practice can be a benefit
Not only for us
But for those we come in contact with
And indirectly with others
So letting go
Is a way
To really support the growth
The development of our practice
So that we can
Show up in the world
Unburdened
And
And now I have to
Find the bell that just fell
And letting go of the idea that the bell
Has to be in a particular place
In a particular time
