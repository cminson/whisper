The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So we'll be continuing with this theme of mindfulness as a protection,
and we'll be using various different images to build up,
maybe a bigger picture of the multifaceted way that mindfulness operates.
And a lot of that has to do with protection in various forms.
So we started out with the fundamental idea that mindfulness is a good protection for us.
And then today, we're actually going to talk about the flip side of that,
which is the danger of not being mindful.
And the Buddha gave a number of images that are about this.
Seems that he was quite willing to approach from the side of danger,
maybe for some lines that works well.
And then we'll talk about ways to address that danger,
including something that the Buddha himself did in his practice.
So the reason that we would need protection such as through mindfulness
is because there is genuine danger in our situation as humans.
I don't want to over dramatize that, but we can certainly see, I think in our own mind,
that there are a lot of long-standing habits,
not all of which are beneficial.
We may not be acting on these various things going on in our mind,
but we can't deny that they're there when we have mindfulness.
So again, not to worry, that's normal for humans.
Everyone who's born as human has various kinds of greed, hatred, and delusion
that comes with the territory.
They're actually not very personal,
even though they have their specific manifestations for us.
As I was reviewing various images about mindfulness,
I couldn't help but notice that there really are quite a few
that relate to the danger of non-mindfulness.
So I thought we'd look at just a few of them today.
So one of them is about a beauty queen,
and I'm sorry for the gendered imagery in this Sutta.
You're very welcome to alter it in your mind.
However, it's appropriate.
So the Buddha is telling the monks a story about a beauty queen
who is walking through a city and singing and dancing
as a large crowd of people gathers around.
So then he goes on to say,
then a person would come along wishing to live,
not wishing to die, wishing for happiness, averse to suffering.
And someone would say,
you must carry around this bowl of oil filled to the brim
between the crowd and the beauty queen.
And a man with a drawn sword will be following right behind you.
And wherever you spill, even a little bit of it,
right there, he will fell your head.
So what do you think?
Would that person stop attending to that bowl of oil
and out of negligence turn their attention outwards?
The monks say, no.
So the Buddha goes on to say,
I have made up this simile in order to convey a meaning.
And here's the meaning.
The bowl of oil filled to the brim is a designation
for mindfulness directed to the body.
So there you have it.
The sense that we could walk with a bowl of oil filled to the brim
in the midst of a jostling, excited crowd and not spill any of it.
So it's pointing toward the importance of precision.
I don't know that we need the anxiety that might go along
with an image like that.
But it does convey the importance, I think the Buddha was trying
to relate in that case.
And then there are also two images given that relate to an idea
of a homeland or a domain where it is safe for us to dwell.
And then outside of that, it's dangerous.
So we'll take a look at those.
There's another suit where the Buddha is talking about places
where hunters set up traps of pitch in order to catch monkeys.
And so it says those monkeys who are not foolish and frivolous,
when they see the pitch, avoid it from afar.
But a monkey who is foolish approaches the pitch
and seizes it with his hand and he gets caught.
And then thinking, I will free my hand.
He seizes it with the other hand and gets caught.
And then thinking, I will free both hands.
He seizes it with a foot and then the other foot and then the muzzle.
And so he gets caught in five different places.
So the Buddha goes on to say, please do not stray outside your
own resort into the domain of others.
Mara will gain access to those who stray outside Mara being,
in this case, the forces of distraction in the mind.
And what is the resort?
What is the place where we should remain safe?
It is the four establishments of mindfulness.
So I can relate to this monkey image in that there can be times
where I know the mind is caught up.
And my attempts to free it, I say, oh, I shouldn't think about that.
I'm going to try to think about something else.
Then the mind is actually just continuing to think in some way.
And so then there's this sort of ongoing, finally,
there's a realization, oh, I just need to,
I need to drop this effort.
It's not going in the right direction.
Oh, and I said there were two of these images about the homeland
or the safety.
So the second one is about a quail that is living in a field
and it's being attacked by a hawk when it leaves the field.
It's a similar kind of image as the monkey.
And in both of these sutras,
the dangerous place is specifically said to be the five chords
of sensual pleasure, meaning eye, ear, tongue, nose, body.
So the usual ways where we would want to seek comfort or pleasure,
the things that occupy the mind.
And then the safe place is the four establishments of mindfulness.
So it's important to note that although the similes are about
physical places, because that's easy to imagine,
what the Buddha names as safety is not actually a physical place,
but a stance of our mind.
So we're safe when the mind is mindful.
So he's not saying that we need to be locked up in our house
with the door bolted in order to be safe.
He's saying instead that there's something to do with how our mind is.
So we begin maybe with, we begin with this practice of guarding
the sense doors.
That's what we talked about yesterday.
And usually when people start,
they find it useful to actually avoid situations that are particularly
triggering.
And that is totally fine when we do actually have that choice.
It can be skillful to do that.
And for instance, people who are in recovery should definitely choose
not to go to bars or we may choose not to go to a big noisy party
if we don't have to go.
Or maybe we would simply be more subtle and just choose to have fewer
conversations with our neighbor whose political views are very
different from ours.
So that's fine to do.
But in the end, the Buddha is pointing toward the real danger of being
from within.
It's our own lack of mindfulness or our own lack of capacity with
mindfulness.
So like strengthening muscles,
we have to exercise mindfulness in order to grow our capacity.
And you may have already seen in your practice that there,
once you started cultivating mindfulness,
there came to be situations where in the past it would have been
very difficult to stay mindful or to be skillful.
And then one day you're present for it and you realize,
I didn't automatically lash out when I think I would have a couple
of months ago.
And so we realize, oh, my capacity has grown a little bit.
And so this is nice when we notice it spontaneously.
But I want to talk a little bit about deliberately cultivating our
capacity.
So at some point, just like we would have to increase the weight
stack at the gym,
we'll probably have to venture into more challenging situations
and try to remain mindful and kind of move into new domains and
expand the domain of safety for our mind.
So we're not, you know, we're not seeking out difficulty willy-nilly,
but it is really a kind of a fun point in practice when we start
doing little experiments to see if we can be mindful in more
challenging situations.
So we're trying to stay in the safe domain of mindfulness,
but gradually develop what is needed so that that domain gets
larger.
And the Buddha talks about doing this in his own practice at one
point.
This is before he was awakened.
So there is a sutta entitled fear and dread where the Buddha
deliberately went to scary forests, scary forest places to
practice in order to remain mindful during the experience of
fear and dread.
There's a lot in the sutta and I'm just singling out one point
for today.
But one of the key points is that he consciously considered ahead
of time.
Before he went into the situation, he consciously considered that
he possesses certain good qualities, including mindfulness.
So he actively reminded himself before going into the woods that
he is ethical, he's mindful, he's caring, and even has some
degree of wisdom.
And this sort of buoyed up his mind and heart so that he could
stay aware even during experiences that were bringing up
fear.
So we can do this also in our own lives.
There was a time when I did a program in chaplaincy training.
And when I, this is a while ago, and when I started the program, I
didn't really have, I didn't have any experience with going into
hospitals and meeting people there and talking with them.
And part of the training in this program is that we needed to do
volunteer work.
And I chose to go into a hospital.
And I joined the spiritual care volunteer team.
And I would have to go into rooms with very little information
about, you know, I didn't know anything about what was wrong with
the person or anything about their background or very much at
all.
I think you get their name and their religion listed on the sheet.
And I would go in and I would offer myself, you know, how can I be
helpful here?
Would you like to talk?
And at the beginning, I was, I didn't know how to do that.
And I felt quite nervous.
Of course, I had some, you know, I was going to the training
program.
So I had some ideas of where to start, but it took the practice
of doing it to be able to be present and mindful in situations
like that that were very unclear or uncertain and just lead from
the heart and see what I could do.
So that was very good training.
And it did expand the domain in which I was more comfortable with
being with, with challenging situations.
So you can try this as you approach a challenging situation is
to bolster the confidence ahead of time by bringing to mind some
kind of inspiration from our practice.
We could recollect our own good qualities as the Buddha did.
And it's also recommended that we can recollect the Buddha, the
Dharma, the Sangha, you know, other inspiring themes for us.
And then, and then you can let those go and just go into the
situation, intending to be mindful and see what comes up.
So we're working with this idea of danger and protection.
And with the protection of mindfulness, more and more of the
world looks safe to us.
We're safe from things that are sensually alluring or things that
bring up aversion or cause agitation in some way.
And when we have that through the establishments of mindfulness,
it's a kind of safety that we can carry around with us.
So we become free in our own awareness, no matter what the
situation.
Of course, it's, it takes a while.
It's a long process to, to expand that.
So I want to respect that process very much.
But we can maybe be inspired that awakened people can go
anywhere in peace and safety, everywhere safe for them.
So may your range of mindfulness and safety keep expanding as
you continue to practice.
You might consider if there are conscious ways that you could do
that.
So thank you.
We'll continue tomorrow.
