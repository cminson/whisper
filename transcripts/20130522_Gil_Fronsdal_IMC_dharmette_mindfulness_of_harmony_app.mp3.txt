Dharmette: Mindfulness of 
Harmony  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by 
Gil Fronsdal on May 22, 2013  
 
 
It has been  interesting to have leaf blowers here, 
and the sounds change over the years . We have 
Dharma practice days on Fridays, and as we 
went through the day, we would navigate the 
leaf blowers. I would try to do guided 
meditations during the leaf blowing . We’d have 
discussions during the sounds of the se leaf 
blowers.  
 
I wanted to go out there and talk to them about it  
– to explain to them that we meditate, and could 
they come earlier perhaps?  
 
Or should we include it as part of the practice, 
and just be mindful – mindful of our aversion, 
our judgments, or in my case, my feelings that  
I’m not being a very good leader of a meditation 
center where they do leaf blowing. In my mind, 
I’d ask, “I wonder how long this is going to last, 
this Friday leaf blowing.”   
But today is Wednesday – it’s a new era. So 
maybe now it’s going to be on Wedne sdays 
instead of Fridays. So it goes.  
 
In this practice, p art of what we do is to try and 
be in harmony with what is going on , rather than 
be in conflict with it . I think that the contrast 
between being in conflict versus being in 
harmony is a useful distinction  to keep in mind. 
Many times we are in conflict with what is going 
on in our lives  – with other people, with 
situations, and also with ourselves . But if we 
reformulate our aversion, and try to approach all 
the different circumstances of our lives as 
somet hing to be in harmony with, then life 
becomes a lot more enjoyable – and also freer. 
There isn’t much freedom around feeling conflict 
inside : tightening up, being aversive, pushing 
away .  
 
What then does it take to live in harmony?  One 
thing it takes is to be attuned to what is going 
on. You p ay attention to the situation you are in. 
Are you attuned to the situation ? Some people 
are so self -contained that they hardly notice 
what is going on around them. They don’t really 
tune in to the context they are in . For example, if one of you decided to be a leaf blower, and you 
determined  that the best place to blow leaves is 
near the meditation hall  while we’re meditating , 
then I would say that you are not very attuned to 
what is going on.  
 
One of the functions of mindfulness is to help us 
have sufficient  attention so that we can attune 
ourselves to a situation, understand what is 
going on, and then behave in ways that are 
appropriate. We don’t force ourselves into being 
someone we are not , but rather we remain with  
who we are in a way that is harmonious or 
appropriate for the situation.  
 
We all do this to some degree. Our behavior is 
very different if we walk into a nursery school  
classroom where the children are all napping , 
than if we go to a soccer game and our favorite 
team is winning , or if we attend a funeral. In 
different circumstances, we attune ourselves in 
order to be appropriate. We don’t go to a funeral 
and sing some song from The Doors. We attune 
oursel ves to what  is there , and change how we 
are. One of the most wonderful experiences of 
life is to go into a nursery school full of kids who 
are napping. You don’t want to disturb them ; 
you’re attuned, so you stay quiet. At a funeral, maybe we would whisper if we neede d to talk to 
someone. We naturally adjust ourselves to 
circumstances.  
 
Part of the attunement is to know ourselves . 
What is the appropriate way for us to be in 
harmony with the circumstances? Sometimes a 
situation is so compelling , that it defines how we 
should be. Or sometimes what is going on within 
us is so strong , that we define the response. 
Sometimes it is a combination of the two  – 
knowing who we are , what we’re feeling that 
day, what we’re thinking, tuning into the situation  
around us  – and then cr eating harmony.  
 
In that attunement, how can we live so that we 
feel free and at peace? To be in  harmony is to 
figure out the way to be at peace with what is 
going on . But actually, rather than saying “being 
at peace,” I would prefer the language of “not 
being in conflict ” with what is . Peace might be 
too high a standard  against which  to measure 
ourselves.   
 
It is preferable t o not be in conflict with the leaf 
blowing. For m e, when the leaf blowing is really 
close by, I feel it physically , as an 
uncomfortable, agitating energy. So, if my idea of being in harmony and being peaceful is the 
absence of that, then I am not attuned to the 
situation. However , if I am mindful of the value of  
harmony, I would ask, “C an I attune myself to 
this sound which i s affecting me in a way that  
make s me uncomfortable ? Can I attune myself 
in such a way  that I am not in conflict with that?”  
 
One very valuable thing I have learned is how to 
be comfortable with discomfort. If I am not 
comfortable with being uncomfortable, then I am 
not in harmony. If I have th e idea that it shouldn’t 
be this way, then I am overlaying conflict, 
separa tion, and distance  from the experience  
onto the situation I’m in .  
 
How can I not be in conflict with my agitation? 
How can I be attuned to that? Sometimes when 
we are trying to attune ourselves to a situation, 
we notice the situation; we notice ourselves; we 
notice we have to emphasize one more than the 
other . Sometimes , we have to share one or the 
other. When you are trying to be attuned to 
everything, a  great thing to do in a social 
situation is to help other people to be attuned by 
telling them how you are. You might say, “I woke 
up this morning really grumpy , and you are 
better off knowing that.” You do them a favor. In case you start snapping at them , they might not 
take it so personally . They might be a little more 
prepared for it. So , sharing how you are can be  
a way of being attuned.  
 
Or someone else may be having a hard time . So 
to be attuned , you might  ask them  what ’s going 
on for them. You try to find out more. And with 
whatever information you receive , you learn 
more , and can better attune yourself to the 
situation you are in. Then you can ask yourself , 
“How can I not be in conflict with this situation? 
How can I be in harmony with it? How can I 
respond to the situation in a way that is 
harmonious with what the situation needs? ” It’s 
a beautiful thing to do.  
 
This is one thing we can do with mi ndfulness. 
Mindfulness teaches us how to pay attention , 
and as we learn to pay attention in the present 
moment, we can use that to attune ourselves  to 
the situation , and to bring ourselves into 
harmony with  it, inside and out . 
 
Those are my thoughts for to day.
