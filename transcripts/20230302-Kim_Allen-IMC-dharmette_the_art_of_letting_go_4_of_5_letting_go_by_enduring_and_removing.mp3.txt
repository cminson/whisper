 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, so we're continuing with our series on the art of letting go, seven practices that lead to letting go. And yesterday we had the pair of using and avoiding. And today we have another pair that sounds like a big contrast like that. We have letting go by enduring and letting go by removing. So is there some active removal of things or is there a more passive endurance of them? And again, we have some discernment about that. When do we hang in there and tough it out? And when do we eliminate something that is unwholesome or harmful? So starting with what to endure, the teachings say, what taints should be abandoned by enduring? So we have a pair of things that are a person reflecting wisely, bears cold and heat, hunger and thirst, and contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping things. And it also goes on to say various kinds of pain we have. So this one starts with various kinds of discomfort. And it's always in life about what we have to endure, particularly with our body. These are about our body. Have you noticed how much of your attention and energy go toward making things comfortable for the body? That's not inherently bad, of course. But it's also not so reliable, is it? And we're always going to be able to make it the right temperature and avoid hunger and thirst and contact with things we don't want to touch. When I lived at Insight Retreat Center about 10 years ago, at that time, there wasn't much control over the temperature in the building. And I really suffered when it was too cold. I mean, I was a little cold. And there were various mental machinations. I could apply to that. I don't know if they really helped. Things like, I'm supposed to be a good Buddhist and I'm supposed to just be mindful. And then the mind would just answer with, no, wait, I need to care about myself and have compassion. And it should be like this and it should be like that. So I was enduring in a sense, but there was a little bit extra added by my mind, let's say. And eventually I realized in a very undramatic way that I was fine, actually. I could handle the temperature variations and it really wasn't that big of a deal. So, you know, enduring and seeing the way the mind tries to endure, but with a little bit of greater version added onto it. And then finally just settles down into actual equanimity. And it gives the confidence that this practice of just being with something does actually work. You know, if one actually uses mindfulness, it will eventually engender genuine equanimity and not the false equanimity of putting up with something. Just gritting your teeth and burying it. That's not what this is referring to. It says enduring. We don't know what other word we could use, but it means actually enduring in a way such that there's letting go. And there is peace. The mind and body just come to peace with how it is. So these are practices that lead to release. And it's important as we go through the enduring process that we see how the mind doesn't want to endure, doesn't want to actually just have equanimity. And it will eventually settle down because there's dukkah in that extra that's added. This is like the second arrow teaching. There is the first arrow of how it's not always easy for the body. And then there's the other ones we add on about, you know, like it, it shouldn't be like this. How can I stop it? Who is responsible and how can I talk with them? You know, these kinds of things. So life is definitely going to give you opportunities for this. But we can practice with it deliberately also. I remember one time Gil coming back from a vacation he had been on where I think he was camping in the mountains somewhere and by a mountain lake. You know, those lakes are often snowmelt. And, you know, I think it was in the spring. And I said, you know, wasn't it, you know, didn't you didn't really go in the lake, did you? And he said, mildly, it was cold for 22 seconds. So clearly he had timed it. So we can practice with this deliberately also at times in order to challenge our system. So, you know, when we do, we get the chance to make the all important distinction between unpleasant feeling and want it to go away. And those are different. And we contact also, I said, you know, looking at her mind, we contact our relationship to powerlessness. You know, how do you relate to having no control over something? That's actually a big one to work with. So then, you know, one for this is that we gain the confidence that we can handle certain things, which is important. How is it going to be in the end when you die? When you get very ill and your body is not able to move or function properly. There may be very unusual feelings of that being able to endure them is good. I don't know. It might be painful or it might not. But it will certainly be very bizarre out of your normal zone, the feelings that come dying. So being able to endure that can allow a more clear minded death. And the suttas also ask us to endure besides the gadflies and the cold and the heat is it says, ill spoken unwelcome words. And those I know can be very hard to endure. It's another area where we don't have a lot of control, though. People say what they do. Even if we live our life trying to be kind, we can't guarantee that we're not going to receive ill spoken unwelcome words. And how do we can we endure those or do we react and defend immediately? I know that's not easy. The texts say that one of the best resources for handling unskillful speech coming at us is mindfulness of the body. And in the works of the adults, I found to literally put attention in the feet and stay grounded, if you can remember. And another good way to do it is to expand awareness to include the whole body and even the space beyond the body. And I found a man named Analio saying that he was once in a conversation with another monk who was very angry that Analio had done some scholarly work defending women having the opportunity for full ordination. There is some conservatism among monks that say that that shouldn't be allowed. And he was very angry with him. And Analio said he just sat there while the other monk attacked him in his work and he just focused on the space between them and around them. And eventually, you know, he didn't react and eventually the other monk finished his tirade and left. What else was there to do? And so he just stayed present with it. So it is important there are times when we will need to endure. And it's also though, the text also says that we can sometimes let go of things by removing. And, you know, what is it that we are supposed to let go of by removing? Generally, they are unwholesome mind states. So mind states of greed, hatred and delusion. We don't remove them immediately though. Generally, we would do it once we have investigated them enough. And there's a reason that this method comes fairly late in sequence. I think we want to go with removing only when we're very clear on what we're doing and how and why. So basically, we have to be careful not to mix removal with aversion, which means it can be kind of an advanced practice. It might be that we have to endure for a little while so that we have equanimity and care when we do remove. And also we'll see actually that removing can have a very gentle flavor as well as a stronger one. So we can maybe look at some examples. Sometimes we do need to remove actively when the mind is in a really bad state, like we would get a snake out of our house. But of course we do that carefully, right? So if we can see, and we're seeing was the first method, if we can see that the mind is repeatedly getting caught in harmful thought patterns, you know, maybe we would try just having mindfulness at first and see if that works, you know, just noting anger or irritation. But if that doesn't work, then there are other things we can try. We can try redirecting our attention, we can try reflecting on the difficulties that come when we have an wholesome mind state. Or we could just kind of withdraw our attention from it. That's kind of like the avoiding, just waiting for the energy to dissipate by being careful not to feed it. So a bit like what Analia was doing. And if all of that doesn't work, then we have set ourselves up well to be able to firmly say to our mind, no more of this. No more of this. And if we do that, if we do it too soon, I think there can be a version. But when it rises up out of genuine strength, then it's compassionate. Another teacher has said that we remove unskillful thoughts this way by saying in our mind, you will not get one more minute of my life. I mean, do you have thoughts where they've had too many minutes of your life? Your life is valuable. Why waste it thinking these terrible thoughts that are only harming you. So it's like setting a boundary. You will not get one more minute of my life. There are other times when removing can be so gentle, we might get free of something by just applying wisdom quite directly such that it dissolves. There's a suta that distinguishes, it distinguishes using mindfulness to let something go and using wisdom. It actually sets up a series of conditions. So first it says that maybe a person just tolerates various unskillful mind states hardly even knowing that they're unskillful. And it says that that person is completely fettered. Think about maybe how my mind was before I even knew the Dharma, all kinds of stuff ran through my mind and I never thought about whether it was skillful or unskillful or it was harming me or going to harm others. I mean, maybe I did sometimes, but not a lot. So there's a lot of fettering there. And then there can also be the case where we see with mindfulness and we see what's going on and we gradually are able to release through our practice of daily life mindfulness. That person is said to be on the path, you know, still fettered like many of us but moving toward awakening because there's mindfulness of what's going on in the mind. And then according to this suta there is a person who divests oneself from unwholesomeness it's like it arises and it's just immediately quenched. Maybe it's, you know, eventually even doesn't arise. So, you know, we're not always in such a clear wise state, but it is good to know that that abandoning by removing can be just straightforward and gentle. It doesn't have to be some kind of a battle. That's the message I want to impart. So, so we have letting go by enduring and letting go by removing. And again, there's a matter of seeing which one is going to be effective. We have to know something about what it means for something to let go. What does that feel like and then we can be then we can know whether a given method has worked. And if, if so great and if not we might know, have a sense of which one to try next. Maybe for those really sticky knots we're going to need more than one, actually, probably we will. So, we continue exploring this art of letting go. And we'll continue with that tomorrow. Have a beautiful day or evening.
