Unification

An important way in which Buddhist meditation unfold s 
can be  subsumed under the word ‘unification ’ or ‘unity. ’ 
Meditation is a process of settling in , so that the 
disparate parts of ourselves get unified  and harmonized.  
 
For many people , as they lead their lives , their thoughts 
are going faster than their bod ies. They are concerned 
about things of the past , the future , or elsewhere. They 
can be jumping around a lot between concerns, 
sometimes very quickly. Then there is the emotional life, 
the mood we may be in. Generally the emotional state 
or the mood lasts longer than the fleeting appearance 
and disappearance o f thoughts. We might be happy , or 
calm, or grumpy – and that persists for a while.  
 
Sometimes you can have a state of mind or a mood that 
is one way, but thoughts that are different. You might 
have a feeling of irritation, but it occurs to you that it 
would be a good thing to be generous to your neighbor. 
So, in spite of your mood, your intentions and thoughts 
may be genero us. There are all of these different parts of ourselves , which can be going in different directions. 
The body can be one way . Our  thoughts can be 
concerned with something different . Our  intentions can 
be something else entirely , and our  emotions and 
moods can be something else  again .  
 
Sometimes the mind  jump s around quite a bit. You can 
see that in meditation. You sit down , and you se e the 
different aspects of the mind . Even if you have some 
major concerns, y ou might notice fleeting thoughts . 
Different kinds of thoughts come in. The y may not be 
about the meditation , even though meditatin g is the 
intention that you had set for yourself.  The thinking mind 
may not have that intention at all. It migh t be involved in 
fantasy or other  concerns. Then you might have a mood 
or emotion left over from something that happen ed 
earlier in the day , and  you bring that with you. Your 
body may be restless or hungr y – or it has gone 
someplace else. What I am trying to convey is the idea 
that we have these disparate parts , which can be 
involved in different concerns almost at the same time.  
 
The process of meditation is to bring these different 
parts of ourselves into unity – so that our body, our 
breathing, our  thoughts, our intentions, our feelings and 
emotions are a ll working together harmoniously on the 
same thing . In a similar way, if you are reading a really 
good book , or are very involved with a movie or with a 
craft you are doing  – it’s captivating and you really enjoy it. Everything in you gets pulled into that activity. 
Because you are absorbed in that activity, y ou are not 
jumping around between ma ny things .  
 
Meditation is a process of unifying, bringing together 
different parts , so that our body, mind, feelings, 
thoughts, and intentions  are all working together , 
harmonized  for the same purpose. One way to help that 
unification process  is the simple practice of mindfulness. 
The act of being mindful  – the presence of mind of 
holding something in awareness  – is like putting all the 
puzzle pieces of our life on the table so that we can see 
them all. One function of mindfulness is to make space  
in the mind to be able to see  all the different things 
going on. It is like creating a bigger container  or context , 
or a large table to hold the different parts of our life. 
Rather than singling out one part and getting contracted 
onto it, it’s an exp ansive  movement . We expand, open 
up, create space around what we know . You might 
know your thinking , your breathing, what you’re feeling 
in your body. The point is not just to see it  – but to see it 
clearly , to recognize it, and  to meet  it with 
expansiveness  or openness .  
 
Some people like the word ‘allowing ’ what is there. 
Making space and allowing things to be there is part of 
the process of unification. Together with that open and 
expansive quality of mindfulness, something else that 
can help the unification process is to choos e, in a clear and conscious way , where you want to have your 
attention.  
 
Our ability to choose our intention is one of the factors 
we want to unify  – it’s part of that gathering together . To 
choose something suc h as focusing on the breath , or in 
walking meditation on the feet, gives a purpose  to our 
practice.  The very gentle sense of opening that allows 
you to be there  is helpful for setting the  purpose that 
you focus on. And with that purpose , you fully allow the 
different puzzle pieces of your life to settle , to get 
absorbed  and focus ed into what  you are doing.  
 
I hope that makes some sense. You might consider  this 
today . How are you? How scat tered? How many 
different things are going on? What is the kaleidoscope 
of feelings, thoughts, sensation s, moods, and purposes 
that come through ? What would it look like to start 
unifying these different parts, or gatherin g yourself 
together, or collecting  everything ?  
 
So, c ollect yourself here and now in this body and mind.  
 
I hope you enjoy your morning.
