 I confess I find it a little intimidating to come before Gil Fonzale, students, specialists in Shyamathan Vipashana. Well trained I'm sure in the slippery monkey of the mind. How's that? Good morning. Well it is an honor for me to be here and particularly on this occasion of the 2,600 and something anniversary of the enlightenment of Shakyamuni Buddha. We've been sitting at Green Gulch beginning last Sunday our usual what's called Rohatsu Seishin, the seven days of intensive sitting that all Zen monasteries and others do around the world at this time of the year to commemorate something called an awakening in the world, a kind of an epiphany or to mark to pick out even arbitrarily a moment in time exemplified by a character, personification if you will even a projection perhaps of our need to awaken into the largest dimension of our birthright. I suppose all of you are familiar with this story but if you don't mind if you don't mind I'd like to I'd like to tell it again a little bit from various points of view. You know we don't know of course that this is the time that some event some epiphany like this took place. Characteristically Christmas, the Saturnalia, the resurrection and so on take place around the changes of the light that equinoxes the solstices. So I think this time of year is a good one when the in at least in the northern hemisphere the night forces beginning to will begin to diminish in the day the light the enlightenment will again occur. Certainly our ancient ancestors sitting in their caves and dark forests look forward to this time of year when miraculously light would return. So maybe it has something to do with that too. So what is this story about somebody born with a golden spoon in his mouth or a silver spoon in his or her mouth? What is it to be born in the midst of privilege which is interesting on the one hand because there's another fable about somebody's born in a stable on another side of the story in poverty. This is that aspect of ourselves where we're born with all the privileges that the so-called material world can provide for us. With parents who care, a father whose son is predicted by the soothsayer, Atista at least was you know in the Indian tradition, came upon the scene when Shakyamuni was born, of course according to the legend miraculously, and predicted a brilliant future for him. He had all the marks of greatness of being a great leader. Either a great spiritual leader he said or a great political, a great king. And actually the father wanted to stay in the family business and not leave home. So he was particularly careful in guarding this youth from those influences that would draw him away from the future that he hoped would be laid down for him, Sudhanana his father. When Buddha was born according to one of the stories we find in the early suttas, and you know it well I'm sure, he took seven steps. You know first thing he did is walk out from the womb take seven steps and point to the sky and to the earth and said in perfect, already perfect language, grammatical language, above the earth and below the heaven I alone in the world honored one. Above the heavens also sometimes it said and below the earth I alone in the world honored one. I alone in the world honored one. And I just want to ask you do we have the world honored one with us today? Sitting here. Do you have any question about who that world honored one is? Is there any one of us who is not the world honored one is what he was saying. Is there anyone who can be you? Is there anyone who will ever again be the particularity that is oneself? Is there anyone here for whom the whole universe as we understand it has not come forth to give you everything you are or another way of looking at it? How does the whole universe recognize itself but as you? Looking back at it. I alone in the world honored one. Each of us is the world honored one without question. But maybe there is a question. If he was the world honored one then what was the big problem? If he was already awakened to that reality then why did he have to leave home? Apparently he forgot it. Apparently we all forget that bright moment of knowing that we are the world honored one. There's another story that at some point in his growing up process before puberty I guess when he was eight or nine there was a festival a spring festival planting festival in which his father the king and one of the ministers or maybe a farmer would plow the first roll and plant the seeds for the coming harvest for the coming crops that in the Shakya clan in the particular area that they would have to grow that year to feed themselves and of course there's been all these ancient rituals around the growth of food and the production of food the necessity for growing food and maintaining ourselves in an agricultural community and so there was much color and hubbub and celebration and dancing and music and singing and you can imagine how colorful it is you can imagine Hollywood doing that putting that one on maybe Ken Reeves again would play the part or maybe this young kid who's in all these movies these days maybe he'd be good part for anyway he he finds it a little disconcerting to notice that as you they're pouring the fields that the plow is turning up cutting into the earth itself and not only that but it's cutting up earthworms and in half and other creatures that live in the earth and birds are swooping down to eat these creatures and larger birds of prey like hawks and falcons are descending on those smaller birds and eating them he finds that upsetting it must have come a time in each of our lives as we're growing up when we understood that life fed on life what was that moment when we realized that what was the moment when you chomped into a stake that you made the connection that the juices running out it were the blood of some animal that you would call it a mukau only a few years before and it felt some affection for whether we forget that moment or not at least in our sensitivity at some time we've all recognized the fact that life feeds on life or Shakespeare said or Hamlet we fed all creatures else to fat us and we fed ourselves for maggots the world is a great recycling system so some kind of dissatisfaction grew in him some kind of anxiety some kind of existential angst about being in this dimension not only that but everything seemed to be changing around him couldn't get hold of anything in spite of the teachings of the Vedas that he was schooled in and in spite of all of the athletic contests and in spite of all of the partying and dancing and music and archery and martial art skills and political skills and so on that he was trained in there was some aspect of it that didn't quite fit I think he even before this so he saw the archetypes of old age sickness and death as we most of us know about that aspect of his story even before that he certainly must have realized that what you get you lose sooner or later you're going to lose everything that you consider important not only that but I'm being raised he thinks to be a great king that man over there is my servant that one over there is a serving dancing girl that one is a farmer what is this thing about identity we have these roles of course he was thinking about the acculturation process that goes on with each of us Russo said everyone is born wasn't it Shandra Russo who said all beings are all men are born for you and everywhere they're in chains I think it was Shakyamuni for that aspect of us who realized that we're all born in chains and think we're free well whether you've seen the movie or the movies or read it in the book or not there is that scene where suddenly he's faced with a starkness of old age sickness and death as presented to him by people in the town outside of his villas and now the dissatisfaction is even more central more pressing he also sees a holy man doesn't he he also sees a big shoe walking who are those people and he's told well that's person with leprosy and that's that's what we're all coming to that old guy and that that one on the on the on the Nat burning and being wailed over by his that's a corpse and so forth and to this end must we come how can you be happy then how can we be happy faced with that everything is passing and you know grasping at pleasures from moment to moment the identity did not satisfy him obviously I don't think the identity your identity satisfy you either or you wouldn't be here that's a whole nother talk see we're shock and morning every one of us we all go through this we all crave we all search for the answers to the great existential questions of birth and death without exception and of course on the one hand we try to bury it in the world there's a lot of diversions out there a lot of ways to hide from this existential anxiety that we have of course what his parents said would be a good idea to marry the boy off given some responsibilities and then maybe he'll settle down and won't worry so much about it and so they do and you know there's a story where he wins the contest the wrestling and I think it's wrestling anyway some kind of contest and the gold medal as it were is given to him by his future wife Yoshadara of course she's depicted as being everything that a young man in the full bloom of puberty would want but it's not enough interestingly enough she too in many of the suitors and stories is a very awakened person in fact in some of the suitors it says that the night that of the party when he decides that he's going to leave they've already discussed this she lays out his clothes for him his traveling clothes she tells his servant to get the horse his favorite horse ready and so on and there is another sudha that says that his enlightenment and her enlightenment took place exactly at the same time and you're familiar with that one there's one in the Savastavadin teachings that on the night that he leaves he sleeps with her and she becomes pregnant and for the next six years she carries the baby and on the night of his enlightenment the baby is born Rahula that they go through the same it's very interesting that this is not some guy leaving the old lady and the kid to go off and search for an Nirvana but that in fact this is a co-event that is not a gender oriented occasion in the world whatever else the traditions may have made of it according to their culture so whether she helps him or not I like to think that it was a event that she knew he had to go and find the answers and that she would have to find her awakening within the milieu that environment that was part of her karma her way her path and we know you know about the story that he leaves and cuts off his hair and since the horseback with the servant and that there's much lamentation and suffering and back at the palaces that they that were left to him by his parents they had three of them according a summer palace and winter palace ones for the rains and so on he leaves all of that crosses in the Magadha another another clans area and wanders about for a while and meets a monk who says I know the teacher for you if you want to practice meditation come with me he goes to meet this meditation master who says I can help you to sit in meditation and overcome all duality and he does and the several practices that they do and because he is Siddhartha he is the chosen one he accomplishes in almost no time what it takes most of his lifetimes to do which is to sit so still that the separation between self and other becomes obliterated or becomes obviated or becomes subsumed into a hole it's not enough he comes no matter how deep the trance he comes back down from the jhana and so on and he leaves that teacher he goes to another teacher who teaches you can teach him even more that the perception of of oneness even that can is still a sticking point I can teach you to overcome even oneness to jump clear of the sense of belonging to all things or all things as you or whatever we however we want to put a very complex so-called state of mind because it was still a state of mind whatever state of mind it was would have a big would have a birth would have a certain longevity would have an ending to it it was not satisfied the first teacher our lara kalamah he left he was an old man the second one the daka rutapata another one he that begged him to stay with him and he after he had mastered all of the what we would call shamatha of a passion a Zen color whatever they were not satisfying to him was there such a thing as brahman was there such a on moving realization was there an eternal self or not I asked you this question try to remember a time you weren't here of course it's impossible you can say I can't remember a time I wasn't here but of course if you look for I or here you can't find it yet at the same time I can't remember a time I wasn't here I know I won't be here and I know what I call I is constantly a rising and disappearing and vanishing and I know doesn't take much sophistication that we are an independent interdependent organism called a universal world I can see that that's easy to see I can see that there's not necessarily any self that I can grasp hold of at the same time I'm here and the world is here how is that what is that I want to know that I want to know what is here that never moves I want to know the one over and against which all of this is happening if there is such a one I want to know that he thinks or I my story is this is my story about what I think he thinks so finally you know he decides well maybe what I need to do is I've still got too much my perceptions my sensory equipment is still too sharp there was a long time ago there was a long tradition of course already in India as we know of asceticism you know really it still is really deny the body punish this thing that stands between me and the eternal all all the craving that comes from the senses the sight the smell the taste the touch and so on bring that to an end and then maybe at last that of which there is no witcher will finally be revealed to me so he tries everything right he doesn't eat but one mustard seed a day he becomes skin and bones his hair grows down to his knees he never bathes he was a mess he goes this last several months all of this has taken place over almost six years now according to what the story is now I know this is probably all old hat to you but I find every time I hear this I think it's amazing because in some way somehow each of us is doing this in our own way if I'm a little footnote here because there is an ascetic side to us as well as a worldly side to us there is that side that wants to be somebody that wants to fulfill him herself within the natural day-to-day confines of the living world to have an identity to fulfill to be happy all those things not very natural to be somebody to be somebody special to be validated to have your paper stamped by the world that that's who you are and of course you know most of us are never really big somebodies in the sense of the public eye we're not fortunately the president maybe or a movie star or something like that nor are we maybe great ascetics or saints you know we're kind of mediocre actually most of us we kind of are in between I'm not the Marquis de Sade on the one hand and I'm not Sir Francis or Sir Francis Saint Francis on the other or Dogen Zengi or Shakyamuni but I have those tendencies the world is driving me nuts and I want to get away from it I can't stand it anymore there must be some answer to all of this you pull back you go to a place they say sure you can let's teach you cut off your hair put on these robes and follow this schedule do all these kind of things after a few weeks if not a few weeks in a few months and the novelty wears off you think what is this about sitting in a forest under a mango tree or something ice cold or in a monastery someplace with sore knees staring at a wall hungry haven't had chocolate in a year haven't had any of the things that you like what did I ever leave the world for this is terrible I'm going to leave this and go back but when you go back you remember why you had left it in the first place but now it's even worse because now you have a little bit of sensitivity to what something else is like now you're really caught I can't live in the monastery I can't live in the over here and I can't live over here what am I going to do at last something begins to occur you maybe I better just give up searching around and settle down someplace maybe you sat down in a chair in the dining room and just put your hands in your lap and said now what side and there was a little opening maybe I should just start looking at how my mind works maybe I should bring these two sides of myself together find the whole of me that's what buddhas they're not too aesthetic finally you know this asceticism didn't work for him he was with all his buddies that were trying to do this five of them one of them had a big spike through his tongue one stood on one foot all day you know all these things punishing the body and finally said it's not working he went down and into the river finally and bathed himself must have felt marvelous imagine having your first bath after months just come down off a backpacking trip of two weeks and you get some idea how good that feels but he was so weak he could hardly crawl out of the river and guess who just then along comes the cow herd the young woman carrying the gruel or what was it it was milk and rice or something for the tree spirit he's trying to pull himself out I like this part of the story he's trying to pull himself out of the out of the stream she comes along says oh my god there's the tree spirit he looks so weak I better feed him something so he eats something of course and his strength begins to come back so much for asceticism I can't I can't tame the mind I can't tame the body and I'm still dissatisfied I'm going to go down and sit I'm going to sit down under that tree over there and I ain't going to move until something until I understand I don't think there's a one of you in here who hasn't had that feeling I'm going to sit down until I understand I'm going to do this till I know something true for myself I've heard all the teachings from other people I remember I'm the world honored one now the big day is coming sits down for take care of it here sits down for seven days and we remember on the last night he's sitting there and then they say in the first watch of the night this thing I mentioned earlier occurs to him but because he's in such deep absorption not only has he always been here he sees that the manifestations of mind and the various manifestations of consciousness if you wish appeared now as this person now as that person back back back back infinite number of births and then he sees also that there's something that we call causation there's a kind of chain around which delusion occurs we call it the 12 links of causation now and I think you're familiar with it I'm not going to go through it all but essentially it means this I have sensory equipment touch taste smell so forth there's contact with what I call phenomena or the objective world from which arises sensation I like it I don't like it and I don't know whether I like it or not I do this I do that or I do this that there's no other choices but those three from contact in fact if I grasp either at holding something that I want to keep or grasping at something else that I wish to avoid and I what we would say reify that substantiate that turn that into a reality that's called grasping and clinging out of that arises a sense of becoming from moment to moment since time out of mind I have been doing that touching contact sensation reaction to sensation as clinging out of clinging a new self is born odd infinitum ad nauseum why and who is doing that and what is doing that where is the self in that he asks himself he says well I can see form I can see the reaction to form which is feelings sensations there's thought perception and out of that I build stories formations and there's consciousness of that whole affair but in all of that I cannot find what I call a self only a provisional self not a self that is autonomous and unchanging cannot be found the five skandhas which I'm sure all of you are familiar with the five heaps the five parts that make us up so what is reality he suddenly looks up oh there's a storm and I like this part in the third watch of the night there's a storm everything becomes cloudy everything is drenched in rain and so on and as we're sitting this week there's storms all week I loved it all these storms and then we clear up and the sun would come through the window just like our life clear clarity to darkness to clarity to darkness opening and closing opening and closing suddenly looks up and there's the morning star bingo the epiphany happens now what was that I like the morning star as a symbol the morning star the most beautiful of all of our planets Venus as it rises in the old world it was called the servant bringing the lamp to announce the coming day the coming enlightenment sees that star everything drops away everything drops away except just this just this just this who's doing it nobody knows nobody knows now we jump ahead a thousand years to zen to zen a lot of sutras grew up around all of this this stuff a lot of schools call the school of the madhyamika nargarjuna nargarjuna the philosopher of mahayana buddhism said there is not even an ontological basis anywhere in the universe that we can finally understand except provisionally and conventionally through language designation or concept designation and his famous philosophical dictum was this whatever arises is said to be empty by that he means empty of inherent existence whatever arises is said to be empty that meaning what I just said that being a conventional designation is itself the middle way so in buddhism there's two realities the conventional and the ultimate the ultimate reality is not something that we can talk about except conventionally conventionality depends on language as we're using here today which is dependently co-horrism it's a story we're telling each other's stories we're always telling each other's stories about this but the reality behind the story if I talk about that reality I have to use conventional language and conventional language can always be always refers to more language words refers to more words concepts to more concepts the dropping away of all the concepts the suchness of the emptiness of all things as this as this arising now so our practice as I understand it I think Shakyamuni is trying to tell us to understand it is that the world honored one buddha's birthday is now and is now and is now and is now and if I look for now I can't find it and if I look for buddha I can't find him so stop looking you can't find buddha you'll never find buddha by searching so stop worrying you can't lose buddha because we are already that that consciousness that awareness that presence that cannot be controverted that cannot be examined that cannot be found but is already perfectly the very self arising at this moment and passing away at this moment you and I have always been doing this I don't know what makes you think we won't always be doing this so fortunately we're getting on the bandwagon early and realizing this the next step with that of course is once we understand that we see that all craving is also dependent core risen we see that the whole world is nothing but dependent core risen and passing away there is no suffering except conventionally there is no buddha there is no dharma there is no sangha buddhism is about understanding that there is no such thing to reify as buddha tsuzuki roshi said when christians understand there is no christianity muslims understand there is no ala and buddhism understands there is no buddha that's buddhism so to the extent that we search and try to gain something a new identity a more subtle form of identity well serving that that is serving a secondary function we are that which is already identityless but we call it digon whoever we call it here we call it now we call it palo alto we have all these names for it and i think what zinn did was to bring the universality the principle of dependent core rising or emptiness together with form form is you know you know that whole thing form is emptiness and emptiness is form form is no other than emptiness emptiness is no other than form let's not get stuck on something called emptiness reify that and go around and say oh everything is empty you know i'm not i think i'm going to go home and take a nap when we actually realize this the way things actually are then you come down off the mountain and you don't spare yourself and working for that common good so the bodhisattva way i'm sure the way that that gil is teaching is that we work for one another and it's being natural that once we understand who we really are that we open our hearts to the world it's just natural you don't have to become compassionate you are already compassionate we realize who what or who we really are however i will say that you're also going to forget who you really are and so am i as soon as i get it from zazian and turn away from the wall and put my foot down and somebody steps on it and i come off the wall like an angry ape i'm back in this world clutching again but by practicing by having these practices to do gradually little by little i think we develop a kind of gap between our usual survival reactive tendencies the olympic system kicking in and just watching the arising of this whole model of confusion pain horror suffering of all indescribable suffering grief lamentation bliss any state of mind that we can think of so the next time somebody bumps into me instead of you know hitting back immediately there might be a moment to have some spaciousness a little breath to realize i'm bumping into myself forever bumping into myself the big self right and take a breath and bow you know that old story about the zen teachers sitting under a a bridge in kyoto back in the in the tokugawa era this is the 16th century sometime maybe 17th century he's really practicing his non-attachment in the samurai swaggers by and that everybody else bows he doesn't bow and the warrior comes up and looks at him and he said you know i have the power to take your head off no he said you know that you're looking at somebody who has the power to remove your head and the monk says you know you're looking at somebody who has the power to let you do that and the way he said it of course if if you're if you're saying it from any other place but from where he was coming from which was total release then you probably would have lost your head but according to the apocryphal story at least the warrior was so impressed that he asked to become his disciple or that story of hakoween being presented with a young mother and her irate parents child born out of wedlock she said he's the father of the old hakoween of all people who's the priest he said he's the father he's the daddy is that so in hakoween said oh i'll sew this guy is that so it takes the child it's a nice story anyway until the time comes when the young mother tells her parents and others it wasn't really him they go get the child and they say well we're sorry you know we made the big mistake he says oh is that so just is that so there's this um monk who in one of the koans comes to his teacher i want to get the words exactly right because i kind of forgot i wrote it down before i came here in fact but i knew i'd forget so he says to his teacher the body of color perishes what is the fixed body of the dharma he's talking from the universal perspective no probably a monk who's really experienced emptiness the non-clinging nature he's done a lot of sitting this is the body of color perishes what is the fixed body of the dharma and the old teacher says the mountain flowers the mountain flowers bloom like broke the mountain flowers bloom like brocade the river between the hills is blue as indigo so what is it what is emptiness the mountain flowers blooming like brocade the river flowing like indigo between the trees what is emptiness the rain on the roof a sausage for lunch whoops brown rice that's the story i tell myself today here with you and i tell it here with you because you're sitting there and i'm in the position to be the talker the spokesman about something that's going on collectively among all of us and i'm going to tell you something about the talker that's the spokesman about something that's going on collectively among all of us next time it might be you sitting here i'm sitting out there we tell a different story don't take this story seriously as soon as you hear the story let it go it's just the story somebody told us that when the when the wall when the wall came down in Berlin that wall came down and what was it the 80s when it finally came down or 90 anyway when when it finally came down everybody was dancing and celebrating in the streets and somebody had made this sign in neon it was the picture Karl Marx blinking on and off and under the in English said sorry chaps it was just an idea this too that i've just told is an idea it has no substance that you can hang on to thank god otherwise you might go to war or something for it to protect it to protect our identity and our ideas our practice is to let it go to appreciate it and then goodbye and we cry we feel our sorrow and our pain becoming a bodhisattva doesn't mean that you become hardened through the world it means your heart becomes softer and softer the tears come more and more often you become more and more sensitive the wretchedness of life digs deeper and deeper into our hearts our frustration becomes greater and greater as we feel helpless before and then we sit down inside and open our hearts if if if this practice that we all do together does not soften our hearts in some way then it's not the buddha dharma it's just more jazz as i used to say back in the 50s well i've shut off my mouth now for longer than i needed to we can have maybe five minutes or so discussion if you want if there's anything more to be said anyway it's buddha's birthday and when you wake up tomorrow morning it's groundhog day it's buddha's birthday and there's a sufi saying i like it you come into the world and there's a sufi saying i like it you come into the world sufi saying you come into the world crying and everyone else is smiling oh he said i want to come in the world crying and everybody else smiling i want to go to the world smiling everyone else crying i like that finally i have to one more poem one more poem wallace stevens has a poem if i can remember it now it's called the snowman you know that one goes like this one must have a mind of winter one must have a mind of winter to regard the bowels of the pine trees crusted with snow and have been cold a long time to behold the junipers shagged with ice and the something trees stark in the distant glitter of the january sun and not and not to think of any misery in the sound of the wind in the sound of the few leaves which is the same sound blowing in the same land for the traveler who standing who nothing himself for the traveler in the snow who nothing himself beholds nothing that is not there and nothing that is for the traveler who in the snow beholds the beholds nothing that is not there and nothing that is something like that so we have to have the mind of winter and not be you know hear any misery in the sound of the wind thank you
