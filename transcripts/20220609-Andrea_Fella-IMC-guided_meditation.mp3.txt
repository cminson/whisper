 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Arriving with yourself in a really simple way. Sitting and knowing that you're sitting. In this space that you're in. In this place, in this time. We can only be aware and present right here and now. And so this gathering. Gathering of the attention, remembering ourselves, helps us to be here and now. So aware of the body. Maybe aware of the breath in the body. Not a forcing or a focusing of the attention, but a being with, perhaps. Being with yourself, being with the body, being with the breath. We actually have to do a lot less work than we think we do to be present, to be here and available, to be with our experience. The capacity that we have to be aware knows how to do that already. So maybe you can relax and let that possibility of being aware do the awareness. Do the being aware. And explore just what it means to be with yourself while that's happening. Maybe aware of body sensations. Perhaps aware of sounds. Maybe aware of the breathing. Maybe aware of the state of your mind, how it is in the moment. Maybe there's tiredness or some mood there present. Can you just allow yourself to be with that too? We might think of our mindfulness practice as exploring what is actually here in this moment. These body sensations and hearing the sounds, emotions, moods, thoughts coming through. And also being aware, in a little bit of a broader way, of how we are in relationship to what's here. Maybe we're comfortable or uncomfortable. Maybe we like something or we don't like it. Maybe we have ideas or opinions about what should be here or what shouldn't be here. Maybe we can simply know that that too is part of our human experience and be aware that that's a part of what's happening too. This body sensation, and I like it or I don't like it. This mood or emotion, and I'm comfortable or uncomfortable. This practice is very inclusive. Whatever is here, it's like our mindfulness can widen to include that too. And then just know that, be aware of that also. And we're not aware of these relationships to our experience. They tend to shape or tumble on forward these relationships. They add to our experience. They stir in extra stuff. It's not simply meeting experience as it is when we're not aware of how we are with what's here. And the practice can still be really simple. Just aware here, inviting yourself to be present with yourself. For some of you, it may feel simpler to connect with a particular aspect of the experience, such as the breath. For others of you, it may feel simpler to not choose any particular experience, but just receive the next thing that's obvious. Just simply aware of what's here. And perhaps from time to time, being curious about is there something else here being added to the mix? Is there something else that you can't include or an emotion, an opinion, a review, a liking or a not liking? A version or wanting to hold on to something beyond liking and not liking? Something like that happening. Can you allow this possibility of awareness, a wearing that to? Awareness, being aware of that too. Just receiving. Meeting the experience of being human. Thank you.
