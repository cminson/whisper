The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So a few things before we start here.
One is that I want to celebrate with you and appreciate you this now,
this second year anniversary for doing these YouTube broadcasts.
And it's been wonderful to feel part of this extended wide global community
of people interested in this practice and practicing meditating together.
And it's been a real delight for me to have this opportunity, this privilege
to be able to teach this way and to have an audience.
So thank you for all of this.
And it's been a while since we had a community meeting.
And I thought maybe on Friday we could do that.
I didn't actually check, but I think Friday I'm free for this purpose.
And this and that.
Yeah, Friday should work.
So Friday I thought maybe I'll post a Zoom link.
And those of you who'd like we can meet and maybe part of a celebration for two years
and also just check in with each other. It's been a while.
The fundraising drive we're doing for the Ukraine for the refugees there
has now as of yesterday was raised $62,000.
It's a lot of money.
And thank you for those of you who contributed.
And partly because of our treasure who processes this won't be able to do it until Sunday as a way.
We decided to just keep the donation page open.
It would be until Monday. This cost Monday.
But we'll keep it open through Sunday when he returns.
And then we'll tally up the amount and send it to save the children.
So thank you for this.
And I hope that our small contribution will make a difference in the world.
So the topic is now the third of the five hindrances.
And in English it's often called sloth and torpor.
And I suspect that a good percentage of you don't use those words.
It's not in your kind of active vocabulary, especially the word sloth.
Maybe it is, maybe especially if you've been around this insight scene for a while.
And maybe you've picked it up.
And it's not so clear this is the best words for what the Pali is, the original Buddhist idea.
Where sloth and torpor came as translations of these terms, I don't know.
But it's been around for a long time.
So it might have been 18th century English translators who chose a word that maybe had particular meaning for them.
The word for sloth, the Pali word literally means rigid or stiff.
And a mind that becomes stiff or rigid or not soft and pliable.
And the word for torpor, that maybe works, but I like the word sluggish.
The tradition says that the second one has more to do with physical, the body, and the first one more with the mind.
So the mind becomes rigid, the mind becomes stiff, or there's a sluggishness in the body.
But exactly where this stiffness and sluggishness is, whether it's mind or body or both, it doesn't really matter.
In practice, we're just paying attention to how it is.
And this is a movement of the mind when the energy level, energy is not alive and engaged in a nice, healthy, flowing way.
And so it's often associated with a sinking mind, a sinking of energy, sinking of vitality in the mind.
The next hindrance, the fourth, is the arousal, over arousing of the mind.
So what we're noticing here is the energy level, the activity, the engagement level of the mind.
And there can be, either it can sink or it can be over aroused.
And there's many reasons for that in life.
In following desire and aversion, the first two hindrances,
if we're able successfully to kind of not be caught in the grip of greed and hatred and ill will,
then some people's minds don't have the usual entertainment, don't have the usual fire that kept it going.
Sometimes people are exhausted from too much wanting, too much anxiety, too much aversion.
They're angry all the time.
And when we finally stop the greed or the fear or the anxiety or the anger, sometimes we crash.
Sometimes the energy level drops down.
And some of it has to do with just kind of finally getting to rest.
But some of it has to do with confusion, a little bit, maybe a depression,
a little bit not knowing where to put the mind, what to do, and a little bit lost.
And there's no good cause to be engaged in and want to have or want to make go away.
And the person's never discovered, maybe, the natural vitality of awareness of attention
because the vitality of attention was always being fueled by greed and aversion or sometimes by fear.
And so there's a huge adjustment that can happen when those caffeine of the soul, I call them,
are not operating and we go through withdrawals a little bit.
Sometimes the sinking mind, the mind gets rigid or closed tight or we get sluggish in some way or other,
is a response or a reaction to our circumstances.
We might feel overwhelmed.
We might have too much stimuli, too much emotional difficulties.
And it's just so hard for our heart, our mind to manage.
And we believe we can't manage.
We have ideas that should be different and we feel discouraged and we feel maybe that a lot of self-pity
or a lot of self-doubt because I should have done better.
I made a mistake or something.
And so there's all these different attitudes come into play around the difficulty of our lives.
And sometimes our lives are extremely difficult.
They don't want to diminish or pretend it's not difficult.
But one of the ways the mind responds to that is to get rigid, is to get numb, is to get closed down.
Another way that we can get sluggish, sometimes sluggish is resistance to what we don't want to do.
Sometimes it's just a sense of being deeply, deeply wearied and tired.
And so we kind of give up a little bit.
And so this is part of one of the ways in which the mind responds to difficulties and challenges.
And it can be dramatic and very big.
It can be very subtle.
As meditation gets clear, more and more clear, as meditation practice gets stronger,
we can get sensitive to the more subtle shifts in this direction of stiffness or rigidity of mind and sluggishness.
And it can be very subtle.
It can be just a little feeling that it's just too much to stay with a full in-breath.
I did that before, and so the mind kind of doesn't want to do it anymore.
There's a kind of little bit of resistance, and so something shuts down.
Or it starts feeling that meditation has become a duty.
We've done it for a long time.
In the sense of duty, one more time I have to do it, and something inside gets rigid or tight or closed.
Or we've had meditations and there have been three days of difficult meditations,
and something inside feels so discouraged that the energy level drops away
and there's a sluggishness and unwillingness of the mind to operate.
And so the hindrances can all be considered normal human mental activities.
We're born with hindrances. They come with human life.
And it's not a personal failing to have them, but it is a personal field of mindfulness.
It's a personal place to discover what's happening with us, to become wise about what's happening with us.
And so one of the tasks of mindfulness is to start becoming sensitive to the movements of energy.
And for this third hindrance, how energy sinks, the sinking mind, or energy gets frozen or tight,
or the mind gets rigid, the heart gets rigid, and then become wise with it, practice with it wisely.
And one of the ways to be wise about it is to make this 180-degree turn to really feel and sense this more.
Really kind of care for oneself by feeling well what this is, rather than being discouraged by discouragement,
rather than being overwhelmed by our overwhelm or how we're shutting down and how we're not practicing just right or something.
Care for ourselves by turning the attention just, oh, this is how it is now, and feel it and be with it.
And it's invaluable to feel and be with an experience, and partly because that's one of the things we're trying to develop in this practice
is the ability to have clarity of seeing, clear knowing, clear feeling of what actually is.
So we're developing it with the things that are difficult.
We might also discover that some of the attitudes underlying this third hindrance, attitudes of shoulds, or it's too much,
or it's been too long, or it's been, you know, I can't manage, I'm supposed to be better.
So there's all these attitudes that kind of can be draining for us to live by.
And so we see those attitudes, and to see them as attitudes can be quite powerful.
When the time comes, when the meditation is very clear and peaceful and settled,
then it might be very subtle the movements of the third hindrance, but we can see it arise, see it be born.
And because we're familiar with it from all that kind of practicing with it for a long time,
then we see it just come arise, the first inklings of it, the hints of it,
and then it might be possible to let go of it, to abandon it.
And this is really a good thing to do when the abandoning of it feels like it moves us to greater health,
moves us to a greater clarity and a good way of being.
And so in this practice of the hindrances, we want to be able to see clearly,
and then if it's easy enough to let go, and then appreciate the absence
and the healthfulness of the absence of this rigid mind or the sluggishness that might arise.
So the hindrances. And so tomorrow we'll do restlessness, over-energize the hindrance and so forth.
We'll do doubt on Friday, and then doubt the day afterwards.
We'll do a community meeting on Zoom.
I look forward to meeting those of you who come to that.
So thank you all very much.
