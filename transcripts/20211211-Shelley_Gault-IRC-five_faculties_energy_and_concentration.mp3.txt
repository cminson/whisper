So, Ines spoke really beautifully yesterday about confidence and wisdom, and today I'll
be talking about another pair of these faculties, about effort or energy and samadhi, what we
usually translate as concentration, composure, unification of mind.
And I'm sure that we can all see that each one of these five faculties, confidence, energy,
mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, that each one of them is really useful to cultivate
on its own in our practice.
And there's also, there's a logic to cultivating them in sequence as well.
The first phase, their confidence that it helps us in cultivating energy, when we trust
that something is worth doing, that's when we're willing to put effort into it.
And then next, we need to make effort in order to be mindful, in order to keep our attention
steady on what's arising in our experience.
And then, as steady mindfulness develops, it helps in cultivating concentration, samadhi,
this unification and composure of mind.
And the steadiness and stability of samadhi, that helps us to see clearly so wisdom can
arise in a mind that's like that, that's steady and composed.
So it makes sense to cultivate these in sequence, each one is really valuable within itself
and then they build upon each other, one conditions the arising of the next.
And we can also talk about them in terms of the balance between them.
Inez talked yesterday about the balance of confidence or faith and wisdom, discernment,
too much confidence and we can get off track, we can put our trust in something that isn't
really going to be helpful to us.
And sometimes when discernment on the other hand is overbalanced, we can focus too much
on intellectual understanding and become proud of what we know, kind of rigid in our views,
and then ignore developing our practice and our hearts.
And we talk about the need for balance really often in our dharma practice, our meditation
practice.
There's a balance of alertness and ease that we always encourage in the sitting practice
and a balance of mental alertness and receptivity in the way we pay attention in our meditation
as well.
There are many areas in the dharma where this kind of energetic balance is useful, it's
essential even, and this list of the five faculties is one of those.
So this afternoon I'll talk about balancing of yirya, the word in Pali that we translate
as energy, as effort, sometimes as diligence, I'll talk about balancing that with concentration
or composure of mind, samadhi in Pali.
And both of these are really essential in our practice.
Keeping them in balance is a skill that I think we keep working with this skill for
as long as we're practicing.
We just keep making adjustments, sometimes big adjustments, sometimes minor adjustments.
Like when we find ourselves slumping in our sitting practice, we can gently sit up straighter,
but without getting rigid, without getting tight.
And when we start to get sleepy in practice, you know, we can bring in energy, maybe opening
our eyes or standing up, when our minds are busy and agitated, we have more tools.
We have tools to bring calm, to bring more stability.
And I'll be talking about some of these tools in this talk.
And as we continue to practice regularly, we develop more sensitivity through our mindfulness
to when there's an imbalance, and we can use our tools to strengthen or ease up on one
or the other.
But before talking about how to balance these faculties, excuse me, it's good to be really
familiar with them individually.
So energy, effort, virya, I like that word, virya, it has strength in it.
It's as important in our dharma practice as it is in our daily life.
It's the quality that keeps us going, even when things seem to be going nowhere, which
sometimes happens.
Stick-to-itiveness, I think, that's an English expression that kind of captures it well,
I think.
And this word, virya, it's also related to courage, points to courage.
And sometimes we need to make courageous effort in our practice.
You know how in Buddhism, in the Buddhist texts, there are so many lists.
There are three of this, and four of these, and six of those.
And I used to wonder, what's with all the lists, you know?
But now I just, I actually love them, it kind of, they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.
And when you begin to see the ways that they fit together, you know, it all makes sense.
It's really, it's so beautiful.
That's really beautiful.
And the Buddha described seven of these many, many lists as essential to awakening.
And the five spiritual faculties is one of those, seven.
And this particular quality, this virya, energy, effort, diligence, it appears not just in
this list of the faculties, but in six of the seven lists that the Buddha said were
essential to coming to awakening.
Well, that's not too many numbers, I'm really impressed by that.
I think anyone who's practiced meditation for any length of time can see the value of
this capacity that we have to keep going, to not give up.
Something that we're familiar with right from the very first time we practice is this need
to bring our attention back to our meditation object, to the breath or whatever it is that
we're attending to, to bring it back again and again and again.
And each time takes a little bit of virya, a little bit of effort, of energy.
Ajahn Chah, the well-known Thai teacher of the last century, teacher of many of our teachers
and he has quoted a little poem of his the other night that's on a handout for you to
read.
Ajahn Chah said once that he estimated that 70% of our practice of mindfulness consists
of just this coming back, coming back again and again.
And that's the way that we develop continuity of mindfulness in our practice.
By making the effort to come back again and again.
We train the mind to stay, to stay by using effort.
Sometimes we use the analogy of training a puppy, I like that one.
The mind is often compared to a monkey, but it's also I think like a puppy.
It scampers around, it kind of follows its nose, sometimes it gets into trouble.
And so we keep training it to stay, to stay, and in the same way we do that with our mind.
We stick to it, we don't give up, we try to stay.
Shin Zen Yang, he's a well-known Dharma teacher, probably many of you know him, know his name.
He once commented that a good meditation sometimes means that we just manage to stay on the cushion
until the bell rang.
Sometimes it's just that effort, that's all we've got.
And I've had sits like that, I know, what got me through them, you know, what got me
through them, it's that sense of okay, I'm going to stay here, I'm going to vary that
effort, energy.
There are two important mental factors in our practice that are ways that we make effort.
The Pali words for them are vitaka and vichara, I'm sure some of you have heard these words
many times before.
A simple way of defining vitaka is to call it connecting and vichara sustaining.
So in breath meditation, for example, we connect our attention with the beginning of
the in-breath and then we sustain that attention through its whole length, then we connect
our attention with the beginning of the out-breath and then we sustain it through the entire
out-breath.
We're making effort to connect and sustain our attention over and over.
When you're paddling a canoe, you know, you put the canoe in the water, you connect with
the water and then you make a long stroke to propel it forward, sustaining the effort.
You do it again and again and that's what we do in our practice.
If you've been on retreat before, you know, we're always talking about continuity of mindfulness
developing continuity of mindfulness.
We make the effort to stay connected to our experience, both during the formal periods
and also during all the other times.
Taking an informal walk, you know, when we're cooking and when we're eating, even when we're
taking a shower, whatever we're doing, it's all included and all of that takes effort.
And this connecting and sustaining is really, it's very integral to that effort.
It's really helpful and energy builds as we repeatedly make effort.
Energy builds within us.
It's like it kind of recharges our batteries to make effort.
And then as our practice deepens, we need less and less effort in order to stay connected.
Sometimes staying connected becomes completely effortless.
And that's a sign that the other faculty that I'll talk about, Samadhi, the concentration
is getting strong, our practice, it begins to develop a momentum of its own and connecting
and sustaining that we're just not needed anymore.
Mindfulness is present and it's kind of, it's driving the boat.
The effort that we make to stay present, it develops into this kind of effortless energy
fueling our mindfulness.
Sometimes it feels kind of magical when that happens.
I can feel it energetically in my practice when suddenly there's like a shift and I don't
need to do anything, but I can still feel there's an energy in the practice that's keeping
me connected.
It's a really wonderful feeling.
It's like finding the current in a canoe that's going downstream.
Once we're in the current, we can let go of the paddling and the current will carry us.
We might need to stick the paddle in just like a rudder just to steer a little bit left
or a little bit right, but we don't need to actually paddle anymore.
And we need to develop a sense of how much effort is needed under different conditions.
Ends are always changing and different amounts of effort are always needed.
And speaking about this, the Buddha used a metaphor that probably you've heard before
many times.
It's a very famous story about tuning the strings of a lute.
No, if we want to make music, the strings need to be not too tight and not too loose.
They need to be in tune and developing the sense of when our effort is in tune.
Like the strings of a musical instrument, it's really important in practice.
And sometimes we have to re-tune, you know, we turn those pegs a little bit.
For me, sometimes it's kind of like a dance because it's not always obvious how much
effort is needed.
We have to kind of experiment a little bit.
We get out of tune in one way or the other, perhaps getting kind of tight and constricted
in the mind or in the body.
That's really a sign that there's tension in the mind.
We can sometimes give ourselves a headache when we make too much effort.
And that's pretty clear when there's a headache from practice that we're probably making too
much effort.
Sometimes we go in the other direction and there's loosening the strings into vagueness
and sleepiness, fogginess.
And as time goes on in our practice, we just develop more sensitivity.
We're able to catch ourselves more quickly when we get out of balance.
We're able to re-tune our energy more easily.
And we all need to make the initial effort to connect and to stay connected.
We have to paddle that canoe to get started.
But in addition to the initial effort that we all make to connect and sustain, there
are conditions that show up sometimes, or maybe they show up really often, they show
up for sure, that can let us know that we need to up the energy level to start paddling
that canoe again for a little while.
If the mind is distracted, agitated, if it doesn't want to settle like a puppy, then
we need to make more effort to stay.
That might seem kind of obvious, but it can be tempting to just get frustrated and want
to give up, think, oh, it's just not, you know, this isn't working.
I'm just going to go do something else.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
We have tools to help us regain a steady focus.
We can count our breaths.
Excuse me, and as I mentioned, breath counting the other day.
I can't remember always yesterday or today, actually, time gets kind of telescoped.
I have a mind that it takes time to settle in meditation quite often.
And counting my breath is kind of a, it's my go-to in practice when my mind just wants
to go chase its tail or something.
So the way I do it is to very quietly, very quietly in the mind count from one to 11, not
to 10, one to 11, counting on each out breath.
And then I count backwards, back down to one.
And the reason I do it in both directions is that it helps my mind to keep from the counting
from becoming rote, you know, how it can become just a rote activity.
But when I go back and forth like this, up and down, it keeps me more connected to the
actual experience of breathing.
So we can use counting.
We can also use mental noting again, very quietly in the mind, just whispering in, out
breath with each in breath and out breath or rising and falling with the expansion and
contraction of the chest and belly and counting and noting, they both help connect and sustain
the attention on the sensations of breathing.
And every time we consciously do this, it's like a paddle stroke in that canoe.
It just provides a little bit more momentum.
It steadies our attention, steadies our attention.
And relaxing the body is also a way of relaxing the mind when it's tense.
It often has, you know, there's a connection between the body and the mind and relaxing
the body can definitely give some ease to the mental tension as well.
And then the same tools that we use when we're distracted and tense can also be helpful if
the mind is lethargic if it's sleepy.
So counting and noting both of those, the effort that they take can actually bring more
energy into the body and the mind.
Sometimes we get bored with our mindfulness of breathing and our attention can get kind
of vague.
It isn't clear.
And when that happens, we can cultivate interest in the breath, interest in whatever object
that we're attending to, becoming curious about the sensations that arise, becoming
curious about what's going on, because energy follows interest.
We become interested in something, energy just naturally follows along.
We can stand up, standing meditation is completely legitimate, it's a lovely form of meditation.
We can open our eyes, we can breathe in a way that brings energy, accentuating the in-breath.
We can do walking practice instead of sitting.
We have these tools, you know, to help us keep balanced, we just need to remember to
use them.
Sometimes that's the hard part, remembering to use them.
And as our effort to connect and sustain strengthens our mindfulness and continuity
begins to develop, then we start to recognize the signs of this other faculty that I want
to talk about, concentration, samadhi.
We can see it beginning to develop in the mind.
So what is this samadhi, you know, what is it?
We usually translate it as concentration, that's the kind of typical translation you'll
hear in the inside tradition.
But in English, when we use that word concentration, what we're often, what we're pointing to
is a state of mind that's narrowly focused and sometimes kind of tight, you know, it's
not relaxed.
And samadhi can be like that, but I think it's much more beneficial when there's ease
and tranquility present, there's this balance, alert and relaxed, you know, that we often
point to.
If we really strain, boring into the breath with our attention, trying to build samadhi,
often what we end up building is a headache.
It's what's much more useful is a composure that collects the attention around the object
of meditation in a really useful and often delightful way.
Samadhi is experienced as a very satisfying kind of composure or unification in both the
body and the mind.
And in the Buddhist sutras, metaphors describing really satisfying physical experience are
very often used to describe samadhi.
There can be a sense of being suffused with the light, there's an image of a cool underwater
spring that is continually filling a lake, continually filling it.
And you know, just the sense of that.
And then another image used in the text is the way it feels to finally have a long drink
of water after you've been walking in the desert for a long time.
That sense of contentment, of satisfaction, being filled with something wholesome and
healing that comes through in those metaphors.
And I believe a version of this kind of composure of mind is something that we're familiar
with in daily life activities as well.
I think we've all experienced our awareness coming together in that kind of a focused,
unified and often pleasant way, maybe reading a novel or watching a film and getting really
absorbed in the story and the characters to the extent that maybe we don't hear when
someone calls our name or if the phone rings or something.
Or in sports, you know, so many athletes talk about being in this kind of stage, you know,
in many different athletic endeavors, running, swimming, skiing, even paddling a canoe,
I think.
We talk sometimes about being in the zone and, you know, I think that's a kind of description
of this kind of composure of mind.
As we get into a rhythm with the exercise and we get absorbed in the sensations of the
bodily movements and the rhythm of the breathing, this kind of composure can arise and it's
like an effortless unification of mind and body in the activity and it's so satisfying,
you know, we've experienced it, you know.
I sometimes make glass tile mosaics, love to do it, and when I begin to work, there's
always a lot of effort, a lot of mindfulness that I have to bring to the initial stages
of the process.
Sometimes I follow a pattern, sometimes I have a design in mind, but usually my mosaics
are, they're pretty free form and I approach them kind of intuitively.
But still, at first, I have to make effort, like looking for the right pieces, you know,
of glass tile, pieces that seem to fit in a way that just is pleasing to the eye and
I consciously choose colors for their effect to be compatible, you know, or to be surprising,
maybe even shocking, and all kinds of choices like that I make consciously in the beginning
are part of the process, shapes, colors, sizes, where to cut, where to go next.
And so there are all these considerations to keep track of, to make decisions about,
to be mindful of, and then at some point, things just, they just shift and the effort
let's go, and it feels as if I stop making decisions and the mosaic, it just starts making
itself, it's like, so there's a, it's being in the flow, you know, it's being in the zone,
there's my hands, my eyes, and my mind are all kind of working in concert.
And it becomes really easy and the design sort of starts to make itself, my mind feels
quite still, it's really absorbed, and outside sounds don't improve, just like when, when
there's really deep absorption in a book or a film or something, it's really delightful.
And I think it's really similar to how Samadhi feels as it's developing.
First we make this effort needed to stay with our object, we connect and sustain our attention.
And then after a time, our attention begins to stay with the object of our meditation
and we no longer need to make that effort, the connecting and sustaining, they drop away
and we're carried by the current of the stream of our practice.
There's a kind of energy that develops and then the meditation seems to do itself, just
in the same way that I have that sense about my mosaic making.
Samadhi brings strength and clarity of focus to the mind, as it strengthens the hindrances,
sure most of you are familiar with the hindrances, the five hindrances, sensual desire, ill-will,
sleepiness and torpor, restlessness and doubt, these five really common obstructive energies
that distract the mind and keep us from seeing clearly.
Those five are held at bay, they don't affect us, just that in itself is really a delight.
And then as Samadhi gets stronger still, the attention becomes rapt, it becomes absorbed,
captivated by what we're attending to.
And a mind like this is described in the suttas as malleable and wieldy, it has a softness
and a flexibility, it's also, it's a good tool, it's wieldy, it can be used.
And then a beautiful equanimity can begin to arise.
The descriptions of a mind in this state call it imperturbable, it can't be disturbed, it's
a state of mind in which deep insight, wisdom that is, can arise.
And as I spoke beautifully last night about liberating wisdom, seeing the truth of impermanence
that everything is moving, nothing is static, there's nothing to hold on to here, including
our selves that we make up.
And seeing how when we try to hold on, demanding that things stay still, there's dukkha, there's
suffering.
And this is the wisdom that allows us to let go of clinging.
If nothing lasts, why bother to cling?
Good question to keep asking ourselves, I think.
So as we practice mindfulness, connecting and sustaining our attention on the object
of our meditation, continuity of mindfulness develops.
And then continuity is the fuel for the development of samadhi.
One sutta describes the inner play of these three together as similar to a great bird,
like an eagle that's taking flight.
First the eagle must make a lot of effort, really flapping its wings in order to lift
itself off the ground because they have heavy bodies compared to other birds.
And then it has to continue to beat its wings, to lift itself up off the earth, to get up
into the sky.
And then there's an ease that comes with soaring, with the wings steady, the body stable and
composed.
And there are ways to help this development along.
If you're practicing breath meditation, just tuning into any pleasure that you feel in
the sensations of the breath can help the samadhi to build, can help the satisfaction
to build that it is really conducive to the development of samadhi.
Inviting any hints of calm or serenity that are present in your meditation, inviting them
to expand, to grow, to be known really clearly, remembering to relax tensions, to find ease
if you can in the body.
And also there's a putting a little bit of a smile in your face, just a little hint
of a smile, it has an effect on the mind.
As composure of mind develops, less effort is needed.
And then remember, there is balance that needs to be kept.
So as samadhi strengthens, as a concentration builds, if mindfulness is weak, then samadhi
can kind of morph into a kind of a dreamy vague sort of pleasant state, what we sometimes
call sinking mind.
Sinking mind.
It's calming for the mind to be relatively still instead of jumping from one subject
to another.
So I think maybe the mind thinks, well, we're not doing anything here, might as well just
zone out.
And zoning out is not the same thing as being in the zone.
It's different, it can be very pleasant, but it's not a path to wisdom, it's not a path
to freedom.
It might even end up falling asleep or just stuck kind of in boredom and dullness.
So many of our minds are just, you're used to having a lot of things to chew on, just
so used to that, that when there's, when calm arises, they think, oh, it's just time to
take a nap now, just to stop, stop being attentive.
So when we notice this kind of dullness or dreaminess in our, in our practice, we can
bring more effort, more energy into the practice, maybe counting breaths or noting, same as
we did for balancing the energy factor, maybe just strongly focusing on the connecting and
sustaining aspect of attending to the breath, increasing our interest, waking ourselves
up.
That's one side of the balance when there's a kind of loss of energy, a kind of too much,
too much calm, more calm that is needed.
And on the other side is finding our mental focus tight and constricted, you know, with
a sense of straining the practice, kind of pouncing on the sensations of each breath,
drilling our attentions and like drilling it into whatever's arising.
And that's a sign that we're applying too much effort.
It's, and so we can just back off.
We can relax a little bit, might take a couple of long, slow, deep, easy breaths when we
notice that that's happening, we can let the awareness be more receptive, you know, instead
of kind of honing in on the breath, looking from the control tower as Gil often says,
we can sort of lean back mentally and just allow the sensations to come to us in the
same way we might kind of lie back on the grass in a park and see the clouds overhead
and just allow the shapes of them to come to us.
If we've been counting breaths or we've been noting and we notice that the focus is a little
bit tight and there's a sense of straining, we can let go of those practices and take
a more global view maybe of the breath, just perhaps noticing how it's felt in the whole
body.
We can reconnect with our posture and releasing any tension that we feel anywhere where it's
easy to release that tension, the shoulders, the chest, the belly, forehead and jaw, often
those are places where there's tension, and then just release any area in your body where
you know mental tension, mental effort is leading to tension.
We learn really slowly I think but surely as we practice to steer our practice sometimes
towards effort and sometimes towards calming to make these like simple kind of course corrections
when we veer into overstraining or we veer into dullness.
We learn when to flap our wings and when soaring is actually possible, when to paddle and when
to float, we learn to keep our mindfulness really bright and awake and at the same time
relaxed and at ease, bright and awake and relaxed and at ease, it's a big part of our
practice learning to balance these energies and when we are in balance practice can flow
really, really well.
Mindfulness is then able to keep the other factors balanced so each one is doing its
part in the practice helping us move toward a wise mind and a kind heart toward letting
go of habits that lead away from those that lead us into, into dukkha, into stress.
So I'll go back to the image of a cart, you know there's that cart with four wheels, confidence,
energy, samadhi and wisdom and then there's the driver mindfulness and we learn to work
skillfully with each one of those four wheels before we attach them to the axles of the
cart and then when we feel like we have a good grasp of how they work, how they work
within us, then we put our mindfulness in the driver's seat and that mindfulness then
can keep the cart well balanced, it can keep it moving forward steadily, you know maybe
correcting when it swerves a bit this way, it swerves a bit that way, but in the direction
onward toward freedom toward the end of clinging, it's a beautiful process and that's what
we're engaged in.
So let's just sit for a moment and just let the words kind of settle away.
Thank you.
So thank you very much for your attention.
