The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Well my clock
says it's just 8 30 or maybe 8 31. We have maybe a couple more people still
coming in. Let's just wait another 30 seconds or so and then we'll get started.
Okay, well good. Perhaps things are stabilizing now and people coming in and
if a few more join us that's great. So it's nice to see everyone again today.
This is the second session on the Kalama Sutta and we're going to be moving on
to some of the specific topics today. So let me just start by welcoming everyone
back and if it happens that anyone is joining for the first time today, welcome
also in particular. You'll see how it goes along. As we mentioned before, we'll
be offering the teachings for the first hour, the interactive teachings, and then
in case anyone needs to move on, we'll have a guided meditation from 9 30 to 10
at a specific time. But it will tie in with the teaching so of course we
encourage you to stay for that. It is part of the class. So just as a reminder
when we first met on Saturday, we got kind of an overview of what the Sutta is
about and its focus on our very intimate question of what is trustworthy and how
can we bring ourselves to this path and know for ourselves how to walk it and
how to slowly grow in wisdom along the way. So I think with that and then we
also of course talked about the how to read suttas in general. Diana gave a very
nice overview of some of the parts of suttas and how we can relate to them and
the use of repetition also called pericope, these cut and paste sections
that appear throughout the suttas and how they play a role also in this
particular Sutta. So then I will pass it on to Diana to delve into the first of
our specific topics on what is actually reliable.
Great, thank you Kim. Yeah, so just to recap, we know the Kalamas, they go to the
Buddha and they say, who should we trust or who's telling the truth? All these
different teachers come through town giving their own teachings, disparaging
others. We've heard a good report of you quote-unquote and this is one of these
pericopes, this good report is all throughout the suttas, we see this. So
how about you Mr. Gotama, what do you think that we should trust or put our
trust in or who's telling the truth? And I'll start by saying for me, I think it's
interesting that what the Buddha doesn't do, right? He doesn't start immediately
giving his own teachings like, oh, you know, I know it's best here, you know,
listen to this. He doesn't disparage any other teachers, he doesn't say, well, you
know, don't listen to them, they're, don't know what they're talking about and in
a completely different setting with a different set of teachers, those of you
who know this, it's Digenakaya too, the Samanyapala Sutta. There's, the Buddha
does the same type of thing where he hears what other teachers have said, but
he does not disparage them. He's not saying, oh, these other people, they don't
know what they're talking about. So both here in the Kalamas Sutta and then in
completely different setting, he does that same thing where he doesn't disparage
others and he doesn't disparage the Kalamas for asking the question. He
doesn't, you know, kind of look at them like, really, are you asking me this?
Instead, he normalizes their experience, he, in my view, teaches them, treats them
with respect, saying essentially, of course, you're perplexed. I think
Ambika Bodhi's translation, it's translated as, it is fitting for you to be
perplexed. So, of course, so he starts by this, by kind of like creating the
conditions in order for some teachings and then he interacts with them as
opposed to just jumping right into giving a lecture or, here, I know what's best,
clearly I know better than you. Oops, sorry, this is my phone. And instead, he
encourages the Kalamas to get engaged, to test out the teachings that they've
heard, instead of just passively sitting back and listening to what other people
have told and trying to determine, well, which teaching should I believe? Instead,
he's essentially saying, what I kind of like to say is he's saying, roll up your
sleeves and engage with the teachings or with what you've heard. So he starts by
saying, when you know for yourselves, this encouragement for the Kalamas to take
responsibility and to not passively just receive, but to trust some of their own
wisdom. And then when he says, when you know for yourselves, these things are
unwholesome. And some of you may know this word unwholesome is a kusala. This
word, a kusala, we see this all throughout the Buddhist teachings can be
translated as unwholesome, unskillful. I've seen it as unhealthy. I've also seen
it as unhelpful. So just this generic word, a kusala, which means that things
that aren't supportive of where you want to go. So when you know for
yourselves, these things are unwholesome, lame worthy, that is, others would not
approve of this, censored by the wise, we could say, maybe criticized by others.
And if accepted and undertaken lead to harm and suffering, then you should
abandon them. So in this, in this teaching here, the Buddha again is moving away
from adopting beliefs and towards notice the consequences of actions or, and I'll
use this word actions to mean that this, this phrase starts out when you know for
yourself, these things. So the in Pali, the word is Dhamma, the same word that we
use for doctrine for the teachings, but sometimes this word Dhamma means things.
So we can insert there when these views, these actions, these beliefs, these point
of view or, you know, like attitudes. So that's something for, in my view, the Buddha
is using kind of this generic word here as just an encouragement for us to test
all kinds of things, everything with, is it, are they unwholesome, blame worthy,
censored by the wise, and if accepted and undertaken lead to harm and suffering,
then you should abandon them. And then of course, the opposite is true too, that if
they don't lead to all these, then you should adopt them as opposed to abandon
them. So something else that the Buddha does is, so he gives them this teaching
when you know for yourselves that the consequences are deleterious or harmful,
not going where you want them to go. But he continues to build on what the
columnists already know. What do you think? When greed arises in a person, is it
for their welfare or for their harm? So he wants to start with something that
they can all agree on. And so this assumes that people will agree, that greed
and hatred and delusion leads to unhelpful states and leads to harm and
leads to suffering. And in my mind, part of the reason why he starts there is, if
they had said, well, we're not sure, then maybe he would have gone down different
teachings. But if they said, yes, okay, we know this, that greed arises, it's not
for a person's welfare, it's not for their benefit, it's not for their harm. But
then again, he points to something really tangible, measurable, literal, physical,
that can be measured, pointing away from just listening to what somebody has
told you and things that you can actually see. A friend of mine used to talk
about this, he said that he was mostly interested into those things he could
fight, which for me is kind of a funny thing, but he was just pointing to, you
know, tangible physical things. So a greedy person destroys life, takes what is
not given, transgresses with another's partner's spouse, and speaks falsehood,
and encourages others to do likewise. So not only that one behaves in a way that
leads to harm and suffering, but encouraging other people to do this also.
So the consequences of having a mind of greed or of hatred or of delusion is
put into the context of, it leads to harm, not only for oneself, but here it's
really pointing to harming others, that ethics, right? Ethics is really about our
relationship with others and the way that we interact with others, and pointing
to that this undermines our communities. If you're taking what is not given from
others, or transgressing with another's partner, or killing others, of course. So
for some of you who are familiar with the Buddhist teachings, well recognize that
there's four of the five precepts here. The last one to not become intoxicated
is not here. I'll just say a little bit about this, that before this is not
uncommon, that there are many places in the suttas where there's only the four
rather than all five, and scholars and ethicists come up with all kinds of
reasons for this, and some of them might be that the inclusion of the last one
about alcohol, or you know, abstention from intoxication and alcohol, might be a
later addition. So this might be, you know, these are things that we
might ever really know, but that might be the later that became a problem and
something that needed to be included into the Buddhist teachings, and so it got
added on, but it didn't get added on everywhere. But another reason is that
these first four of the five precepts to not destroy life, to not take what is
not given, to not transgress with another's spouse, and to not speak falsehood,
really point to the community, really point to harm that one is doing to
others. Becoming intoxicated may or may not cause harm to others, but these other
four do without question cause harm to others. So a real emphasis on taking
care of the community, so lead to harm and suffering, not only for oneself, but
for the, for others. So in this way, so that Buddha, when he's asked about which
teacher should we believe, or who's telling the truth, or who should we trust,
which we place our trust in, he's pointing it to things that are more
tangible that you can see and experience, and specifically to look at
consequences. What are the consequences of some of your thoughts? What are the
consequences of following beliefs? What are the consequences of your actions? So
something a little more tangible. So with that, I was just talking about this
little bit in the, well maybe it's not so little, it takes up quite a lot of space
in the Kalama Sutta. And maybe I'll end with this, that it could be, we might
interpret this as the Buddha in his skill, as a teacher doing a little bit of an
Aikido move, that is where he gets asked one thing, who should we believe? And he
does a little bit of a move and saying, well look at your behavior as a way to
see this is what's important, and this helped make this increased ethical
sensitivity might be the way forward for you, as opposed to saying exactly here's
who you should believe. So now I'll turn it over to Ying. Thank you Diana. So with
that piece of teaching, what we'll do right now is to get you together into
breakout rooms. And in your small group, we'll discuss a little bit of what this
is for you. And so we'll have two prompts, basically two questions. And the
first one is to maybe recall or remember an experience or example at a time
where the specific actions, whether it's in the list of precepts, ethics that
Diana mentioned, or maybe in the general ethical arena. When a specific
action have helped you learn what might be skillful and are skillful, what might
or the translation that Diana mentioned a wholesome or unwholesome. And so think
of an example, a real life example, a real life experience, that could be yours,
could be something you observed. And so that's the first question. And then
alongside of that, in the teaching that the Buddha mentioned, knowing this for
yourself. And so also contemplate what is your relationship with this mode of
learning, which is a really based on your own experience, knowing it for
yourself. And so those two questions are kind of related. But I would maybe
suggest we start with the first one, which is think of an example, and then
think about how does it help you learn using your own experience. And so David
has gotten us all into the small groups. And when you get into the small group, I
would maybe recommend you start based on the alphabetical order of your zoom name.
And the first one start and then the rest, you know, doesn't have to be
following that order. But it kind of would be nice to have someone start, start
the circle. Okay. Thank you.
But while it went for you, any questions, insights, and are just something that you
share, shared within the group. And you can use that raise hand button again.
That's under participants. If you hover over your own name, you see more. And then
if you're on iPad and phone, you can do the dot, dot, dot on yourself. Then you
find the raise hand button. See if anyone would like to share a few words.
Okay, Jennifer, please. And just before sharing, we should either maybe pause the
recording or just let people know that the recording is continuing. So be careful
with what you share or who's controlling the recording, Diana, to record or not to
record. You're muted, Diana. Thank you. That, of course, our objective is to
upload the audio, not the video, not the video. So only the sound. And this is the
equivalent of passing the mic around if you were actually here at IMC. So I don't
know, maybe I'll let each speaker decide what they want to do. And then we'll hope
for the best that I can pause and pause. I mean, saying that I can, but whether I'll
return to whatever, this will work fine. So if people want to say, Jennifer, I said,
okay, if we record. Totally fine if you want to record. Thank you. Thank you for
asking. So, wow, I had a great group. What's wonderful about this is I have
feeling everyone's coming away saying, wow, that was the best group. I think one
of the things that I learned through this process is just the power of learning
that is grounded in experience. And just the deeply respectful framework for
learning, both that the Kalamasura is showing us, but also that you are
producing through this very model at the breakout rooms, right? If you were just
lecturing to us and we were all taking notes, that would be a different mode of
learning. So I'm really, I'm really appreciating that. Thank you.
Wonderful. I kind of lived experience right there. Great. So Chris, from San
Francisco. Thank you. I was hoping someone else would step forward. I can't stop
talking. So, you know, this environment, certainly, I just described me to the
group. It feels we're working or thinking or observing what's our process
reading this sutra and what we're thinking about, who our teachers are. I
mean, I've done all those issues of hearsay and
infrastructure reading, logic and teaching. I mean, I've done it all. And I've
learned from it all. It's been sort of, in a sense, my North Star. I kept just
leaning against teachers or learning from people. So it seems to move me in a
good place. I mean, I'm here in this class, so gotta be good. You know, it sort of
led me in this direction. I'm really, the Zoom, the Zoom teaching, I spent a lot of
time this weekend just going over the sutra. And then I actually listened to
Kim's recent class on, on Red View, Right Understanding, which was something I've
never really looked at. And that really plays into this column of sutra. What do
I believe? What do I think? How I'm gonna move forward? And this sutra I've read it
or heard a number of times that it's just coming forward in a really, really
strong way right now. And having this Zoom platform, I'm able to hear from others
people's point of views. And it's, it enlightens me. It lifts me up. It's very
intimate. It's that Mahayana idea of Indra's net. We're all kind of reflecting
each other. We're gems on this net. It's really coming forth in this process. So
thank you again for having this Zoom group. And I think I've drunk the Kool-Aid.
Nice. Thank you. And Jerry... I just want to say that because the fifth precept against
taking intoxicants isn't here. You're in good place. Okay, Jerry. That maybe the last question
we'll have for right now. Go ahead, Jerry. It's somewhat coincidental, once again, as
Adam, as I said last time is for me. But I thought I could send someone a note. When
I started with MBSR, we were told, don't believe anything that we're telling you.
It's only true if it's true for you. And I always was told that that's a Buddhist
type of belief. And I was wondering in what sutras I could find that, which is a
little, a little unawarness of me because it's actually in the sutra that we're
studying and I didn't realize it. I find it's, again, because of my own, I don't know,
issues. But that, and it happens to be true no matter what a teacher tells you,
it's only deeply true if it's been integrated and it's actually deeply true
for yourself. But I find that it's just extremely respectful and liberating that
nothing, I don't have to buy anything unless, unless there's evidence coming
from inside of me. I'm grateful for that. Thank you.
Nice. Thank you. So with that, David, back to you.
Yeah, we wanted to just, in another brief teaching section, talk a little bit about
wise speech and look at it from a couple different perspectives. The, the first one
is just to notice that the, the, the issue of wise speech creates sort of a
grand arc of, a grand narrative arc for this discourse. And something, as we go
through, we like to draw attention to in these, this series of courses is study
aspects of these materials, of these ancient texts. And last time Diana talked
about repeating passages, this copy and paste thing that happens,
pericapies, and their use. The importance of creating forms that were
memorizable, chantable, and that in the chanting of them, in the repeating of them,
in the memorizing, there was a re, rewiring of narrow circuitry that was
part of, part of practice. And similarly, these have these suitas, they have their
container, sorry, they have their contents, but they also frequently have a
narrative arc. And frequently there's great beauty in the narrative arc. And a
lot of times there's a lot of thrust of the fundamental teaching in that same
narrative arc. And for example here, the Kalamas are concerned about whether
teachers are speaking truthfully or untruthfully. But they're also, I think,
concerned or disturbed maybe by the fact that the teachers would appear to be
engaged in unwise speech. Not only do they, not only do they aggressively or
assertively propose their own views, their own opinions, but they denigrate
and dismiss the, the teachings of others. And they seem to do so in a way that's
divisive, which is one of the hallmarks of unwise speech. Things that are untruthful,
divisive, abusive, things that maybe are just not worth debating. And this seems
to be part of what has, has sort of confused the Kalamas. The Buddha, as Diana
pointed out, understands this. That they have a, they have good reason to be
confused. Not only because there's a question of truth, but also because the
speech is unwise. And the way it lands in there, the cognitive dissonance that
creates, is something worth paying attention to. So it's part of the grand
arc. The Buddha doesn't take the bait. He doesn't himself engage in the same sort
of unwise speech. The whole discourse is an exercise in wise speech. Not only how
the Buddha speaks to the Kalamas, but how he encourages them to speak to
themselves, to engage with their own experience, the sort of voices they take
to what comes up in their experience. All of this is part of a training in wise
speech. So, and then within the, within the kind of looking down from the grand
narrative into the, into the, into wise speech, wise speech turns up, as Diana
pointed out, in each of these repeated phrases. And in each case, it's a way to,
to interrogate in one's own experience the relationship between consequences and
the roots of action. And the Buddha, again, without engaging in unwise speech,
implicitly suggests that any speech that is unwise by definition must come from
greed, hatred, or delusion to give the defilements those rather brutal general
characterizations. But any speech that's unwise, of which they've had a taste from
these various ascetics that visit them, must come from these, these roots. This is
part of his teaching, and it can be understood in our own interrogation or
investigation of our, what urges us to speak, and the way we speak. Whenever we
speak in a way that's untruthful, that's divisive, that's abusive, or that's just
engaging in idle chatter, gossip, and debate that doesn't have any purpose to
be, to happen, we're engaging in unwise speech, and we can feel how that feels in
the heart. And instead of telling us that, or telling the Kalama's that, but, but us
many generations later, he actually leads us through a process. And this will
turn up, spoiler alert, in the homework for this week. We sort of take wise
speech as a, as a way to pay a little attention, as the Buddha sort of suggests
here, that we can do.
And I think, even though that brings us to a little bit ahead of time, I'll stop
there. I think that's a good place to stop, and it leaves a little time, in a
few minutes, to take some, to maybe take some additional questions, or have some
additional discussion. So let me pass it back to Diana. Great. Thank you, David.
Yes, it can be really helpful to look at, as David said, the narrative arc. So
there's the specifics of the Sutta, as well as kind of what's, what's the kind
of the container or the context that's being held. So now we'd like to open it
up to you guys again, to, we didn't, at the beginning today, talk about some of
the homework for last week, or I say last week, it was just Saturday, the question
of what do you hold to be authoritative? So here's an opportunity you might want to
comment on that. Or what was it like to read the Sutta again? And maybe some
questions about wise speech, or maybe some general questions about the Sutta. We'd
love to hear, like how, how, how this is landing for you, some of the questions
you have, maybe some aha moments, or something like this. And we'll do the, I
use this expression, the blue hand that we'll use, if you can raise your hand in,
in Zoom, because we can't all see the screen, so we can't necessarily see your
physical hand.
Yes, Laura. Oh, Diana, when I was reading over the Sutta again, it, Donald
me, as you pointed out this morning, that the column must, must be at the set,
certain level of practice, because practicing, you know, I didn't
broke any of the, and it wasn't until I, you know, the meditation, oh, and skillful,
you know, you read, you have to have the experiential, I mean, you really have to
clear your mind and settle it down before you realize something is unwholesome.
So it's kind of interesting that the Buddha just talking general about non
greed, and you know, the four precepts, but there's all these other example of
unwholesome and wholesome acts, and you know, anyways, I just want to point kind
of the Sutta in a sense, make it really general, but in practice, it's actually
very specific to the person. So I don't know whether you can comment on that or
not. Yes, thank you, Laura. You broke up a little bit there, but I think I
understand what you're talking about. For me, one thing that's noteworthy is
that the Buddha says, when you know that these things are blameworthy or
criticized by the wise, so it's not to rely entirely on yourself, but it's to
recognize that people that have wisdom, that have maybe some spiritual maturity,
also would not condone or promote that behavior. So for me, the way that I think
about this, is this something that you feel like you'd want to hide? Does this
feel like something you don't want to be in the newspapers, you don't want other
people to know, then that can be a clue. So yes, it is personal, but it's not
entirely personal. For me, there's a real emphasis on community here,
too. I appreciate what you said about that. He asks them, if a person has
greed, hatred, or delusion, does that lead to harm or suffering? So there is
already a certain amount of spiritual maturity or awareness, and for me, the
way I'm interpreting that is probably if they had no interest in the spiritual
life or doing the right thing, quote-unquote, they would not have gone
to talk to the Buddha. So maybe there's a selection bias. Those people that are in
the audience that are talking to the spiritual leader are the people that
care about spiritual things. If there were other people that didn't care, they
probably weren't there. So that's the way that I'm thinking about it. David. Just
also on Laura's point, which I think is a really good question, another way to
read some of the discourses is that what happens here, if you imagine this
actually happening, it takes time, and I'd like to think that it's possible that
this question and answer actually takes the form of guided meditation. So
it's not just telling them this. It's actually, as you suggest, Laura, each in
their own, with their individual temperament, their individual personal
history, their role in the community, they're each invited to go through this
exercise, dipping it into a meditative practice. It's not
separate from that. It's integrated with that. And in a way, it captures some of
the spirit of our endeavor here in this course, which is to integrate the study,
the theory, with the actual practice of meditation and what to do with what comes
up in meditation. Thank you. Thank you, David, to Ying or Kim. Do you have
something you'd like to add? Yeah, maybe I just to say that this process of a
knowing for ourselves is also a gradual process. You know, I think that the
Kalamas might know something about what the Buddha said, and so that allowed
him to have some trust to what the Buddha had to say. But then through
the practice and through working with, walking the path, that knowing becomes
more and more clear, and there may be different aspects of the practice that will
come along to shed light on what could be trusted. And Kim, I saw that you
unmuted yourself, but maybe... I don't have much to add. This is all good. Okay,
okay. So, Lori, shall I unmute you, or would you...? There you go. Thank you. Over
the last week, I was thinking that one of the reasons I was drawn so deeply and
strongly to the Dharma was that it articulated what I learned through my
own experience in the School of Hard Knots, more so than any other philosophy
or religion or psychology that I'd ever encountered. And the Kalamas Sutta, which
I connected with kind of early on specifically does this. It's a primary
example of teaching what I had learned about trustworthiness or whatever in the
School of Hard Knots. But I get concerned that sometimes I might interpret
suttas to support or justify my own ideas. And so what I've been thinking this
week of the value of this specific class is it shows me how to conduct an
investigation into not just the Sutta, but into my own mental processing of the
Sutta. It's showing me how to investigate, like the level of detail,
how helpful it is to not just read it once and kind of nod or shrug, but to
investigate it in great detail and read it more than once. And it's just
astounding, like if you read this Sutta four times in a week, you come up with
four messages that kind of layer and or interrelate. So this has always been
one of my favorite suttas and it had some big message for me. Now I think it
probably has a dozen important messages for me. So I appreciate this class and
I don't know, I don't like to use the word technique, but kind of the
approach that you're leading us through and how to engage with a Sutta. Thank
you, Laurie. You're pointing to something which makes me quite happy that
Yang, Kim, David and I, we talk about this a lot. Like, wow, every time you
revisit a Sutta, there's something new there. It's that seems like the richness,
the depth is incredible that each time we come there. And the four of us, we've
discovered that we learn from each other so much. Okay, I had this one idea, but
you know, somebody else has another idea. Like, oh, I hadn't thought of it that way.
So there's so much depth in that way, too, to share it with others. Yeah, so. Well,
that's another reason that classes like this are so valuable to all of us
participants. I, for one, live in a place where there are no teachers, there are no
classes, and without offerings like this, I would be completely on my own to
interpret the Dhamma in a way. It would read how I wanted it to read. So this is
wonderful. It's a real, it's a real gift to those of us who live out in
dispersed areas. And where do you live, Laurie? In Wisconsin. Oh, nice, nice. Yeah,
that's Wisconsin is far away from the Bay Area. I'm sorry. Yes, go, David. I just,
I love Laurie's contribution, and I just wanted to say something really
interesting in what you say that I think turns up in the Kalama Sutta. We live in
a world right now, I have to make reference to any number of current
events, which wouldn't make it even clearer in which things like implicit
bias and confirmation bias are really, you know, significant challenges
individually, culturally, socially, politically. And I do think that this
practice provides a way, particularly with guidance and community working
together, to address some of those, you know, some of the kind of hardwired
constraints that make our actions less than entirely skillful or that, you know,
end up in harm to ourselves and to others and to the community. So I think you
point to something really significant in this manner of doing this kind of study
and practice that draws, you know, deeply on what the Dharma, the power of the
Dharma's promise. Thank you, David. And maybe I'll say, if you're catching the
bug of Sutta study, maybe I'll invite Kim to say just a word or two. You're
teaching something about Sutta study right now, Kim. Do you want to say
something? Yeah, I have a workshop coming up on July 26th, which is a Sunday. I'm
calling it the Polly Cannon workshop for, and it's essentially just a, it's not
Sutta study so much, although we will read a couple of texts, but it provides
an overview of the Polly Cannon. You know, we talk about this thing, this is
where all these Suttas come from. What are the major books of the Polly Cannon?
Why were they organized in that way? How can we relate to the strange language in
the Suttas? I found that as people get into Sutta study, they start to maybe
have questions like this, and it's not so easy to get an overview like that. So
we'll be providing a link in the follow-up email if that is of interest.
Thank you. I see some thumbs up. That's nice. Great, great. Okay, so we'll be
going into a guided meditation, but before we go there, I wanted to say a
little bit about some homework, some encouragement of things to do. One is to
read the Sutta yet one more time. Maybe you'll discover some new
things, and maybe you might be interested to see if there are some other
translations, and you can see how that affects you. We might be able to put in
the email that comes out, or maybe we could put in the chat box. I haven't
discussed this with my co-teachers, where you might find alternative
translations that are freely available on the web. I think this Sutta, because
it's so well known, probably if you just googled it, would show up a number of
different places. Yes. I just said it was in the last email. Oh, thank you.
Where you can find the different translations. Oh, great. Thank you, Ying. I
guess I didn't read that clearly, or I forgot. Thank you, Ying. And then here's
some practice, some practice to consider. So what if you spend the rest of the
today and all day tomorrow intentionally using speech to create
social harmony, to create concord, to create people coming together, to help
people feel like they belong, to help create a sense of community, to use your
speech in a way that is of benefit to not only yourself, but to other people. So
this means to refrain from saying anything that might be divisive, or
harsh, or untrue, but also to specifically say things that are helpful
and supportive, and create community. Of course being authentic, of course not
saying things that aren't true, but just to incline the mind to what could be
said here that helps bring people together. It could be as simple as
saying, oh, that was a great idea. Thank you. Let people know that you
heard them, and that they kind of want to participate and communicate, or maybe
it's listening really attentively, helps create some community, but also how can we
use our speech as a way to create harmony and concord. So if you'd, I think now we'll
go into a guided meditation, and I'll hand it over to Kim. Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
