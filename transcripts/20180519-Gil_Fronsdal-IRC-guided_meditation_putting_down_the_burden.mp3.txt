We have two parts, two sides of mindfulness practice. 
There's the aspect of awareness. 
To be aware in different ways we can be aware is always a phenomena of the present moment. 
Awareness, living awareness only lives, only exists here. 
And the other aspect of mindfulness practice is clear comprehension. 
And that can be very simple. 
It can be to clearly understand, clearly know or recognize that unequivocally, with no doubt, you are here, here and now. 
There may be thoughts and ideas about other times and other places. 
And we can know that that's happening and know that it's happening now and here. 
And sometimes this is enough to be aware and to know that we're here, with this, that whatever is happening is here. 
And now, and here, there's always more than whatever you're thinking about. 
Beyond the edges of your thoughts, beyond the edges of your body, there's the stillness of this room. 
There's the silence. 
Your thoughts are surrounded by stillness, spaciousness, just as beyond the edges of your body. 
There is a spaciousness, space. 
And perhaps you can feel that there's no sharp boundary or line between the edges of your body and the space beyond it. 
The silence, just beyond it, and perhaps the stillness. 
And within your body, there'll be sensations and movements. 
But between the sensations, between the movements of the body, there's space. 
There's stillness. 
There's certain kind of silence. 
Sometimes the space in the body, the spaciousness, can seem vast. 
As it has no sharp limits. 
And within the vastness of space, vastness of awareness, there are particular sensations and experiences. 
The sensations of breathing. 
Feelings. 
And thoughts. 
Sometimes it's possible to recognize that there's space or silence between the thoughts. 
Rather than being interested in the content of your thoughts, to be aware of thoughts arising within the space, stillness. 
And if there is some sense of stillness or spaciousness within, not instead of feelings and thoughts, but around all things, within all things, next to things. 
Perhaps there can also be feeling or sense, intimation of a peace. 
Simple peace. 
That's here. 
That's around any agitation there might be. 
Or between the agitations or deep inside. 
Peace that involves having no conflict with what is here. 
And as you bring into more caring focus your breathing, you might see if in breathing you can relax the muscles that come into play as you breathe. 
Maybe at the end of the exhale. 
Or maybe at the end of the inhale. 
Or releasing of any tension that might be present in the body as you breathe. 
Perhaps relaxing or softening whatever tension there might be in the control tower. 
That brings an extra effort or strain in being with the breathing. 
Allowing breathing to breathe itself. 
Perhaps as if breathing is a gentle wind blowing through the vastness, stillness. 
And sitting here now. 
To allow yourself to be here without conflict at peace. 
What do you have to put down? What would be good to let go of? What aspects of the past can be put down? What concerns of the future can be put to rest temporarily? What fears, resentments and guilt, could be gently put down for now? Is there any idea of self, or oneself as the doer, or the self as the recipient that you can drop in favor of letting go into here? Just this. 
If there is something you recognize that would be good to put down. 
But there is no readiness yet to do so. 
Perhaps you can intuit or see just beyond the edges of what you are holding on to. 
The possibility of a wider world of peace, spaciousness. 
Some sense of what it would be like on the other side of holding on. 
And perhaps you can touch into some trust that it is okay to let go. 
Some wisdom and confidence in putting down the burdens to let go into here and now. 
Into a simplicity of being, here. 
Into a simplicity of being, here. 
Into a simplicity of being, here.

Into a simplicity of being, here. 
Into a simplicity of being, here. 
Into a simplicity of being, here. 
Into a simplicity of being, here. 
Maybe aware of here and now through your body. 
Perhaps you can feel the invitation to let go. 
The invitation to put down the burden. 
The invitation to put down the burden. 
The invitation to put down the burden. 
The invitation to put down the burden. 
The invitation. 
The invitation.

Whatever you're concerned with now. 
Free it up. 
Free it up. 
Free it up. 
Free it up. 
Free it up. 
Free it up. 
Free it up. 
Free it up. 
So two aspects of this practice. 
To allow to make room for your capacity to be aware. 
To be attentive here and now. 
Awareness itself is always a present moment phenomena. 
And allow it to be here over and over again. 
And then whatever is happening here. 
To clearly comprehend its phenomena that's here and now. 
And perhaps from time to time. 
You can always also clearly comprehend or clearly intuit. 
That there is peace available. 
When we put down the burden. 
When we set free. 
The concerns we have. 
Letting them go. 
I hope you enjoy this day. 
And that you stay close to the place of awareness. 
Thank you.
