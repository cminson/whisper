Dharmette: How We Lose Peace  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Earlier this morning , I mentioned the practice of noticing 
peace  – noticing some tranquility , ease , or stillness that 
might be in our  experience . There are times when this 
sense of peace, tranquility, or relaxation is stronger ; and 
there are times when it’s weaker. R egardless of how 
present it is , it can create  an interesting opportunity . It 
can hi ghlight the loss of peace; i t can highlight what  is 
not peaceful, not tranquil , not still , or not relaxed . Part of 
the function of be ing relaxed or at ease  is how that 
helps us see how we’re not . It seem s a little paradoxical 
perhaps, but these thi ngs can exist side by side. I f you 
hold your body still , you might see how much agitation 
there is in your body; but if you’re really busy , active and 
moving , you might be moving faster t han your agitation , 
and may not know that you’re agitated . Some people 
don’t know they’re tense until the y finally stop and relax  
– they’re so busy in doing . But in stopping and being  a 
bit more relaxed , then they can notice what wasn’t 
notice d. Yet both were there at the same time.   
 
This j uxtaposition , or this contrast of being at ease and 
not at ease, being relaxed and not relaxed, be ing peaceful and not peaceful , gives us an opportun ity to 
notice and study w hat hap pens to us. What is going on 
that makes us agitated, tense , or lose our peace? One 
thing  I’d like to suggest today , which  may interest  you, is 
that we often lose our peace by defining ourselves  – by 
our experience, by ideas, by our relationship s to other 
people , etc. The idea of defining ourselves , and having 
an image or concepts by which we then categorize 
ourselves , limits us quite a bit . More often than not,  we 
limit ourselves dramatically in this way . 
 
Sometimes it is hard to see in oneself. It’s easier to see 
in others , or it’s easier to see when people do it to you . 
Maybe some of you have been in a situation where 
someone clearly was seeing y ou through a very limited 
lens. M aybe o nce in your life you were angry , and you 
happened to be angry around another person. Then  
every time that person sees you , they see you as an 
angry person. You want to say, “ Wait a minute. Hey. 
That w as once. That was ten years ago.” B ut they still 
don’t want to see you another way .  
 
Or sometimes people a re seen as who they are by  their 
occupation,  and people rela te to them through that filter 
only. O r sometimes it’s thro ugh your relationsh ip with a 
spouse. Y ou’re seen as the person’s spouse , as 
opposed to being a person in your own right . But, “Wait 
a minute. I’m here. I’m not just a spouse. I’m someone  
else here to o. I’m a person.” O r people are seen for their ethnicity or social class . In America we don’t have 
social class , right? So we don’t see it . But there  are 
definitely  classes here . And i t can be very limiting to be 
seen that way .  
 
Sometimes you see people treat you a certain way. I f 
people know that you’re a meditator , they might have 
expectations that define you. “ Oh, you’re su pposed to 
be calm all the time.”  I t’s quite burdensome to have 
people around you expect ing you to be calm. “ You know 
you’re supposed to be the calm  person. What’s wrong 
with you?” It wouldn’t o ccur to them that there was 
something wrong with  someone else because  of being 
agitated. That person is  just agitated , but you’re not . 
You’re being defined that way. Sometimes you can feel 
it. You can feel how limiting it is to be defined by other 
people.  
 
And then there are times when we define other people . 
We limit them. Sometimes it may be necessary or close 
to necessary. I f a police officer pulls you over , you 
should operat e by the definition that this is  a police 
officer, not a parent , or a child of someone else , or a 
little league coach. It’s not the time to relate in  any way 
other than  that this is the police officer . That’s the 
expectation .  
 
Other times you may actually limit someone else 
because you see him or her  in a particular w ay, or you define or charac terize the person in some way and hold 
them to it . Sometimes  we hold people by our 
resentment , and we see them only in that way. O r we 
hold them only by what they can do for us , and so we 
look at them  based on what they can do fo r us. Or we 
limit people for what they can’t do to us . We limit people 
by being afraid of them , and we see them through the 
filter of our fear . That’s a narrowing of who they are.  
 
An interesting teaching , which I got from my first Zen 
teacher , was about my father.  I had some difficulties 
with my father when I was in my early twenties . When I 
went to talk to him about my f ather , he said, “Your f ather 
remembers before you were born , and he remembers 
after you left hom e. He isn’t defined by being a fa ther. 
He is more than a father . He was a person before you 
were born, and now that you’ve left home , he’s living his 
own life. H e does all  kinds of things in his life . But you’re 
seeing him only throug h the filter of being your f ather . 
He’s more than that.” It was really interesting for me to 
hear that , and it caused me to look at my f ather in a new 
way, realizing  that I’d really only seen him through  that 
one filter. My expectations of him , of what he should 
and shouldn’t do , were for a father, but he is  more than 
that. So t hat was helpful for me.  
 
What’s harder t o see is how we define  and limit 
ourselves  through our definitions . The s elf-definitions 
we have are so obviously part of who we are . It’s true , right? Y our definitions are obviously true . Becau se 
they’re so obviously true , they’re invisible , and we just 
accept them as this is how it is . One function of  
medi tation practice is to help us  see how we define 
ourselves , and then to see when and how the se self -
definitions are limiting . But the practice of meditation 
can also show us that there’s another possibility  – that 
who we are is greater than our definition . Maybe we 
don’t have to define ourselves at all . Or, if we do define 
ourselves , maybe we can do so  in a bigger way.   
 
Peopl e define themselves in all kinds of ways . One 
classic way is by saying, “I can’t.” For example, “I can’t 
speak in public.” In some ways that can be  a self -
fulfilling prophecy . Is it  true that you’re the kind of 
person who can’t speak in public? Maybe it’s only true 
because you’re telling yourself that story . Maybe you 
can.  
 
Another one way  we limit ourselves , oddly enough , is by 
having needs . “I need. I need to have this happen.” I 
think  that most of the time when people say, “ I need ,” I 
don’t know how much people really need . Often the 
needs are another way of limiting oneself, defining 
oneself within a limited range of what’s possible.   
 
People define them selves by judging themselves, by 
being right or wrong . Or people define themselves by 
what they’r e willing to share  about themselves  with others – by what’s acceptable to show and not to show. 
For example, i t’s not okay to sh ow that I’m having a 
hard time. S o if people ask, “How are you?”  Then we’ll 
help them out so that they can have the right defini tion 
of us, and we say, “I’m fine , thank you .”  
 
Sometimes we’re trying to manipulate people so that 
they c an see us in a particular way, the way we want 
them to see us. W e’re trying to create a definition, a 
representation of ourselves that other people will live by . 
I think it’s usually pretty unsuccessful; most people see 
beyond how we want to represent ourselves.  
 
All these movements of s elf-definition are self -limiting , 
and often involve clinging onto something . This is one  of 
the important way s we lose our peace, our ease, and 
our relaxation . Usually living in definition comes along 
with agitation, tension, resistance, tig htness.  
 
It’s possible to have definitions that we don’t live in . You 
can say in certain circumstances, “ I am [my occupation] 
– like I’m a Buddh ist teacher.” I can define myself . I 
think most of you  may want m e to define myself a little. I 
think it’s a  bit of an expectation that Gil’s supposed to 
think that he’s a Buddhist teac her so he can sit up here 
and try to teach . In a certain role or circumstance , the 
definition  works okay . But I don’t limit myself by that . I 
don’t think  that being a Buddhist teacher is what defines 
my identity, who I really am . I’m quite happy to let it go and do something else , or be something else . But it’s 
useful , so I take it on at times.  
 
It isn’t th at having definitions is wrong. I t’s about the 
agitation, the loss of our peace when we cling to the 
definitions , when we get caught . And so a really 
interesting area to explor e when you are suffering, or 
when you feel agitation or fear, is to ask yourself, “ In 
what way is this suffering connected to a limiting way in 
which I’m defining or identifying myself? A limiting way 
in which I’ m telli ng myself a story about who I am , or 
who I’m not?”  
 
What’s the relationship betwe en your suffering and your 
self-definition?
