 Let me just first of all say thank you all for coming tonight to listen to me. Share with you some of my experiences around meditation and healing. I'd like to apologize first to let you know that I do need to read my notes because I do have a history of an anoxic brain injury which has affected my short term memory so I'm not able to hold on to information very long including what I've just said. So sometimes that's a blessing and sometimes it's not. So anyway I will read my notes but I will try to do it with interest and reflection. So I encourage you to join me and open your hearts to hearing what I have to say. The other part of what I hope to share this evening with you is some artwork that I've developed as a way of expressing some of this journey I've been on in recovery with respect to the brain injury portion. I brought a collage which I'll show you later as well as some artwork using fiber art to give you a sense of the depth with which my practice has evolved and allowed me to if you will see these various realms and understandings very deep within my own body and psyche. So those will be expressions of that process which I hope to share with you later. So thank you for your attention. Now I get to wear my glasses. The title of my talk is Health Challenges Healing and Practice, Development of the Five Spiritual Faculties. I would like to relate to you how my meditation practice and cultivation and strengthening of the five spiritual faculties has developed over the years and why I found it so helpful when dealing with my complex health care concerns and needs. Begin by telling you a little more about myself. I'm 47 years old and I'm a retired family nurse practitioner. I began a formal insight, this is repeat I realize, a formal insight meditation practice in 1995 at the Friends Meeting House in Palo Alto with Gil Franzdale. I went on my first residential meditation treat about a year later and discovered that I had a natural talent for entering the jhanas, the deep meditative states of concentration and absorption spoken of by the Buddha. I vented several residential jhana retreats with Lee Brasington and cultivated the natural talent I was given. My jhana meditation practice has been a serious integral part of my life since that time and has paid a very important role in my life at this point as well. I'd like to share with you some personal medical information that will give you some background about myself. I was born with a fairly common genetic disorder of connective tissue called the Marfan Syndrome. It affects roughly one in every three to five thousand people throughout the world. There are roughly two hundred thousand people in the United States with Marfan Syndrome. It primarily affects the heart, the eyes and the skeletal system. Often times individuals with this disorder are at risk, high risk for aortic aneurysms and dissections at an early age. Both my sister and I were diagnosed with this disorder in 1962 when I was five years old. My father was the first in our family to have this disorder. He died in 1959 of an aortic aneurysm that dissected and ruptured. He was 21 years old, six feet tall and bore many of the skeletal features associated with the disorder such as long thin arms and legs, long skinny fingers and toes, chest deformity, scoliosis and nearsightedness. I was 18 months old and my younger sister who was also affected was six weeks old when he died. As for me, I have had five open heart operations to replace my mitral and aortic valves with mechanical valves and I have also had ascending and descending thoracic aortic aneurysms repaired. I've also undergone spinal surgery for dural ectasia which was spinal cyst to be removed. Again part of the Marfan Syndrome problems. I've also had inglal hernias repaired. My sister who I mentioned earlier is also affected died at the age of 20 of a cardiac arrhythmia. In February of 2002 while I was on a meditation retreat in Cloud Mountain in Washington State, I experienced a cardiac arrest brought on by a cardiac arrhythmia. I was unconscious and received manual CPR for 20 to 25 minutes before being defibrillated twice by the EMTs. I was transported to the local hospital and spent three weeks in the ICU where I was placed on a respirator and contracted pneumonia twice. I lost 15 pounds while lying in a bed and breathing. The initial lack of oxygen to my brain induced a grand mal seizure during the time of the arrest and is responsible for the acute severe short term memory loss that I am left with today. Following the arrest, Andrea, my friend here, my husband Steve and my mother came to be with me in Washington. I don't have memory of that time other than what I've been told by my family and friends. Andrea told me that during the time I was in the hospital I appear to be in a state of pure love. It appeared as if all my filters were down. My short term memory was barely working. I had no idea of what was going on, really unable to track or follow anything. I had to be told several times about what happened to me and it didn't seem to bother me that I couldn't remember. It wasn't until three weeks later when I was on a plane ride home that I looked over my left shoulder and saw the clouds go by that I began to connect with this world again. I can still see my mother seated across from me, facing me with a lack of concern on her face. I began to take in what was going on, what had happened. The air flight attendant, that nurse that was with me, was monitoring all the equipment that I was hooked up to. I was transferred back home to Stanford Hospital by Life Flight Jet by the third week and spent another week in the Stanford's ICU where I had an AV node ablation to control my arrhythmia and a pacemaker defibrillator implanted. I now have mild to moderate congestive heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation and my defibrillator has activated several times and I'll just say that it is not a very pleasant feeling when that happens. During the Stanford Hospital stay, I underwent five months worth of weekly rehabilitation therapy which has helped me rejoin the world again and learn how to cook my meals, do my laundry, drive my car and take myself to the grocery store. I learned many skillful habits and rituals and routines to help me remind me of the things I need to do on a daily basis. The sense of who I am has softened, has shifted and yet I have become increasingly more acutely aware of everything even more than before. My brain continues to heal and to wake up if you will from the anoxic injury it experienced three years ago. It continues to show signs of becoming increasingly sensitive and awake. On April 1st of 2003 I had a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm repaired at Stanford. I experienced a grand mal seizure which was provoked by spinal meningitis during the immediate post-operative period. This was my second seizure, my first being the one when I had the cardiac arrest in February of 02. I had to take anticonvulsants for a year to prevent further seizure activity. And since then I've been feeling pretty fortunate. I am grateful as you can tell for very small adjustments in my life which is not having to take anti-arrhythmics again for a while hopefully. Anyway I'd like to talk more about the progression of my mind's healing ability and what I've done to support this process. Looking back I can see how the five faculties have been playing an integral part in the healing process. How my mind sense of self is actually coming back together, it's reforming itself. And my heart I think as a result of all this has been inclined more than ever towards liberation. In my search to better understand my experience I came across the writings of P.H.M. at Water in a book titled The New Children, The Near Death Experiences. This is my impression of what she wrote. She suspects that Abraham Lincoln had two near death experiences during a drowning accident as a five year old boy and possibly again when he was kicked in the head by a horse at age 10. And I'd like to read this quote to you from her book. Among the characteristics suggestive of a brain shift or a spirit shift that Lincoln came to exhibit, one was loss of fear of death, a love of music and solitude, unusual sensitivity to sound and light and food, sensing in multiples, wildly prolific psychic abilities, preference for mysticism over religion, absorption tendencies or merging, dissociation or detachment, susceptibility to depression and moodiness, increased allergies, regular future episodes, future memory episodes, hauntingly accurate visions, the ability to abstract and concentrate intensely, cluster thinking, charisma, moral upliftment, a brilliant mind, perseverance in the face of problems and obstacles and a driving passion about his life's destiny. Certainly the argument can be made that Lincoln's many idiosyncrasies were the result of his extreme poverty as a youth coupled by a relentless determination to succeed. That nothing during his early years indicated genius, none of his unusual talents appeared until after he had survived two close brushes with death. As an adult he nearly died again and once more displayed signs that he might have yet had another near death episode with additional after effects. And I woke up this morning with the thought that the Buddha might have had a near death experience prior to his awakening that sort of came to me and that's why I chose to bring it into my talk today. And I remember he put himself through some pretty extreme aesthetic practices which he could have very near brought him very close to death and the miracle of the bowl that swam upstream that confirmed his faith and allowed him to turn himself around and discover the middle way. So I reflected on this morning and then after accepting the porridge from the woman who approached him and receiving enough strength to go on he found the Bodhi tree and you all know the rest of the story. Rediscovering the story of the Buddha and reflecting on this possibility makes me love and respect the Buddha within me even more. My heart is encouraged and uplifted yet again by his example even if it is only what I think it is. Okay following the arrest everything came in full force sights, sounds, smells, textures, tastes and thoughts. Any combinations of these could easily overwhelm me. My mind would become unsteady, rickety and prone to running away. I would literally check out from my experience because everything taken in together felt so overwhelming. All my filters were damaged or destroyed. The arrest left me with several interesting developments. It has altered my sense of time, internal vision, sight, color, perception, sounds, smells and tastes. It is as if someone removed a filter that kept me from experiencing the true depth and beauty of everyday things. There is an appreciation for a gradual growing sense of steadiness in my mind's daily experiences. Looking back I have a sense that the arrest had the effect of crashing my hard drive literally and that the powerful and deeper places of my mind, my desire to be free of suffering was what rebooted my brain. It is my deepest heartfelt desire to be free from suffering and that is what survived. That is what has rebooted me. The overall effect having blown fired my hard drive was that of removing or damaging the existing filters, habits and routines, concepts and views my mind had constructed around myself and my world over the years. My mind has set about gradually reconstructing new filters. The Buddhist teachings have given me some wonderful material to rebuild with. By choosing the training I am rewarded and feel very grateful for the numerous small miracles that comprise and surprise each of my days. The Buddhist teachings continue to shape, refocus, develop my mind and heal my body. Joseph Goldstein wrote, In Seeking the Heart of Wisdom, in his teaching the Buddhist book of five spiritual faculties, qualities that bring power and balance to our mind and form an essential part in the path to freedom. Meditation is a process by which we develop these qualities so they become strong and enduring forces touching every aspect of our lives. I have a daily sitting practice and attend weekly group sittings and hear Dharma talks. It was very hard to meditate the first year following the arrest. My mind felt very slow, had little interest in anything. I could sit down and bliss out by myself or get lost in my salad when I ate my lunch. I relied on grace and faith during this time of healing. I had the inner sense that everything was just as it should be, that nothing was missing. There was no urge to do anything more than pay attention to as much as I could hold onto and let go of the self-critical thoughts and feelings when they arose. Later as I began to work with the therapist and do the daily exercises they required of me, I learned to apply effort and faith together. I had to believe that what they were asking me to work on would eventually help my brain to recover. Math problems were hardest and are still difficult for me at times. Back then, I seemed to be able to absorb into the problem but not find much desire or satisfaction in doing anything about it or with it. My mind felt lazy. It took my calling up effort, the second faculty, to get myself to apply myself and persevere, to concentrate and perform what was asked of me. I share all this information about myself with you to hopefully give you an idea of the severity of the situation I found myself in and the challenges that I've had to face with my mind and body. It has been a three-year process and I have a sense of coming back together. I can see how the daily practices have impacted and generated the healing I've experienced. I've come to look upon awareness faculty as a fine tool that can be strengthened and reinforced with practice. All my senses have become heightened. My ability to hone in and bear down and absorb into anything I practice my attention on has been getting stronger. It's as if I can intentionally include or exclude any or all parts or pieces of my experience at will. I've had to learn to do this in order to cope with a tremendous amount of information flooding my senses. This is an example of developing the faculty of concentration and wisdom. Mindfulness, apart from being a basic faculty in its own right, has the important function of watching over the even development of the four, in particular confidence, which is faith, in relation to wisdom, which is reason and of energy in relation to concentration or inner calm. Mindfulness is one of the five spiritual faculties and the others are faith, wisdom, energy and concentration. Each of these two pairs of faculties should be well balanced for achieving full potency. That is, there should be neither excess and one-sided development nor neglect and under development in either of these faculties. It is mindfulness that watches over them and acts in a harmonizing factor. The five faculties work together to give me the strength of mind to think, to sense, to feel and explore and ultimately release these old habits, old ways of being that have become very strong from years of repeated conditioning. I no longer have a desire to hold on to them as they appear, mainly because I can see them in my mind's eye and recognize them that they are not me. Later as my mind started to work, as my mind began to look for these references, you know, as in who I was before all this happened, old habits of reacting to stress in situations were things I had learned what I used to do would sometimes work and sometimes not, brought me more aware of the mind's tendency towards reactivity. I'm learning to investigate and then to consciously let go and not follow through on some of those impulsive ideas or actions that used to be part of the way I thought about things. So that's another place where the chain is broken. At one point during my first, the first year of recovery, I wanted to get on a plane by myself and go back east to attend an NMF conference when it would not have really been an advisable plan. My family or my physician thought it wasn't a good idea either. But at the time my mind was not able to see the situation clearly, but I'm grateful to my family, supported me by helping me to see the situation more clearly. And I'm happy to report that my perceived self-advocacy was not demolished totally and that my wisdom faculty has gained in strength and ability since that time. My emotions were also affected. I was much more emotionally sensitive back then than I am now. I feel that the balancing presence of the five faculties has a lot to do with this aspect of my experience. In a more negative way of seeing my experience is to recognize that there are holes in my awareness preventing me from consciously tracking and keeping up with and accounting for everything I feel compelled to follow from previous conditioning. My brain, my mind does not think work, register information as fast as it used to on one level. And those are the holes I'm referring to. It doesn't feel the, it, referring to my own mind, doesn't feel the urge to compete anymore. But on another nonverbal level, I have a heightened awareness that's capable of synthesizing an incredible amount of information now. Ask me about to add numbers together and I struggle. Give me a picture to ask and ask me something unique about it. And I'm usually able to conjure up a replica of it in my mind. And there is where I will go inside and examine it. My mind seems to be, have very strong absorption tendencies. The thoughts, images, feelings appear to me. They just register more slowly. I watch my body language when I'm around people. How do I stand when I'm speaking with someone? I look for unconscious memories that are stored in my body and in theirs. It's easy to get tripped up in my thinking when that happens, especially when the outside world is asking, expecting something of or from me. At times I feel a little out of step with everyone else. It's as if the holes represent the slowness, the inability to pick up and hold on to and selectively let go of the incessant conveyor belt of information that's coming in through the sense doors. Kodiak arrest I experienced three years ago left me with fewer heart and fewer brain cells than I had before the arrest. The ones remaining are damaged and not. And now they work to heal and regenerate themselves. Following the arrest, I didn't seem to care about or focus on anything long term. I pretty much lived in the present moment all the time. Thinking was hard work. Forced writing, collecting and connecting thoughts on paper was torture. Spontaneous, uninhibited, gibber jabber was effortless, inspirational and abundant. When those little brain cells got tickled. Fortunately the five faculties have strengthened enough to where I'm better able to manage these situations. Deep states of concentration are easy for me to find. I go in with very little attachment or expectation on what I will find or experience. On most occasions my mind drops like a stone. Maybe it's because it doesn't have that floatation device so many plentiful random thoughts used to provide. Okay. There are two different types of concentration. One that is heavy and dull and seems as if the mind folds in on itself in an oppressive way. This is not right concentration. Right concentration is balanced with right effort, wisdom and mindfulness. Right effort encompasses wisdom and mindfulness. To know what is wholesome, to make the effort, to not let the mind sink down into itself or let it go off running with the puppy mind I call it. Initially I did not have an awareness of what I could and could not do. I was not able to naturally perceive the consequences of my actions rationally. My interior governor was on the blink. This includes even my sense of meditation in what I was doing, exploring my own mind during that time. Thank goodness again the awareness of my limitations has improved and I am more skillful with how I do my meditative practices now. Things are brighter and more intense but I am slower. Interesting combination. There is a sense in my mind that is working very hard. It feels like it is a tired muscle sometimes. I am always trying to strengthen my memory and motor skills by using multi-sensory and imprint reinforcement techniques. I make diagrams of ideas or concepts, take notes, type passages from books, listen to recorded tapes, sing songs, make up jingles. I entertain myself by dancing around in my house, listening to music or reciting poetry, talking to my cats and reading Dharma books out loud to them. I work on various artistic projects that I have going. I knit scarves, crochet afghans. I challenge myself in any way that I can. When I do things around the house I bring my awareness to the question, what is this? What can I learn from this? And this is the one that Wisdom Faculty is arising. I pay attention to how and when and where the answers appear and this can be very loaded and rich with deep and profound insights into the nature of reality. I like to think of the five faculties as muscles that I recognize and develop within the mind every day. It helps to reflect and read on the subject every now and then. When it's time to get up in the morning I feel as if I'm coming up from a deep sleep. I rarely have memories of my dreams. I'm not certain what it is that signals me to begin servicing from this darkened place. I just know that it's time. I lay in my bed and intentionally call forth my memories of the day before. This is how I rediscover what I made for dinner the night before. When I move on to what I was working on or doing before I went to bed, is there something I need to follow up on today? Where did I go yesterday? Did I leave the house? Did I have an appointment with someone today? I reflect on my spiritual practice. Anything new to report to dwell on there? How is my heart beating? Does it feel regular, irregular, or irregular, irregular? How fast is it going? Am I aware of any pain or unusual symptoms in my chest? How is my breathing? Is there tightness or fullness or evenness in my breath? Am I wheezing? I'm reconnecting my body with my thoughts and felt sensations. I feel like I'm pulling on a warm old coat that I'm only vaguely familiar with. The distance I feel from myself sometimes is so profound and so hard to conjure up at times that I wonder if I will ever make it. Then it's like magic. The generator starts up, the light bulbs go on, and I fall back into some reasonably familiar flow of consciousness, thoughts and ideas, yet put together with paper clips, posted notes and frayed extension cords connecting everything back up together again. I have intentionally, consciously reconstructed my sense of self. All this takes tremendous effort. I call this my memory strengthening practice. I wake up without hunger or thirst. I feel happy and content for the most part. I go to the bathroom and weigh myself. This is important because worsening heart failure can present itself through unexplained weight gain. I brush my teeth, I go downstairs and prepare my breakfast. I do my reflections and practices around food and medication. I return to the bathroom and perform my morning bathing ritual, being careful to sense how my heart's doing. I'm always trying to be conscious of how much stress I'm loading on my heart, engaging how well the medications I take every day are holding me. My defibrillator pacemaker is there for backup if my heart runs into trouble. Knowledge wisdom mind knows, has experience of having had to deal with some of these concerns in the past, and so that comes forth to help me deal with something that may come up during that time. After the arrest, I pretty much ate what I wanted, just staying away from foods high in sodium. After the arrest, I lost my desire for food and drink. I now eat what I need. What I'm discovering are important things to include in my diet. Our bodies are in constant state of regeneration and repair. I don't know why I couldn't see this before. I think of eating as giving my body nutrients and other useful building blocks with which to support this work. It is so obvious now that I see it. I draw things to myself through prayer, reflection, intention reading, casual conversations, finding missing pieces to the puzzle of healing from brain injury, arrhythmia, heart failure, Morphin syndrome, and now menopause. That was hard too. I take various vitamin supplements, herbs, and oils. I've researched and found to be good supports for my heart, blood vessels, bones, brain, and menopause. I say grace over my food and medications every morning. I use creative energy, imagery. I imagine that I can see into the worlds of the cells. I imagine all the foods, nutrients, and processes absorbed by the cells. I imagine them as happy, healthy, friendly little cells that are smiling and naturally intelligent. We have a communication system. If they need anything more, they will let me know. They will make requests of me. For instance, I may have an urge to try something new or different that day around a food choice. I might modify a step or a procedure that in some way lets me get into that internal sense of satisfaction and ah, feeling that's it. I listen closely to my conversations with others around their health practices and what seems to be working for them and take notes so that I will have something to refer to later. I pay attention to my thoughts and sensations as they arise in my body. I use my body as an information gatherer and read it as a register. Then I ask, is this appropriate for me at this time? How much will I suffer later if I ignore the wisdom that's here? If I'm happy with the response, then I'll accept them into my body with gratitude, wisdom, discernment, and joy. I eat by the clock. Eating is a very sensuous, full, and rich experience for me. Smells, tastes, and sounds around foods are strong for me. I seem to be able to absorb into the flavors and smells. My awareness seems to go out into object and delight my senses. Something seems to be without a filter between direct sensation and object. Self-maker is quieter. I can get lost in a bowl of soup or go exploring in a salad. Subtle flavors are enhanced with awareness and I don't really experience cravings for more than seems appropriate. I don't miss salt either. So much of my own good self-care is realizing that I must at least make an attempt to train the sometimes unruly puppy mind that wants to play and shirk from her responsibilities. Who's in charge here? My playful unruly puppy mind or my wisdom mind? Wisdom mind reminds me not to be so hard on myself if I falter and at the same time reminds me to balance hard work with delicious play afterward. The middle way incorporates both. I use various props and routines to compensate for my short-term memory disabilities. I have a calendar book that I use to record everything I do and involved with. I have a system of boxes with check marks and stars and highlighters and stickies. I use my notebook by my phone. I use a notebook by my phone and make notes as I talk with people on the phone making sure I indicate the time and date and instructions to myself with check boxes to follow up on later. I use alarm clocks on my watch. My kitchen stove clocks to set near my medications. I've recently acquired this cute little digital timer, T timer. I use it to remind me to check on something as I travel through my house. Multitasking would be impossible for me without these props. I have rules for myself. If I'm cooking and someone calls me on the telephone, I move the cordless phone into the kitchen with me or I take the pot off the burner before I walk away from the stove to find the cordless phone. When I prepare food, I bring everything out onto the counter and separate it by what I've already used from what's next to go in the pot. This way I avoid over or under seasoning, forgetting or just uncertain where I put an ingredient. It takes extra effort for me to make something new. I'm constantly rereading, looking for my place in the recipe, reassuring myself that I haven't left anything out or missed a step in the preparation. Pull myself back from daydreaming, planning as I stand stirring the pot, balancing the mind in the present moment, finding neutral. This is very easy for me. My mind knows how to idle really well, yet freeing up the energy in that mind to creatively, intuitively determine what needs to happen next. Then doing it with awareness requires effort. That's the wisdom factor coming back into. Pulling myself back from daydreaming or planning requires wisdom and faith, wisdom to realize that my attention needs to be here in the present moment with a hot stove. Faith is making a mental note to follow up on the idea later or trusting that it will reappear, the idea that I had, trusting that it will reappear somewhere sometime at a more appropriate time. We'll talk a little bit now about healing the body with mindfulness practices and the Jhana practice while seated on the cushion. As you know, I use mindfulness to begin to settle the body and mind, to open my awareness, to begin to recognize the patterns within my body. What's arising today? Is there any discomfort in the body? I explore it with awareness, gently touching and exploring. One will naturally track and develop an overview of the situation. I greet the mind and body. Then using my intuition, I recognize the mind looks to rest and regenerate itself in the body through exploring the Jhana. I pay attention to what's keeping me focused, to see if what's keeping me from focusing on the breath sensations in my body and can I detect any of the five hindrances. This is important because when you attempt to do the Jhanas, you need to see if the five hindrances are present and tuning into the body is one way with which to bring a sense of if they're present for you or not. The five hindrances are desire, aversion, sloth and torpor, restlessness, remorse and doubt. I recognize the category of hindrances that are at play and I become mindful of them. If possible, I let go of them, the ones that are troubling me after I examine them thoroughly, trusting them. If they need to come back, they will at a different time. When the hindrances are at bay and not active, it's possible to have momentary glimpses into the mind directly, sensing the mind's innate qualities of clarity, brightness and malleability. As perception gets stronger, we continue Jhana practice. The first four Jhanas refresh the mind, the mind generates and releases focused energy from within to produce the first form Jhanas. They are called rapture, joy, tranquility and equanimity. They represent finer and finer, more subtle sensations that are experienced within the body. These factors begin to balance within the mind. The last four Jhanas are felt apart from the body. The body sense drops away. With exercise, practice, you can gain insights, understanding the nature of reality. All things are impermanent, always changing and therefore not self. Clinging gives rise to suffering and the formation of the false sense of self. You let go of clinging, the false sense of self lets go as well. The fourth Jhana, equanimity is useful to strengthen in terms of stepping out of this platform and then examining the body. Using concentration can become a laser beam of awareness that I can look into the mind of my own cells, tiny little energetic beings that comprise my body. Truly see that we are composites, we are made up of tiny charged proteins, molecules and energy. I converse with the cells through interactive imagery, thoughts and feelings. I get to know them, interactive guided imagery is a useful tool. They can let me know when something is not right inside through symbols. This is the stage for healing and recovery. This is knowing the self intimately and all the five faculties are engaged in this process. In the Morphen syndrome, problems can arise with the synthesis and deposition of proteins that make up the microfibrils which then coalesce to form something called fibrillin which is a part of connective tissue throughout the body. This results in inherently weakened structures. They are not able to stand up to the average wear and tear placed on the body by activities that produce repetitive amounts of physical strain. There is a constant chronic healing process going on around buttressing and reinforcing the weakened damaged areas of the body that are giving way to normal wear and tear. This can produce inflammation in organ remodeling. An example of this is in the aorta as it exits the heart and travels down the center of the body, splitting into two and traveling down both legs. People with the Morphen syndrome are prone to aneurysm formation and dissection which is splitting between the three walls that make up the aorta and rupture. I understand the scientific information and I use it as I investigate my body. Something else I use as far as the meditation technique is method two which is taught to me by Tom Jeff of Meta Monastery in Southern California. It is a technique called keeping the breath in mind and it was taught to him by his teacher Ajahn Lee Damodaro. There are seven basic steps and involve bringing the breath sensation into the body at various points in the body and following, sensing it as it travels through the body and exits the body. I found this to be an excellent practice for me. It truly rejuvenates me and makes me feel more solidly connected to my body and mind. This practice embodies all the five spiritual faculties as well. My mind does not feel lazy all the time. In fact, there are times in which it feels quite bright. During these times, I allow my mind to dwell with old memories, watching them come before me, healing them, sending them loving kindness, wishing them well, reviewing old mental photo albums, resolving, forgiving, sending, Meta blessing. There is a wide range of things involved in healing the mind and body. I see myself and other people, especially when I pick up on and see our similar patterns. I record my insights in my journal, deep meditation, images appear, interactive imagery is useful in this. I can see a problem or concern and allow my mind to work with it creatively and then record it as it appears. Awareness has the capacity to heal us, is in us, in our very cells. When illness occurs, our cells feel disconnected and troubled. Bring in help through energetic healing work and cell memory. I've begun working with Chloe Scott in Feldenkrais Method. This has been very helpful too. Just starting now to work with me on that. And it involves neurologically reprogramming your body through body awareness practices, encouraging your body and brain to speak together through touch and pressure and various movements. I'm repeatedly waking up over and over again, being present with myself. I encourage you to see your practice, not just as a 45 minute session, but your entire day. Watch mindfully your reactions to things. See if you cannot get drawn into the lull of activity and fall back asleep. And you'll have cultivated the resources to handle the most mundane, the most profound situations life has to offer. The five faculties are the strengths we can develop and use when we investigate and learn through our troubles and difficulties. And now I would just like to have us just quietly close your eyes. And I just want to say this, invoke this blessing for us. And it won't take long. And then I'd like to show you some of the artwork that I've done. May the five spiritual faculties, faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom, blossom within each of us. May we be happy, healthy, free from unwholesome feelings, thoughts and states of mind. May we skillfully reflect on the words of the Buddha, that our hearts would be enlivened and encouraged by the deeper truths that are revealed to us. Thank you. So.alliab Pos One, two, three. You feel you are separate from your mind more than an average person. I did identify in the mind that's the biggest problem. But because of the special situation, the problem we are related to. You feel more separate from your mind? It's, words are always tricky when we look at this. Should I put this back on? Words are always tricky when we use them interchangeably and along different lines of thinking. My mind does not feel like it's in my head anymore. My mind feels like it's in my entire body. I don't feel separate from it. Everything in me feels very alive. And that's the heightened sensitivity, I guess you'd say, that I feel. It's funny, it's as if I can kind of see things, the thoughts, I can sort of get a sense in the mind, almost like I can sort of feel them bubble up. Oh, there it comes. And then it goes away. And there it comes and there it goes away. And so I have a sense, I can sometimes get a sense that I'm starting to form some self around it. It's like I almost kind of feel it coming out like, oh, here it comes. And so it's funny, it's like, you know, it's considered a disability in one way, but in another way, you know, I get to see what's happening more clearly. It's almost just like that's what we're trying to strive for, trying to get a better connection between our mind and body. And you've been able to do that and get a real connection between the mind and body. What we try to do is be really aware of our body. Yeah, it seems like, yeah. It seems like we try to be really aware of our body in the moment of the critical. Yeah, so, you know, I have a sense that the mind, the brain, it actually has the capacity to heal itself. And it, as I say, having knocked down all those old ways of being, just kind of blow them out. Just let what I guess was just naturally there develop. And then, you know, now you see this. So that's what it seems like to me. Yes? Would you discuss the experience of singing and vibration and the first way singing strings together thoughts differently? Differently than what you were talking about as healing the body coming up with, or just talking about the whole world of music? Oh, the music, yes. Yes, in fact, when I call it tag along with the music, I get very, depending on what the music is, of course, I can get very static almost, you know, can get very taken away by the music. And I can, in a sense, generate some of that for myself too, if I start to sing a happy song or reflect sometimes on something very pleasant around music. Do you ever have songs that go through your head repeatedly? And you just kind of, some of them you like and you like to continue, and you just go, where did that please go away? I'm very sensitive to when those are showing up in me. And I get a sense that if I give them more attention, they go, they get stronger, you know, that's repeated. But if I can give myself permission to say, well, wisdom minds says, well, maybe I shouldn't be doing that right now, then I let it go. But again, it's registering. I feel like the whole thing registers in the body. It's like we're registers, music. And I have this long, you know, lifey-like body, you know, and I just sort of, you know, float away sometimes. But again, it takes control and effort and energy for me to move because of the way I'm built, you know. So balancing all these factors. But it doesn't stop me from trying to dance. I mean, I have a good time dancing, so, yeah. Did that help? Have you focused on your practice with different types of chant? Formal chant. Listening to it, not trying to do it at some point. Listening to different types. I haven't explored that just yet, but I've, you know, I've got CDs and things like that of chants. The meta-chant, I like to listen to that, you know, oftentimes. And again, all these things have, they almost like they get the mind entrained, you know, repeatedly entrained, entrained, entrained. So I'm aware of those effects, and I'm very sensitive to them. So, yeah. Yeah. I'm particularly interested in your community process and how you came to, did you create the fiber art as a visual tool that sort of talked to those cells that are functioning, and how you came about doing that? And what else you might be doing to help that communication with your heart? Well, there are a lot of things that I've discovered that actually give me a sense of greater connectiveness again. I'm reconnecting all what was left up there, so see, what didn't get completely fried. Still there a little bit. I'm encouraging those to heal, and I'm also encouraging them to build new connections. So, for instance, doing things like knitting. A good friend of mine had a wonderful insight, and she said, Cheryl, what a wonderful, you know, opportunity for you to sit and knit. And it was, I knew how to crochet, that was easy for me. But knitting was a real challenge at first, because I just couldn't get my mind around how do you get this over there and up there over there. But finally, I figured it out, and I got it, and then I must have knitted like five scarves. I just went crazy, because it was like, you know, it got to be where my body started remembering. It was like my fingers started knowing how to do it, and they were happy, and it was like, we know how to do something again, isn't this great? So, yes, knitting is a wonderful tool. And mindfulness of, oh, quilting, that's another thing I've taken up again. Years ago, I did a lot of sewing, and now recently got involved in quilting. So, with the Women's Full Moon Gathering, we're making a group quilt here, by the way. It's a project we're taking on. But again, it's giving the idea that you're very mindful, very present with what you're doing, and you're watching your thoughts roll by, and you decide, am I going to go with it or not? What's troubling me? Do I feel it in my body? It's an awareness practice. And I don't think about the end outcome, like, what's it going to look like so much, as knowing that I put the best effort I could into it. That's what really counts, because it's the present moment of where I live. I tend not to live in the future very much, because I've discovered the future is really unreliable. It really is. We like to think it's really going to be solid, and it's going to happen, but hey, come on. I'm living walking proof of a change that can happen like that. So, yeah. I also paint. I like little painting jobs. I love watercolor. Yeah. So, at some point, you almost built a relationship with themselves and our function by sort of visualizing them and creating them and making them, looking at them and talking to them. Yeah. So you did the fiber art and paint them as well, and what kind of... Well, I haven't actually painted any of the fiber artists yet, but it's a good idea. I'm going to be all incorporated. I think it's something that a lot of us reviews are parts that don't work. Yeah. I think one thing that keeps coming to me a lot is see the beauty in everything. You know, having a body that's not considered normal, looking like everybody else, and you always say, well, it's normal, but anyway, having, you know, disproportionately long arms and legs and whatnot. I have been part of the National Marfan Foundation for many years. I was a founding member of it, and so I've met many people with this disorder. And what we strive to do within ourselves is to look for the beauty within our bodies, and it's unique and special, and it's just like anybody else's body. It's unique and special. And so, you know, getting a relationship, a friendly relationship with ourselves, with our minds, with our bodies, through whatever means we can, it's a relationship you're having with yourself. Ultimately, you really are. I am.
