 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello, hello everyone from everywhere. And now here we come at the end of the week. And I believe that these days that I've been sitting down here, I've been feeling fairly, you know, empty in a nice, very nice way. I hope that it comes across okay in this YouTube world. So, if we study our thinking, and one of the ways to understand is we usually, thoughts are usually about something. So about the meal I'm going to have, or about the meal I just had that wasn't just quite right, or the work, or a conversation, or an event that happened, or about some self-concern, or about plans we're making, or about a fantasy we have, we think about things. And the world of aboutness is at least one step removed from the world of aliveness. And in some ways the world of aboutness is maybe a one-dimensional, two-dimensional world. It's a kind of a virtual reality world, that world of thoughts. I love my thoughts mostly. At least I have a very positive relationship to them. And so I don't feel like I need to be critical of them. But I am aware that they are about something. And if I spend too much time in that world of aboutness, then I become separated from the world of aliveness. And one way of understanding this meditation is it's a switch from aboutness to aliveness. That we're not so focused on the world of aboutness, but we're focused on the world, the living world, that we can experience and feel and see and touch and know directly here and now. And so this distinction between thoughts being the world of aboutness maybe helps you to break the enchantment with them, or break the allure, the strong pull into the world of thoughts. And this idea that the alternative in meditation is the world of aliveness. Maybe that is a welcoming idea to show up here for your lived experience of the moment. So assuming a meditation posture. And gently closing your eyes. And to gently, slowly, as if you're like you're entering into a beautiful place, a forest or a sacred grove, or gently, slowly, take some deeper breaths. Just deep enough that it remains comfortable for you. And maybe in a way that's comfortable taking these deep breaths and then slow, long exhale. Maybe exhaling more than usual. And as you exhale, let the shoulders relax, the belly relax. Let your body settle here. Letting your breathing return to normal. To begin meditation with relaxing is also a way of settling into the lived body, the experience of aliveness in the body. So as you exhale, you might relax the muscles of your face. And maybe the character of aliveness in the face changes as the face relaxes. On the exhale, softening the shoulders. And as you do so, perhaps the shoulders. Expand in their aliveness, the range of feelings. Softening the belly, settling in. Letting your belly hang forward and down, maybe. As the belly relaxes, the center of gravity settles in the body. And then to have a global awareness of the body, meaning a wide, broad experience of the body as is available for you. And on the exhale, softening the whole body, softening into the sense of aliveness in the body. And then relaxing into the body breathing. In many ways, breathing is an animating force for our lived life. And feeling how the body experiences breathing. Settling in. And if your mind goes into the world of thoughts, maybe think of it as the world of aboutness. Maybe even noticing that you're thinking about something, of course. But that's a bit removed from the world of aliveness. Here, here, now in the body. For these minutes, choose aliveness instead of aboutness. For this minute, choose aliveness. For this minute, choose aliveness. For this minute, choose aliveness. For this minute, choose aliveness. For this minute, choose aliveness. For this minute, choose aliveness.
