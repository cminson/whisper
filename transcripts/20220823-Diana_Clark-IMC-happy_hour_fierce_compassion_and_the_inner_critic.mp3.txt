 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Thank you for putting that in the chat box. So welcome, welcome everybody. I'm going to mute us just so that the quality of the recording is a little bit better. Otherwise sometimes, unknowingly, there's a lot of sounds that end up coming through or living spaces. So today, I'd like to continue on this series of The Inner Critic. I've done quite a few now, right? I'm not sure how long I'm going to do this, but I wanted to include a little bit more about this idea of the inner critic in some different ways in which we might work with it. And one way is to notice how sometimes we might have this sense of allegiance to this inner voice that's putting us down, belittling us, make us feel like we're inadequate in some kind of way. Maybe there's this allegiance because there's, A, it's familiar. Chances are we've heard it a lot. And B, maybe there's a part of us that thinks it's true and we don't really want to give up this idea that we have to be really hard on ourselves. We don't want to give up this idea that the only way that we will get what we want or go where we want to go or be who we want to be is if we're really hard on ourselves. Because there's so much pressure, like society gives us so much pressure to beat ourselves up, beat other people up too, right? With our judgments, judge ourselves, judge others, they go together, right? The people who judge themselves the worst are the ones who are judging others the worst too. It's my experience when I see that thing happening. So we often have this, and it's not at the front of our minds, and it would, like if you were to ask somebody, they might say, oh, don't be ridiculous. I don't have loyalty, allegiance to this voice that is so mean to me. But there might be a part of a way in which we do, actually, this inner critic, which sometimes can feel like it's a subpersonality. It's a, I mean, there's many different ways it can be felt or sensed, and not everybody has it. But if we do, there's a way in which we might be part of us that doesn't want to discount it, doesn't want to say it's not true. But sometimes we need to have what we might say some fierce compassion. So compassion is when there's this warm heartedness, this care, this warmth, and this care, this warmth, this love meets suffering. Then the love, the warmth, just gets transformed from loving kindness, we might say, to compassion. So compassion comes out of this warmth and care, and it adds onto it or has a little extra seasoning, we might say, of wishing the suffering to end. Wishing that some well-being for the other person or the other being, or if we're doing compassion for ourselves, wishing that ourselves can have some freedom from suffering, can have some ease from suffering. So somehow, when we're working with the inner critic, instead of having this allegiance to recognize, oh, there is this pain here when this inner critic is saying all these things to ourselves. And we could just allow this natural compassion to arise. If we're coming out of this place of warmth, this is why I like to do compassion practice starting with loving kindness, so that the heart is already have open and spacious, so that when it encounters the suffering, just this transformation into compassion already happens. But I want to add a little bit here to just compassion. Sometimes we need a little bit of fierce compassion. Instead of just saying, oh, yeah, yeah, everything's nice, and oh, I wish the suffering would go away, there's this way which we might be a little detached from it. But is there a way that we can meet the difficulty of the inner critic with a kind heart, but also with some fierce compassion that has something like, okay, I recognize the difficulty here, and I know you're trying to help, but it's not working. I know you're trying to help, but this isn't helpful to be belittling ourselves and putting ourselves down. So in the way that we might like stick up for a friend sometimes, that we might stand up like, no, don't talk to my friend like that. Is there a way that we could do that for ourselves? No, don't talk to me like that. I know you're trying to help, but that's not working. So there's this kind of like, this fierce compassion that says, no, that approach doesn't work. I'm going to do something else. And sometimes we have to do that for ourselves. It's a little bit odd, right? You know, that is okay. We're saying this one part of ourselves is saying it to another part of self. And without worrying about what all this means or getting lost in the, I don't know, the minutia of it, can we instead just kind of have this sentiment or this feeling of this? No, this isn't helpful. This is actually painful. But in order to have this feeling like it's not helpful, we do kind of have to switch our allegiance from the inner critic to everything else. Right? We're not the inner critic. Sometimes it might feel like that's the only thing that's there and it's the loudest and the most predominant, but it can be really helpful to recognize, nope, that's just a voice that arises on occasion. It's not the only thing that's happening in our world. And can we have this sense of, I know you're trying to help, but it's not working. That's not helpful. In fact, it's making me feel worse. Maybe I'll just, before I end here, just build on a little bit. What I was saying earlier is that often when we get into judging, when we're judging ourselves, often it kind of spills out into judging others. And then just that never feels good either. It's like, oh, that person, they shouldn't do that or whatever it might be. That doesn't feel good either. That is not a loving, kind, warm-hearted way to show up in the world. So even if we're not quite ready to switch allegiance, can we feel the pain of the judging? There's what the judging mind is saying, and there's just the activity of judging. It just kind of diminishes us. Even though we might think we're better than others, there's still a way in which it diminishes us. And there's a part of us that recognizes that too. It might be a habit. It might be something familiar. And maybe there's a little zing of energy, like, oh, yeah, I would never do what that other person is doing. But it comes at a big cost. This is not the way to have a life that has freedom and ease and warmth and care, which is what I think all of us want. This is part of where happiness lies. Okay, so with that as an introduction, let's do some meditation. So taking a meditation posture, one that has ease, some comfort, but also expresses this intention to meditate. And to feel into the body, to be embodied. And when you sit and know that you're sitting, feeling the experience of sitting. Is there a way that can soften or ease up or let go any areas, obvious areas of tension or tightness? Sometimes by bringing our awareness to them, it can be an increase in relaxation, not always. And if the tension doesn't diminish when you bring your attention to it, can you be okay with that? Resting the attention on the sensations of breathing, feeling the stretching and the release of the stretch around the ribs, perhaps. Maybe it's the movement of the abdomen. Maybe the feeling of air going in and out of the nose. And then the mind wanders as it's apt to do. Can we with some ease and gentleness and warmth, just begin again with the sensations of breathing. So this practice, mindfulness of breathing is always available. Whatever it feels like the loving kindness isn't helpful or that it's, you're like dipping into overwhelm with emotions or something like this, you can always just come back to mindfulness of breathing. And then to begin our loving kindness practice, bringing to mind a lovable being, a person, that furry family member, maybe even an imaginary kittens, puppies, babies. Whatever brings a little sense of delight or warmth or like an inner smile, for whomever. Maybe it's even somebody you don't know, but they've touched your life in some kind of way and you just have so much appreciation and gratitude. Connecting with this lovable being in any way that makes sense for you. Some people like to visualize some people like to maybe feel a connection in the chest heart center. And support our cultivating loving kindness. Can repeat these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. Connect with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Connecting with that warm hearted feeling you have with the lovable being. As it would like the keyword here is allow. If you don't feel anything in particular, it's perfectly fine. You can just stay with the practice in a relaxed, easy way. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. Connect with ease. And then can we expand this loving kindness to include ourselves? Of course we include ourselves. Bring in an image of yourself to mind. May you be safe. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. Allowing ourselves to soak up some of this warmth, this care, this kindness. May I be safe. May I be safe. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be safe. May I be safe. Bring to mind a mildly difficult situation in your life. Like on a scale of one to ten, ten being the most difficult, something that's like a two or a three. There's a few phrases you can say, these have a really different flavor. Might be helpful to just choose one. And to go at your own pace. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. I'm in the process of learning new ways and this takes time. I'm in the process of learning new ways and this takes time.
