So coming together, meeting like this is a time to exchange views, hear teachings, and meet together. 
And for that to have benefit and to bring us the results we need, we first need to establish a firm foundation of peace in the mind. 
It's like when you build a house, you have to prepare the ground very well and lay very solid foundations. 
And so now it's our time to return to our own inner foundation and observe very clearly the nature of the mind, observe ourselves. 
The past has gone, there's no need to worry about that. 
The future is not yet here, so we have nothing to worry about that either. 
What has it isn't is the present moment, and that's where self-knowledge lies in the present moment. 
We come to know and understand the process of our body. 
There's an in-breath, and we know the in-breath. 
There's an out-breath, and we know the out-breath. 
And when we take up this model or this practice, this is what leads us to a state of freedom, that of being in the present moment and seeing things as they really are with a measure of clarity. 
For this we need sati, mindfulness, mindfulness to know the in-breath, mindfulness to know the out-breath. 
The mind relaxes, the mind lets go. 
If the mind is relaxed, then there's no basis for tension, pressure, stress, anxiety, nothing obscures the mind. 
This can be called samadhi or concentration meditation. 
So for this we hold the body erect and bring our awareness to the present moment. 
We're establishing self-awareness in the way of the awakened ones, the enlightened ones. 
So I pay my respects to all the monks gathered here and extend my greetings and blessings. 
I wish you growth in dhamma and growth in happiness to everybody here who has gathered together in this place with faith and interest to study and further understanding of dhamma. 
So today this is a nice chance, a good opportunity for all of us to meet up like this and get together and support each other like one big family, like relatives coming together and this warm feeling we have here, this feeling of interconnectedness, relatedness, gives rise to a certain well-being which is something we can bring into all our interactions. 
So tonight then this is an opportunity to discuss issues related to our living together in society, in community. 
And the teachings of all our ancestors, all our predecessors have always taught us to give very great importance to our lives, to how we live our lives, because life is something which is of great intrinsic benefit and value. 
And if we genuinely feel that our life can be of true benefit, of true value, then we have to ask the question, how? And so this is an issue we have to give great importance to and study. 
And with regard to the material aspect, the material aspect of life is something we are all quite familiar with. 
We know nature, we can talk of the physical world, the natural world and natural resources. 
We can speak of the minerals which there are in the world and we can also speak of elements. 
We traditionally speak of earth element, water element, fire element and wind. 
And with regard ourselves, we add an element of space and consciousness. 
This is one way of conceiving of ourselves. 
And when we are able to observe ourselves in the context of elements, seeing ourselves as composed of various elements, then we see that there is nothing of real essence within us. 
We experience a sense of being part of nature arising and passing away. 
And the result of this is that we are able to experience life in a more broad way rather than a limited way, because we see that actually as human beings we are all the same. 
Whatever lives we lead, wherever we live, our lives all take up the same essential form. 
That is to say we arise somehow, we remain for a certain period and then we pass away. 
So when we see ourselves in this way, then this doesn't give rise to a sense of self-importance or conceiving an essence or a self in the body. 
And so we don't fall under the power of delusion. 
But our mind's mental health, mental well-being is something we have to study and understand. 
This is what we call the nama-dhammas, the aspect of mentality. 
We have the physical part of life and we have the mental part. 
And with regard to the mind then we can perceive it or describe it in terms of positive and negative, or those aspects of the mind which we call good and bad, those things which are wholesome or unwholesome, those things which bring us benefit to our detriment. 
And with sati, which means mindfulness, we're able to observe ourselves, to observe both the material aspect, the body, and the aspect of the mind, the mentality, the aspect of the mental realm. 
And observing our minds with mindfulness then is different from simply acting, thinking based on various sense contact which arises based on what we call sense consciousness. 
We're able to stop and observe the mind with what's called self-awareness. 
And this gives rise to right view or right understanding. 
Right understanding can be described as the experience or a view which doesn't lead one into agitation, neither oneself or other people. 
Right view will always lead us to experience a feeling of letting go, a feeling of relaxed being at ease, rather than feeling heavy, there's a feeling of lightness. 
Rather than mind, thoughts, mental states bound up with gain and loss, getting this or losing that, there's a feeling of enough, there's that feeling of satisfaction when nothing is needed to add to this particular experience. 
And this is freedom. 
Nothing obscures the mind and one goes beyond delight and beyond aversion. 
One's no longer bound up by pleasure and pain, wanting and disliking. 
This is what we call the mind which is at ease. 
When the mind is peaceful and still, then the mind will be at ease. 
And this is true happiness. 
This is the happiness we're all seeking. 
And it's something which we can all acknowledge and all experience for ourselves because the mind at peace, the mind at ease, feels cool. 
And this is something we can develop in ourselves, just like in the material world. 
If we know how, we can use and adapt and manipulate the world's natural resources to be of great use for us. 
We can produce food, we can create, make clothing, we can build houses. 
And so with regard our minds, if we give our lives true importance and think of ourselves as, the word is manusa. 
Manusa means human beings, but it has the implication of high-minded beings or true human beings. 
Then we have this, what that means is we have this capacity to develop our minds so that we can lead our lives in a way where every moment we can experience this cool and this feeling of being at ease. 
And so this is what we call true knowledge or true understanding. 
Just like, just in the same way that light dispels darkness, knowledge and understanding dispels this feeling of disease. 
And knowledge and understanding with regard our lives is that which leads us away from danger. 
For this purpose, we have to cultivate what's called sati-sampa-janya. 
This means mindfulness and clear comprehension in every posture, whether standing, walking, sitting, lying down. 
Every interaction we have with the outside world and with society must be bound up with clear mindfulness. 
And in doing so, we can just be the witness and observe our experience as simply a natural process of arising and passing away. 
And when the mind is operating like this, then all sense of enmity, negativity, hatred disappears naturally. 
Unlike when the mind is obscured and bound up by delighting in this and being unhappy with that or wanting this and not wanting that or liking this and not liking that. 
That's what we call not dhamma or not truth. 
And that kind of mind state, this delight in aversion, wanting and hating, this is a lack of development within us where we haven't yet realized our true capacity. 
So if we're able to contemplate very deeply, then we'll see that we'll establish a foundation within ourselves and be free from this attachment which gives rise to delusion. 
The attachment is this giving oneself self-importance or even conceiving of an essence in oneself, conceiving of a self. 
And whenever that experience arises, straight away there's disease, that's where dukkha or suffering arises. 
So understanding these principles, this dhamma, which is of great value to us, is something which is our goal which we can do. 
And this is not something which is limited to any particular race, creed, nationality, age, sex or any other kind of group. 
It's a universal truth which we can all experience. 
So we need to have a part of the experience, a part of the society around us. 
Because we have the parameters which we need to have with the society. 
We need to have eyes, we need to have ears, we need to have a hear, we need to have a voice, we need to have a sense of smell. 
What is the vision? What is the hearing? La-mong, la-mong loong thi quam rusit kong lao eeng. 
Tha ta hien geert quam yin rai hoo dey yin geert quam mai poh jai. 
Geert quam rusit mai sabaai ne laksana jang ne. 
We have to know the end, the face of the viewer, the end, and be careful. 
Be careful not to let the good and the bad feelings arise. 
We have to know the end, the face of the viewer, the end, and be careful. 
Be careful not to let the good and the bad feelings arise. 
If we have the sense of being a person who has the ability to know that all this is an aggravation, the aggravation that causes the sense of being the source of all this. 
We don't give up. 
We look at it in another way to give the sense of being a person who has the sense of being the source of all this. 
We look at the person who has the ability to express himself in a way that we don't give up. 
We look at it in a way that he is not comfortable. 
He has the sense of being the source of all this. 
If we look at it in a way that we may have the sense of being sad, we don't give up. 
We will stop giving him the sense of being in the normal state. 
If we don't have the sense of being sad, we can ask him what is there? There may not be a reason, there may not be a place to be safe. 
This is the part of the sense of being aware of all this. 
The sense of being aware of the essence of the mind. 
We don't want others to look at it in a way that we know ourselves. 
If we are not comfortable, we can know ourselves. 
If we are not comfortable, we can say that it is dangerous and hot. 
If we are not comfortable, we can say that it is not necessary. 
We think in this way. 
So, the Buddha taught us to be careful. 
If we are caught in the right way, we will have the benefit. 
If we are caught in the right way, we will have the benefit. 
We all have a part of the relationship with the sense of being. 
Don't waste the energy that is part of the sense of being. 
This is hot, this is less like fire. 
The fire gives light when we control the darkness, we get the benefit. 
The fire gives warmth, and the fire makes us get the food that has the value of the body. 
The fire comes from the fire. 
If we look at it in this way, we can see that our relationship is not dangerous. 
It is not dangerous. 
There is only a part that makes the creation happen. 
It makes us more aware. 
It makes us more aware of the sense of being. 
If there is no such thing, we will not be aware. 
We will not be aware. 
This is because the Buddha taught us to be aware of the sense of being. 
So, being aware of the sense of being is not dangerous. 
It is not a trap. 
Be aware so that it is in the right way. 
If it is in the right way, there will be no danger. 
It is as if we are all in the same place. 
If we are in the same place, we are very careful. 
We can see that there is a part of our relationship. 
At least, there are friends, parents, and disciples. 
There is also another part that makes the creation happen. 
We are not in the same place. 
This is because we are aware. 
It is not dangerous. 
It is similar. 
So, being aware of the sense of being is one of the things that are dangerous. 
Being aware of the sense of being is a type of lack of sense. 
It can cause a bad sense, but it can cause the sense of wanting. 
We are not aware of the sense of being. 
Being aware of the sense of being is a type of lack of sense. 
There is a saying that it is not in a calm state. 
It is called the sense of fear. 
It is like fire. 
Loss is also the same. 
We have the habit of giving up this feeling, giving it more and more. 
If a person has a habit, it is dangerous, there is no punishment, there is no danger. 
Therefore, the world should do as a part of the society, so that there is a sense of fear. 
Let us know and see. 
If you know, then know from the use. 
In the end, you will see as a substance that causes the feeling to have a different feeling. 
It is called the sense of fear. 
If you look at it like this, then it will be like all. 
The sense of fear comes out in all of the forms. 
The sense of fear is like nature. 
The word of God is like the origin. 
The form of fear is like the origin. 
The word of God is like in any place, in any place, in any situation, there is nothing different. 
If we look at each other in this way, we don't have any feelings or feelings. 
That is, we don't see that we are good or bad, that we are good or bad. 
If we look at each other in this way, it is clear. 
It is like the water we have in the past. 
It is clear. 
It doesn't have a depth, it doesn't have a depth. 
It is like the water in the past. 
It is very cold. 
Our mind and mind are the same. 
Both of us have eyes that have to look at each other. 
Both of us have ears that have to look at each other. 
It doesn't make any feelings in the way we are. 
It is like the heat, it is the heat, and it is the heat that causes the heat, and it doesn't have any feelings in the way we call it. 
It is like the heat, it is the heat, it has the feeling of the cold. 
It is the I am very happy to have the feeling that there is a state of non-conviction, that there is a state of depression, that there is a body, that there is a body. 
There is a feeling about the mind, which is peaceful, like the mind is weak. 
The state of the mind is the right thing. 
There is no feeling that there is anything to worry about, not that there is a worry, but that there is something to worry about. 
This is the way to put your own feeling into the form of a man. 
A man from the past, from the past, there is no punishment, there is no danger. 
This is where we come to the end, to create awareness in the way that is called the right body, to create awareness, to create awareness, to create awareness of the human being. 
I am a human being, I am here, I am not here. 
One way of thinking about our Dhamma practice or of practicing Dhamma itself is in the light of doing one's duty or taking on the necessary tasks that we have to do with regard to how we manage and deal with our lives. 
In our lives we all play certain roles of management or having to deal or handle situations. 
And so anything we do, anything arising which we are handling or relating to to be successful we have to have a certain circumspection and all around seeing things very clearly. 
And in our Dhamma practice it's something which we can do all the time when we relate to the outside world or living in society. 
It's something we have to do because everywhere we go or in every situation our eyes must see forms, our ears hear sounds, our nose, smell, odours, our tongues, our tasting, flavours, our body contacts and physical sensations and our mind gives rise to thoughts and imagination. 
So Dhamma practice is all about understanding this process and asking ourselves when the eye sees a form what happens, when the ear hears a sound what happens etc. 
So understanding this process, eye seeing, form, ear hearing, sound etc. 
this is understanding our very own lives, this is looking into our experience. 
And if when we do experience external sense impingement or anything contacts us there's dissatisfaction, aversion, it's not liking then straight away there's disease in ourselves. 
So as Dhamma practices that's the point we have to stop and to simply observe with great awareness and then at that point be very careful observing very carefully our minds and our mental states so that we don't fuel or nurture or buy into these thoughts of delight or these thoughts of aversion and so in time they don't arise. 
Take for example being criticised, somebody who is negative or prejudiced criticises you basically based on their own suffering they're in some kind of negative state. 
Whenever we hear these words of criticism then if we're not aware straight away a feeling of negativity, not liking it, resentment, whatever arises. 
But if we see clearly that really what's at the foundation of their criticism what's often behind it is that person's own suffering it's a certain negativity or prejudice on their part then in ourselves then we're able to just stop and not foster or indulge our own negative reaction. 
We can train ourselves simply just to let go. 
You just observe how when you hear something you don't like it leads to your own heat and agitation and we simply look at the person who said these unkind words of criticism, see how they are in a negative state and they themselves are unable to find their own inner freedom and looking at somebody in that way then instead of negativity feelings of compassion or loving kindness can arise. 
And so then when our own strong reaction has calmed down we return to a balanced or normal state then we might even be able to ask them what's really the problem. 
And so we're stopping the cycle of anger or negativity or danger. 
This is a state of what we call knowing oneself. 
We have to be very aware of our own mental states and this is not something that anybody else can do for us. 
Each of us has to do it for ourselves. 
We can just experience very clearly what is it like to experience dis-ease or lack of comfort or lack of well-being. 
Usually it's a kind of hot, agitated feeling. 
So anything that's hot is undesirable. 
So the Buddha and all our ancestors, all the teachers of the past always taught us to be very, very careful, to be very carefully observing our minds. 
But we have to understand the mind, understand heat in the mind because heat is something which can be beneficial just like a value, just like heat in the world. 
Although it's usually painful and dangerous, we all need it. 
We all need energy and energy is in some form or other bound up with heat. 
For example, the lights which give us this brightness or the kind of heat which we need to cook our food. 
All of this comes from fire which can be dangerous. 
But if we know how to use it and look in the good sense, then it's not so dangerous. 
So it can give rise to our own development and improvement and it's the same with understanding. 
When we learn to understand our minds, then we can even learn from our own negative or our own hot mental states. 
So the Buddha taught us to be very cautious, very careful with our minds not overly suspicious, not, you might say, overly paranoid, but to simply be very clear and very ready to understand our mind and protect our minds. 
Just like, for example, anybody who has a home, you have to be careful of your home. 
There may be friends, relatives, children of yours who come to visit you, but then there may also be people who wish your harm, or who wish for your well-being. 
But if you see very clearly everyone who's coming, then you're able to live free from danger. 
So what we call dangerous, dangerous thoughts, dangerous moods, are those things which are unwholesome, which give rise to worry and negativity. 
And principally, desire, desire which has no end to it. 
You can never end one's desire by gratifying it. 
It's called lobha in Pali. 
Then there's the state of mind which is hot and agitated, never feels cool in its ease. 
This is the state of anger. 
And the Buddha compared anger to fire, dhosa. 
Then there's the state of what we call delusion, just not seeing things clearly. 
But if we contemplate and develop mindfulness, sati, then these states of mind which are actually false and trick us, they won't overcome us anymore. 
So the Buddha taught us to use what we call the lokadammas, the worldly factors, all the experiences which we experience in our life in order that we understand our life very clearly and to develop metha, loving kindness and warmth and the spirit of seeking truth. 
So imagine everybody who's coming here today. 
If we look at ourselves in the context of our individual characters or temperaments, personalities, then we'd say we're very, very different. 
But in the light of ultimate truth, we're all the same. 
We all arise, we're born, we remain for a while, and then at some point we pass away. 
So none of us are really any different. 
And when we really develop this view and see things like this, then this prevents biases and prejudices from arising. 
So the way the mind will work will not be labelling things, judging things as good and bad, or judging people as good and bad. 
The mind will be like pure water, pure water when it's free from pollutants or free from dirt, it's cool and clear. 
We have eyes to see forwards, we have ears to hear sound, etc. 
But we learn then to train our minds so that whatever sense experience arises for us, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, then on account of it, we don't feel confused or agitated or ill at ease. 
When we train our minds, the mind will be at peace. 
It will feel cool and no longer intoxicated and drunk by sense experience. 
It will feel cool and fresh. 
And the word we use in Pali is Sukkato, often translated as the accomplished one. 
But in this sense it simply means a happy one, or one who's at peace. 
Any posture, worry, any activity or undertaking, in any situation, the mind feels cool. 
And when our mind can experience this, then we can say we've gone beyond all obstacles, because nothing that arises in the external world has the power to affect us anymore or hinder us. 
This is somebody who's gone beyond everything, one who sees everything clearly so that no experience is of danger to that person. 
So this is how we train ourselves to go beyond agitation, beyond concern. 
We have a body, we train ourselves to be aloof from the body, no longer bound up with the body, attached to the body. 
We train ourselves to go beyond wholesome and unwholesome mind states, we call this aloofness or seclusion of the mind. 
So to train this we develop moderation with the external world, always knowing moderation with regard to the external sense realm. 
If we practice in this way, this leads to a mind which could be called pure, or which is correctly established in line with the laws of nature, dhamma. 
And this capacity to develop ourselves, this capacity to realize the highest potential which we have as human beings, is not something which lies anywhere else other than within ourselves. 
Food, material food is something which is of great importance and benefit to all beings, we call this ahara. 
Without food then we can't sustain ourselves for very long. 
And it's the same food for the physical body, it's the same then with regard to food for the mind or food for the heart. 
We call this dhamma ahara, the food of dhamma. 
What dhamma ahara, the food of dhamma is, are the spiritual qualities or the virtues which we can develop. 
If we have inner virtuous qualities or inner spiritual qualities nourishing us, then this is to the great well-being of oneself and of society. 
This is what we call living a life of perfection or bringing our lives to fruition. 
So one of the very famous teachings or injunctions of the Buddha is to live a life of great benefit for oneself and others, cultivating great heedfulness or mindfulness in our lives. 
So we have to cultivate these spiritual qualities and it's not to be done anywhere else other than right here, using our very own bodies and minds right here within us. 
We have the tools for the job right here, we have the body with its organs, we have our sense faculties. 
So we have to do those things which are called wholesome, those wholesome acts of body. 
Whenever we do something good, then goodness returns to us. 
When we act in good faith and act in a good way, then people won't harm us. 
There are less likely to be dangers for us. 
And so we can say on this level, on one level, just simply doing those things which are good, leading a virtuous life, is of benefit to oneself and benefit to the world. 
It brings a level of sukkha, a level of happiness to ourselves. 
But there's another type of happiness, another level created which arises based on the development of inner spiritual quality or developing the mind, which brings this feeling of coolness and freshness and ease, where one is no longer negative with regard to the external world. 
And the more we can cultivate spiritual values, spiritual qualities, then the more we'll be a refuge for other people. 
People will come to us and through our own willingness to renounce and give up and give up time or care for other people, then this makes people happy. 
And ourself will be happy as well. 
So this is the happiness of the mind which has the food of dhamma. 
One word we use for this is a mind which is, the word is bhunya, or bhun in Thai, usually translated as merit or meritorious. 
But really to expand on it, it's more like the mind which has inner wealth or inner well-being, a mind of, we have our inner richness or spiritual richness. 
The mind which is papa or evil or unwholesome, then it's very easy to see this will always lead to negativity, fear, danger. 
So anyone who does good things and leads a good life, then their mind is happy and balanced. 
And this is what we call sawan, it means heaven. 
Heaven is simply a mind which is very happy. 
Anyone you see, you experience them as your friend, as your relative. 
And this is just the simple natural result of good actions, whether actions of body, actions of speech, or actions of your own mental wholesome actions, then it becomes a more and more increasing cycle. 
If we do it more and more, we respect others and we gain respect. 
We become a buddhya-niyabukala, it means a person who is worthy of respect or one who is worthy of being venerated. 
And this respect in society arises based on spiritual qualities. 
So today on this occasion I have nothing really special to offer you. 
It's simply to point to the value of this life which we all have and encourage us all to leave lives which are of benefit, both now and in the future, in this world and the next. 
That will be what we call a life which is not wasted. 
The Buddha said, This means a difficult, difficult indeed to be born as a human being. 
So you can also understand or imply by that, that it's of great fortune. 
We're very fortunate indeed to have this capacity or this potential to realize our highest human potential. 
But it's up to us to train and develop and adapt and improve our minds. 
That way it's as if we're embellishing our lives with jewels. 
And in that respect then we can say we're leading a life of great beauty or our lives will be beautiful based on the adornments of a well-trained mind. 
So today again, meeting together like this, I have nothing really special but I just want to point out those things which are of value. 
So I'd like to express my happiness, my appreciation for everybody for giving up the time and renouncing giving up your time to come together clearly then with the intention to develop spiritual qualities. 
And if society and the whole had spiritual qualities and cultivated what we call the Arya qualities, the qualities of the noble ones, the enlightened ones, then wouldn't this be of great benefit to ourselves and to all sentient beings? I think we'll end this formal session with a blessing, do a traditional Pali blessing. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
I guess the sound is on, okay. 
I'm just asking Gil, do you want to close the evening? And he's passed the mic to me, so. 
So that Ajahn Liam, as in the blurb, is a senior monk, a disciple of Ajahn Chah. 
And he takes on a tremendous amount of responsibility in Thailand. 
There's probably 300 branch monasteries in Thailand. 
And when there's something goes wrong, everybody goes to Wapapong or goes to Ajahn Liam. 
And so that for him to step out of the responsibilities that he has and come to visit us in America, it's a great blessing. 
He's been up at Abhigiri, staying there. 
He'll be here in the Bay Area, up until June 8th, this when he leaves. 
So these next few days, he'll be in the Bay Area. 
Tomorrow he'll be in Wat Budanuson in Fremont. 
I think that'll probably all be pretty much in Thai. 
Although once you get into the Thai realm, you never know what's going to happen. 
So Sri Rupanya may be involved in translating again. 
On Monday, Ajahn Liam will be giving a talk at Spirit Rock. 
He'll be doing a Monday evening talk there. 
And then on Tuesday, he'll be giving a talk at the Berkeley Buddhist Monastery, which is sort of Abhigiri's regular first Tuesday of the month. 
So that if people are interested, they can join. 
He'll also be on Wednesday. 
We'll head back up to Abhigiri and we'll be there until he leaves on Monday. 
If people are interested, welcome to join at any point. 
I appreciate everybody's interest coming tonight. 
And I think it's very interesting for Ajahn Liam to see the interest that there is in Buddhism here in America. 
And that is, he has seen Westerners showing up in the back reaches of Thailand and seen some pretty wild characters showing up in the monastery. 
And to see a sort of a maturing of both of our own communities, but then within the lay community and the society that it's coming from. 
It's not lost on him. 
He isn't sort of a California gushy, tell everybody what he's feeling. 
But things slip out from time to time. 
And he definitely appreciates everybody's interest and sincerity. 
And I think that's not lost in him. 
I think it's good to take note of that. 
And I thank Gil for making this evening possible. 
And I think it's a great blessing for the community here to have him here. 
Thank you. 
And I'd like to thank Ajahn Liam very much for coming and gracing us, blessing us with his presence and his teaching. 
And also that he was able to bring along so many monastics. 
This is a record. 
And I feel it's a wonderful, very fortunate to be with all of you and to feel your years of practice and your commitment and dedication and the dharma, the dharma that you manifest being here with us. 
So we're very grateful for all of you. 
And I hope you all come back again. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
