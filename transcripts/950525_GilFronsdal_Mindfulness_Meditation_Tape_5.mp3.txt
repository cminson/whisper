 If you feel like you're if what's happening in the present moment is you're judging your breath You bring your mindfulness to the judging oh There's judging other that there's my old friend and you can even count how many times you do it and when you get to 392 You'll be a bit lighter about it Correct so then you want it. So then what okay Well So you're sitting there Minding you on business watching your breath and then this is only you notice the breath is not long enough or deep enough So you judge it so then you bring mindfulness. Oh, this is judging judging mind judging mind and you do that And maybe it dissipates maybe it doesn't and then Judging then you start to notice then you start controlling you want to control your breath Force yourself breathe deeper and then you notice you're judging and so you try to push away the judging and have other kinds of thoughts At that point if that's what's happening, that's what's presented itself in the present moment Then you become aware of what it's like to be a person who's controlling the breath or controlling the judging Isn't that simple You don't get rid of anything. You just have to be really aware of what's happening And then you might feeling on top of that that you hate the fact that you're controlling your breath So you might think because it's spiritual not spiritual, you know to hate your Anything so I'll try I'm not gonna I'm not gonna pay attention to that But everything is a field of practice And you don't push anything away, but you allow yourself to become aware and in allowing yourself to become aware at some point You find a spaciousness around whatever it is Acceptance So Great so that's so that's the fourth that's the fourth level right and then you maybe have to take attention to frustration This is a very very important point. There's nothing outside of practice And if you think there's something outside of practice Then you some point you'll get up and walk away because you get so frustrating people frustrations not the practice So I can't do the practice but the frustration is the practice if you bring awareness to that You disappointed Unsettled unsettled so where do you feel in the body? What do you feel in the body right now? Close your eyes so they're unsettled feeling where do you feel it now? I Keep your eyes closed keep your eyes closed a little bit and how do you experience it there in the middle? So be aware of tightness you might say to yourself tightness tightness And is it tightness kind of fill your whole stomach or is it a small area of stomach Is it more on the surface of your stomach or deep inside And if it had a shape what kind of shape is it flat square around And is it does it have sharp edges or weak edge or it kind of diffuse edges And in that round area of tension is there some place that's particularly strong So bring your awareness to the center of that area and notice this tension tension And be aware of what happens to it as you're aware of it. Does it get stronger or weaker or stay the same? Continue being aware of it seeing what happens sensing what happens and what's happening to it now So and what's your state now your emotional state you still feel unsettled or Sometimes I think I should I should sound like a drill sergeant and I'd be much more effective meditation teacher because because People wouldn't be relying on a voice That's what they rely on anything outside of yourself, but that's the that's the That's the process you need to do for yourself and things change pretty quickly if you bring yourself into the experience So there's nothing outside and so wherever you find yourself whether it's in the fourth to fifteenth generation of reactivity Go into that and know it's fully in fields in the body And a lot of people get restless especially beginners And you see people's shit visiting and moving and they don't have the idea that Restlessness itself the feelings and stations sensations of restlessness are being unsettled Are the very stuff that we pay attention to at times in meditation and you go into that and you find there's a way that If you bring very attentive to it, you find it some way that it's manageable to be with it So It's possible It's also why sometimes it's also why sometimes to take a break and Being a beginner and your first one to sitting maybe you should you know Little after gone for a walk and come back So So so they so yeah, well so take it easy. I mean you can do welcome if you know to The point that as I keep saying this meditation practice is to find find some way to be present for what is happening and find that ability is more important than than Not feeling frustrated or feeling calm. So in the midst of your frustration Can you find some way to allow that to be without getting? Worked up even more Can you establish some establish some kind of peaceful relationship with even being frustrated and it's possible? So it could be that the real the real cutting edge of your practice is not the early part of day Well, you're calm and anything's going well or whatever, but really that's the least place of least acceptance is at last hour And that's you're up against your cutting edge. So it's fascinating to work that area But you don't want to work. You don't want to you don't want to work that area You don't want to work that area to a degree that you get discouraged if that's what's happening. You take a break Get up and go for a walk or stretch your legs or whatever it takes I Think about what would take me away from paying attention to my breath while we were sitting is the birds I like listening to them. And then I think well they're here Yeah, well sometimes I said what takes you away from the present, right? so what takes you away from the present with maybe the more the key question and and Sometimes they are Well, let me say me say a little bit here the The There are five things five states mental emotional states Which are single singled out in the Buddhist tradition as being those things which are particularly powerful In pulling us away from the present moment pulling us away from the present They somehow grab or hold on to The grass kind of like I call them black holes of awareness a black hole in the sky Are these stars that have such strong gravitational pulls that whatever light travels near them or into them? Doesn't leave because the gravity pulls the light to the surface of the body. So it's a dark. It's a black hole These black holes of the mind are states of the mind which are so strong That awareness gets sucked up into them and no awareness comes out so you can't see them and these are very powerful states which Prevent people from entering into the present moment. And so these are things that are very common very standard things There's other things also that these are particularly strong that when these five things have been fully kind of Acknowledged and recognized and become familiar in meditation. The meditation will become a lot easier so it's important to mention these five and These things are Strong desire craving lust Attachment Warning things to be different Wanting to have a better meditation experience and wanting it so badly or wanting to have a better spouse So I want to have a better whatever or a better car a better house or better Wanting things so it's a wanting you lost in fantasy People sometimes spend days in the meditation in sexual fantasy strong strong desires that might arise And which are so powerful they pull you away from the present get lost in them So if one is cause is strong desires. The second is strong aversions ill will hate and Sometimes people spend hate you get consumed by ill will towards someone or yourself or anger or aversion And you get lost in the story or lost in the emotion and it keeps you from the present moment And sometimes just in meditation is you hate your experience you're having right now You wish you had a better one and so you really hate it. So you had this whole story about how terrible it is The third is What's called sloth and torpor you Sleepiness but not just sleepiness because you can be naturally sleepy, but it can be Kind of cloudiness of the mind or that it drained energy Dullness of the mind the mind feels very dull very tired very heavy The body feels very heavy and it's very difficult. You might keep almost falling asleep or falling over And in states of swath and torpor it's very hard to meditate you get pulled into those states the Fourth is our restlessness and anxiety or restlessness and worry When you're very restless or worrying a lot you're very anxious It's also very hard to be present and they'll pull you away from the present over and over again and a fifth and what's said to be the strongest of these five these five are called the five hindrances in Buddhism the strongest of the five is doubt Because doubt is what can Doubt is most likely the one to pull you away from practicing or get you to give up and doubt involves Doubting the practice doubting your doubting whether the practice is a good practice, you know, this can't be a good practice I doubt it is not going to help me for anything Doubting the teacher that teacher doesn't know anything who do you think he is? You know, he's you know, you know, maybe if I found a better teacher would be a lot better, you know I just all okay doubts about oneself They're thinking I can't do this. This might be a good practice, but I'm not the right person for these practices I don't have the ability to sit and be present Doubting about whether it's the right kind of day to meditate or the right day to meditate or doubt about whether you're wearing the right clothes for meditation, you know You know just whatever the doubts are and the doubts can be quite strong and you can get lost and swept up in them So these are five black holes of the meditation practice and these are visits everyone It isn't like a visit only bad people and you're a bad person because you have it They visit everyone and part of the process of meditation is becoming a connoisseur of black holes Learning to recognize them and saying oh boy here it is. I get to get to really Become familiar with it. So you explore it you get to know it really well the problem is not The problem is not Desire or aversion or sloth or torpor these things The problem is the hindering quality of them the gravitational pull of these things You don't have to get rid of these things to do the practice What you need to do is to overcome the gravitational force that makes it difficult for you to be in the presence when they're there And part of that is the identification and attachments we have around these things So we might have very strong Desires or attachments and we can have very strong aversions and either one of those can fuel The gravity of these strong black holes So one way to overcome this kind of gravity this identification is to learn to recognize them very quickly and very early Can you recognize these things when they arise and the more familiar you are with them? They're less likely you are to be pulled away So we've talked about in this course so far Mindfulness of breathing being aware of the breath and in a sense allowing the breath to be the center of the practice where you rest in your practice The mindfulness of the body mindfulness of emotions states mood moods and states of mind mindfulness of Thinking and thoughts and I work with that And in a sense, it's just simply being aware of what presents itself to you and it's very kind of straightforward It's kind of analytical and not thinking way, but just seeing what makes up this experience sensing it feeling it and all that another whole part of this medication practice is Not just simply seeing things as they are but seeing how See patterns of Phenomenal patterns of experience and seeing how the experiences we have in our in our life relate to other experiences and relate to other aspects of our experience the causality So so for example You might notice that when you have strong Anger arises in you. You don't just simply notice the anger, but you might notice that that with anger comes A dulling of your vision you don't see so well anymore. You don't see other people so well you see only parts of them so you see the consequences of having angry and Or you notice that when you don't angry you see the person more clearly for who they are fully and that's that's interesting to notice That there's a cause and effect relationship between states of being and and how we experience the world You might notice that there's a relationship between what route you take to work and you drive to work That if you drive on 101 to work you get to work in a more irritated mood Then if you drive on the central Expressway or wherever, you know something is a more easygoing road to go on You see that there's a relationship cause and effect relationship and you see what that causality is and the way that decisions why decisions can arise for our life from mindfulness practice is Becoming aware of what the cause and effect relationship is between what we do with what we do So it's not just simply recognizing that now I'm angry and I'm tired or now I'm happy and I'm joyful but noticing I Drove in 101 And that's really difficult for me and I ended up being irritated So you say oh, maybe it's useful not to drive on 101 and to choose some other route So see and cause and effect relationship and this is very important in Buddhism because in Buddhism There's no external authority for making a decision about how you live your life Buddhism doesn't have a God which says, you know, this is the way it should be and Buddhism doesn't have a tradition that says listen to the tradition. This is the way you should live your life Rather what Buddhism offers you is a tools to help you notice in yourself What is the cause and effect relationship when you do some things? So you might make some mistakes for a little bit But after a while you learn and you say this is if I do this this is this Makes me more open and more compassionate and if I do this I've learned that it closes me up and makes me less compassionate So you choose the things that help you become more open and more compassionate But noticing also the patterns between things And one of the patterns they talk about is what's called The tradition it's called the knots usually translated into English as the fetters But the literal Buddhist word is in the knots and this is about the place where we get knotted up There can be you can see a flower and If you be aware of seeing and then we can enter into a relationship based on that scene We want the flower And straw notes your neighbor's prize rose and they're gonna take it to the fair and Saturday and but you just you know You can't think can't stop thinking about how you want that rose for your you have the perfect base for it, right? So that's a fetter you've got you can even even tied up with together with the rose with the flower So it isn't simply seeing but there's also a relationship you formed with the seeing So we become aware of those two things the relationship that we form with experience and experience We see how those two are different things It's very interesting you do that for all the different senses you can go for example down I don't know where you go, but you can go down, you know Stanford Shopping Center and look in the windows and notice when you notice you look at all the windows and notice when you're You get it yet when he's not Know when you kind of you know, there's a little bit more than just kind of looking at everything evenly but when you get caught And it can be with anything any of the sense doors sounds tastes touches Noticing noticing what our relationship is to the experience we're having It's a very important area for developing wisdom and compassion and understanding And I just underlined the word compassion It's very important to be very Compassionate to yourself and if you can't be compassionate to yourself then Be compassionate with your inability to be compassionate Or at least be forgiving Or at least accept it or If you can't do any of that just try to be as mindful as you can yes We define it differently in different situations I believe but I think compassion towards oneself you see your foibles and stuff and your difficulties is I Guess maybe another word that's somewhat related. It's not synonymous by any means is forgiveness being forgiving Recognizing recognizing that there's suffering here and Feeling feeling somehow when you feel compassion for someone else you kind of feel you empathize with their suffering You feel their suffering in some way and that feeling somebody else's suffering is compassion In Buddhism there's often a feeling there's an added little element to compassion The not only is the feeling of someone's else compassion, but always hoping that that's feeling someone else is suffering But hoping that that suffering gets alleviated So compassion for oneself is to have some kind of sense on suffering and and feel that this is maybe Human condition and just like you feel compassion for someone else and want them to feel better you do it for yourself But also it's very if you're forgiving forgiving to yourself It's very hard to be human being and we do so hard on ourselves So can we forgive ourselves and allow ourself? It's also related to the word acceptance Can you accept yourself as someone has this foible or has this tendency? As softening about softening of the heart around this experience So you hate yourself? Can you be so have compassion to yourself is to have a softening around the heart around this self-hate? That Maybe that's the best definition It's not getting rid of it, but putting softer on it I'm not gonna have a chance to say all things I want to talk about this evening But I thought it was nice to have the discussion and the questions and answers I thought that was rich and maybe more useful because it came from you directly and your concerns What I want to talk more about was how to integrate the meditation and mindfulness practice in the daily life much more And that's there seemed like an appropriate thing on the last day But then there's not that much time left and but The longest retreat that I did my phone's retreat was eight months long and And it wasn't just from 9 to 4 30 It was from 3 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night for eight months So that's kind of you know, maybe a little bit extreme but But you know is possible that's you know, it's one way to do the practice Yes, I'm it was pretty much silent. The only time I really talked was I had a 10 minute 15 minute interview with a teacher of most days No, there was a translator Yeah, I ain't That's another story. But in the middle of this experience About four months or something. So right in the middle I was ordained as a traditional monk So suddenly there was this flurry of relative activity And So I went through the ceremony and and And then I went back to my room where I was going to continue because I was mostly in my room by myself all this time and And I felt you know So I felt how frazzled I was and how completely bewildered I was with all this activity and I talked a little bit And so I went back to the teacher and said, you know This mindfulness practice is really great and I'm really enjoying it here practicing with you But I realized you know when I When I go back into my back to America and live my normal life It's a whole different event there. It's really complicated life and all these things I have to do and I'm gonna have to learn a lot and what other practices can I do? You know, what can you teach me? That's relevant to my daily life And he kind of looked at me kind of he was a very stern teacher. And so he looked at me really sternly glaringly and he said All you need is mindfulness It's all you need mindfulness that's all it is and that I Had I had I Had in my own mind made this idea that mindfulness was something only for his intensive meditation practice and nothing to do with my daily life and I think he was kind of disappointed in me because Mindfulness is about our whole life and as someone said any Thomas Burton a spiritual life is first of all a life it's about how you live your life and How do you bring awareness and sensitivity into all aspects of what we do? and I think that to some degree if you sit and practice every day you do formal meditation practice every day The spirit of mindfulness and awareness will begin penetrating into your rest of your activities and the stronger your meditation practice becomes the more you have this diffusion into the rest of your life and So I encourage you to sit every day sitting every day is very very powerful It's one of the best ways actually I feel to integrate the practice into our whole life Some people tend to go on There are many knows three way three kinds of students this one way of categorizing students One is a kind of student who only goes on intensive retreats and doesn't do any kind of daily sitting in between retreats They kind of party or whatever they do Whatever they do or get depressed more likely And And they go on intensive retreat and they had maybe have some very important experiences there. It's very useful for them And for some people that's that's what works best is just to go on retreats and some people they do that And not really what works for them, but that's one possibility the other possibility is just to meditate every day at home on a regular basis and That seems to work very well for a lot of people and some people like Kamala came a few weeks ago She didn't I was going to treat for a long time In my experience in my almost 20 20 years now of Regular meditation and knowing a lot about the meditators Probably the most significant and most powerful Effective meditation or mindfulness practices will have in your life is through having a daily sitting practice for most people for the majority of people It's kind of like if you go in retreat I Just live in Hawaii and in Hawaii when I first got there. We had these torrential downpours and When a first couple of ones I ran for cover because that's what you do in rains and After a while I realized you shouldn't have to Because it would rain for a minute or two this huge downpours and then the Sun would come out then your t-shirt would dry So you so no problem the teacher. They would dry really quickly I'd also live in places where there's been a lot of fog And we're like and if you walk through the whole city From one end to the other you don't even notice that fog is getting you wet It's kind of slowly soaking your clothes and the time you finally get your destination You completely soak through and it's gonna take a long time to dry out Going whenever on intensive retreat, it's kind of like going into a tropical downpour and it's temporary and you dry out quickly It's useful, but it's it's you kind of come back into normal situation much pretty quickly Sitting every day. It's kind of like going through the fog and don't even notice that you're getting wet Many times we don't even know that we don't even recognize anything's happening If you measure your meditation by what happens in one day or one week or one month It's not so useful. You should measure your meditation by Shouldn't even begin measuring your meditation the usefulness for the first six months of doing it. Just do it for six months Or a year or something Slowly and you might feel as immediate benefits But you probably if you do it for a couple of years you look back and say oh what I thought was the benefits initially That wasn't really what was important. It was something else was slowly developing and building It's kind of like the changes and the insights and the growth is incremental They certainly incrementally don't see it, but it's stable If you go on retreat and you have an intense experience, it's not so stable The best combination for almost everyone is to do both Is to do daily sitting practice and then occasionally have an experience of going on retreat retreats very useful and really help Stately sitting practice and in the deepening that happens even though it's temporary is very useful also So one of the ways in which you can just deepen your Your mindfulness practice and have it diffuse into the rest of your life is to do more formal sitting whether every day or on retreats and we do one day sittings here in Palo Alto pretty regularly and weekend sittings and there's longer sittings you can go for week-long sittings and ten day sittings and six-week sittings and And it might be a relief for you to know that the longest retreat you can have in America right now is three months But there's also all kinds of things you can do for cultivating a practice in daily life And I don't mean to be trite or simplistic or something, but There isn't the best way to think about it is that it's not a technique for doing that. Just you start paying attention Pay attention to what you're doing It's not a technique. It's just paying attention. It's paying attention to technique It's not you start paying attention how you do it you pay attention What's happening what's happening But you do it and it becomes a you do it and you do it and you do it and it starts becoming Muscle like a stronger and stronger and you find yourself living in the present more Noticing much more what's happening at present with your thoughts your feelings your emotions the situation around you However having said that I think was important to have said there are all kinds of things that you can do However having said that I think was important to have said there are all kinds of ways to help deepen and develop mindfulness through your life One way is Simplify your life If you do ten things at once chances are you're not gonna be very mindful of any of them if you do one thing at a time There's easier to be really mindful of what's going on there. So simplify your life do less You might find if you do less you'd be happier And you can be more present and you might find that being more present will bring more happiness And it's kind of is right The happiness of awareness is kind of elusive because you don't see awareness so much you can't see mindfulness You can see you know whether you have You can see whether you know, I don't know what's this you You have more material goods or you can see whether you've kind of done ten things that day and done all these different things But mindfulness is kind of invisible But with developing a mindfulness comes something that is much more valuable than all the kind of doings that we can do So simplify is very useful way doing one thing at a time is very useful One thing that's very useful in terms of developing mindfulness in the rest of our life is to Choose certain activities that are maybe five or ten minutes long and Say I'm gonna try these activities. I'm gonna be mindful of if you decide you can be mindful all the time You may get frustrated. It's not going to work so well, but but if you say well for five minutes I'm gonna be mindful these five minutes. I wash your dishes. I'm gonna be mindful I'm gonna turn off the radio and not talk to anybody just gonna be with the dishes or the ten minutes that I take a shower or they or the You know choose something you do that takes ten or fifteen minutes It's very nice to do something which is repetitive you do every day on a regular basis So you developing some familiarity with it? And as you develop familiarity your mindfulness can get stronger and stronger and you can understand yourself and relationship that better and better So you might for one week decide to do the dishes And the next week you might decide to do Every time you for all the laundry That's gonna be your mindfulness practice folding laundry and the next week It's going to be when you make when you make an eat breakfast imagine eating breakfast without reading the paper for a week And slowly you begin getting a sense of what it's like getting a feeling of what it's like to be mindful and It begins permeating your life much more Another thing which is very useful Is Associating yourself with other people who do mindfulness practice or do a spiritual practice It's very hard to do almost any spiritual practice alone, and it's certainly hard to do mindfulness practice alone And it's very hard if you've been doing mindfulness practice, and you have developed you're feeling a sense of deeper integrity from the mindfulness meditation And you want to try to express or cultivate that integrity in the rest of your life It's very useful to be associated with people who are doing the same thing So hanging out with people it's very useful to come and sit in a sitting group Come to a weekly meditation group, and there are a number of them around you can come and sit with us We sit all over people be sitting Thursdays The regular basis you can come sit with us on Mondays there are other sitting groups around on Wednesday evenings you can sit with the Zen people and it'll send Mountain View and You look around you'll find scoop to sit with It's also very useful from time to time to Discuss your practice and your questions with a teacher and One of the best places to do that is to go in one-day sittings Where teachers are usually available to answer some questions or come to come come out if I'm in on the local teachers to come Come to these Thursday or Monday sittings and ask me questions before after if I ask for questions you can ask questions Or you going other retreats with The collective of teachers and I'm part of we teach retreats all over in spirit rock of a new and different places in Santa Cruz And go check out other teachers and get their perspective and ask questions from them Some people have cues they use throughout their daily life to encourage them to pay attention And once you that I like is going through door frames because when you go through a door frame you're going to a new place Everything you've grown a new place or something and so things have changed. So it's pretty it's a good time to pay attention So whenever I go I don't always do it regulates a practice But there was a period of time where whenever I went through a door frame that was a cue Oh kind of stop mentally and bring my awareness into the present moment What's happening Some people do it when the phone rings and the phone rings and they spend they don't answer the phone right away And they let it ring two or three times or four times or whatever and use it You may even hold hold the phone and just sit there with the phone be with your breathing Just a view of your breathing two or three cycles of the breath Can be very soothing very settling and It's kind of a pleasure in the midst of a busy life Just seems like a simple simple and Generous simple kind of pleasure to give yourself two cycles of breath So you can choose different different cues If you will live or work near the train the train every time the train goes by That's the time to pay attention Follow your breath a little bit Follow your breath a little bit There was a story of Ramdas having a meditation group in New York City on top of a fire station and Every once in a while to be a fire and the sirens would go off in the building We kind of explode sounds and the whole of these engines would turn on and the building would shake and and that first all the meditators This is terrible distraction the practice and all that and then Ramdas said something like no rather than thinking of a distraction Think of something that you can use in your meditation practice that there is a Hindu practice where they're trying to raise the Kundalini So he said imagine your Kundalini is being awoken Your energy and your energy and so and so they so after a while they really got into it And they couldn't wait until there's a fire in New York City So anyway any point you can use anything there's nothing nothing outside the mindfulness practice everything is mindful everything is fuel for mindfulness practice Go ahead turn on the lights, please What are the middle ones Okay, that's good. I think that's the right one. No, that's too much Yeah What have some of you guys learned About integrating the practice in daily life some of you might have some experience or some thoughts about it What do you find useful? In bringing awareness into your life. Yes Walking Can we really talk about Just being aware when I'm walking and weird Uh-huh So not all the time but just at long nights I'll just remember I'm walking So so walking has become your cue kind of to pay and we walk a lot so it's beautiful Yes That's what I started to feel before I was doing things a certain way, but now I stop and think There's so many options It's kind of fun to sit there and think about it and feel the truth and not destroy it Automatically, yeah In some ways life becomes richer because if you if you slow down and be aware for a moment before acting You realize the presence is pregnant with possibilities And the possibilities are available to you then Yeah, I think also develop being like a witness all of them, you know, and writing stuff really into it, you know anger, whatever I could step back and Look at yourself, you know, so you're working yourself up. It's not that important. Uh-huh. And then just let go it's not easy And it takes a while but it's Developing that witness This game just comes from this It reminds me of something a quote that I read recently about And he asked you about self-hate Um If you can't love yourself Then at least love the eyes that see your hate And then you can laugh at yourself, yeah Great yeah I think when I walked the dog said he was twice a day With wine that there were times before I was doing this once very present Because I do it every single day She said just Do one thing at a time and then I can remind myself to say just walk the dog And then I can stay at the park and look at the dog instead of thinking about And what's the difference so By the end of your walk with time to get home. What's it? What's how is your state of being different? Uh Those two options It's really different when I can really stay there makes the time seem much longer and fuller And feel more relaxed And even the efficient Well what efficient anyway That's that's a great lesson do less so you can do more But you can't want to do it I have a practice of whenever I feel harried and I have a lot of things to do and I can't do it all I'm rushing around I'll stop Just stop just don't do anything for a while and then start again And it seems like it You know the moment you just think that's impossible to stop, you know But it's it's just of course you can stop The world's not going to fall apart When I worked at it in the monastery in the kitchen And uh server for lunch was always very hectic because in the zen monastery The food has to be served up exactly at 12 noon On the second because it is you know zen monasteries are kind of anal about The schedule Well, you know, no, no, you have to it's all it's all choreographs like a dance the whole zen monaster Wasn't fair to say but exactly but it's more like the whole zen monaster is like a dance And if you know if a dance, you know a choreographed dance the timings are important, right? So the kitchen activity is part of the choreograph part of the dance So if you don't if you if you know if you're not there at the right time to catch your partners flying through the air You know there's consequences, right? So there's 40 people up in the meditation hall Doing the help us dance with their food and their bowls and everything and they expect the food to show up at that particular moment so So the pressure, you know have the food ready was you know, and it was always a great flurry But every day five minutes before serve up We had to stop and chant for a minute The whole kitchen stop what they're doing getting from the altar and chant I couldn't believe it You Know it was a struggle, you know Like I meant it for a while I was a kitchen manager, you know And I was responsible more responsible than anybody and it was the temptation to say let's forget it today So strong And and for some reason there was always time to take a minute But now it was never a problem To stop stop and look around And I realized that One of the things I should have done in this introductory course is talked about mindfulness a walking meditation And I didn't What probably what i'll do is Next week we're not having our regular meetings here. However, one of the Quakers and the Quakers have invited Um a meditation teacher from oregon Who is meeting with treats I think next weekend Um to come and use this they want to use the place during our times and they want to kind of harmonize with us So they're doing at the same time as we are and they want to have not the very long meditation But short meditation and I talked to this teacher and he he he pulls apparently Many different spiritual practices from many different spiritual teachings. He's not Just a mindfulness teacher, but he knows something about vipassana. I was going to give a talk. He said it's uh, very compatible with or Could be considered a mindfulness talk So I don't know him so I can't exactly recommend him, but it seems like a very nice man on the phone and So it might be very nice for you to come and see Um, and they're going to run it pretty much the way we usually do it and um so And then we'll continue our regular uh thursdays The week after that and what that means is that we'll we start at seven Uh for the regular kind of beginners night start at seven and i'll give someone will give usually I or someone else Some very short instructions to start the meditation like for two or three minutes for new people And we'll sit for half an hour And then we'll have 45 minutes of the talk and discussion and then we'll end with 15 minutes of sitting and that's very nice and and So we'll do that Until we do the next introductory course, which is um, I think september october so And so what I think i'll do is one of these one of those sessions in june one of those thursdays in june I'll give a talk on walking meditation and instructions and I can't tell you when but Some of you will be here and some of you won't And um So for any of you who uh missed the first couple of times when I talked about uh, Donna or donations
