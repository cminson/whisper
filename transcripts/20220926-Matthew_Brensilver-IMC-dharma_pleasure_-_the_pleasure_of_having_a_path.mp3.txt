 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So it's good to sit with you, good to be with you. It's always easier to say hello and welcome after we all sit. It's a deeper greeting in a way. So I'm your substitute teacher this week, and I will be with you these days. And I'll actually also do tomorrow night and Thursday night do a Zoom session, an optional Zoom session for a half hour. I'll post the info at the end for, you know, we can sit for a few minutes and have any questions or dialogue. So, yeah, I have this this friend, long time practitioner and, and, and he is always working actively on something in his practice as if he's like, in the new phase of like intense excitement about Dharma practice, he's just like always there actively contemplating something. And whenever, whenever we talk, it's like he's living in a Dharma talk, giving it to himself, then giving it to anyone who will listen really. And he's extremely persuasive. One time we smoke and remember this conversation and, and he said you know we're, we're always saying let go we're always saying, open up to a Nietzsche open up to unreliability uncertainty comprehend Duke comprehend suffering. And he said it's too much, it's too much. We need to teach pleasure. That's what we need to teach. And. And so this week, the theme is varieties of of Dharma pleasure. Now, Dharma pleasure is weird pleasure, in a way, but it's pleasure nonetheless. Pleasure is not the same as satisfaction. And I really associate ordinary pleasure with actually strengthening the patterns of craving of craving, seeking relief, finding some kind of brief seclusion from the pain of craving, but then the cycle continuing. Whereas, maybe we say Dharma pleasures are distinctive in so far as they don't create thirst, they actually satiate. They are pleasures that leave peace in their wake. So that's the theme. And today, the pleasure of, of having a path, the pleasure of having a path. We're, we're all sometimes say we're all philosophers of happiness, and we, we've all asked the question many times implicitly. What is the good life as a philosopher might ask what is a good life. And we're all, in a sense, tentatively living our answer. And as a kid, I was without really knowing it, but just looking back, you know, retrospect, I was asking this question, and was kind of picking up and ruling out many different philosophies of happiness and sense of like, could this work? No. Could that work? No. I was so sensitive to suffering. And with so little equanimity and I was just like trying out what could work, what could work. And my conclusion was that I didn't know. And my conclusion was that adults, the adults didn't know that much about happiness either. And I kind of waded into this path years later with a great deal of skepticism, so I'm unsure that this had anything new to offer really. And many of the, the tears that I would shed in the early years of practice were tears of relief. And they were the relief of this. And I found a path. Not the path, not the path that everyone must walk, not the one true path, but I found a path. This is a path for me. And there is so much relief in that and a sense of like, my heart kind of interlocking with some vision of happiness. Very soothing. The philosopher Nietzsche said, one who has a why can bear almost any how. One who has a why can bear almost any how. And we need to be convinced of our why, but when we are convinced, the why, wisdom, and love, when we do become convinced, the rest is just kind of details. The rest of the path, how I'm doing, where it's going, what I'll learn, how much I'll achieve, details. We have our why. And I'm really alluding to, in a sense, the arising of faith, a certain kind of the pleasure of faith. Vaclav Havel said, hope is not the conviction. Something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it turns out. And there's this kind of faith. We relax, we relax. We're not compulsively looking for evidence that we're on the right track. You know, that sense of just like hanging around within our experience, just looking, am I doing this right? Is this right? Should I be doing something else? Should I be that kind of energetic state that starts to fade? The absence of faith, we could say, is a kind of this wobble, a certain kind of ambivalence of always looking for evidence that we're doing it the right way, or trying to sort out our place on the path, or comparing ourself to others, rather than just actually feeling one's own belonging within the Dharma. And the absence of this kind of faith leads us to a sense of like grappling in the dark and never sure exactly what's trustworthy, where to look for data, you know, where to validate what we're doing. That fades, that fades. There's a pleasure in our faith. We stop guessing if we're getting it right because we know we're just going to keep going, exploring, learning, growing. And the pleasure of this kind of faith is, it's a particular pleasure. I'm no fundamentalist, I'm really almost reverential about the permanent possibility of being wrong. But at the same time, my mind hasn't wobbled about the path for a long time. And what that feels like is a very abiding confidence in wisdom and love. Not more than that, just a confidence in that. This is Ken McLeod. Few times in my life, I've been in difficult situations, situations in which I could not see any way forward. In my morning practice sessions I would, to the best of my ability, rest in the confusion that swirled inside of me. I suppose it was the years of effort that made that resting possible even though all those years, those efforts had seen paltry and ineffective. When I could rest in the confusion, it grew quiet and dark, the quiet of a dark night with no moon or stars. When I rested in that darkness, a clarity would sometimes arise and with it a sense of direction. How or what discern that clarity or that direction, I don't know, but both were there. The clarity didn't illumine anything. It didn't make anything in the situation clearer. The rest indicated a direction. Where that direction led or what I would encounter, I had no idea. There was a direction, nothing more. One of the pleasures of this path is we have a direction. We have a direction. And even when the confusion swirls, there's solace in a direction. There's solace in a kind of faith in wisdom and love. That that will matter, that will matter, no matter what unfolds, that will matter. So I offer this for your consideration. And we'll keep going tomorrow. New strange pleasures of Dharma practice. Okay. Thank you. Thank you all. Yeah. And I'll post the Zoom info here for a little bit tomorrow and Thursday. Let's see. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, folks. Yeah, I wish you a good day. And yeah, nice to see your names here in the chat. I'll see you in the morning. Yeah. Okay.
