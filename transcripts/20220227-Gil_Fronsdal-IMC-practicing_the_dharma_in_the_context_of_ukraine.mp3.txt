The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Hello to everyone attending for online. Happy to have you.
So, from time to time, all too often, there are current events which are so big that it feels that to not address them as part of the Dharma talk shouldn't be done.
I can't ignore them. That this Dharma practice that we do is a practice to be present for what's happening in the world, to be witnesses and to care.
Some things are so big that they should be named and see where we go.
And so, the fighting in the Ukraine, I think has affected me this way. I don't think I could not talk about it in some way.
But what do we say? How do we understand this?
There was an earthquake in Haiti last summer and that was such a clear event that through the YouTube channel in the house here at IMC, we raised over $30,000 to dedicate to a wonderful nonprofit, partners in health.
And that was clear. But with Ukraine, there's so much not known yet. So unknown how this is evolving and what's going to be needed and what's happening.
So in terms of responding to what needed there from people like us, not so obvious to me. But I think being caring and concerned for the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia, a lot of the ordinary people in Russia are going to suffer.
And maybe much of the world is going to suffer. We don't know how this is going to expand. Will it spill out beyond the borders of the Ukraine?
And so we're kind of just at least watching now and seeing and hoping that the people who have some role in addressing this are doing it wisely and carefully and for the long term.
It's hard to know that. It's easy to second guess. It's easy to have opinions. But it's hard to really know what's going on and what is consequential and what's going to make a difference.
9-11 happened. It's a community. We actually had a special meeting. I think on a Tuesday evening or Wednesday evening. So we could just meet and process it as a community.
And then the second invasion of Iraq and the invasion of Afghanistan. And these kinds of things going on and on. You know, they've gone down through history. There's been war. People attacking each other.
And it seems like most times when it happens, people say it's different this time. And this time Ukraine, it's different because it's always different. It's always the same.
In some ways it's not news that these things happened. It's old. And in a bigger perspective, this is what human life is about.
This is the time of the Buddha. There was war. The Buddha died around him as he was getting old and close to his death.
He was cognizant of it. The countries of his area were getting ready to fight and go to war to each other for each other.
He witnessed fortifications being built on his last travels before he died.
So what does it like to be one of the great champions of peace and a peaceful way, an ethical way of living, a nonviolent way of living?
And dedicated his life to that and then to watch around him as he's old to watch that violence getting ready to start.
So here we are with this. And I don't know what to say. Do you know what to say?
I could offer opinions, but you're not here for my opinions. Exactly. So what do we say?
One of the things I'd like to say is that this is a time, as if there's ever not a time, but this is a time to stay close to the Dharma.
And the word Dharma includes much more than Buddhism.
To say, to go close to Buddhism, I think, would almost be, I don't know, I was going to say, an insult to Buddhism, because Buddhism is not about itself.
Buddhism, the Dharma is about the discovery and expression of a heart that has no conflict, a heart which is at peace with itself, a heart which doesn't cause any self harm.
And one of the ways that self harm is caused is by harming others.
I can't get away from it.
One of the definitions for evil, a word which I seldom use, but many Buddhist texts and English translations of the suttas use the word evil as if it's there in the suttas.
And whether it is or not is a scholarly question, whether it's appropriate to translate that way.
But one of the definitions of evil is evil is when the mind turns on itself to harm others.
The mind turns on itself to harm others.
And what this implies is certain actions of evil harms the person who's evil.
Certain expressions of hostility harms the person who's hostile.
And there's a jataka tale, these old Buddhist fables that are composed at some point.
And there was a donkey who is being led to slaughter, I guess for meat or something.
And when the donkey realizes it's going to be slaughtered, the donkey's first reaction is to laugh.
But then after laughing for a while, then it starts crying.
And after it cries for a while, the slaughterer says to the donkey, what's going on with you?
I'm about to kill you, but first you laugh and then you cry.
Explain yourself.
And the donkey said, well, for 500 lifetimes I was reborn as a donkey.
And this will be the last time. It's so great. I'm so happy. I'm done with it.
Like he exhausted his karma of being reborn 500 times as a donkey.
So he's laughing apparently. He's happy.
But why were you crying?
Well, the reason I was reborn as a donkey for 500 times was I slaughtered a donkey.
500 lifetimes ago.
And now you are going to slaughter me and you'll be reborn as a donkey for 500 lives.
So, you know, the teachings of karma is that what you do comes back to you in some form or other.
And the self-harm is deeply, you know, we harm others, we harm ourselves.
So who's harming each other right now?
And how are they harming themselves?
So looking at Ukraine and Russia, I almost don't want to answer that question.
I have that principle in my mind, concern.
But the place I want to apply it the most is to ourselves.
How do we respond to all this?
Because unless we can do something directly, and if we can, please help.
But unless you can do something directly, perhaps peace begins with yourself.
Perhaps that's the person that you can have the most impact on.
And if you can't, if you don't know how to be peaceful, is there any hope for the Ukraine?
If we don't know how to resolve our own inner conflict and challenges, who can?
Are we expecting other people to do it?
Friends of mine just went to Spirit Rock to participate in the month-long retreat there.
And one person was concerned that it was the wrong time to go,
because what's happening in the world, the international stage is so big and such a big concern,
and this seemed to be, maybe, the person didn't say this,
but maybe selfish to go off and do meditation like this, you know.
And I said to the opposite, unless you can, you know, do something for the world directly,
this is actually meditating is actually one of the greatest responses you can do,
because this path of meditation that we're offering in Buddhism is a path to get into the bottom of our own peace,
to discover our capacity for living in non-conflict in a wise and generous and supportive way.
How not to hate, how not to get angry, how not to be hostile, how not to be greedy,
how not to have lust for power and money in such a way they were harming people all around.
How not to live in delusion? It's a powerful path that's really uprooting the attachments,
the clinging, the grasping, the fears that are kind of like barbs in the heart,
or closed down the heart, or constricted or, you know, limited.
It creates the kind of heart that the good heart we have is lost.
And when we're not connected deeply to ourselves, then it's our surface reactivity which gets the upper hand.
And surface reactivity is usually not so wise.
Reactivity that, you know, anger, for example, reacting angrily to the world is usually not that wise.
The consequences are not that good.
Sometimes they accomplish what we want in the short term.
But in the long term, do they really help us live in a better world, a better situation?
And I've said this big story before, but please allow me to say it again,
because it's such a powerful for me lesson that, you know, I tried to live wisely,
parent wisely with my sons when they were young.
And sometimes they were challenging for me with my parenting skills.
And it felt like, you know, it was hopeless unless I kind of used my strong voice.
I never hit them or anything, but I never was in danger of it.
But sometimes I use a strong voice which was done consciously, carefully,
because I didn't know what else to do.
And like, you have to stop what you're doing and you cannot do that anymore.
And it was effective.
But then one day I heard my older son use the same voice to his one-and-a-half-year-old brother.
And I said, what have I done?
I accomplished what I wanted to do in stopping the behavior,
but what was the influence, what a horrible conditioning, influence example
I gave to a small child that it's okay to do this.
So he could turn around and do it to his son, his brother.
What does brother learn?
And then it goes on, right?
From one person to another, one generation to the other.
And they learned somehow at their early age, this is okay.
But what are the consequences?
What are the consequences of invading another country?
The consequences of certainly the people who get killed and died.
When I think of war and people getting killed, I not only think about the people who get killed,
but the ripple of their family and their friends and their neighborhood.
And it goes on and on and on.
And some of this suffering goes on for decades and decades.
In my family, I grew up very much under the influence.
I was born after World War II, but I grew up with it as a very strong presence in my family life.
My parents, my grandparents, my parents-in-law, and their parents
all were kind of deeply affected by World War II and the violence.
So much so that it still affects me to this day.
I mean, some of the horrible things that happened to some of them touches me very, very deeply.
Especially because I have two sons, the older one, who knows firsthand, not firsthand,
knows firsthand conversations with his grandfather.
Actually, when he was 14, he interviewed my grandfather and did a little video of interviewing him
about his, my grandfather-in-law's experiences in the concentration camps in Germany,
where he was a prisoner.
And, you know, it's 70 years ago now or so, and more.
And so it's still alive.
So these things go on and on.
The things that happened around World War II still are alive in communities.
Things that happened in civil war are still alive in this country, in communities.
So, and I would argue that, if I may, that the violence of the American Revolutionary War
is still rippling, affecting this country, coursing through it in a way that maybe we don't directly see,
but I think that the violence of that time is still in effect here.
So it goes on and on, these things.
And so I think about that ripple effect of violence and what causes this to do.
So in Buddhism, there's a very strong, in the teachings of the Buddha,
a very strong repeated emphasis on non-harming, non-violence, on not killing.
The first precept is not to kill.
And you don't have to go very far in the teachings of the Buddha
to find all kinds of direct teachings about the value of radical non-harming, radical non-violence,
even to the extent that if someone's harming you, he says, do not give in to harm.
He does say that you can strike back, if someone attacks you, in order to escape.
So you don't have to just stand there and passively beat up.
But there is this radical, strong idea of non-violence.
And so some people, some kings in ancient India, interpreted this, that they were going to have their armies stand down
and not have violence, not to have capital punishment, and all these kinds of things.
And I've had adult life where I've felt, ever since I was about probably 18,
dedicated to non-violence.
And it was relevant for me because when I was 18, I was of the age that could be drafted for the Vietnam War.
So it was very alive that I would be called up and had to go and fight the war across the Pacific.
And so I had to kind of contend with that.
So war was really alive and present, and what do I do if I get drafted?
And so I was not going to fight. I knew that I would not go.
I'm from Norway, originally, and I went back there a few times.
I wasn't drafted because my draft number was so low at that point.
So I never didn't have to go. But a few years later, a couple of years later, I went to live in Norway and go back for a year.
And there I was surprised to discover that there was a movement.
You could be a conscientious objector in Norway, a mandatory military service for men back then.
But you could be a conscientious objector.
And if you were, you didn't have to do the one-year military service that all males had to do.
You had to do two years of public service.
A friend of mine spent almost two years working in a hospital in order to do the equivalent to support the country, I guess.
But some of the conscientious objectors in Norway protested.
And they said that they knew about Russia being right nearby.
Russia, you know, at that time, was still kind of pushing the edges of the border, kind of seeing, you know, testing things, I guess.
And so people were worried about Russia in Norway in the mid-1970s.
And so some of the conscientious objectors who didn't want to become soldiers and fight wanted to be able to defend the country if it was attacked.
And they were asking for training in civil disobedience, training in nonviolent resistance.
And they were lobbying to try to get that to happen.
I don't know if it ever happened in Norway, but it has happened now in Sweden and Finland.
They have trainings now. I don't know how extensive it is, but they train some people there in the techniques of nonviolent civil disobedience
and nonviolent resistance.
And there is nothing to bring it up in the following up talking about how important nonviolence is in the teachings of the Buddha, non-harming.
Too often, when people hear that, they say, well, that just means we have to passively allow people to attack us.
And no self-defense is allowed. You're not allowed to fight back.
And out through the centuries, Buddhist kings and Buddhist countries have justified standing armies and fighting defensively
because defending yourself is allowed in the Dharma, they say.
Just not attacking people, not being the aggressor.
But how do you know who's the aggressor and who's the defender?
Right now, I think the president of Russia, Putin, thinks of himself as a defender.
At least that's what he says, and he keeps referring to him being defensive.
But for many of us, it looks like he's the aggressor. So where do you decide that?
So if the justification for war is that it's the only way to defend yourself,
then the Buddhist principle of nonviolence is conditional, it's situational.
And in which situations do we live by it and in which don't we live by it?
When I was also around 19 or so, I came very much under the influence of a particular scholar in the United States,
an academic named Gene Sharp. And Gene Sharp wrote this wonderful book. He was a scholar of nonviolent civil disobedience efforts around the world.
The nonviolent way and resistance by which people resisted successfully dictators and authoritarian regimes and things like that.
And he has a three-volume book on nonviolence that goes through, it was kind of eye-opening for me to see.
He goes through chronicles and lists all the different techniques, sophisticated techniques that are used by people who engage in this kind of work
and how so many times it's been successful, and sometimes it hasn't.
It was interesting, he points out that Ahmad Magandhi is the great exemplar of nonviolence, civil disobedience.
He was inspired by civil disobedience in Russia in 1905.
Nicholas II, who was a Tsar of Russia at that time, there were massive public strikes and demonstrations, nonviolent ones, on the part of the demonstrators,
that eventually forced the Tsar to create the first parliament in Russia, the Duma.
And then he had to contend with the members of parliament. They shared the power and they continued that way.
So Ahmad Magandhi saw that, and he said, wow, that can be done. And that inspired him in his work.
So it's interesting how important Russia happened in Russia, as an example, given what's happening now.
In the Ukraine, there was the Orange Revolution, about 2004. And that was a student-led movement of nonviolence
that brought down the Russian-supported president of Ukraine, who probably was rigged elections and a lot of corruption.
But those students in the Orange Revolution in 2004, they were reading Gene Sharp.
Because he was one of the people I know who spent a lot of time as an academic, writing and describing the techniques and the methods of nonviolent civil disobedience.
And he says, people will die with nonviolent civil disobedience.
Some people say, well, it doesn't work, because if you put yourself on the front line, they'll just kill you. They will, maybe.
But if you put soldiers on the front lines, they'll die too.
His argument, fewer people die with civil disobedience than with armed struggle.
So I say all this, that in Buddhism, this central ethical tenet is nonviolence, nonharming, not killing.
It's possible that that strategy, that way of living, should not be done naively.
That this is something we bring our wisdom to, our intelligence to, our reflections to, to really engage and think about how can do this?
What's the practical way? What's the wise way? What's the active way to do this?
Too many people want to defend themselves, and their first strategy is to get a gun in this country.
Are they really safer? The instinct is, I tell you, make yourself safe, but is that really a safe way?
What about doing their research, their reflection, and look at all the alternative ways to become safe?
Are there other ways to become safe than having a gun? Are there better ways of becoming safe than having a gun?
However, it takes research and intelligence and engagement in this process.
And not many people want to do that.
We want to do the instinctual so we can get on with our lives.
So here we are with Ukraine, in this major event in this world.
There's so much stress these days with the pandemic and all kinds of other things and politics.
It's almost like the more stress there is, the more stress it produces.
The more people feel the stress of it all, the worry of it all, the fear of it all, the more they take on stress.
And then when we're stressed, it's a recipe for more reactivity.
It's a recipe for anger and for fear and for dysfunctional ways of responding.
With too much stress, if we don't not careful with our stress, we add to the stress in the world.
So this practice that we do is a revolutionary thing. It's a radical thing to do.
It's finding a way to not contribute to the stress of the societies of the world.
It's a radical way of being someone who does the opposite.
Someone who's almost like a healthy sink where the stresses of the world can come into us.
We experience it and know it and are present for it.
And somehow we can process it and empty it and de-stress ourselves from it.
We can go through the world committed to not adding to the stress of the world.
Committed not to add to the violence of the world, to the anger of the world.
To do our work is such an important thing what we're doing.
Someone has to do it.
Some people have to show everyone else that it's possible to become free of these instinctual forces
that one way or the other contribute to causing more harm and more harm.
And responds to harm with more harm and passes it on from generation to generation.
Someone has to do this work.
And there are people who are doing it all over the world.
We're not alone in doing it.
But I think this is what this practice we're doing is about most importantly.
And I would say that the reason I'm here today and because I'm here, you're here today.
IMC is here in Edward City today. One of the causes for why this whole YouTube thing is happening
and we have video camera happening today.
One of the conditions for all this is because I believe, I believed when I was quite young,
that this work of finding peace in oneself, becoming free in oneself of clinging and reactivity
is a way of responding to war in this world.
My whole first interest in Buddhism was in response to the Vietnam War.
My whole reason to dedicate my life to Buddhism was because of witnessing from a distance
the violence of war in the early 80s and being deeply impacted by it.
War has been part of my life and something I'm conscious of and aware of
and never had the misfortune of being in the presence of it really, hardly at all.
But it's part of my whole life experience that it's influenced me
and it's part of the reason why I'm dedicated to be an arpa teacher and to do all this.
For me, this is not only stress reduction so we can go back to work and live stress-free at work.
This is a revolutionary activity if we go to the depths of our heart and really find a way to uproot
the deepest attachments we have and we become peacemakers for this world.
And maybe it's just locally, maybe it's just for our neighbors.
But how does it ripple out from your neighbors?
Who do you know? You don't know who you touch and how this goes out and out and out into the world.
Peace begins with ourselves. If you want a peaceful world, start with yourself.
Find out how you can be at peace. Find out how you can walk in peace.
How you can speak in peaceful ways. How you can relate to others in ways that they feel safe
and feel like there's another way and learn how to be in conflict wisely.
We're not going to not be in conflict with people.
I think that's not part of what life is about. But can we be in conflict peacefully with them?
Can we be in conflict in a sense where the motivation for how we are with the conflict
is cooperation, not competition, not to win and they lose.
But can the motivation be how can we both win?
There will be conflict. Conflict doesn't have peace. It does not mean the absence of conflict.
Peace is the absence of harm.
So that's not knowing what to do for the Ukraine at this juncture.
I feel like we do the other great thing for the Ukraine.
At least let's do our practice.
Stay close to the Dharma. Stay close to the practice.
Let what's happening in the world be an inspiration to evoke a wonderful aspiration
that this practice is so important, so valuable.
It is a way of responding to the world to happily know that you have something precious in this practice.
Maybe there are ways you can give yourself to this practice a little bit more
that will feel like a reason that you know is a response to what's happening in the world.
You're not ignoring it.
You're responding in this powerful way by becoming a person who is a beacon for peace.
Isn't that great for all of us to do?
So those are my thoughts today.
Wouldn't it be great if this is the last time I give a talk and responding to war in this world?
I have hope that that's the case, though that's probably naive.
One of the reasons I have some hope is that as much as we're seeing fighting going on in Ukraine,
we're seeing right currently at least the international community responding non-violently and economically.
Who knows?
Maybe it'll teach us that war is old-fashioned and war doesn't really work.
And we have to find other ways to work through our conflicts than through war.
So I have high hopes for the sanctions that this will be seen as a non-violent way of responding to aggression.
And it'll make a difference.
So may we all find ways to be non-violent in our lives and support that in the world around us.
And if you want to learn more, read some of the works of Gene Sharp.
Here's a one.
So, thank you.
