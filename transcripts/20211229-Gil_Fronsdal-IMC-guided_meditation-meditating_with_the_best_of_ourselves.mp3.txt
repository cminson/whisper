So hello everyone and here we are at our meditation session and it's possible to
approach meditation as simple stress reduction as simply a way of coming
calming oneself down. It's also possible to approach meditation as being kind of
entering into a sacred realm, a very special realm of life. Conditions are
very special that we sit down to meditate and that it's an opportunity in the
quiet and the stillness of meditation to meet our moment moment experience in a
very different way than we usually do to to see it as kind of an extraordinary
thing we're doing in meditating. That is a simple ordinary thing. Sometimes if
a person has meditated for a long time it becomes kind of habituated maybe or
has become kind of normal but it's also can be seen as a very special thing
where we bring the best of ourselves to it. That we bring that qualities of care,
love, generosity, kindness to whatever happens in this uninterrupted ability to
avoid some of the mind states that undermine us. Of course those mind
states will arise but it isn't so much so it's not like we can't have them but
the issue is how we meet it, how we are aware of it. That's the special, that's
what's unique and to see that as a meditation as a time to experiment
with you know kind of some of the best of us come forward to meet our
experience. Wisdom, non-reactivity, non-hostility, non-greed, really it's a
special time to experiment, to explore, stepping into this sacred realm to meet
and it makes a huge difference when we see it that way. That it's more than just
being calm, it's developing, strengthening ways of being that are not to
override anything or deny the challenges we have but how do we meet those
challenges. So to assume a meditation posture and it's really useful to give
some attention to the posture that you take, the posture that you think will
support you to bring the best of who you are, the clearest attention to the
moment here, maybe sitting up a little bit straighter if you're sitting and then
lowering your gaze so you may be looking down at the floor and then gently
closing your eyes if that's comfortable and taking a few long slow deep breaths
breathing in deeply and relaxing as you exhale
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continuing to relax
layers and layers of tension that we carry in our body, in our mind, our hearts
and start at the outer layers and just as you exhale soften, release
letting go
the muscles of the face, the shoulders, the belly
and then settling down into your breathing in the simplicity of breathing
very gently bring an attitude of attention that is free of a version free
of greed, free of self-concern, self-judgment that is undermining
simple awareness through which a sense of kindness can be there as you meet
every experience, every in-breath and out-breath
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to dedicate the benefits of the
meditation to spread from you out into the world the ways you speak today, act
today, work today may it be that whatever benefits from the meditation
we've done is for the welfare and happiness of others as well as for
ourselves may all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be
peaceful and may all beings be free
