 So today, this expression that I think has become somewhat popular came to mind a little bit. I thought of starting there. There's an expression, I think it's kind of a recent thing called thinking outside the box. You know the story? And it's a nice idea. The meditation practice is kind of like that, except it's, we don't want to say thinking outside the box. We want to say functioning outside the box is better. And there's a number of stories that can illustrate this idea of functioning or thinking outside the box. Maybe you heard some of these but there's one, I think it's a Sufi story of a king who decides he wants to find out who the wisest person is in the whole country. And he wants that person to become the Minister of State or something. So he gathers together three of the wisest people in the kingdom and he locks them in a tower, the top of the tower. He puts them in this room and shows them there's padlock, big padlock on the inside of the door into the room where they're going to be inside this room. And he says, you know, put you in this room and close the door and you have to figure out how to get out of here, how to get out, you know, how to get out. And there's no windows in this tower, just this door, this big padlock on it. And you have to figure out how you're going to get out. And there's three of you and if none of you figure it out, I'm going to kill all of you. If whoever figures it out will become the great Minister of State and have lots of wealth and the other two will get politely retired to some country or state, but happily ever after. So the pressure was on and they had three days to figure out how to get out of this room. So two of them promptly went to work and started studying this padlock and looking at different angles and looking at all the numbers and kept doing calculations and listening for the clicks and trying to use all their intelligence, trying to figure out how this padlock works to see how they could get the padlock to open. And the third one just sat there in the corner and just kind of napped and, you know, napped and napped some more and just took it easy and look at the door and look through the door. And then just before the three days were up, the first two couldn't have figured out anything about how to open up the padlock. And the third one finally got up and just pushed on the door and it opened. The padlock had nothing to do with the door being open or closed. It was hanging from the knob and nothing to do. So, you know, the first two are operated on the assumption that somehow that this padlock had to do with what made it really a challenge to get out of the room. And the only challenge was that there was, you had to kind of think beyond the normal obvious categories and see maybe there are other possibilities. And having some understanding of the world of our thoughts and learning how to function outside of our thoughts or appreciating the functioning that we have that is beyond or greater or besides our thinking functions is a very important part of just life in general, but also especially of a meditative life, a life of meditation. Because our thoughts are quite limited in what they can do. And most of us are functioning within the realm of thoughts, negotiating our thoughts, negotiating other people's thoughts and ideas and talking back and forth just the realm of thoughts. And it's very hard to imagine there's anything beyond that and you have greater functioning. And some of you maybe have some sense of other functioning like that, but you see that the great difficulty of really living beyond that when maybe when you sit down to meditate, a great difficulty some of us have in getting off the train tracks of our thoughts and our thinking. We sit down, we try to be with a breath and many people then will pretty quickly slide into some track of some preoccupation and concern and thinking. And they can't just simply let their thinking kind of rest and stay present in a non-discursive direct way. And I think for many people their thoughts are such an integral and intimate part of their experience of negotiating life that their thinking is invisible to them. They don't even know their thinking. It's kind of like the air that you breathe. Most of us, we walk through the air and most of us don't spend much thought thinking about the air that we're in, but we couldn't live without the air. And it kind of works the same way I think for many people with their thoughts. They're not people have no sense of their thinking and their thoughts. And it happens somewhat regularly that when I give instructions for mindfulness of thoughts and pay attention to your thoughts, there are some people that don't have a clue what that means or how to do that because their thoughts are inaccessible to them. They never thought you could turn around and pay attention to that. So to think outside our thoughts, to function outside of our thoughts, when I spent many years in Zen monasteries doing tensor practice. And that was a pretty diligent meditator, you know, sitting away doing my zazen practice. But in Zen, when you ate your meals, you ate your meals in the meditation hall. Normally in the Zen tradition, I was in, you sit meditating facing the wall. And for the meals, you turn around and you face away from the wall. And then they come in, they come, servers come in with food and you lay out your bowls in front of you and they serve the food into your bowls. And then you do some chanting before you can eat. And then you eat your food and you finish your food. They come in with water and they pour water into your bowl and you clean it. You have a little cleaning stick and you clean it and clean your bowls and they come with a bucket and you pour the water away. And so you kind of clean and dry your bowls right in your sitting place, sitting in meditation posture. So the idea is that you can continue in a sense your meditative way of being while you're eating. You're eating in silence, except for the chanting periodically. And it's a lovely way of eating, a lovely way of being. But I didn't really take it for a long time so seriously as a practice. I just thought it was like a break from my meditation. So I remember one year at the monastery, I had worked in the kitchen for a whole year and I'd been on the kitchen crew and I'd been a kitchen foreman, kitchen manager. And one of the great creative jobs in the monastery was to be the guest cook for the summer season when at Tassajara, when they have all these guests who come down to use it as a resort and you make all this wonderful elaborate food as a guest cook. And I'd been the whole year in the kitchen and I was like, I felt, you know, I was probably at the time I was one of the best cooks, you know, in the kitchen and I really knew the whole scene. So I really wanted to be a guest cook the following summer and I thought for sure I'd be. In Zen Marzia, you couldn't ask for a position. They just told you three times a year they would tell you, okay, you're doing this skill. You're going, you know, this period you're going to be the compost maker. So I'll have to do the compost for three months. So you're going to do a plumber, you're going to work in the kitchen or whatever. So you might not know anything about cooking but put you in the kitchen. You know anything about plumbing, they make you the plumber. It's a wonderful experience. And you know, in the Zen monastery you have more kind of professions in a few years and most people have in several lifetimes. And since you get to see yourself differently in different professions, it's a wonderful way of kind of learning different sides of yourself that you wouldn't normally have the privilege to do if you always had the same job all the time. So the end of the, I stopped working in the kitchen in the September and I was expecting and really wanting to be the guest cook the following summer. So every one of these meals for the next eight months, eight in the meditation hall, I'd be thinking about menus. And I'd be thinking about the food and they come in with the food and I would be critiquing the food and thinking about it and designing better menus and you know, and I, you know, in my mind is proliferation of thoughts and ideas, you know. And you know, I was preparing for this great event where I was going to be the great guest cook that Tassara had. And so the following summer came and I was waiting, waiting for the announcement to, Gail, you're going to be the guest cook. It didn't work out that way. I was assigned somewhere else. And what amazed me was at some point, it didn't happen, I didn't realize this right away. I realized this actually some years later, that I had spent eight months of my life, three times a day for about, you know, 40 minutes each time consumed with these thoughts, as if they were really important and really consequential and really meant something, consumed with these thoughts about something that never happened and expecting it to happen. It had a big, you know, I've had big impact on me and I, what a wasted opportunity. I mean, maybe if I made it get, been a guest cook, it would have been great. I would have had all this preparation. But, but I wasn't a guest cook. And I lost this wonderful opportunity because I knew that in my meditation, when I sat facing the wall, I could have this wonderful sense of contentment, of ease, of well-being, of real presence, of real wakefulness, real intimacy with myself. And then I'd turn around to eat the meal. And because I was lost in those thoughts of menus and food and all that, I lost that intimacy to myself. I got lost in this world of thoughts and ideas and I lost touch. And I felt it was a real loss, real waste for me to have spent all that time in these kind of imaginary thoughts and ideas. When I had this wonderful golden opportunity to sit quietly with this tremendous intimacy with myself, that's not really possible when you spend a lot of time completely lost in the world of preoccupations and thoughts and planning and memories and all that. There's a wonderful Zen story that I've been given many times. But the two Zen monks who are traveling and they come to a river and there's this gorgeous, beautiful 16 year old virgin, whatever, woman. And one of the rules, traditional rules for Buddhist monks, they weren't allowed to have any physical contact with any woman. They were not to shake hands even. And so the woman needed to get across the river. And here were these celibate monks. And so one of them simply came to the river, saw the problem, she couldn't get across and needed help. He picked her up and carried her across and put her down the other side of the river. And the two monks continued on their travels. And just before they came to the monastery where they're going to stay for the night, the second monk said, I gotta tell you something, how could you, you're a monk after all these years of being a monk, how could you have picked up that woman back there and carried her across? And the second one said, the first one then said, I put her down by the river. Why are you still carrying her? So this idea that we carry our concerns and preoccupations may be long beyond time we need to hold on to them, like I did in the kitchen at the Zen monastery. What is the nature of our thoughts? Have you ever thought about what a thought is, what thinking is? Have you ever looked at it carefully? Have you ever reflected on it? Have you ever reflected on the motivation of why you think? Or do you think your thinking is something automatic? Something like, just kind of, it's just what the mind does automatically and it's a natural function and it just keeps oozing out thoughts as if it's a waterfall. And you don't question the nature of a waterfall, just there, your Yosemite waterfall is there, the water keeps coming, you won't look at it. You're in awe and it's amazing, it's great, and the great power of nature. And sometimes our mind maybe feels more like Niagara Falls. And it's a great miracle of nature to watch this waterfall of thought. But maybe we just take it for granted. But it's actually possible to look at thoughts and investigate them and try to understand them better. And one of the great questions is what motivates your thinking? Have you ever asked yourself that? What motivates your thinking? Not in the abstract, you know, is all your thinking in general. But what motivates the kind of thoughts that you're having, that you're thinking in the way you're thinking right now, you're thinking the way you do sometimes in your daily life. I was motivated in that year and eight months by my ambition to be the guest cook and my ideas of being a good guest cook and my delight in being creative and coming up with new recipes and my new ideas of cooking. That's what motivated that. I know sometimes my thinking is motivated by fear, sometimes it's motivated by desire, sometimes it's motivated out of compassion and concern for myself or others. To kind of drop below the level of just thinking kind of on automatic pilot, taking it for granted. But asking what's going, what is this nature of this thinking that I'm having? An interesting exercise to do sometimes is to ask yourself, what's the quality of the voice that's doing the thinking? Is it a harsh voice or is it a hesitant voice or is it a loud voice or a soft voice? Is it a fearful voice? Is it a critical voice? Is it a gentle voice? It's almost as many of us, some people find that the voice in which they speak their thoughts to themselves can have different tones, different ways of being. Some people even report that certain kinds of statements that they make, like judgmental statements, certain kinds of judgments about themselves or other people, occasionally people report that they listen to that voice making those judgments and long behold it wasn't their voice but it was one of their parents. But it was one of their parents and somehow they internalized the way of speaking, the way they heard from maybe a parent or someone and they were actually continuing the same kind of way of speaking, the same kind of voice in the way that they do their thinking. Now thinking, so one thing is there's many ways to investigate thoughts. An interesting, another interesting investigation is the cost of thinking. Have you ever wondered what your cost is for your cost of thinking? We often think that, you know, we don't think about our thinking for most part, we just think happily away. But some thoughts, there seems to be no cost involved at all, it just seems kind of just, they just happen kind of smoothly and easily and like a welled oiled wheel that turns truly. But some thoughts are actually quite exhausting to have and people can actually develop a lot of stress and a lot of fatigue from a certain recurring strong patterns of thinking. And if we just take our thoughts for granted as if that's the way nature should be and have these kinds of thoughts, we don't really see the source in Genesis of some of the stress and some of the fatigue we might have in our lives. And from the perspective of very deep meditative concentrated states, when you really get into a very deep quiet meditative state, you see that actually most activity of thinking requires work, which is not really such a far-fetched concept. To think is an activity and any activity requires some energy for it to happen. Any energy requires work and any work pretty much has a certain element, even if it's delightful, joyful work, but has a certain kind of tiring effect or tiring impulse. And it's quite fascinating just from the perspective of a very deep meditative calm to see that even very subtle thinking has a quality of, no matter how good or perfect the content of the thought is, the quality of even thinking has some element of unsatisfactoriness to it, some element of fatigue to it, such as interesting to note that. The other thing about thoughts is that it tends to be in the world of ideas and the world of ideas tend to be quite limited compared to what's actually happening. So if we're negotiating our life through our thoughts and ideas, we're not really seeing the full fullness of many situations we look in. And it's quite obvious in some situations. Have you ever been the recipient of someone else's categorizing you into a certain category? Like you're someone's spouse or you're just that kind of person, you know, once in your whole life you got angry and now to someone, that person always thinks of you as an angry person who's afraid of you from then on out. That's a kind of maybe too dramatic fanciful example, but you've probably been categorized by someone and you felt that wasn't really fair, that you're limited to that degree by that person's idea of who you are. Or you see people who do it to themselves, see people who really feel like they're inadequate or unworthy or they think they're the hottest, hotshot software programmer around or something. You know, get off, get the chip, you know, they have a chip on their block, they say, right? And so people put themselves in certain categories. Sometimes they exalt themselves, sometimes they put them down. Both activities are exhausting to be involved in such concerns. But anyway, we do it. And you can very clearly see that these people put themselves in a category and you see the limitation and the suffering that occurs because they're kind of limited by how they think of themselves. What's much harder to do is to see the way we do that ourselves or the way we do it for other people, towards other people. But we ourselves put ourselves in categories and see ourselves through the filters or the limitations of certain ideas of who we are. And we put other people in situations into limitations of certain ideas of how things are. And they might have some truth to it. And sometimes the ideas can be quite, correspond quite closely with reality. But the nature of our thoughts and ideas will never really measure up to the full range of possibilities and complexity of situations we find ourselves in and people we meet. And if we're only negotiating the world through what we know, or what we think we know through the ideas we have or the fears that we have, the ideas, we're actually limiting ourselves and living our full participation and understanding of what's going on to a very, very dramatic degree. So thoughts, a lot of thinking can be fatiguing, a lot of thinking can be limiting in many ways. And that's where the power of meditation is very important. And the power of meditation is to give us some appreciation or some possibility of existing in the world where the center of gravity of our being, of our attention, is not in thoughts. And I said that very carefully. The center of gravity of our aliveness is not in our thoughts. And the question is, where is the center of gravity of your attention? I think there's a tremendous amount of life energy or attention that goes into the realm of thinking. And we don't want to set up a war with our thoughts and thinking as if they're bad, but it's possible to have a center of gravity somewhere else. Or it's possible to expand our awareness to include much greater realm of functioning that isn't just simply limited to, so it isn't just simply kind of always kind of in the world of thoughts. And I was sitting there thinking, there was eight months thinking about menus and food. I wasn't aware of much else. I was just kind of lost in that world. It's a two-dimensional world to be involved, lost in thought primarily. So to shift the center of gravity from our thinking to a wider sense of mindfulness, of presence, is part of what we're trying to do in this kind of practice. And it's very dramatic, remarkable what can happen if you shift your center of gravity from your thoughts into a wider or bigger sense of presence or awareness. It's the only way that you're going to have some sense that you are really, some sense of real well-being. Real, deep, personal well-being doesn't arise from thinking about how to make it happen, doesn't arise from thinking it so. You can't think yourself into well-being. You can't really think yourself into making yourself happy. You can't really think yourself into making yourself feel at home with yourself. It's something you have to feel yourself into, sense your way into. You have to kind of let your awareness of yourself become greater than all your thoughts and concerns. And in that space, a greater kind of awareness allows something else to happen that simply can't happen when you're always thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. And it's so tempting to think for some of us because many of us have problems and we suffer. And human beings are kind of designed, in part, to try to find meaning and interpretation and solutions through the cognition, through the thought processes. And it's really marvelous that our thoughts can do so much. I'm actually in awe of thoughts. I think they're great thinking, as long as they're in their place. Thank you. But in their place, in their domain, thoughts are just fantastic. But they're so limiting. And if we're really lost in that world of thoughts, then it's like we've closed the space down around us. And we need to have more space in our being, in our presence, to allow some well-being and feeling at home and feeling content, feeling peaceful, feeling compassionate, feeling loving, for those things to arise or to surface within us. And we can't do that if we're writing our thoughts really closely. So one of the things that's very important in mindfulness meditation is to be mindful of your thinking, of your thoughts, to not take them for granted, not get lost in them too easily, but to start having a little bit more of a wake sense of what thinking is about, how you think, how quickly you tend to fall into your thoughts, what it's like to be thinking. So that maybe by becoming more familiar with your thinking process, you're not so seduced by it or enchanted by it, so that you have some choice and control over what you think or when you think about things. And for some people, this is a completely far-fetched idea that you have some control over your thinking process and what you think and if you think at all. But through the strength of meditation that comes with time, you actually learn to get tremendous ability to have some choice about whether you think or not. And if you start having that choice, then if you know there's something a lot better than thinking about menus for eight months, if you know there's something a lot better than thinking about planning the day tomorrow or remembering some thing from the past or being preoccupied about some relationship that's whatever. But if you know there's something better than being involved with those thoughts, and how many of you are your thoughts repetitive? Maybe having thought that thought once was really a good thing, a really good thing. Having thought it twice was maybe kind of okay. Having thought it three times was overboard. But 500 times? 500 times? The same memory and reliving that event that happened and thinking, can you could have done better? Or this event is going to happen? And what amazes me is that it's as interesting each time. It doesn't matter if it's 500 times, it's as interesting, that's compelling to the mind. Why is that? What motivates that sense of compelling enchantment, even though it's the same repetitive thing over and over again? Sometimes. So start becoming sensitive to this realm of thought and having some sense that there is something better that you can do. If you simply have some negative reaction to your thoughts, and think, well then, I'm supposed to kind of shut them off or crush them or stop thinking, that's not going to work. But if you know there's something really wonderful that's better than thinking, then it's a kind of delight to choose that different thing. And non-discursive awareness of our life is really great. It doesn't mean you have to stop thinking. This is one of the great, what I suggested in the meditation was see if you can find that wider presence that's beyond your thinking. Not to shut off your thinking or stop it, but to kind of realize that who you are is this huge, vast mandala of functioning. And the thoughts are just one little piece of that. And you want it in its rightful place and to have it in one little piece of the great mandala. You don't want it to be the whole mandala. And non-discursive awareness, the awareness that is able to hear a sound. You don't have to be thinking to hear my voice speaking. It happens kind of automatically. There's a non-discursive awareness of hearing my voice speaking. Now you might be thinking about what I'm saying, God, why did I come tonight? He's talking, you know, and he goes on and on talking about thoughts, you know, he's making more complicated. And am I supposed to think about this? Am I not supposed to think about it? What's this guy saying, you know? You know, so, but you're welcome to those kinds of thoughts. But that's your thinking. The listening to my voice is just that happens as non-discursive awareness just happening. Some of you are looking at me. If you look at me, well, looking, seeing happens in a non-discursive way. And your thoughts about what I look like, I mean, keep them to yourself, please. But, you know, you're welcome to those thoughts. But those are your thoughts. But you're seeing me, the seeing itself is non-discursive awareness. What your physical body feels like right now. Some of you are comfortable, you've been sitting on the floor for a while. Some of you are, you know, feeling comfortable or whatever. Or some of you feel whatever in your body right now. Some of your legs are kicking back and forth and you sit in your chair or whatever. You can feel those things. To feel and sense what's going on in your body is a non-discursive form of awareness. And what I'm proposing to you tonight is that non-discursive awareness is big enough and large enough to include it all, including the fact that you can know that you're thinking. You can non-discursively know that you're thinking. And the sense of gravity is in that awareness. The sense of gravity is not lost in the manipulation of thoughts and ideas in our thinking. Is this making some sense? I'll think about it. Think about it. And I say all this because the main reason we're saying all this is so that when you sit in meditation, you might find yourself not so interested in going down a track of thinking and find yourself interested in taking a different track. And a different track is a track of non-discursive awareness. Awareness is just simply opening and being aware of what's happening, not having to think about it. It's really hard to do. So I grant you it's the challenge of this, but it's something we can learn to do and become stronger with time. But it really helps if you understand the nature of thoughts and limitations of thoughts and that maybe it isn't so interesting as it first appears to be thinking. That it's not really going to maybe solve so many of your problems. Or it might solve all kinds of problems at a superficial level, but it's something much more deeper and more important will happen to you if you open and sense your life as opposed to thinking about your life. To open to the felt sense of what it's like to be a human being as opposed to thinking about what it's like to be a human being is a very important part of the meditative process. For a while I used to tell when I gave instructions for meditation, I used to say, I used to repeat what one of my teachers said was that there's nothing you need to think about when you meditate. Isn't that great? There's nothing you have to think about, absolutely nothing you have to think about. Now can you be convinced about the truth of that? Can you really live? Can you really meditate as if there's really nothing you have to think about? Nothing really that important that in that 40 minutes you're meditating needs to be thought about. So I used to say that a lot because I thought it was great because it's true. There's very little or basically nothing you think about the menu or whatever. But I said that once and then this guy came up to me afterwards and he said, I used to be part of a cult and they used to tell us this in the cult and this was a way of kind of controlling people so they wouldn't think critically of what was going on. So since then I haven't said this very much anymore but I think there's some truth to the statement but it's not meant to be a substitute to thinking critically and carefully in your life. It's very important to do that. Just don't do it when you meditate. In your meditation you don't have to think about anything and then if you don't think about things in your meditation and get really calm and clear then you're in really good position to think. Come out of a really good meditative state and then think about something and you'll think with great clarity and penetration and understanding. It's really great. So anyway that's my kind of thoughts for this evening. So what are your comments to that? Questions? Fiona? Just in relation to what this book about concentration. Seems like that is relaxing and more relaxing. Can you do both? Yes. This was definitely, this talk was definitely continuation of Monday's talk. And I probably give a variety of the variation of this very talk unless you guys think I shouldn't. On Monday because I think it's really important and I want to continue the theme of concentration on Monday for the next month since I asked people to work on the concentration. It's a lot easier to develop concentration. Oh, this is why the realm of concentration is often misunderstood because some people think it's a narrowing of attention. And it's possible to develop a non-discursive awareness. What we're trying to do with concentration, what concentration means for us is we're trying to sustain that through time. So sustaining the open meditative awareness through time, really being present for what's happening in the present moment, that's concentration for us. It isn't necessarily narrowing attention that stays narrow. It can be relaxed and open. We're trying to maintain that open awareness through time. And it's a lot easier to develop that kind of concentration or that kind of sustaining attention if we're not so enthralled by our thoughts. If we're not so quick to jump on that track. We want to stay on the track of awareness. If we stay on that track of awareness, that's sustaining the attention that's developing concentration. I'm very lost when you were talking about counting. Less on Monday, yes. Is that still backing off when you should put counting as well? Well, you know, there's a little bit different... The mind has a lot of capacity. There's a lot of functions of the mind. And so there's little bit different kinds of meditation practices to do to develop different functions of the mind. And the counting of the breath might not really relate directly, written directly, it could or couldn't, to a more wide open spacious restful awareness. Counting of the breath is primarily... it could. But the main reason I said it is counting of the breath from one to ten and over again is really to strengthen one particular factor of the mind, which is the factor of concentration. And the stronger the concentration, the ability to concentrate is, the easier it is to do almost any other practice, including any kind of open awareness practice a person might want to do. Also, what's very interesting, if someone has done mindfulness for some time and then they stop for a short time and do a concentration practice like counting their breath, it's a great truth-teller. And they'll find out exactly how present they really are. Because it's very relatively easy to be fooled, because our thoughts are so invisible. And we can kind of get a sense, we think we're present, and we're somewhat calm, we think we're present, but primarily 95% of what we're doing is we're kind of lost. And we think we're present, you know, or we're present, you know, five percent of the time, but we kind of think it's 95% of the time because, you know, we're kind of giving ourselves the benefit of the doubt. But if you start counting your breath, so you have to stay present for each count, and you can only stay really on a regular basis up to two, then, you know, wait a minute, maybe I wasn't as present as I thought. So it's actually, it's also not only a good kind of development of concentration, but it's also a good truth-teller to really let us know better where we're actually at in our practice. Does that make sense? Yes? I'm working on the more mindful in everyday life, and everything's succeeding to make sense for my future practice, and I wonder if you might give me some ideas. I know when I go off on a track in everyday life, I take a walk every day, and sometimes I get back, and I just, as if I had any longer walk, so that my mind just takes off. And the other time, sometimes while driving, and then other times are when I'm doing a task that is not like washing dishes, or after I've been gotten out of the shower, putting on my clothing, just sort of mundane things that are not that much fun. It seems an awful lot more fun to get on a track, you know, solving problems, and coming up with ideas for how to fix this or do that is much more exciting for me than doing the walk, doing the dishes, that sort of thing. And I'm wondering if, and by the time I discovered that I've been on some, these road tracks, all this time has passed. Do you have some suggestions for how I might have not myself out of it? Well, there's just a few comments first about what you said. When we are really very actively thinking a lot, it's very hard from that place of a lot of thinking, a lot of busyness of thought and all that, to imagine that there is an alternative that's maybe more deeply satisfying. And so because it's hard to imagine, even letting go of those thoughts a little bit, it's kind of like being an addict. And there's a little bit of disorientation for a while, and it doesn't feel like so, you know, it's kind of like you've been charged on this caffeine of the mind for a while. And it just kind of feels kind of like, it's actually more comfortable to continue with a caffeine than it is to drop it for a while. So it's very hard sometimes to imagine from that very busy, active, problem-solving mind that it's possible to actually have a tremendous amount of joy in washing dishes. There are times when I find great delight in washing dishes, and the more present I am in my nondiscursive awareness, the less I'm caught by my thoughts. And one thought I can be caught in is a thought, I have to get something done right now, it's different than this. So let's figure out how to do this as quickly as possible. But if I can really be there for washing the dishes, and be in the kitchen, like one of the little things that I find joy in doing is, a lot of joy is, you know, we do our dishes in the evening, and we pile them up in the drying rack to dry overnight, so we don't have to dry them, right? Save some time. And then in the morning, I'm usually the first one up in my household, and it seems like the first thing that should be done pretty much when we're going to the kitchen before making breakfast is I empty the drying rack of all its stuff and put everything away where it needs to go, so there can be space for when we make dirty dishes, you know, we can wash a dish and have some place to go, because we have a small rack. And we don't have a dishwasher. So, it's like a little ritual. I love it. I just stare for it, and it's like a little dance in the kitchen, you know, and I do twists of the body, and I bend down, I put the pots underneath it, you know, and I love it. I mean, I could be thinking about, you know, I could be thinking of all kinds of wonderful things, but I think it's actually more wonderful to have that time. So, how can you do this? How can you find the joy or the delight that comes from not being, you know, to being more present for things like going for a walk and washing dishes? One is to give yourself the chance to settle into it. It might take a while. It might take, like, if you haven't gone running for some time, you start running. The first hundred yards are just like, you know, this is impossible, you know, forget this, you know. Who invented running should be strung up and shot and quartered, you know, and it's like hopeless to get to. But once you get to the first hundred yards, it may be a little bit easier. And then over the days, it becomes easy after a while, after a week of running every day or something, and it's kind of, there's no resistance, and the body doesn't have a problem with it. So, same thing with bringing presence to activity in daily life. It might be the first five minutes of dishwashing or the first five days. It takes, you know, difficult, but it takes a while to settle into that activity and really let your body kind of sink into it. The other is to try not to do too many things at once in your life. Doing a lot of things at once is a guaranteed way of having the thoughts spinning and spinning and spinning. So, I mean, I see it very clearly. I don't always choose what I probably should be choosing, but, for example, if there's a big difference between the state of my mind, if I read the paper and eat breakfast, or if I just eat breakfast, and if I'm really honest, just being in breakfast is actually more pleasant. But I'm so captivated, you know, I'm not going to have any time today to read the paper, so this is my chance. It's also very nice to read the paper and eat breakfast at the same time. It's not like, it's like a mixed thing. But I know that if I look at the state of my mind, the quality of my mind, probably my mind is actually better if I don't read the newspaper. And that kind of principle of not doing too many things at once. Or if you have a lot of things that could be done, what I try to do then is sometimes I'll try just to do one of them all the way through, and then the other one all the way through, as opposed to trying to have five different fires going at once, if I can avoid that. And that actually improves the quality of my mind, because my mind is not kind of racing between things. Paying attention to... So I think one of the best ways to answer your question is to actually find something that you really appreciate about simply being present for things as you're doing them, and not being somewhere else in your thoughts. If you can find something you appreciate about it, some delight in it, then you want to be there. As opposed to, you know, Gil says you shouldn't be thinking so much in certain activities, so I better force my mind in a certain direction. That's not going to work. There's a lot I could say, but I shouldn't go on, I feel. Someone else? Yes? I've noticed a pattern in my life, in my thinking, is it worth it? I'm not sure what the pattern is, but I will go along, and things seem to be going well, something like that. And then, at some period of time, I will start to get angry. And I guess, and it's really, I realize it's my fear about some things. And lately, it's about some superiors that are doing some things that I think are dumb. And what I was doing was my concentration meditation this morning, and I realized I was doing this, and when I was finished, I got up and realized that this was their problem. And I was lying, but I was really, and I was upset about it. And so, I kind of let it go by saying, well, I'm not responsible for all of this, and whatever happens, will happen. And that's their problem, that's why they get paid, and they get salaries, and all this other stuff. And I'll let it go, as a result. And that allowed me to let it go, and then I got more into my own life, and whatnot. And my question to you is, and I've noticed, I'm not sure why it is that I pick up on this stuff, but I know that I do. I'll pick up something, and it happens periodically. And my question to you really is, in your history as a meditator, have you found that you just do this stuff, and the stuff stops happening. You deal with it as it comes along, but you always still have to deal with it, or does there some place where you say, okay, well, maybe it is concentrate, conscious that you say, well, okay, this is the first time through whatever you do about the same thing. Yeah, I think there's so many different strategies and ways of being present that I don't have a clear single answer for you. There are times when it's quite easy for me to just let go of my thoughts, and just stay present with my breath, or stay present in what's going on. There are other times where it seems like it's very important to bring mindfulness to my thinking process itself. Because mindfulness practice is not being set up as a way to reject anything. We're not supposed to set it up and reject our thinking. What mindfulness is in purity is how to bring mindfulness to whatever is going on in our life. And if we're actually thinking a lot, we want to bring mindfulness to that event. But not mindfulness to that event so we think even better. But we want to bring a different kind of awareness to the thinking process that helps us become free of the enchantment there. And what you described was using a thought process to understand that you're not responsible to set your thoughts free. And that can work sometimes, which is a fine thing to do. But there's an alternative, and that is to use the mindfulness to see the thoughts clearly enough so you're not caught by them. And you don't have to be right to... It might be your responsibility, but you still don't have to think about it during your meditation. So it's possible to discover a freedom, a possibility of how to be free in relation to our thoughts, that's not dependent on coming up with a good idea, a rationale for why it's okay for us to put them to rest. Does that make sense? Does it respond somewhat? So I thought we should end with our short sitting. But before we do, I just want to have one more thing to say. I thought this may be a little bit interesting. One of the places I try to pay a lot of attention, and it's a difficult area of mindfulness, is in mindfulness in conversations with people, like when I'm talking with someone. And when I'm really present listening to someone, there's a whole level of thinking which don't occur as best I can. I mean, there's a lot of thinking that could occur. I might be thinking a little bit about what they're saying and somehow kind of processing a little bit of my thoughts. But it's also possible to have all kinds of thoughts about... Well, if I say that, that's going to sound dumb. Or, you know, what do they think about me? Or what are they thinking about? A lot of self-preoccupation kind of thoughts in relationship to the interaction you're having. And I discovered that if when I'm present for people, I can be sometimes present without that whole level of thinking about myself and what I'm getting out of it, what I'm presenting myself, what I'm... how I'm concerned my image is, or what the person's thinking about me. I'm just simply present really for the person without those kinds of self-preoccupations, those thoughts. And a lot of self-preoccupating thoughts belong to the world of thoughts, kind of thinking that goes on kind of subtly in the background. And they actually keep me, if they're present, they keep me from really being present for the person. It's like a veil comes over me. Even though I think I'm present, there's only maybe a third present where I could be two-thirds present if those thoughts weren't there. And what's more interesting is that when I find myself able to not have self-preoccupating thoughts, any kind of thoughts about myself, sometimes I feel a little bit uneasy. Because I think I'm supposed to be a person, I'm supposed to be someone for this person. I mean, our whole life is, you know, our whole social life is set up for being someone for someone. And when I'm really present in a very clear and awake way, I'm not being anybody for anybody, consciously. Not in terms of thoughts and ideas. So there's a whole level of trust of how to be present, where we have enough trust that we don't have to be anybody. Isn't that great? And so much of how we be someone is through negotiating our beingness, through our thinking about who we are. So it's very freeing to learn alternatives to thinking about yourself. And you might also explore a little bit in conversation, see if that level of thought that has to do with your self-concern. What happens if you have a conversation with someone that level of self-concern is not operating? So now I'd like us to sit. Will there be time for an announcement? We will do it after the sitting. So what I said tonight might sound very complicated. So I'm trying to point to something very, very simple. I'm trying to point to how you can have the simplest state of being possible and find the joy of that. Simply being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. So I'm trying to find the joy of being present. If you stop experiencing yourself solely through the filter of your thoughts, you'll give yourself a chance to learn that there's much more goodness in you than you realize. May all your goodness shine forth. Thank you.
