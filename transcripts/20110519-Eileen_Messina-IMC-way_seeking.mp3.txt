The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I'd like to start off reading a poem called Practice.
I feel empty.
A jackass rabbit ridiculously scampers across my path.
There is so much whirling around happening.
I decide to hang out painfully with the not knowing.
A cow docilely stands in the middle of my path
with a complete understanding of time.
As I approach, she turns her head
towards me in our eyes meet, and she graciously
walks off to my right without fear.
Could this empty, alone, not knowing
emotion be sublime equanimity?
I look ahead and see a white egret
standing on the left side of my path with an attitude of
imbalance. As I approach,
he senses my presence, my inquiry,
and the movement he makes with his neck as my path is cleared speaks
yes.
So,
I'd like to talk a little bit about
ritual and hindsight before I
start to get into some of the twists and turns that happened
on my spiritual journey and my history with practice.
With my involvement with the chaplaincy program,
I've come to realize how important ritual is
to me.
In hindsight, as I reflect, I've realized that
it's been actually important for me for my whole life.
If I look back when I was a child, it was quite nurturing.
Eating meals together
and watching the meal be prepared, watching my father garden
and prepare the soil, even walking to church
as a family, this ritual
was really just nurturing for me.
Even church, the Mass was said in Latin
and that was even quite the sounds of the
rituals and the incense.
And then over time,
I kind of got muddled mixed in
stress and contact with the world.
So, I'd like to tell a little story about how
I've come to realize the importance of ritual.
I have three grown children in their 20s
and we cooked together around the holidays and my son
decided that he wanted to learn how to make sushi. So, he organized
a sushi making night. So, the four of us got together
and learned how to make sushi together.
And to my delight, it ended up being pretty much a monthly
ritual. And one time
my daughter, I was unavailable
by phone one morning and when I noticed my phone, it had
four missed calls from my daughter.
So, I immediately gave her a call and her first
comment was, Mom, where were you?
And I said, well, I was occupied all morning and she said that
she was frantically trying to organize a sushi making
night for there was some stress in her
day that she felt the need to be comforted.
And this was
quite powerful for me to see how just a simple
ritual of things that I had done while they were
growing up meant so much to them. And I feel
quite blessed that they feel that
my home is a safe place for them to come to. And this brings me to
how I learned to hold
a container for my kids and do some self
nurturing, which I learned
how to do through my meditation practice and my loving kindness practice.
And there's another kind of ritual that I now want to
talk about and that's one that inclines the mind
towards more wholesome states. And
this is a ritual that I kind of performed
right before I came here because this is my first public speaking
talk. And so I had to
you know when Gil first asked me to give a talk
my response was no way. Absolutely no way.
And then later he told me he had me
scheduled to give a talk. And
I looked at him with shock and he said oh did we talk about this?
And I said no. And I said
I wasn't ready. And then a third time he came
and that he asked me again and this time I figured
well I better give it a try. So
my ritual before coming here was to sacrifice
my idea of not being able to give a talk.
And decided to step off the cliff
and realize that
with my understanding of practice that
the way I'm going to be able to get over that is to actually start and do it
and realize that you know just taking the risk
to give it a try and to know that
it may not go very well or I'll make mistakes
and not know what to say and whatever. But anyway here I am
and thank you for
being here with me while I
kind of trudged through this.
So to talk a little bit about how I came to
IMC and how I came to the chaplaincy program, I'd like to talk a little bit
about conditioning, my family of origin
and my conditioning because that definitely had
with
work that needed to be done to
undo some of the bad habits that I developed
growing up.
So one of the big parts in my childhood
I was raised, I'm one of six
and
I kind of had a learning disability
only I didn't really wasn't really aware of it. I had difficulty reading
and writing and as a kid I didn't speak much and with
six kids I didn't, I guess I wasn't nurtured enough to actually
be encouraged to speak. So that's one of
I developed a lot of habits around not letting people know that I didn't
know how to read or write and that carried on
through college. When I
somehow just sort of went along with my conditioning
and some of the courses that I was really interested in
like some of the requirements for the humanities I remember taking
just getting into college I had to my SAT scores were so low around
the reading and writing I had to take the you know the dummy you know writing course
and I happened to fail it twice and then
it was also another requirement of humanities and I was in this
philosophy class which I absolutely loved and
I couldn't do the reading but I could kind of pick up a lot what was going on
and ended up failing that too because I couldn't do the writing at the end.
So I kind of switched gears and I could do well
in math and sciences so I ended up getting my degree in applied physics
and information sciences and found a way to get around
some of the
writing requirements. So that's
been kind of a strong pattern in my life is
getting around my disability or not even knowing
that I even have a disability or what they call as a disability.
So those were some of the conditionings
and then
there was a big shift in my life when I had
children and this opened me up in a way that
was quite powerful. I realized that I did a lot of
some of the mindfulness stuff that we do here unknowingly
with this phase of my life. Just the process of being pregnant
was a strong meditative practice
because I was totally aware of what was happening in my body in it
and it was
as I do more practice I kind of reflect back to those experiences
that I had through the whole process of giving birth, the beginning
the middle and the end. And then as raising
children, another aspect of practice came in
with causes and conditions and I was very interested
in watching the reactions and what worked with kids
and communication skills and I started taking courses
on how to listen so kids talk and talk so kids listen
and so I loved this space. I loved this
learning and it opened me up in a way that
I had this sense of purpose and it made me
kind of come alive. And it also
I started exploring also learning styles with three different kids
and I got a little bit more information on
my disability and it also brought me into the community
the involvement with the kids of being in school
and being a real shy kid this was a stretch for me
and putting myself out there in that way.
And then another step, another leap in my
spiritual path came about when my kids
started bringing home their writing and their artwork
and I had this tug like do you want to take this class
or do you want to do that class and I realized this was something that I needed to do
so I started exploring art for myself
and realized that sculpture was
the medium that I liked working in. So I started working
and this became my first contemplative practice
working with sculpting
and I could watch all the negative habits of
mind you know it should look like this or it shouldn't look like that
and this isn't going anywhere and I just hung in there
I just kept at it and then there was also the community aspect
there too as well was important to me working with other people
doing this work as well.
And so this was going on and
raising kids and doing art and then in
1989 we had that earthquake
and this was quite an
experience for me because I was standing with my
80 year old neighbor who remained calm
through the whole thing and I was
it really struck me as something quite profound
because Gil kind of in one talk talked about
an emotion that he called elevation where you can
experience this shift just by
being with somebody and that's what happened with me with this man
I was totally amazed that somebody
could remain calm in
being shocked you know it was an eye-opener for me
and what I realized in that
was
and then also with that earthquake
I knew that my husband was out of town so I didn't have to worry about him
and I just took care of my kids and the neighborhood kind of got together
and when my husband called he was
seeing on the news that the day bridge had collapsed
and he was upset that I hadn't tried to contact him and it was kind of an eye-opener
for me because I realized that I didn't look to him for any
kind of emotional support so this was
it kind of put my
life kind of in a spin when I realized that our lives had kind of
you know separated you know he was working on his career and very
busy with that and I was working you know this way
and at this time it was also
my family of origin was there was a shake-up in that and that my mother
was having difficulty with alcohol and
it
I guess this experience I had gave me a little bit of
I needed to do something I needed to do something about my marriage I needed to do something about
my family of origin and my brother and I
ended up we ended up doing an intervention with my mom
which was quite powerful and
she went into the Betty Ford Center and my dad
actually went into a co-dependent program as well and each programs
had you know a week where the family
can come in and also do work with it and and then
I got to see you know more of the family dynamics and
my identity you know kind of
I started looking at my identity in a very different way
this caretaker role, this co-dependent role in myself
and that kind of opened up
working with therapists and shifting that around
so that was so these new teachers kind of came into my
life and at that time I also started working with my
first spiritual teacher, this woman who led
a journal writing course and she used
movie clips to kind of get our
imagination going and she had themes and then she would ask us questions
and it helped me explore
a lot of what was going on in my life and relationships
it was quite amazing and then I started
doing some writing and she also introduced me to another
practice using active imagination
and that actually has come in real handy
later in my meditative practice you know with dropping on a question
and letting something
kind of arise.
So that was sort of you know a lot of the middle part
of my journey and then I came and then my
father came to my house one day very sick
and this was my introduction to the you know
sickness old age and death because he was very sick and ended up dying
and so I got to watch that process
as well and that opened me up in a new way as well
just like you know giving birth, the death process and the life process
and then at the same time
after this experience it shifted me
again in a deeper way
and it put stress on my marriage
until that
kind of became kind of the crisis
kind of became critical and it dawned on me that
it would be
I think we were causing more harm than good
I didn't have enough of the skills to, communication skills
to sort of make that kind of work so we ended up separating
and this caused another sort of leap in my growth
you know here I was with three kids and managing alone
and no career because I wasn't working
at the time and then the process of divorce and custody
and but I
still had the spiritual practice that I was doing and poetry
then kind of showed up for me and I started doing a lot of you know writing
and then someone had introduced
me to the Yi Qing in this course that I was taking
and I started looking at attitude and
it was a beautiful book on changes and it actually maps on
to the Eightfold Path so this was the text that I started studying
with and eventually you know a woman
in my sculpture class had mentioned if I like that I should try IMC
so that's actually how I came to IMC
and that was about in the late 1990s
and when I came here it was
the second Palo Alto and it was sort of odd that you know you kind of
come and sit and listen to a talk and then leave
and I really, really appreciated the talks
but I couldn't quite figure out the community part of it and it reminded me a little bit
of the dysfunctional part of the church that I grew up
in so that was kind of puzzling for me
until one day I was standing next to Gil
and I just kind of felt this rush of energy kind of come up
and it felt like oh I can trust this guy so I ended up
hanging out here and I'm glad I did because
I started really looking at
what happened with me when anger was
directed towards me and I just sat with it
and I sat with the uncomfortable feeling of one that thought about
you know and just stayed with it
and I can do this day remember the first time
I experienced I received a call
and this person was really angry
with me and was ranting and raving and I remember
that I had just gone right past me and as the
rant was going on and on and on I was completely calm for the whole thing
and finally when he stopped I just calmly said
okay now it's time for me to go and this was so profound
that I kept at this practice
and another kind of twist happened
and I hope this isn't totally boring you guys
no it's okay
yeah it's going alright
okay
this
was probably the darkest part in my life when
I had been
out of the workforce for a long time and I needed to get back to work
and my skills with doing computer work
which is what I was doing
you know had been such a long gap
and so it was useless and I wasn't really interested in doing that
and at this point you know my mother also died and she died in a car accident
and it was kind of complicated
that there was a lawsuit because she was the one that was driving
and it kind of caused
a rift in my family
you know between my brothers and my sisters dealing with this lawsuit
and it was very
I just kind of
fell apart watching all this
and I realized that I kind of held a wrong
view that and this doubt kind of came about that I wasn't
capable of finding work and
I no longer had a sense of purpose my children were getting older and didn't need me
and so
so that and then I realized that I looked at identity
again you know where I had this identity that I was this depressed person
instead of an optimistic person and I kind of got stuck in that cycle
for a while until that crisis kind of became critical
and the weight of
and then there was this you know the teaching of not taking what's not
given and I realized that I had to let go of
of
taking any money from my ex he didn't want to give it you know he didn't want to pay
child support and I finally the way that that was just
wearing me out and I decided to just let that all go
and even in this
distress was so intense that meditation practice kind of made it
worse so I ended up letting that go too and I let go of the
each thing and I just kind of let it all go and
and then after you know then
I sort of looked for work and and I found
I found a job that I actually quite enjoyed so things started to then
kind of come back and slowly
started you know coming back and doing meditation and
I was co-teaching a sculpture class at that point and
then another big kind of shift happened when Gil started doing
the Dharma practice days which involved
interaction with people in the community and then I really started
to feel part of the community when I started to get to know people
and he had exercises that also challenged just a little
bit more so
that and I started doing
volunteer work here and I practiced kind of deepened
and then I was laid off after a number of years so that was
another big twist that here I was because the downturn in the economy
and my skills are you know so
I don't have a whole lot of you know skills
as far as finding work but I didn't
it wasn't it was challenging and
and at the time you know I was really investigating going back
to school and doing something that was a little bit closer to my heart
and get over this reading and writing part
but I couldn't really quite find anything that really resonated and at the time I started doing
some hospice volunteer work which I grew to really love
and the part about it that I loved the most was actually the chaplain part
and I looked into you know what it would take
to get a master's in divinity and go that route and
that was probably the most daunting graduate program that I looked at
and so I sort of left it at this point unresolved
and I ended up finding another job that
actually turned out to be kind of a dream job it was kind of a quirky
job and I was working in a
hotel a little gift store in a hotel that I managed
and it was tucked off into this little you know like a
dark you know tiny little room and the part
that was neat about it was that
it was very quiet and it really wasn't a whole lot of people coming in
so I had this time to myself to really investigate
what it was that I wanted to do next and
it ended up and I also it was also interesting to do that kind
of work I had to manage a few sales people and to do it from a real
slow pace scale you know the previous
job I had I was managing an arc gallery custom frame shop and it could get
quite busy and frantic and so this was delightful to
use my meditative practice to do things more and slowly
investigate aspects of managing
and I also worked at my
attachments to status and money and that was
a time that I kind of really looked at how I held that
and I realized that this year and a half that I was doing this
work I ended up you know doing more writing
and I started working with the each images again and exploring
the eightfold path and my practice started really deepening
and I started doing working in a writing support
group with the hospice work and started
reading things out loud which I would have never done before
and so that sort of also pushed me a little bit too
and I knew this job wasn't going to last because they weren't making any money
they had a year and a half contract and I was
just pleased to be where I was and doing what I was doing
and so with the idea of being laid off again you know I could see
the hotel manager showing the property to somebody else and I could watch the
fear arise and then I watched it arise and it would just kind of
fade away and so I got to look at all the
added stuff I heaped on myself around being unemployed all the
unnecessary suffering the practice was sort of
showing me the way in that regard and I also
realized that this time was so powerful that I wanted to
when I got laid off because I knew it was going to happen
but I wanted to take a year off I had enough savings and take a year off
and really deepen my practice more do some retreats
and then I noticed the Saudi center chaplaincy
flyer and I applied for
it and they accepted me and the job ended and the chaplaincy started
and the retreat started before that and that's how I
and then within that chaplaincy program you have to do 100 hours
of volunteer work so I also started doing an intensive program
at San Francisco General Hospital
so that is
and
and with this with the chaplaincy program it's a graduate
level course and there was a reading and then there's also writing assignments
and slowly over time I realized that
I could do all the writing and I could manage to do some of the reading
and halfway through
I decided to apply for a year residency
in the fall and they accepted me
so I have that starting in the fall so I kind of know a little bit
about what I'm going to be doing next year and after that I'm not sure
what's going to happen but that's how
and then that's how I came here
anyway that's sort of my story
of practice and I'll kind of end with
another poem and this I was on retreat last week
and this was an experience I had with the calmness
that I came away with the potential that can
hopefully someday stay with me not just a few days after a retreat
it's called unseen
I feel dumb I'm stopped at a stop sign my intention is to
turn right it's my turn for all is clear
as I start my turn I feel something is off
I pause the turn yet all is still clear
and as I start again I hear a boy's shout from behind
looking over my shoulder a boy on a bike now comes into my vision
I slam on the brake as he barrels through the intersection without stopping
at the sign
where's the rush anxiety
I was so struck with
there was just a slamming on the brake
and that was it that was the end of it there was no anxiety there was no rush
there was no anything so that's the power of practice
thank you
oh
any questions
that's a very moving story
so as you described
these events in your life
I'm wondering how they inform
your practice
in this chaplaincy program that you're working in
and as you work with people in the program
I find that
I think it goes together quite well
having a number of crises in my life
and then walking in and serving walking into a situation
where there's crisis and being able to be calm
for a person while this crisis is happening
it seems to serve
allow them the space again like I talked a little bit about what I do for my children
creating a container that's what it feels like when I walk into the hospital
when there's someone in crisis and there's also something kind of
powerful that happens when I walk in with a chaplain
name tag you know even though it's
it somehow drops the conversation deep
almost immediately they have some
crisis that's going on and they just need to someone to listen to
so that's basically what I do
I don't have a question
but I have a comment
and this is such an unusual comment
because I don't know you but yet you have revealed so much
about yourself as a human being
that I feel proud of you
thank you
hi
knowing what I know of you
and how difficult it has been for you sometimes
to speak to a number of people
I'm really proud of you too and it's a pleasure to
hear your story
your journey seems to bring you closer to the practice
at times and farther away than others how long was it before you
consider yourself a Buddhist
oh
I don't know that I think
that's a tough question because I don't know if I know when
it really I mean I have to say
only within the last number of years did it
really become a major part of my life
that being laid off from
work and then knowing that it just kind of fell into
the next thing and then I fell into the next thing and it just sort of unfolded
when I started really seeing how things unfolded
did I realize the power of the practice
also how did the retreats affect you spiritually
or your practice the retreats I find that
a lot of the work I had done was non-retreat work
with the writing and the sculpture
and a lot of that but what I found was that
what I needed retreat work to do was that the
I had to keep looking with more
subtler and subtler habits
and those just take a really quiet mind and it needs
a level of concentration so when my mindfulness started getting
stronger and my concentration started getting stronger
I just needed to do longer retreats to watch
to be able to see what was happening on the more subtle scale
of my practice.
I was trying to figure out how to award this
it seemed like there was some gaps in your practice
is that accurate assessment
would you say that when you came back to it
was it a setback
or when you came back to it you were sort of reinvigorated
or something was it
basically was it like riding a bicycle you know and you came back
was it like you're just right back in it and you were able to
grow even more. With some of it
when I was going away and then kind of coming back it was
usually a relief when I got back like oh I'm home
but there was a period where there was that major
depression in my life where the practice
actually when I was doing retreat work
it actually made it worse and so I had a little bit of a fear
when I came back that time and I remember
going on my first retreat and I mentioned this to Gil and he said well
what are the symptoms and I mentioned so it was nice to have
a teacher who could support me around that and he said
that this was a long time ago and he said what were
the symptoms that I would experience when I'd be sitting in meditation
when it became kind of scary and he said okay just come
talk to me if that happens again and it never happened again
so then I was able to let go of the fear of coming back to doing
retreat work but that was just because of a psychic
imbalance that happened in my brain that
that time it was a little harder to come back
I see so you felt like you were set back in some cases and
like you had to start all over again in some ways or
no it was because it's amazing when
when I have the times when I would have a daily practice
I could really sort of feel the benefits then when you stop
you really notice that it's better that
when I do meditate so that was always
I always knew that but when you meditate
uncomfortable stuff comes up and sometimes it's hard to make yourself come in
and do it so that was always when I was here was always
it always felt useful. Thank you.
I just wanted to say thank you also
in expressing your misgivings about doing something
like this and doing it in front of all of us
it's inspiring and
at one point when you said am I boring you all
it's like no because what you're giving voice to
are experiences like
I've had in my life that I don't generally give
voice to and you did it
in such a wonderful way. Thank you. Thank you.
So you mentioned your retreat you mentioned going on retreats
could you talk a little bit more about your retreat experience
I mean it sounds like you've done a lot of retreats is that right
were they short ones or long ones? With this year
taking this year off I started with a week retreat
in October and then I did a week retreat march and I just did one
last week with Richard and I'm going to be doing a two week
in July so I haven't done more
than in the past I would do weekends
and a few weeks here and there
but
I've grown to really love retreats
that it's
in the practice I just love
the benefit from it
there was another course that I had done while I was working at this
little gift store and that was the Awakening Joy
class and that was an interesting
practice in noticing
what is joy is and also
in mindfulness I know Andrea talks about this too is
if you're kind of off and all of a sudden you wake up
in a mindful moment and just kind of celebrating that
and those sorts of practices also I think are quite
helpful in knowing what brings joy
and it's not dependent on anything
any situation
I guess we're going to end early tonight
and I'd like to do a little ritual you know dedication of merit
and it's these little rituals I think are so profound
it kind of keeps the ego from kind of building
to offer up any benefit that this has presented
to all beings
may everybody be at ease, may everybody be happy
to be with you.
