 But it's the holding and clinging to it. And it's understood in Buddhism that one of the fundamental clings that cause the suffering is a clinging to some concept or idea of self, some identification, this is who I am, my body is who I am, so we hold on to our body, our youth, our looks or whatever, because that somehow represents who we are. Or our feelings or our thoughts, many people, maybe somewhat unconsciously equate their thinking with their self. And so the thinking part of our being is a very limited part of who we are. But because that the sense of self seems very closely connected to our thoughts about ourselves, it becomes very awkward for people to imagine that it's possible, you know, people get very frightened sometimes when their thoughts that create the sense of self disappear and then they feel disoriented in their life. It's not so uncommon, especially on intensive retreats, people do strong meditation practice, that their mind gets quite quiet and the normal thoughts that they use to kind of almost subconsciously support their sense of self, support the way they relate to the world, quiet down, relax enough, so they're not there. That people get calm for a little bit and then they realize in this calm that the normal references to orient themselves to their life are no longer there and it's quite common for people to get frightened. You know, if I'm not this kind of person, then I don't know how to defend myself, I don't know how to present myself, I don't know how to orient myself to the world around me. And then the underlying fear that is being hidden by our defenses, by our sense of self reveals itself. And then this is a very important part of practice, for some people this confronting this fear and then learning to relax into it and find it's possible to trust being alive without these kinds of ideas that we prop ourselves up with. So it can, somewhat simplistically, say that the central issue that we're addressing in Buddhist practice all through the practice, all through the years of our practice, is the issue of our clinging. So we look at it very honestly and find how to move into the possibility of non-clinging and all that comes from that. And there's different strategies that people might have to let go of their clinging. One way, the possible way in a sense is to look at it very directly, look at the clinging very directly until it releases itself, where you can release it and let go of it. The path of loving kindness is to bring love to that part of you, maybe that is so frightened that it wants to cling or so uncomfortable with life or so full of aversion and somehow start dissolving some of the clinging through loving kindness or kindness or compassion. And there's many different routes that people might take. Just simply doing a relaxation practice, like a concentration practice, can release a lot of the clinging. Clinging is, some people will call it synonymous with stress, it's a form of stress. And a lot of stress gets released through doing concentration practice and just relaxing. The problem with doing concentration practice is just relaxes the clinging, is that the underlying tendencies we have to cling are not addressed. So if you go out and drive in rush hour traffic and it makes you really tense because you get impatient, you get angry, you have the drivers and all this stuff, you can finish your drive or stop your car on the shoulder of the freeway for a little while and close your eyes and just meditate and just relax. And you start again in a relaxed way. But you might not have seen the sense of self, you might not have seen your opinions, you might not have seen your desire for ease or comfort, which is at the root of how you get stressed in rush hour traffic. And so because you haven't seen the root, the trigger there to get stressed is still right there, ready to kind of pop into gear. And so the function of the Ipasa Na practice is not just simply to bring relaxation and relief from our stress, but more specifically to look at the underlying roots, the triggers within us that trigger us to get stressed, trigger us to cling, to hold on. It's not enough just to let go, because if you just let go, then the triggers are still there to the next moment or the next day, the next time you're in the freeway you get upset again. So the function of Ipasa Na practice is to somehow get down to the root of our clinging. And so all through the course of Buddhist practice, people are somehow massaging or investigating or studying their clinging and the possibility of freedom from clinging. But as Ipasa Na practice progresses and the concentration connected to practice gets quite strong, strong concentrated mindfulness, then people begin seeing what's called the three characteristics. And this is what we talked about two weeks ago. We see seeing things as they are, which is a very important quality of mindfulness. And specifically it means seeing things as they are in their three characteristics. The three characteristics of our experiences, all experiences we have are impermanent. All experiences we have are unsatisfactory as a place for lasting security or happiness or senses of self. And all experiences we have are absence of any enduring self, an enduring entity which can be called the self. Now, beginning to see these things, beginning to see the impermanence of our experience, meaning to see that there's no enduring self in this experience that I can cling to, then brings a person to the next stage of these twelve steps of dependent origination that we're talking about these weeks. And that is the step of what's called disenchantment. And this is a lovely word. I love the word disenchantment. Some people are troubled by the word, they don't want to be disenchanted. But a very important part of Buddhist practice is to get yourself thoroughly disenchanted. And one of the first projects, maybe not first, but one of the points you're supposed to be disenchanted with is Buddhism itself. And then eventually you're supposed to be completely disenchanted with your idea of self, your clinging to self. And some people say, whoa, what's this about? This seems like excessively kind of... But the idea is disenchantment, to no longer be enchanted. And enchanted means, the word enchantment is to live under a spell, to live under a dream-like spell of what's actually there, to be somehow living in illusion. Another word perhaps is to be disillusioned. Now maybe in popular language when people feel disillusioned it feels like it's kind of a downer, it's kind of depressed and sad and such things. I felt so disillusioned. But I think that we're supposed to be disillusioned from our illusions. If we're living in illusion, we have to somehow be freed of our illusions. And so we call disillusions or disenchantment. And it's relatively common for people to do a number of years of Buddhist practice. And at some point, in the early years, Buddhism seems to offer a lot of hope. It's wonderful in the great world religions, it has a great philosophy and you can study its great metaphysics and teachings of emptiness. And it just seems like it has great authority and great promise and great charisma or great whatever. And it's quite exciting to be part of this great world movement and people feel it in the cutting edge of whatever is happening with Buddhism. And then after a while it gets kind of old. After a while the initial kind of excitement and enthusiasm about this wonderful religion hopefully begins to fade away. Hopefully people get disillusioned at some point. Hopefully at some point they realize that Buddhism itself is not going to help them as something foreign, something that they relate to outside of themselves. And some people at this point will get disillusioned in Buddhism and feel it doesn't offer any hope for them or something and will leave it and go find something else. But what's required is really to move beyond that and realize that what Buddhist practice is about is not about Buddhism, not studying Buddhism as a thing apart from you that's going to give you the answers. But Buddhism is asking you to turn around and look very deeply at yourself and face yourself in a very raw, honest way. To really look at your own clinging, look at your own suffering, look at your own possibility of freedom, your own compassion and loving-kindness. And so as long as a person is looking outward towards Buddhism, they need to be disenchanted. If they're looking outward towards a teacher that's going to do it for them, a teacher has some wonderful answer, they need to be disenchanted with a teacher. This gets very awkward when you're a teacher because it's kind of nice when they're enchanted with you. And then when they start getting disenchanted it's kind of rocky a little bit until you know. But that's okay. Eventually, hopefully things get sorted out and it becomes a friendly relationship again. But to be disenchanted is actually a very important thing. We get disenchanted with the things that we're addicted to, the things that we feel are compulsions. We get disenchanted with what drives us. And this can take many different kinds of levels. I think many of us here have probably been disenchanted by something in our lives, that we were pursuing madly and wildly as if it was really important. And then at some point realize, wait a minute, I don't know if this really was worth it or this doesn't seem to really provide me with this lasting or deep sense of happiness or satisfaction or peace that I'm looking for. I think of myself as, when I was in college, I was kind of a good student. I was kind of like a B plus student. It was good enough. And I was kind of content with that in a sense. But I felt like it was really a blessing that I wasn't any better because I had a lot of interest in some things. For a while I was interested in art, for a while I was interested in mathematics and different things. None of them which are wrong endeavors in any kind of way, but if I'd been any better at them I would have pursued them more seriously. I would have followed through and made it my life, whatever. And I'm not knocking that that's an important, wonderful thing for some people to do, but I'm very glad that I didn't take that route in my life because then eventually I found my way to Buddhist practice which I'm infinitely grateful to have been part of and have done. It's very easy to kind of get on a track and then stay on the track. So I'm saying if I'd been too good at anything I would have kind of stayed in that track, stuck on that track. So I kind of slipped off some tracks until finally I found the track that I wanted. That makes sense, I just said. But if you think of a stockbroker who's living there on Wall Street and literally lives there day and night and day trading, night trading. Just furiously making bids and keeping up to date and living under the stress of stock market going up and down and up and down. And wanting more and more money and never satisfied with how much money she has and just trying to not getting any sleep living on McDonald's burgers all the time. It's just a worse-case scenario, someone just pursuing money and more and more money. Most of us, I think here, are probably already disenchanted with that kind of life. We probably realize that's not the way I'm going to live, but there are people who live that way. And some of them occasionally get disenchanted and say, wait a minute, I don't know if I want to live the rest of my life this way. And I've met people like that who've left that kind of life because they realized what a dead life and uninspired life it was. So that's kind of extreme, but then as we look at more subtle aspects of our life, it's to start being disenchanted with all kinds of things. Some people will like to refer to this as kind of the process of growing up. In a kind of way, I think as people grow up, they get disenchanted with many of the things which the illusions they live under, or what they're enchanted by, or the delusions they live under, or whatever. I remember when I went to my first junior high school dance, and at the end of it, it was more or less kind of over, but we were still kind of on the gym floor. And of all people, my father walks onto the gym floor in the middle of the school dance to get me. I was mortified. I mean, talk about, how could this guy have shown up here? And a certain kind of enchantment of sense of self and sense of self-worth and how it's seen by others. And then as I got older, the zits was an issue, right? And zits, like pimples. And mortified by going to school with certain zits on my nose. It was like the worst thing that ever happened to humankind. And by the time I got to my 20s, I couldn't care if I had a zit in my face, and I couldn't care when my father showed up somewhere. And then slowly as we age, I think, we can look back sometimes to 10 years earlier and see if some of the things which we were completely preoccupied with, completely cut up with, is being so important. And there's a kind of movement of, maybe we can call it disenchantment, or realizing that's not really that important. And older and older, and maybe by the time we were 60 or 70, we looked back at the way we were so caught up in ideas of status at work. How could I spend so many years kind of consumed with ideas of status and getting ahead, and there were better things I could have done with my time. So I don't know if those examples are the best examples for any one of you, but some people, as they look back at their life, they look back and say, Oh, I've gotten disenchanted. I was really enchanted by that. I was driven by that at some point, and now I don't see that I've moved beyond that. I've grown out of that and no longer seen it. In a sense, Buddhist practice is a form of accelerated aging. And because, you know, we're not, because there's the kind of maturation that happens as people get older, and seeing through the illusions that we tend to live under as when we're younger, tends to happen quicker. This movement of getting disenchanted and seeing through our illusions, being disillusioned, not so we can live an empty life or a nihilistic life or a life of no meaning, but rather to live a life that is actually filled with meaning, filled with purpose and vision, but is not limited by the constrictions of clinging, of tightness, of fear, of ambition that get in the way of life of being. That lives, life that lives, a division of freedom. So to be disillusioned, to be disenchanted is a very important part. So there's two things, general categories of things we can be disenchanted with. One is the objects of desire, the objects of enchantment. The other is with enchantment itself, with desire itself. And part of, I think, one of the wonderful movements in mindfulness practice is to realize the distinction between the object of what we want and the wanting itself. And some people say that in practice you don't have to give up any desires. What you do is you give up the object so the desire can still be there. But we tend to have those two entangled. But we can get disillusioned also in the desire for the object because we can really feel that some of the ways in which we cling and want, the ambition we have, the drivenness, the addictive quality, the preoccupation we have, it doesn't matter what the object is, but that drivenness is so painful, so difficult, so sore within us. And some of us, only by pursuing many different things, one after the other, we realize it's not so much a thing that I'm pursuing, but it's the nature of this addictive quality of my wanting, my wanting mind, which is really the issue here. And so it can start getting disenchanted, not for the objects of wanting, but with the very movement of clinging itself. I think ultimately that's wiser because then we don't end up letting go inappropriately of particular objects of desire because some things are okay to have and to desire, but we let go of that clinging, we let go of the compulsion connected to them. The next step in this 12 stages of dependent origination is, it's a little bit awkward, I don't know quite the best, I mean there's no good English translation for the Pali. The Pali is Vi Raga. And it comes from the word Raga, Vi is kind of the ending of, Raga is, maybe some of you studied Sanskrit or the Kamasukta or something, Raga is a very powerful language, a powerful word in Sanskrit or India, and has many many different meanings. It comes from the root, Raga means to color, or to dye, to taint something with a color. And so Vi Raga literally means the fading away of the coloring. But Raga also means, has a meaning of, there's a whole bunch of different meanings, but in the Buddhist sense probably the closest literal meaning, aside from the etymological meaning, is the word lust. And the three, what's called, three children of Mara, the three are lust, hate and bewilderment. And that lust is here is Raga. Some people translate Raga as passion, and so Vi Raga is dispassion. There's a very important par state, it's become dispassion. But that doesn't work so well I think in English because the word passion has a wider, you know, it isn't just simply the passion of lust or the passion of hate, but also there's quite appropriate passions to have, quite strong zeal, sense of zeal and excitement for certain projects and things. So probably the best word here is a fading away, as a translation of Vi Raga. So with the disenchantment comes a fading away of the compulsion for desire, the compulsion to hate, the compulsion to cling to these preoccupations that we're going to have, the fading of greed, hate and delusion. This is also, can be flipped over, and the opposite kind of way of talking about this is the strengthening of equanimity, that the mind and the heart starts becoming much more equinanimous with our experience. So there isn't this constant pushing and pulling to things. Our likes and dislikes, our preferences often lead us constantly, very, there's a kind of, you pay careful attention to your moment-to-moment experience in life. You'll see this tremendous amount of moving towards things and away from things, wanting and not wanting. Just the way you come into a room and sit down, some people will look around and move because they want to sit near someone, or they want to sit away from someone, or they want to sit, you know, they have a good place or a bad place, kind of movement towards and away from. As practice deepens, and especially in the context of intensive retreats, this movement of subtle movements of clinging and aversion begin fading away, and what replaces it is not some empty kind of void or dull kind of state, but rather this very powerful and intensely in a sense pleasurable state, it's usually called equanimity. Equanimity is not a kind of even kind of dull place, it's actually quite alive and powerful, but it's called the teflon mind, that nothing sticks on it. It's the mind which is so powerful and so powerful. It's a mind which is so luminous and clear that there might be a rising for a moment of hate, but there's no, it doesn't stick anywhere. Just kind of, you know, there's no enchantment with it, there's no hoarding, there's no hooks or it doesn't trigger anything. And the mind then, the overall mind might within it have certain movements of hate or desire, but it just kind of, it's just like this, there's no, it has no juice to it. And the mind itself stays completely balanced and open and doesn't contract in any kind of way, or doesn't participate in any way with these thoughts of desire or aversion. And slowly, slowly the desire and aversion fades away, and it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it's just kind of, it just kind of comes away and the equanimity becomes stronger and stronger. And equanimity is quite wonderful in its own right, but the, in the context of intensive practice, as we start seeing very deeply the impermanence of things, we start seeing very deeply our disenchantment and fading away, then that equanimity functions as a springboard for the possibility of what's called release. And this is a, the Pali word for this is vimutti here. And vimutti means, some people translate as emancipation, liberation, but release is the best word. It's actually, it's related to etymology of the word, to untie or to release. And the, and in that, Buddhist project is to free ourselves from clinging, the entanglement of clinging. The goal then is to, is the release, the release of that entanglement, to untangle, to the knots that bind our heart, the chains of fear and reoccupation, desire we have. And so to have the experience of release, to release ourselves, to release the mind, to release the heart. And now this is maybe not a doesn't seem to be a very illustrious or noble goal. And maybe some wonder if there's other religions have more wonderfully descriptions of their ultimate goal. But in Buddhism, the ultimate goal is the release and the sense and we maybe say the sense of grace that comes from that. But Buddhists usually don't want to say anything more about grace, about release. They simply release, there's no purpose for experiencing release beyond itself. Many people in the West, they want more purposes, what's it good for? But the experience of release is just there for itself. And there are many lists of the kind of things we get released from, the kind of clings we get released from. And there's one very common list of four. And it might be interesting for you to go through the list. One is, I'll start to kind of do a new list upside down to make it more appealing. So the first thing we get really, the first thing we get released from is our attachment, our clinging to religious practices and precepts. Isn't that good? I mean, oh, I can do that one. Finally, you know, a religion that tells me just to drop it all. And now it isn't supposed to, you know, if I was to stop or drop entirely your religious practices and your moral life, but it's the attachment to it, which creates a tremendous problem for people, not only for individuals, but for their friends and family around them, as we all know. And so it's very, very important to not to cling to spiritual practice as a lifesaver, as the right way or the true way. But, and if this is one of the more, this is one of the more tenacious forms of clinging that human humans have, is this clinging to religion itself or practices itself. And so the Buddha said, this is one of the things we have to be released from. The next one is to our, somewhat related to this first one, but the next one is our attachment to opinions. And again, we know that there's doesn't take much analysis to realize that there's a tremendous suffering in attachment to opinions, our way, the true way, the right way. This is the way it has to be. And then the next attachment is the attachment to self. In some sense, this may be one of the root, really important issues in, in for suffering. There's so much suffering arises out of the sense of self and so much sense of, of joy or freedom of delight that can come when we're no longer operating under the attachment, the clinging. This is who I am and this is who I have to maintain myself as a person. I've been having these long conversations with Tanisravika, who was here a few weeks ago, about the Buddhist teaching of not-self. And oddly enough, I have a PhD in Buddhism and having these long conversations with him. And I can't quite understand the Buddhist teaching of not-self yet. He's trying to get it into me, you know, and I don't quite get it. Can you believe it? At least his, at least his understanding I'm not getting. And when I was driving down here today, kind of thinking a little bit about what he was saying, trying to tell me. And I think that what he was trying to say is that someone who's enlightened is not interested in whether there is or isn't a self. The question of there's no self is not a Buddhist concern. And a lot of Buddhists who say there is no self, Tanisravika says, I've misunderstood the whole teachings of not-self. Buddhism doesn't teach you there's no self, it doesn't teach you that it is a self. It's just not interested in the question. And doesn't want to answer it. If you ask a Buddha, is there a self or is there no self, point blank, the Buddha will not answer. And so why doesn't he want to answer those questions? That's why I'm trying, that's why I don't quite understand why doesn't the Buddha want to answer that question, that those two questions. And I think maybe from what Tanisravika was trying to say is an enlightened person does not have the kind of self-conscious reflection. Their self, they're aware of their movements, their feelings, their thoughts and all these things. But an enlightened person doesn't have self-conscious reflection where the reflection of themselves, understanding of what happens isn't related to a category of self or a category there's no self. It's kind of like you look out of a clear window and you don't even see the window. So it's kind of like that, you don't see this, there's no self or not self to talk about because there's no that kind of reflection. So not to have any kind of reference to a self, but still to function in the world with great mindfulness and care. And then the final, at least four attachments, attachment to rights and rituals, the attachment to opinions, the attachment to self. The last one, which is usually the first one, which I say because some people will shut down as soon as I mention it, is the attachment to sensual pleasure. And over and over again, this is actually stressed a lot in Buddhism that is a very important kind of very root attachment people have is to comfort and pleasure. And it isn't that these things are wrong or bad in any kind of way, you're welcome to have them, but it's one of the things we tend to get attached to and cling to. And it's the clinging to it which is the problem. And when there's ultimate release, the final vimhuti, the liberation, the person is no longer attached to or clings to sensual pleasure to pleasure. They enjoy it when it comes, when it's not there, it's basically okay. So disenchantment leads to a fading away of our drivenness, our compulsion. And the fading away of drivenness and compulsion becomes a form of equanimity. And when the mind is completely equinanimous and no longer moving away from or towards anything, that allows the possibility for the mind to really see in a deep way the fundamental clings we have and then to release them also, to be released from them. And in this experience of release, which sometimes in Buddhism is called the great happiness, the Mahasukha. And some Buddhists will say that it's the only reliable happiness is the happiness of release, because that's the happiness which in a sense is permanent. Any kind of way qualifies as some kind of permanent happiness. Perhaps I'm not quite sure why they say this, but I think one of the reasons maybe is that when the mind is released, the absence of great hate and delusion, the complete, the claim in Buddhism as you can do through deep practice come to a final complete ending, fading away of all our greed and our hate and their delusion. And when that comes to a complete end, the absence of that, that is permanent. The absence of something can be permanent. So the absence of those things allows for the possibility of a kind of happiness that is permanent because it's based on the absence of something which is once and for all gone. Does that make sense? The absence is not a conditioned thing. It's not a fabricated thing. So those are my thoughts. And we have one more step in this 12 stages. I hope you do. I don't know if you've kept count as we went along. But we have one more. We'll talk about next time I come in probably two weeks and then we'll be finished with these 12 wonderful steps. Any questions today or comments? Yes, Ellen. Generally in Buddhist discourse there's no difference. In English popular discourse there's a difference because attachment has a range of meanings, a range of kind of understandings. And it can also mean for many people a simple affection, a kind of bonding. Like we were involved with a little bit of studying what's called attachment parenting. Attachment parenting has to do with real bonding and real sense of connectedness and affection that's there. I don't think it necessarily meant clinging, though sometimes it certainly seems to be the result. Mommy, mommy, daddy. So in Buddhist discourse attachment is always a bad guy in a sense, right? It's always kind of what's being addressed as being the problem. But it's very awkward then when we talk to people who don't limit the definition to a Buddhist term and have a wider understanding and say what's wrong with attachment? So it can just mean affection and so hopefully that clears up the confusion. So for Buddhists clinging and attachment are basically synonymous. And the relationship of those two things, desire? Well desire also is maybe this way. Desire is a, if you take a look at it, it's like set theory. Desire is like the biggest set and then there's subsets within that of kinds of desire, subcategories of desire. And some subcategories of desire are wholesome and useful and helpful. And some, like it gets you to the bathroom in time, for example, or whatever. And some desires are characterized with clinging and contraction. So it isn't that all desires are problematic, it's those desires that come together with drivenness. Maybe. I think it's a little bit hard to figure out does the egg come before the chicken or chicken before the egg. And the Buddha said that the beginning of suffering cannot be found. So just where it all begins. Because some of our desires arise because of our attachments. We're attached already and then we want something. And some of our attachments arise because of the desire there first. The desire is there and then we latch onto the desire. And it's kind of hard actually. In particular instances you can see where you can see the causal connections. But as a generalization it's very hard to decide whether the chicken or the egg comes first. Yeah. When you talk about attachment or clinging I always have difficulty in relating that to a permanent relationship of marriage. So I don't, I don't, because in the attachment with a with your partner that's a very strong attachment and you want to sustain that relationship. So how do you let go of that and then in terms of what you're going to say? I'm not sure what to say. The love and affection very quickly gets entangled with our other issues. Our clings and our desires. We want to have something. We're attached to security for example. We want the pleasure. We want, you know, there's a lot of attachments that can be mixed up with love. But love itself doesn't have to have any attachment. When I was about 19 or 20 I got somewhat enamored with a woman and then I went away for the summer and there was no chance of pursuing it. But I thought about her a lot and I discovered in kind of reflecting on it the joy of unrequited love. And I realized that there was this kind of sense of pleasure and delight in this person. But that the pleasure and delight existed independent of my wanting something from that relationship. And there are actually two separate things which I hadn't seen before. I thought that my desire was intimately connected with the sense of delight with that person. A sense of love or whatever I felt there. So I think that the task of practice in terms of relationship is to disentangle the best we can. The clings and the attachments that come with the sense of wonderful connection we can feel with people. And so not to give up the relationship but to in a sense to purify it or clarify it. I suspect that some people discover this naturally as they get older. That some of the ways, just like growing up you know I said earlier, that some of the ways which we were... I suspect that relationships go through phases over years and decades. And some of the ways that we were related early, early might have a lot of attachment but then maybe later things mellow out and we relax and maybe there's less and less as we get older or something. I don't know. I have to wait and see. Yes. Did I just answer your question well enough or did I address your concern? Yes. We claim to our desires and we claim to objects and then there's also craving. It seems to somehow come in there or is that part of desire? What's the difference between craving and clinging for you? That's what I'm asking you. What the relationship might be. Well, craving for me is one having to have something. I see. So that's probably from an attachment that I already have or a clinging that I already have to the memory of the pleasure that I had before. I just said maybe the difference between... I never thought about this but I guess it may be the difference between craving and clinging is that clinging you cling to what you already have or you think you have. Whereas craving is you cling to the future, something you want in the future. So that's a nice distinction. Bud. As a parent, how do you watch your child's bonding, praying to you? Sometimes with exhaustion. I don't know if you have a question. Well, I don't feel like... I'm just kind of barely getting my bearings. I feel it's being apparent. It seems to me like a little bit complicated issue because some of the things that he really needs or wants, the clinging, is probably developmental and really needs to be fulfilled and met with. And then some things... It's very clear right now that some things he really wants is really a testing of limits. And really what he... It seems like a couple of times it was really clear that he really wanted... I don't know if he wanted but he was waiting. He was going to draw with a marking pen, not just in the paper where I told him, but he was kept looking at, kind of do it here on the table, only on the paper, kind of do it on the wall. And to finally, you should take it away from him. And that's what's called for. So some of the clinging or some of the compulsion or the drivenness, some of it you meet and give lots of love to and some that I suppose you set limits. And some things are in between. So other people are parents. Well it just comes to me around that, I can't believe it, is that it's more like what the reaction is to the clinging. I mean, if there is a reaction to someone else's clinging, that means usually that I still have issues around that. So it's not so much what's done about it, but what comes up around it. Well I think that's very wise. I think that our ability to model or to be an example of someone who does not cling, but responds appropriately without clinging or aversion, is very, very important. So regardless of how my son responds, that if he's met with someone who doesn't do that, I think that hopefully will, by osmosis, help him as he gets older. So I try, you know, it's always hard. Yes? I think that I think that I think for a higher degree, whether it is the degree, whether it is time to tell attention to their religious writing, and then writing to the temple, that everyone can make it. Yeah, but being a father myself now, I think there's a difference between, again, maybe between here, there's a difference between clinging and attachment or bonding. And I think that, you know, I feel a tremendous bonding with my son, that I don't think is a kind of clinging, but I don't know what to think. It seems to be almost biological, you know, just seems to be in the nature of that relationship. And so I sympathize very much with the father really on, and I tend to give some priority to that. You know, maybe there's clinging in the father also, but there's also some more primary kind of bonding that goes on there that might look in some ways like clinging, but I don't think it is. And I was very glad that today, The Day's Chronicle, at first I opened up and it was this horrible picture of the boy frightened. And then, but then afterwards I looked a little picture up in the corner, and I guess it was a few hours later, and he was so happy. And the father finally was happy. You remember all the pictures of the father? He always looked so, you know, down. And then finally, his father had this great smile too. It just made me really happy. I identified very much with the father in this situation. Yes. My children are grown up, I lived here with my grandchildren, and I lived with my grandchildren a whole lot, and I didn't live with my own children. And the distinction, I think, was very helpful with the distinction about crazy, because it seems to me that as children grow up, they have a lot of craving about what they want to do. That's kind of distinctly this whole world, and unless there are limitations, they're just out there. And what's been surprising about when my children were teenagers, is that they were constantly testing, and it was all that. And then when the lines put down, and they were, you know, in that stand, the room wouldn't go out, they looked at it. They couldn't help it, that they initially complained about it. And then at that stand for a whole week, they got sweeter and sweeter. And we were like, finally, they didn't realize it. And I didn't realize that these things, isn't that strange? You know, they really like it. So it seems like as children are growing and developing, there's some sort of developmental push for wanting all the stuff that they see, and that's kind of natural. Yeah, I guess I'm wondering about this also. Maybe it's that the world is such a huge place, and so confusing, that to finally have some structure in order to it, that allows children sometimes to relax. Because I've seen that, you know, and heard about this, what you described often. So we'll see. So, last one, yes. I just wanted to add my sister from the parenting thing, but I think that it's important that we not confuse your dependence of clinging also, that truly, you know, we are their security in their early years. And I've watched my kids grow up, and all three of them grew up at different rates. And my third one, people would say to me, oh, well, he's old enough for that. Well, he's old enough for that. And for whatever reason, he wasn't old enough. And there was a really strong dependence, which appeared to other people that he was like clinging or, you know, too attached or too good for that. But we kind of had this philosophy that was, it was before attachment parenting, but it was attached with before. We used to have to walk him at eight years old still walking four laps to play with a friend. And, you know, everybody said, oh, he's too old for that. Well, one day he got up from the table and said, I'm going to go play with Joey. And we said, okay. And we looked around, well, who's going to walk him over there, you know? And he said, oh, no problem. Then walked out the front door. And then my two older kids and myself were just sitting there with like our mouths open. And I'm like, oh my God, what happened? You know, it was like, you know, we just were so patient with it that eventually that happened. And I think we can be really quick to misjudge, you know, another person's needs in labor. It's really important to, you know, grant them their timetable on. I completely agree. That's a very important distinction between dependence and clinging, craving. So thank you very much. And, this should be lovely next week without you, Admiral. So I look forward to coming and thank you all and hope you, you know, part of the opportunity and Sunday morning we had in mind was that you hang out a little bit and they meet each other. And because often people don't have to rush off and eat like we do Monday evenings. So when you come on Sundays, if remember to think, keep that in the back of your mind that to meet, to introduce yourself to people around here you haven't met before. I hope we're a friendly crowd. Thank you.
