 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, everyone. Good day. Hello. Greetings from Insight Meditation Center. I'm very glad to be back here. It's been, I don't know how long it's been, maybe six weeks that I've been away. And, or so, five weeks. And, from traveling and teaching and different things. And now I am coming back from Insight Retreat Center where I just finished teaching a week-long retreat. So, a little bit I feel like a beginner sitting here, being away. And I'll use that as a theme for today. Also, maybe it's appropriate to feel like a beginner in that I mark today as maybe the, approximately the beginning of the, maybe it's next week, beginning of the, or finishing, this week is finishing three years of these 7 a.m. YouTube teachings. And next week, I guess, we begin the fourth year. So, thank you all for being here. And in the theme of being a beginner, I think it's useful to consider, maybe realize, that when we meditate, we mostly meditate as a beginner. That mostly it's like we're starting over, or, and then sometimes as we get settled and mature in the practice, there are times when we have, we course along with some kind of more experienced, deeper meditation. But often in the vagaries of life, we sit down to meditate and it's kind of like starting over. So, we're all beginners. But the difference between someone who's a beginner, a real, you know, really beginning, someone who's an experienced beginner, has done a lot of beginning, is that the attitude with which they meditate, how they meditate, the how they're aware, how they concentrate. And as people become more experienced, they're more relaxed about how, and also more dedicated. And this combination of being calmly dedicated without striving, without judging, without bringing all the baggage of me, myself, and mine along when I meditate. My experience, what's happening, I'm doing it wrong, I'm doing it right, what should it be? As people come more and more experienced, they just settle in and are more at ease with being a beginner and just going through the basic instructions. So, I'll offer you some of those today. So, to assume a meditation posture. And what's nice with a, being caring and careful about the posture you take, that it's a posture that feels unobstructed. Somehow we're sitting in such a way that there's no obstructions. And that's part of the advantage of the classic posture of the Buddha sitting upright and cross-legged posture, is that there's no obstructions in this body, no places that are contracted or limited or collapsed. Sometimes if we sit too comfortably in a couch, it might be comfortable, but maybe there's a way in which the shoulders and the upper body is kind of curled and curved in such a way that it doesn't really allow, kind of obstructs, it kind of compresses a little bit the chest. Unobstructed posture. And then to gently close your eyes. And without much more ado, to take a few moments to recognize, to know how you are in your body, how you are in your mind and heart, and how you know it is important to know it simply, matter-of-factly. To know it without being for or against. And in recognizing how you are, now going into your body, feel what that feels like. The somatic experience of how you are in your body, in your mind, in your heart. And again, how you feel is important. And feel it with radical simplicity, not having an agenda or a need imposed on what it feels like. Not trying to change anything. But offering a respectful attention in feeling, sensing how you are somatically. And then to relax the body. Relax the body on the exhale. And how you relax is important. To relax without trying too hard. Or trying hard at all, just relaxing, simply, matter-of-factly, content in doing so. In whatever way is easy. And now, maybe taking a few longer, deeper inhales. Gently on the exhale, relaxing deeper. And the relaxation that follows it longer exhale, all the way to the end of the exhale. And now, letting the breathing return to normal. Recognizing, knowing what it's like for your body to be breathing now. And how you know is important, being content to know it in whatever way is most obvious. No need to analyze or bore down, just the simplest way, knowing what it's like for your body to be breathing. And then to feel what it's like for the body to be breathing. Feeling the somatic experience of breathing. And then, without any ambition of how well you can do this, gently soften and relax the breathing. Soften the muscles that engage around breathing. Maybe softening the muscles of the belly. And then, to be with your breathing in a simple way. Resting and breathing. And whichever is easiest to help you stay with your breaths, helping you quiet your mind. Stay with the knowing, recognizing, inhales and exhales. Or stay resting in the feeling, the somatic sensations of breath. Riding those sensations, and with every exhale, quieting the thinking mind. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And breathing. And as we come to the end of this sitting, perhaps we're always a beginner in our relationships to other people. People are always changing, we're changing, context changes. And to be a beginner is to be willing to not bring with us the old beliefs, associations, ideas of who people are, but to see them freshly. But more important, as we become experienced in meditation, we learn that the how we're aware is important. We learn to be aware without our judgments, preferences, and agendas and needs. We learn to see others simply and openly with our feelings about them. Still feeling the way we do, but to see them, to know them without the filter of the feelings. Feelings are one thing and seeing is another. To see freshly, without philosophy, without cynicism and skepticism, just see. Perhaps to see then with kindness, with goodwill, with the friendliness, with care, to gaze upon this world kindly as a beginner. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings know deep contentment. May all beings know that they are respected. May all beings be free. And may we contribute to that possibility. Amen.
