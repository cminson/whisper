 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go with our meditation. So, for finding a posture that's easeful for you and also alert. Allow yourself some time to do this. And perhaps noticing if you have any set ideas about what it is to be in a meditation posture. Or a set of preferred physical sensations you think you need in order to meditate. Well, just notice those ideas. Allowing time to release, perhaps soften any tension in the body, the heart, the mind. If there is tension, or lack of ease, noticing it. And just allowing it to be just as it is. Also noticing if there are any experiences you're trying to have, or trying not to have. Just letting that into awareness as well. Aware of how any of those ideas feel as they're received in the body. And softening around them if possible, or releasing whatever arises, allowing it to pass, when it's ready to pass. Aware of any feeling of unpleasantness, or pleasantness, or even no strong feelings at all. There's nothing right or wrong here, or good or bad. Just receiving into awareness. Recognizing if there's wanting or not wanting, receiving that in awareness. Allowing it to arise and pass. Knowing experiences as they are. Whether they persist or are brief appearances. Recognizing knowing. Perhaps relaxing. Or softening. And also recognizing any thinking that arises or is present. Noticing your relationship with any thinking. Are you tending to dive into it? Tending to push it away? Just allowing it to drift through. Recognizing what's happening. Aware of any sense of wanting things to be a certain way in the body, in the heart, in the mind. Awareness receiving it, recognizing it. Allowing it to pass through in its own time. And if from time to time it's helpful, and the question can arise in awareness, what am I aware of? Just as a way to keep bringing the attention back to allowing and recognizing whatever is present now as we continue with the meditation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
