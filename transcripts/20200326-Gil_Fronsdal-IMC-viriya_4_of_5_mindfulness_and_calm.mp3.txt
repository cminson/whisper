Viriya  (4 of 5): Mindfulness and Calm  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 26, 2020  
 
 
Good morning. Thank you for the sitting. I’ll continue 
now with this series of talks about effort. The talks are 
somewhat progressive. As people practice meditation 
and develop along the Buddhist path, the kind of effort 
that is needed changes . It develops, grows, and evolves 
over time . Sometimes , it may be circular or spiral. We 
often begin again and again with that initial effort.  
 
What I have talked about so far is the effort that we put 
into the practice . Initiating effort  – beginning again an d 
again , over and over – can take a lot of work. 
Sometimes the forces pulling us in opposite direction 
from practice – desire, addiction, hatred, fear – are so 
strong that it can take a lot of work to come back and 
begin again. We take our seat, take our p lace, and are 
mindful.  
 
As we are able to be more present, we can contribute 
our choice. We notice the dividing line , or the fork in the 
path between the mental states, thoughts , and emotions 
that take us toward greater stress and suffering , and 
those tha t lead to greater ease , happiness , well-being , 
or wisdom . There is choice involved . We choose one over the other, let ting go of one , and pick ing up the 
other. And then we make some effort.  
 
Part of the art of meditation is making effort that is 
continuous and persistent. Yesterday I talked about 
relaxed persistence. We have to offer something. 
Sometimes that offering of ourselves is to be more 
continuous – a continual opening up and allowing the 
attention to be there  – rather than holding the attention 
present. The balance between making effort and 
allowing effort is part of the art of finding our way.  
 
These  first three days had to do with  what we offer. But 
at some point, as we settle in and have enough 
relaxation, a kind of momentum or movement happens  
– something  is being done to us . Rather than we 
ourselves practicing , we are being practiced.  
 
I sometimes think of this as Dharma energy , or the 
Dharma begin ning to move through us. As the Dharma  
moves through us, something begins to unfold. T he 
pieces  come  into place through our practice , allowing  
for this inner process of healing , evolving , or liberating , 
which flows and moves through us .  
 
The Buddha used a lot of different metaphors to refer to 
this inner movement that is not of our doing. The 
previous effort puts together the conditions, and creates 
the right environment for this seed to grow and become a great plant. Or, the boulder cover ing the spring is 
taken away , so that now the water can flow out from the 
spring. Something begins to flow within us  – to open 
and evolve within us.  
 
We learn to recognize and allow for something within 
us, which is not us, to begin to operate. It’s n ot the 
person we identity as the one  having agency or being in 
charge. It’s n ot the ideas we organize ourselves around 
to get along in the world , and which are often useful . But 
as the practice gets deeper, if we only stay in th e part of 
ourselves we identify with, then we won’t allow for this 
deeper Dharma energy to flow and evolve.  
 
Sometimes I think of this Dharma energy as a relative of 
the idea of qi. At some point as we sit, this qi or energy 
arises from inside us to awaken and lift us . It keep s us 
engag ed in the practice , and i t becomes almost second 
nature to be alert and present. We don’t have to work at 
it. Mostly, w e have to keep the boulders away from the 
spring, keep the weeds away from the plants. We clear 
the ground, and let go of the distractions in order to 
allow this kind of energy or aliveness to move through 
us.  
 
Movements of compassion can well up. Some of  the 
deepest forms of compassion, love, or care  are not 
those  we intentionally bring up , but rather they  happen 
when we make space  for them. We might have the intention for this. The intention is like opening the door 
to a particular room where compassion lives and can 
flow forth.  
 
We can allow for wisdom, for greater, deeper 
understanding  or intuition about how to find our way . 
Rather than think ing it out  or solv ing it with our minds , 
it’s more like we relax enough to let our important 
concerns be process ed, so that solutions , ideas , and 
perspectives  can well up from within.  
 
The more we allow this Dharma energy  to flow, the 
more things seem  like second nature. If you put your 
hand on a hot stove, the hand will pull away. It’s second 
nature to pull away  and not get burned . At some point a 
greater sensitivity can come with mindfulness if we are 
relaxed and calm. We become sensitive to the slightest 
little ouch, the slightest little place we hurt ourselves , 
getting contracted or caught in anger , or hostility , or 
some addiction. We are sensitive to how it hurts in a 
way that we can’t be sensitive to the subjective  impact if 
we are caught or blinded by the object of our desire or ill 
will. If we relax enough to really settle in and feel what is 
happening when we are  caught in the grip of desire or 
hostility, then we see,  “Oh, this hurts. ”  
 
As we start feeling that sensitivity, of course we take our 
hand away from the stove. It’s not like we even choose 
to do it. The whole system, the Dharma system that we are, begins to relax and pull away. Then, sooner or 
later, we begin to feel the benefit s of practice – the 
sense of relaxation, the qualities of freedom and ease 
that come along with the practice. Then, of course we 
lean toward that.  
 
The whole system is like gravity. If you put a ball at the 
top of a slope, it will roll downhill. Our whole  system 
wants to roll down toward greater and greater freedom. 
As we get a sense of freedom and openness in 
meditation, then of course , our whole heart and system 
want to flow downhill  and keep opening. It’s a lot of work 
to stay contracted  and tight. So of course , it wants to 
relax and rest.  
 
We start becoming sensitive to, aware that something 
else is operating in this practice besides what we do or 
are in charge of. We are in charge of initiating effort. We 
are in charge of some choices between what is 
wholesome and unwholesome, useful and not useful. 
We are in charge of trying to support the continuity of 
awareness throughout the day.  
 
But as these begin to grow, we start to become 
sensitive to something else operating, something we 
can’t quite take as being personal. It’s in us , and is part 
of us in a sense , but not what we usually identify as 
being me, myself, and mine. It’s helpful not to identify it 
that way , but to realize that something much greater  is supporting us. A wonderful natural process wit hin us 
has tremendous capacity for support and goodness.  
 
And so we begin to become sensitive to th e deeper 
thing s operating . At first , it may be just a little shy 
whisper, hesitant to show itself. We want to be quiet and 
caring of it, not frighten it , or grab hold of it. Rather, we 
slowly allow  it to grow and develop.  
 
The more we are aware of it, the more we open to it and 
hold th is Dharma energy, Dharma momentum  – the 
more space it has to grow. It’s like awareness is the 
sun, and Dharma energy is the plant. We bring the sun 
of awareness so that the Dharma plant can become 
great. Sooner of later, that plant will grow and develop 
wonderf ul fruit. And one day that fruit, like an apple, will 
fall from the tree into the palm of your heart.  
 
May all of your fruits bring you great freedom as they fall 
into your heart.  
 
Thank you very much for being here today. Tomorrow I 
will do the last of this series on effort. Next week I will 
go on to the next of the five faculties, which is 
mindfulness , and  I will offer a series of five talks on five 
different aspects of mindfulness.  
 
Thank you all very much.
