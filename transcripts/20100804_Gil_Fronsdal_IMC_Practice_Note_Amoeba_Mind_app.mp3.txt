Practice Note: Amoeba Mind

One of the important areas for mi ndfulness practice is to 
notice  the feeling tone, or the hedonic  tone, of our 
experience. All the things we experience have one of 
three different feeling tones : they are either  pleasant, 
unpleasant , or neither pleasant nor unpleasant. There 
are a variety of different kinds of pleasant things, of 
unpleasant things , and of things that can be neutral. 
Sometimes to just see these feeling tones – not their 
individual, unique characteristics – but to just see 
whether they’re pleasant or unpleasant is very 
informative . Many times, how we react to our 
experience, is not by reacting to the details of the 
experience, but rather to  simply  whether it’s pleasant , 
unpleasant , or neutral.  
 
Sometimes there’s a reaching forward to hold onto, or 
grasp, or want wh at is pleasant . And there’s resistance, 
or contraction, or pushing away, or aversion to what we 
don’t like.  Sometimes there’s confusion  or delusion 
when our experience is  neutral  – we don’t know how to 
relate to it. It’s very interesting to just simply loo k upon 
things from the perspective of whether they’re pleasant , 
unpleasant , or neutral – and just see that part of it . And then see how you react based on that , without making  it 
any more complicated.  
 
In terms of sitting and walking this morning, if you’re 
interested in this, just do the simplest mindfulness 
practice of the breath, being present here for your 
breath, and whenever something makes it difficult for 
you to be with the breath, or takes you a way from the 
breath, then notice whether that experience is pleasant 
or unpleasant, or whether it is connected to something 
pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.  See if you can notice 
this in a very simple way. D on’t analyz e the detail s.  
 
How are you in relati onship to that pleasant or 
unpleasant? Are you for it? Are you against it? Are you 
balanced? Are you equanimou s? Or is there some 
contraction , resistance?  Or is there  some holding on, 
some way in which you get involved with the 
experience?  
 
You can do t he same practice with the walking 
meditation : simply  staying with the steps as you walk, 
trying to be present  as best you can, getting into the 
mindfulness of the walking.  But if something happens  
that pulls your attention away, or makes it difficult for 
you to be present, then look at it through the 
perspective of whether that experience is pleasant or 
unpleasant , and see what you ca n learn about the 
simple amoeba -like reaction that we often have.   
Sometimes very complicated philosophies, or even 
political positions,  have their genesis not in well -
reasoned, logical argum ents or understanding. T he 
well-reasoned , logical arguments can be  a cover -over, 
or a justification, for the amoeba -like reaction we have 
that we want to avoid what’s unpleasant , and we wa nt 
to keep what’s pleasant. It’s  sometimes quite humbling 
to realiz e that we operate in this  way. 
 
If you’ve never done this before , it can be  an interesting 
experiment to keep the mindfulness really simple , and 
just see how you are with the plea sant, unpleasant, and 
neutral aspect s of your lived experience.  
 
I hope you enjoy your morning. Thank you.
