Welcome friends, it's good to be here with you.
I'd like to continue the exploration of the orientation to experience that is cultivated through our practice,
and that we can also intentionally bring to how we are practicing.
In a sense, you could describe the unfolding of the practice as moving from identification with experience to simply knowing experience as experience.
That might sound like that's not a very freeing shift, and yet the experience of being identified with some reactivity in the mind,
some belief or construction or greed or aversion in the mind, and knowing,
oh, the mind is affected by greed or aversion in this moment, or, oh, the mind is believing this thought in this moment is a difference between stress and release and peace.
Our habit is often to struggle to get rid of unpleasant experience, such as our reactivity.
We might even interpret the practice instructions as saying that we should be doing this.
And yet the Satipa Tana instructions invite us to simply know whatever is arising in experience as simply what is arising in experience.
Paradoxically, we can know these states of reactivity with non-reactivity.
We can explore this possibility in our practice.
Perhaps there is agitation, restlessness, worry, confusion.
Is it possible to simply recognize that as such as it's happening?
That the knowing of confusion is not confused about knowing confusion. Oh, this is what confusion is like.
There can be a space of receiving experience simply as experience, even when the experience is something that the mind believes is in the way of practice.
Yet in the Satipa Tana Sutra, the Buddha lays out these aspects of experience that we are to include and simply know when they arise.
When there is aversion, we simply know, oh, the mind is affected by aversion.
This is the pattern of greed arising. This is restlessness. This is doubt. This is some agitation.
It's not to try to change it. It's to actually to understand it.
So the invitation is to notice the habitual tendency to pull away from and try to get away from and get rid of the unpleasant.
Notice the impact of that on our well-being.
I trust that we've all had a taste of an unpleasant experience being the source of a lot of agitation and stress and suffering.
And then there being a shift into no longer identifying with the experience, but letting the experience just be what it is.
There's some pain here. There's some sadness here.
And when that's no longer a problem, when that's no longer a struggle against, there can be a deep and profound peace and freedom and ease,
even in the midst of an experience that we think is in the way of peace and ease.
In fact, those experiences can be met with love and can be a source of love and warmth and compassion arising for the poignancy and the tenderness and the difficulty in being human.
We release from these patterns of stress and struggle. We come through understanding our experience.
You're understanding the nature of our experience and also the patterns that give rise to stress and suffering, this habitual reactivity and push and pull.
We can't understand our reactivity or experience if we're constantly trying to just change it and get rid of it and make it be how we think it should be.
And yet this pattern of trying to get our experience to be how we think it should be is deeply conditioned and will inevitably continue to unfold in our practice.
And we can include that. We can include that. And that doesn't have to be a problem.
Recognizing the relationship to experience becomes an object of our practice rather than the filter through which we are practicing.
We can know, oh, the mind, yeah, the mind is wanting this to go away. The mind is trying to change this. Or the mind is trying to create the kind of meditative experience that it thinks it should be having, trying to create some kind of clarity or stillness.
And we can just know, oh, what is this pull? What is this pull or push? What does that feel like? And get to understand and become intimate with it.
When we let our experience take its course and do what it naturally does, we're more able to observe in a way that allows for this learning to unfold.
Mindfulness practice is, in a sense, a process of gathering information. We're supporting our minds in this natural learning process.
We're gathering information about our lived reality so that this understanding can naturally arise.
With understanding or wisdom comes greater and greater ease, greater and greater capacity for peace and kindness, generosity, love.
These patterns of manipulation or reactivity that are very deeply conditioned, of course, we bring them into the way that we are practicing.
And we tend to just identify with this. An example could be sitting, we sit down to sit and you notice the mind is all over the place.
And so there's not a lot. We're trying to make it be more steady, but make it be more still or more calm, less agitated. And yet we can actually just settle back and receive, oh, the mind is all over the place.
And that can be the object of our meditation. It can be even very vague and diffuse and unclear in a sense. And yet we can clearly know that.
We're continually trying to corral our experience into the range of how we think it should be. And we're potentially really limiting ourselves in our capacity to open to newer and deeper and perhaps even more free aspects of our experience.
We can know these patterns and states and experiences very matter of factly, the quality of, oh, the mind is just struggling here.
Well, the mind is judging what's happening here. The mind is trying to do, trying to get it right. Feeling like it's not getting it right and judging itself.
It can be such a tender source of compassion to recognize that. We can recognize the viewer belief that we need to get somewhere or to do something with experience in a particular way, or that practice should look or feel a certain way.
We should be experiencing certain states or experiences that we associate with, quote, good practice.
And we can include the mind that is doing all of this in our practice. How is the mind with this?
Perhaps dropping in the question, what's being believed right now?
This can really help to shine a light on the views and beliefs that are operating under the surface and driving the reactivity that's happening.
There's a lot of agitation and I'm really unclear why. Perhaps dropping in the question, what's being believed right now might illuminate the belief, oh, if I'm practicing right, the mind will be peaceful.
And yet, in this description of right practice in the Satipatanasuta, the Buddha says, when the mind is peaceful, one knows the mind is peaceful.
And when the mind is agitated, one knows the mind is agitated.
It doesn't say when the mind is agitated, one gets rid of the agitation and brings in peace. But actually, this stepping back, there can be a wisdom and a peace that is even bigger than the container of what we normally think of as our experience in our practice.
These beliefs are simply, in terms of the five aggregates, are mental formations.
And this is also included in the description of what it is that we are to notice. Notice the arising and passing of beliefs. Notice the arising and passing of mental states and mental qualities.
Notice the arising and passing of creative version and delusion. And with the seven awakening factors, we can notice the arising and passing of the skillful qualities of mind.
Mindfulness and interest, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, wisdom.
There's no right or wrong object of meditation. We are cultivating these wholesome qualities in our practice. And there can often be the sense that we should be making them happen.
But rather, it's the quality of how we're attending to whatever is arising in our experience that will naturally cultivate these wholesome qualities.
So we don't have to try to make there be tranquility or concentration or wisdom.
Those arise naturally, those grow naturally out of the understanding that comes when we are observing and attending to moment-to-moment experience, however it is.
We're not holding on to the peace. We're trying to push away the agitation.
And when we observe that the mind naturally does this, of course it will, we learn that that kind of reactivity actually is what is at the root of our stress and suffering.
So through this really simple observation of what our minds are naturally doing, we get to include these reactive patterns that tend to cause stress and suffering.
And we also include and become interested in and aware of the patterns that lead to peace, to well-being, to ease, to release, to love.
So this learning process unfolds. As our minds get more and more information about what really is causing stress and suffering, those naturally get released.
The great fortune that our systems, our hearts and minds really naturally move towards what they recognize to be sources of well-being, sources of ease and peace.
And this is a really essential and transformative insight to begin to understand is that the craving in response to our experience that causes our dis-ease, not the unpleasant experience itself.
And that's part of the view or the belief that underlies craving and clinging.
Oh, this unpleasant experience is the cause of the unhappiness.
Or just if I could get that pleasant experience, that'll do it. That'll finally do it for me.
And of course, we all have this so deeply conditioned.
We get to really observe and understand our experience in this pattern through this really simple, sustained awareness of our moment-to-moment experience.
And begin to understand our experience in a way that really takes the wind out of the sails of those beliefs because the mind starts to see how experience actually works.
So this understanding through direct, direct experience dispels these distortions and misperceptions about our reality.
And so, the greed and aversion are rooted in the delusion of permanence, of there being a lasting sense of self that can be propped up or held on to.
We cling to things because we believe that they will provide a lasting sense of satisfaction.
And as we attend to our experience, we begin to understand and directly see its nature, this intuitive, direct understanding that unfolds.
That knows that, oh, there's actually nowhere really stable or solid to land in our experience.
It's just changing so quickly, constantly shifting, constantly moving from pleasant to unpleasant to neutral.
And that it's not ultimately governable.
It's not ultimately within our control. We can influence it, but we can't just make it how we be, how we want all the time.
Otherwise, we would.
His patterns are trying very hard and causing so much stress and tension and agitation.
And as our minds begin to understand this impermanent and conditioned and unreliable nature of experience.
And that not understanding these, that kind of not seeing these aspects of our experience is what underlies the mind's tendency to hold on tightly to cling, to identify.
And this understanding ripens what flows naturally from our hearts is all of these wholesome qualities, the Brahma Viharas, loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, which is the delight in the well-being of others.
And equanimity.
I'd like to read a poem by Venerable Lama Gendran Rinpoche.
It's called Free and Easy, a spontaneous Bajra song.
I actually like to receive this as practice instructions to perhaps contemplate how might this land and how might this inform how we are orienting to our practice and to our experience.
It begins, happiness cannot be found through great effort or willpower but is already present in open relaxation and letting go.
Don't strain yourself.
There is nothing to do or undo.
Whatever momentarily arises in the body mind has no real importance at all, has little reality whatsoever.
Why identify with and become attached to it, passing judgment upon it and ourselves.
Far better to simply let the entire game happen on its own.
Springing up and falling back like waves without changing or manipulating anything.
And notice how everything vanishes and reappears magically again and again, tying without end.
Only our searching for happiness prevents us from seeing it.
It's like a vivid rainbow which you pursue without ever catching or a dog chasing its own tail.
Although peace and happiness do not exist as an actual place or thing, it is always available and accompanies you in every instant.
Don't believe in the reality of good and bad experiences.
They are like today's ephemeral weather, like rainbows in the sky.
Wanting to grasp the ungraspable, you exhaust yourself in vain.
As soon as you open and relax this tight fist of grasping, infinite space is there.
Open, inviting and comfortable.
Make use of this spaciousness, this freedom and natural ease.
Don't search any further looking for the great awakened elephant who is already resting quietly at home in front of your own hearth.
Nothing to do or undo, nothing to force, nothing to want and nothing missing.
How amazing, everything happens by itself.
Nothing to do or undo, nothing to force, nothing to want
and nothing missing.
How amazing, everything happens by itself.
Thank you for your practice and attention.
And we have some bit more time for questions, comments, discussion, insights.
Anything that you'd like to share about your practice or ask a goat.
Yes, Amy.
Hello, Ari.
Hi.
Thank you for today.
It was a beautiful meditation.
I really was very touched by that poem that you just recited from memory.
I wonder if you could share maybe in the chat some clue as to how I could find a copy of that.
Maybe perhaps just the name of the teacher and the name of the piece.
Yeah, great. I'll post that here right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I had a silly question, I think it's silly.
I was more than usual, had problem solving thoughts going on about work and
the problem of solving itself is not, it's pretty neutral probably.
I think there's a little bit of anxiety there wanting to fix things.
It doesn't feel like I'm clinging to it.
It feels kind of neutral, but it's distracting, right?
And when I come back, I noticed a little bit of tightness, right?
So what would you call those kinds of thoughts?
Is that a version and clinging or is it just problem solving?
It feels different to me than playing it, which is one of my favorite though too.
Yeah, yeah.
Right.
Yeah, so if a clear mental note is really helpful,
I might experiment with just, sometimes for me, that kind of pattern feels a little bit like,
like, oh, the mind is just chewing, it's chewing on something,
or really, or there's something really sticky,
just this kind of, just feeling this kind of pull, this gravitational pull towards thinking about or problem solving,
or it's like, in those moments, I often find it really helpful to just to remind myself that it's conditioned.
It's like, oh, oh yeah, this is something that the mind has been doing a lot of.
And so when I sit down to meditate, it's like, that's where the mind goes.
So that there's more room for that to be included and not be a problem,
so you can actually include like, oh, and the mind is still really, really chewing on this or really pulled toward in this direction.
And of course, the mindfulness is going to come and go, you'll get lost in it, and you'll come back,
and where the mindfulness will arise again, and it's like, oh, I was kind of gone,
lost on that train for a while, and then just, how is it now?
Like, what's here now?
Like you said, some tension, that's very common to kind of land back into some tension when the mind comes back from thinking about something
or some kind of chewing on something, and really just to include that as part of what we are being with,
and not trying to stop it is, yeah, yeah.
Well, there's two, they thank you.
So that helps, there's two awarenesses as you were speaking, and I realize, one is, it's okay because,
I mean, it's just like you said, the condition, it means some part of me is working on problem,
that's all it means, right? And that's in some ways a good thing, right?
That's probably how we progress in life is, we chew on things, you know, and then they come out.
Yeah, just part of our human experience, yeah.
Right, but also, I realize that in this case at least today, in the nature of my work,
the things you're saying and the awarenesses, the awareness happening in me,
it is associative because I then think, oh, this would be helpful in this way, or this would be helpful in this way.
So my mind is going, you know, hold, and it's not even, you know, I'm not trying to make that happen, it just emerges, right?
This problem, how this poem or this saying or whatever the guiding is in the meditation would be helpful for that person or that thing.
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course, yeah, that sounds.
So that makes me have less aversion for it in a way, right?
Like, it's just conditioned, it's coming out of the moment, and there's something positive in it, even if it's drawing me out of the moment.
Right, right, yeah.
Yeah, that sounds really skillful to recognize that, that wholesome aspect of that, yeah, yeah.
That care that wanting to offer, offer support or offer help.
Or offer the Dharma.
Yeah, yeah.
That's just, yeah, as they say, is the greatest gift that can be given, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it really sounds like there's a skillful perspective on it and just really encourage the continuing to kind of regard that as just a natural,
a natural part of what we are training to or practicing with,
learning to be with in a skillful way, yeah, yeah.
In this unentangled way.
Thank you.
Yeah, Allison.
Yeah, thank you for that talk and that phone, both really, really beautiful and really settling. Thank you so much.
I was, I'm just coming off of a retreat about that focused on the hindrances and the beneficial factors awakening and I'm working so closely with the hindrances for a week.
I think I was thinking about that and then the, your theme of that you mentioned of, you know, not trying to make anything happen.
And I think that I, in working with the hindrances so closely I have been trying to make something happen.
I don't know, I'm just, I guess I'm just wondering how you balance that, that practice of, okay, this is here.
You know, this maybe non nourishing mindset is here, I'm aware of it I'm accepting it I'm saying yes to it, you know, allowing it feeling it, but also doing it in a way that's not pushing it away.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, great, great.
Do you want to say any more about the, that the quality of pushing it away that you notice.
Yeah, so the, the retreat was a wonderful retreat was with Gil, and as and, and they really gave some wonderful practices about allowing and accepting and kind of seeing the hindrances hindrance when it comes up as kind of like a sunset and, you know, wonderful that you're here that I can see you.
And that's, and that's really helpful and really supported me throughout the retreat. Now that I'm out of the retreat.
I think that I've kind of created a little bit of a rutted out little mantra pattern for myself instead of being really experiential like I was when I was in the retreat.
I don't have the subtleness that I had on retreat so I'm, you know, there's that there's that like finding my new way kind of thing going on.
But also, um, yeah, I'm definitely noticing that I'm, I'm working with the hindrance to an end.
Right.
I'm telling myself not to.
Right. So just pulling out a pulling out a tool to kind of work with it in a way so that
Yeah, peacefully on the other side.
Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. Yeah.
Yeah.
It's it's that's so common and so natural in our practice for for some of the skillful means that that that we that we discover that are really effective can be really effective at just helping orient the mind in a really skillful direction.
And yet when when we're using them kind of like as a just as a habitual kind of response to to kind of practice our way out of or to kind of tweak it a little bit so that it'll be more pleasant and go away and
Yeah, that is so so so natural and so so common. And I would I would really just encourage there just to, you know, include just to include and notice like, Oh, this reaching for this tool to work with the end with this hindrance.
Maybe just like include this, this quality of maybe subtle, subtle aversion of just a subtle aversion to the hindrance and or some subtle kind of craving for or leaning towards some some quality some state that you are trying to kind of get to, which our minds are just always doing
always doing. Yeah. And just like you are noticing the hindrance in the first place, the response to it that kind of like oh on it and want to kind of practice it away.
Yeah, yeah, it's like, I have this new thing. Let me use it. And yeah, there's definitely like a layer of thin film of aversion on top of the hindrance.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's really great to see. That's really great to see. Yeah, this, this kind of level of experience in the mind that is kind of what we typically identify with is like the mind that is doing the practice.
It's like, oh, I'm going to notice this or be aware of this or bring up this or remind myself of this. And all of that is also just, you know, also just mental activity at the same level of the original object that you are noticing like the hindrance and then so it's great that you're seeing
that and just, it's kind of like, it can feel kind of like a never ending kaleidoscopic stepping back of like, oh, well, there's a relationship to that. And then the next moment you notice, oh, there's, there's an identification with noticing that and it's like, just however it is in each moment
just letting the mind will kind of whatever level of experience is presenting itself be included as what's natural and in terms of like working with the hindrances versus just knowing them or really any experience.
But the teachings are really context based. And so there's a gradation of ways that are really skillful to be in relationship to or respond to our experience.
So when there is like you said like on retreat, this is often the experience that on retreat, there's a bit more subtleness and inner resources and capacity.
So often, we can just know, we can just know experience and it's not so sticky that it's really tying us in knots, we can, oh, there can be some balance that can know, oh, there's a version happening here and there's some spaciousness around it that's okay.
There's not that level of resource available. It can be really helpful. Sometimes we can like try, we can think that, oh, we should just be able to just know it.
And if I am bringing in any kind of skillful means that I'm, I don't know, it's like not doing it right.
But there's a sutra where the Buddha says there's five ways of working with, with, I think this one is distracting thoughts, but it could be like any, any, any difficult experience.
And the first thing is just to know it to know it has experience to know it with mindfulness.
And if that, if there isn't the level of awareness or stability in order to know it in a balanced way, then the next thing is to, to shift to something, to shift to something more neutral.
So like orienting our direction, our attention in a direction that is more resourcing, like, oh, this pattern is really, really sticky. And it's just kind of taking me out or it's like really dysregulated or there's some kind of trauma thing coming up.
That's like, okay, don't just try to sit with this, like, like, you know, it's time to open up and like look around or orient to the sounds or something like that.
And so there's, yeah, it's really context based.
So when the, when it's not really like critically, critically, like sticky and kind of snowballing, then we can just settle back and know, oh, this is how it is right now.
And yet when it is really kind of ramping things up to try to just stay with it, then it's really, you know, listen to the wisdom that knows that it's, it's going to be really supportive to and caring to shift here.
Yeah, to something else.
Thank you.
That's really helpful. I don't mean to quiz you, but I wonder what the other three methods are that were mentioned in that suit.
Oh, it's it. Yeah, it's kind of funny.
So I think the first one is just to know experience to know just to know it and allow it.
The next one is to bring in a wholesome reflection, like to bring in a wholesome thought or reflection.
Another one is just to replace. Yeah, like the shifting to something else. So you replace this experience with something else, like, okay, I'm just going to think about something else or attend to something else.
Don't quite remember what the fourth one is with the last, the last one is it is the something like you press your tongue into the roof of your mouth and you grit your teeth and you crush mind with mine.
That's, that's the language that's used is crush mine with mine. I don't know about.
I don't know about that translation and might not be so violent, you know, in the original poly but just kind of like using the power of the mind to say no, like, I'm not going to go, I'm not going to go down this road.
Yeah, yeah, and that can actually be really, really helpful.
Yeah, that's possible at the beginning for me at the beginning, like when something just begins to arise and like, you know, actually, let's not do that, you know, like everyone's know that is a possibility.
Gritting that sounds a little over efforting.
I know, yeah, that's an intense one.
Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing that to died never heard that before.
Yeah, thanks for the question.
We're at time. So thank you all for your, your practice and presence.
