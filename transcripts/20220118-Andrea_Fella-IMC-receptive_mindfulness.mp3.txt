In a simple way, connecting with how you are in this moment.
Allowing your sense of yourself to be connected with the experience here and now.
The bodily experience in this moment.
It's always useful to check in with the body.
If we're aware of the body, we're aware in the present moment.
So just checking in with maybe just a sense of the body as a whole. How do you feel in general? How is the body in general?
And how is the mind in general?
Is there relaxation or ease in the body? Is there subtleness or scatteredness in the mind?
It's in a simple way. Acknowledging how you are right now.
Beginning where we are. Not trying to put ourselves into a state in order to be mindful.
Be mindful of what's here.
Be aware of how the body is. How the mind is.
And having kind of arrived a little bit with ourselves, arrived and connected to the here and now.
It can be useful to be aware of the body in terms of whether there's relaxation or ease and inclining towards encouraging relaxation of body.
Aware of the body with the invitation to soften and relax.
Maybe the face, the head, the neck can relax.
Maybe the shoulders, the arms, the hands can relax.
And aware while doing this of how it is to relax as there may be a little bit of softening.
This is mindfulness.
Maybe the chest and upper back can relax.
Maybe the muscles across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back can relax.
Maybe the hips, even inside the hip sockets, maybe that can relax a little bit.
Maybe the legs, the feet can relax.
And it can also be interesting to explore, invite the inside of the body to soften too.
So maybe the inside of the throat can soften and relax.
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax.
Relaxing the body is a supportive condition to allow and encourage the mind to relax as well.
As the body relaxes it can be a little bit more natural for the mind to also soften.
Let go of tension, holding to worries or concerns about the past, the future.
And so opening to the possibility that maybe the mind can relax.
Often the mind is busy and has some tension around doing.
So maybe letting go of trying to do so much and just instead explore what happens if you step out of being in charge
and allow the body and mind to receive experience.
Without our engagement, without our trying, our bodies and minds will be noticing experience.
And so settling back, relax and receive.
What's obvious? What's here? What's easily available without trying to do mindfulness?
It might be often the experience of the body is a very obvious experience.
There may be sensations in the body that are kind of popping in.
Pressure here of contact of the hips against what you're sitting on.
Pressure points of feet or hands.
Maybe a broader sense of the whole body could also be hearing.
Hearing is another very obvious experience.
The sound of my voice or sounds in your environment.
As we step out of the driver's seat, as we step out of being in control of what we are attending to,
we may well notice there's a lot of change, a lot of shifting of the attention.
First one thing, a body sensation and then a sound, a different body sensation,
a focused sensation and then a broad sensation.
This is the way our minds will naturally work.
We don't have to pick something and stay with it.
Can you be aware of receiving these different experiences moment after moment,
allowing the body and the mind to receive and just knowing what's here, what's obvious in a moment?
This kind of mindfulness is really supported by relaxation.
Relax.
Receive.
The receiving may also receive at times, moods or emotions, thoughts coming through.
If you can just know there's a thought, there's an emotion as one other experience being received.
The mindfulness is doing its job.
And it's easy to get hooked by thinking.
It's easy to forget about mindfulness when thoughts arise.
And so probably there will be at times getting lost, hooked into a pattern or a train of thought.
And yet there will be a moment when you remember and there's a recognition.
Awareness is back.
The mind has been hooked.
Haven't been noticing for the last few seconds or minutes.
In that moment when you notice that you've forgotten, you've remembered.
In that moment of remembering mindfulness, it's often helpful to first appreciate that mindfulness has returned.
And then remember relaxation too, because relaxation will help support the ability to receive what's here.
We don't have anything in particular we need to get back to when we're just exploring receiving.
And so relax and open. What's obvious?
After returning from a wanderer in thought, sometimes what's obvious can have shifted from before the mind wandered.
Really useful to know how the mind has been affected by the thinking.
There may be a little bit of emotion that's come up or some tension in the body.
Maybe, but sometimes after a wander, there can actually be more relaxation, more ease.
And so just be available when the mindfulness returns.
What's here?
Relax and receive the kind of an honesty of acknowledgement.
And this is what's here. Allowing a friendly kind of curiosity. What's here?
