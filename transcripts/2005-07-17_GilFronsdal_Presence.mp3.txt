 Well, I haven't given a talk now for over three weeks, which is a long time for me. And I wonder if I have anything to say. But the stronger feeling I have about that is that talking about practice doesn't seem very interesting. It seems like there should be something much more immediate than talking about something. So the question is, what is it that's more immediate? And what is it that's here for all of us that's not someplace else, not something we have to think about? But what is it that's available right here and now that is liberating, that's freeing, that's intimate, that's deeply satisfying? What is it that's here? What can we find here? And if you listen to my words as if the words about something, then you might miss the opportunity of what's here. Here are some wonderful ideas, take the ideas home and ponder them and think about them. So that was really intellectually stimulating and challenging and interesting. That's great. But if you did that, then today I'd feel kind of bad. Because it's not about ideas. When I think about mindfulness practice, I think that there are two major aspects to mindfulness in and of itself. One is the quality of presence. And the other is the aspect of recognition. So presence and recognition. And there has to be presence. We have this presence in the present moment, here and now. And then when that presence is here and now, then there's the recognition of what this is. And some features, or sometimes we emphasize one, sometimes the other, sometimes both of them, presence and recognition. But today, the idea of the presence seems very important to me. And I keep finding in my mouth that I want to say that we bring presence to the present moment, something we bring presence. But that's not really, that can be right, we do that. But presence isn't something we bring. Presence is something that's already here. And in fact, the sense of presence can be so strong for some people that they will anthropomorphize the presence. Sometimes, I know in some traditions, like in Sufism, they might, or people have called it the beloved. It's something very powerful. Some people might call it the presence of God. But the sense of vitality or aliveness or presence that can kind of emanate, not through our thoughts, not through our ideas about things, but rather kind of from our being, kind of almost like, for me, I feel almost like a rising out of a torso out of the body. And sometimes it's so palpable, so powerful and so important. And I know it's always so easy to feel that because human beings are often creatures of thoughts, of thinking. And it's easy to get pulled into the world of thoughts, what we're thinking about and how we feel about things, what we want, what we're afraid of, how to fix things, how to have a conversation, what I'm supposed to say, what I was supposed to have said. You know, kind of get pulled into this world of thinking. And it can be a very rich world, the world of thinking. And it can be very compelling. One of the compelling qualities of thinking is that it has the promise or the hope, it seems to offer the promise of hope that you can think your way out of your problems. Or you can think your way into solutions for how to live a deeply happy and satisfying life. So if you just kind of think about it enough, and that's why sometimes listening to Dharma talks or the words of talks, everything Dharma books, is such a terrible thing to do. But stay at the end of the talk, please. Because it's just more words, and it just kind of feeds into that part of the mind which already is thinking about words and working things out, thinking about things. And oh, she didn't waste any time. Oh, sorry. And so, but the sense of presence. And sometimes one of the key things that can be done is to stop thinking. And to give up our attempts to think things through or think out solutions or answers. And even sometimes, even in the most difficult circumstances, we might find ourselves in, sometimes stopping to think is sometimes a really wise thing to do. And stopping to think, stopping to think, stopping, stop thinking. Stop thinking can be really wise thing to do. Not because we then become a zombie or uninterested or uninvolved, what's going on. But rather when we stop thinking in that kind of surface chatter of the mind and are very present for what's happening, then there can be other forms of intelligences, other ways of understanding that have a chance to show themselves and reveal themselves. And the ability to respond can come, for example, from the heart, can come from the belly, can come from the body, can come from some deep place in the psyche. We never know what's going to come. And sometimes there are corners of our psyche which are much wiser than that part of the psyche, that little corner of the psyche, which tends to dominate, thinking about things and analyzing and thinking about the future, planning. So sometimes in the greatest challenges, sometimes it's a very interesting practice to stop thinking about it and see what happens, see what goes on, see what arises. I've known plenty of people who have, when they've had a huge life issue to address and to answer what to do with their life or whether to make some big choice in their life, have chosen to go off, for example, on a meditation retreat and not thought about it for a week, but rather sit in silence, let go of their thinking, be with their breath, be with their body. And then the end of the week something else can bubble up, some other perspective can arise that can't arise when we're always seeing through things, the filter of what we're thinking about, what we're talking about. I think it's interesting to use the analogy of being in the ocean, that if you're swimming on the surface of the ocean and say there's a big storm and waves and wind and currents, it can be quite tumultuous. And you might think that in order to have some peace you have to kind of sort of stop the waves, which sometimes doesn't work, right? And sometimes if you're in a boat in a big storm you just kind of pull down your sails and just kind of wait it out and it's a little bit noisy and you're walked around a little bit, but usually often that can work. But if you're always on the surface it's always going to feel the storm of it all. But if you go under the surface of the ocean, if you're a scuba diver for example, and you sink underneath, you don't have to go many feet underneath the surface of the ocean where it starts becoming very peaceful, very quiet, very calm. And you can actually, sometimes you go eight feet underneath or ten feet underneath and look up and you can see the waves up there and you see the churning going on up there. But you feel like somehow there's this great presence, this great spaciousness, this great calm or peacefulness that offers a perspective, a very different perspective to what's happening at the surface. If we're living on the surface of our lives then we might think we have to stop the waves or wait or fix things or engage in what's going on there on the surface. But if we can sink down into a sense of presence or into a sense of deep calm or openness or kind of wider sensitivity, presence is a kind of sensitivity that for me at least seems to ooze, flow out of the body, but then it's not limited to the body. I think it's maybe an optical illusion of sorts or sensory illusion of sorts, but when I'm most settled into a presence, that presence seems to expand, extend beyond the confines of my body. And it can feel quite large. I can feel quite large as if everything that I'm aware of in consciousness is being held within a bubble of consciousness, a bubble of awareness, a bubble of sensitivity, a bubble of presence. And so when something happens, there's all this space within which for it to happen. But if I'm only thinking about things, then often I find my world is really narrow and tight. And I see this very dramatically with times when my children are quite challenging, is that if I am writing my thoughts closely and they are being difficult, then it's a difficult situation. But when they're being difficult and I'm there in a very open, spacious way, then it's not a difficult situation. Something has to be dealt with. It's a difficulty. If it's a situation, not a difficult situation, it's actually quite peaceful, quite expansive, quite big. The china shatters on the kitchen floor. Wow. Why did you push it off the table? I think we need to talk about this or do something as opposed to, that's the center of the universe at this moment, that particular point, and the anger and the concerns. There's a huge world of difference between writing something really close and then writing something that receives it in a great wide ocean of presence. So how do we do that? How do we make a switch from being narrow, being tight, being confined in our thoughts, to being open and spacious in this wide presence that exists in the body? I think that's one of the key keys, at least for me, that exists in the body. It's not limited to the body, but for me it's one of the primary ways of understanding it. Accessing it is the felt sense of the body or the sense of perception or the sense of awareness that seems to reside in the body. Because once I kind of settle into that, rather than thinking my way or seeing my way into what's going on, into the sense of the body, how it feels or senses or is aware of what's happening, then there seems to be a much greater spacious quality to the situation. And maybe it's a little bit paradox, you know, you go in, in a sense, only to go out into something really large. So, you know, sometimes I think that it's very easy to have life upside down. And what I have in mind here is that if we take the human being to be kind of like a pyramid or a triangle, and say we put thinking at the top of it because it's so wonderful and great and all these great things can happen, all the great things in life, you know, inventions and creativity and so much as a genesis in thought, maybe the papers and most everything happens in papers except for natural disasters. You know, some human thought had to kind of began there. The pinnacle of great inventions, the pinnacle of human life is the capacity to think creatively, maybe you could say that. So if you put it at the top of the pyramid, you know, and sometimes when something is insecure, it's good to put it on top of this pyramid. So, so we'll put it to give it a high status, our thinking mind. But then if, if the, if the pyramid is upside down, and the point is facing down, it's going to be really wobbly. And what presence can provide is to kind of turn it up, put it right side up. So certainly the top of the pyramid can be our thinking world, but it's supported by this great breath and strength foundation of our body, our being, our awareness, our presence, our feelings, our heart, so much more of who we are. And then it's safe to think. Then maybe it's actually much more clear and cleaner to think, thinking can be much more creative when it has that kind of foundation. But when we have it upside down and we think of thinking is all where it's all at, you know, then we have it upside down, we're very actually much more fragile, much more easily topple over. And sometimes I have a sense that there's almost like a switch or a very simple choice to be made between getting lost in thought to letting go of that loss that's getting low, getting low, letting go of that kind of preoccupation with thinking and relaxing into something with a bigger, bigger sense of awareness and presence. And it's interesting to watch the course of a day and the course of an hour, the course of a minute, how the mind kind of sways back and forth between those. I haven't figured out any way to stay in one mode all the time. You know, presence is really great, you know, I'll just kind of just rest there and be happy ever after. I haven't figured that out yet. But what I'm very aware of is that there's kind of, you know, it goes back and forth. I get really interested in something and sometimes my thought gets really involved in that. And then I have to notice that at some point and see do I want to stay there or do I want to kind of let the pendulum swing and kind of open up again. And so I kind of watch, I try to track, you know, that sense of where my presence is, where my attention is, where my involvement with life is. Is my involvement with life cut up in thoughts or through the vehicle of thoughts or is it much more broad and spacious? And then where do I want it to be and what's the choices I can make going back and forth. I think meditation is very helpful, regular meditation practice. I think of it like brushing your teeth. There's good dental hygiene is brushing your teeth every day. Good mental hygiene is meditating every day. And if you don't meditate every day, you'll get cavities, mental cavities. And one of the aspects of meditating every day is that it can, if you're practicing in a regular way and maybe have a little bit of luck, it can give you a strong sense of presence, strong sense of silence, of stillness that's very close to presence. And then that kind of carries over into the daily life. So it's more available in daily life. It's more ready to show itself or ready to be there. A daily meditation practice is similar to having a time every day for stillness and silence. Some people have said that spiritual life grows out of stillness and silence. And I don't know if it's always the case, but I think it's often points to something very important. And that can be external. I mean, can I go into a situation of still and silent? I have very powerful visceral memories of sitting in Zen monasteries in Japan and the stillness and the silence of this kind of pristine kind of early morning, quiet, very still rooms and having an experience of this kind of great stillness of the place. And then at some point, discover that stillness inside of us. And then if you don't need it externally anymore. And so when the situation is chaotic, that you realize this stillness is here, you're carrying it with you. Sometimes when I have the kids are just completely bad at home. Sometimes I feel really lucky to be able to have a notice place of stillness that's there all the time. And sometimes I wish I had it. Because it's not so easy. Sometimes it doesn't seem to come so easily. So sometimes when people point to this idea of presence, living in kind of presence, sometimes use little kind of expressions like listen with your eyes or listening with your chest, or they'll say, look with your ears. Or rather than with your eyes. Kind of let your perception of what's happening open up so that it's not through the usual vehicle, usual channels by which you're aware of what's happening. So if you're a looking person, that's kind of primary way in which you engage in the world is by seeing. Then relax the sense of what you're seeing through the eyes. Imagine you're seeing through your ears. And you might find that there's a whole different way that you take in the situation. Or if your primary way of being in the world is by hearing, then hear with your body, with your chest rather than with your ears. Or if your primary way of being in the world is thinking, then some people will say, think with your belly. How do you do that? Think from down here rather than from up here. Shift the mode of how you think you perceive the world. And when you shift the mode, then you might have a sense of a container or a holder or stillness or a piece that kind of goes together with the inner self. And that's the act of perception, the awareness of being conscious. When we're engaged in thinking in the normal way about life, thinking about things, that thinking is often what precludes the possibility of feeling the stillness, the silence, the spaciousness, the peace that maybe is here right now. Outside of the boundaries of your concerns, your worries, your feelings, your sadnesses, your angers, to kind of shift the perception outside of the boundaries of your preoccupations. What's there? I think of presence as kind of like a pearl. Sometimes it feels like pearls are beautiful, shiny, precious, and pearls are created by sand that irritates the oyster. And sometimes the sense of presence, precious presence that I can feel, is highlighted by the difficulties or the irritations, the challenges of life. So rather than thinking that it's one or the other, that oh, if I can have a sense of presence, then that's really great, that I can just relax, that's peaceful and wonderful, I don't have any problems. Sometimes actually the very problems of difficulties, the places where we suffer, if we bring presence to that, they become the sand that makes the presence grow and become stronger, more palpable, more available. And rather than making some kind of hard distinction that should be one or the other, it's actually quite precious to allow these things to coexist together, to really recognize what our suffering is, the difficulties, and then to hold it in this bigger container of our presence within, this great presence, this great presence that has no boundaries, has no limits. And it's not always comfortable then, because you feel that interface between the suffering and the presence, but that interface, the suffering can make you actually feel the presence more acutely, the peace that's much bigger and holds it all. And I find it very interesting, that interface, that hanging out there, rather than thinking, oh, this problem shouldn't be here, this suffering shouldn't be here, open up to something bigger that holds it. And then every once in a while, a very powerful sense of presence happens seemingly by accident. Something will happen in life where the normal thinking mode, which we're always engaged in the world and seeing the world, drops away. And the thinking mode often can be like an armor that keeps so much of the aliveness, presence within us at bay, at a distance, or shut off. And when that thinking mode somehow shuts off or quiets down in some powerful way, a powerful rush of presence can arise in people, and some people are just blown away by what is available, what happens to them. When that thinking mind relaxes, stops, and the sense of perception that becomes very full and peaceful and still bubbles up from inside of them. And so we have expressions like the presence of God, or experiencing God, or the beloved, or great peace, great sense of being connected to some spiritual reality. So the last thing I'll say is that, you know, I'll repeat myself, there's two aspects of mindfulness practice, there's presence and then there's recognition. And today's talk is really talking much more about the presence and the value of it. And that this presence is available, it's not something different from who you are, it is who you are. Presence is one of the key aspects of what a human being is, a sense of presence, aliveness, vitality, consciousness, awareness. And there's not something to create and make, but it's rather something to allow, it's rather something to relax into, rather than something to make happen. So a sense of allowing, can you allow it to happen, rather than to make it happen? So I hope that as you leave today and go out into your day, that you might experiment with allowing something that's different than your thinking. Be who you are. So we have a few minutes, if anyone would like to ask any questions, you're welcome to do that. Yes. Although I'm a little nervous about this, I think this question is related to what you're talking about. It has to do with loving kindness and presence or stillness. I've spent many years in a tradition prior to coming here, where, in a tradition prior to coming here, wherein when one affirms or visualizes, there's a sense of divine Mother or Heavenly Father or God, to whom one is addressing the affirmation or the request. When I practice loving kindness, and I ask that I be free of suffering and the root of suffering and the people I love be free and the people I hate be free of suffering and the root of suffering, I feel something, but it dawned on me a few days ago that I don't actually know who or what in Buddhism it is that I'm asking this of. Is it this generalized sense of presence you were talking about or stillness, or is there even an answer? Do you need to ask anybody? Is it a petition? Does it need to be a petition? Is it enough that it's just your heartfelt wish? The more I practice it, the more it becomes a heartfelt wish. I suppose I'd answer that by saying that my assumption would be that it's not within my power to accept and request that it be the case, that it's within my power to free anybody else from suffering or the root of suffering. So I'm attached to the structure of the model in which that kind of request is being addressed to a divine being or a presence. So maybe that's something for you to explore a little bit, whether that serves you as an appropriator or something you really believe in. I can help you with the exploration, but I can't give you an answer. Am I supposed to say something now? But if you want to explore it some other time, talk about it some more. I'm happy to. At the moment you realize that you're thinking and that you're caught up in your thinking, what are the options for you to think about some more that you're caught up in your thinking? So when you're caught up in your thinking, you notice it. What are the options you have? And thinking some more, just, you know, this is great. Plunge back in as one option, right? It depends what you're thinking about, right? Or is that a big gain? I've known people who on retreat, for example, who have had a hard time on their retreat, during their life or whatever, and finally they had this really juicy fantasy. There's a wonderful sexual fantasy or something, just, wow, this is the best. And they kind of pop out and they realize what's going on. They come out and laugh, wow, I'm fantasizing. But you know, it's been hard. I think I'll just go back and... This is much better than what was going on. So, another one option. Sometimes there's so much you can do around thoughts. I mean, it's a huge practice, practicing your thinking. I think if there's a universe in itself, and so I wouldn't want to say it's just one thing to do. But I think exploring and being curious about the phenomena of thinking is a very useful practice. Rather than being caught up in what we're thinking about, step back and say, what is thinking? What's going on here with that thought thinking mind? And why do humans think? And what's the nature of this thinking? Is it words? Is it images? Where is it happening? How fast is it happening? What is it like to be involved in my thinking? Can I have enough presence to watch my thinking and see what it's like to be thinking? Am I really tight with it? Is it a velcro? Am I riding close? Am I attached there? Do I have emotions and feelings around my thinking? Do I have beliefs connected to both particular thoughts I'm having, or do I have beliefs about thinking itself? Some people have very deep but unexamined beliefs about the nature of thinking. Everything you think is true. Or they believe that this is the way that we have to engage in the world, it's by thinking our way through the world. And so they can step back enough and be curious for this phenomenon of thinking. And the more we can learn about it, learning about it is one of the ways of becoming free of something. So rather than pushing it away or letting go too quickly, study it, get to know it really well. And then when you know it well, then you might find you have the ability to let go. But letting go sometimes naively, some people let go too easily. So that's why it's really good to study something for a long time, for a while, get to know it well. And then you know when it's wise to let go, and when it's not. So even with thinking, even though today's talk was about presence and the problems of thinking, we don't want to have an antagonistic relationship to thinking. We're never supposed to think, and you're not supposed to think if you're spiritual. Thinking is great, it's a very important part of life. And so you have to be wise about when it's appropriate to let go of thinking, and let something else just dominate. And when to let something else dominate, but then also engage in thinking about what's going on, to engage in a lot of thoughts, consideration. So there's so much to thinking. I think thinking is so fascinating. It's such a great thing, as a lot of other things are. So is that at all addressed to your question? Well enough? Marilyn? This is just a comment, but it's always really embarrassing when you're thinking so much that you've already thought through a thought process that someone proposes. Let's say you have a situation, you're in a situation, someone's like, well how if we do this? And you're sitting there like, well I already thought through that, and this and this and this. And that's when it's always embarrassing because you sort of feel like off the plane with the person you're dealing with. And so that's kind of like an area where thinking is, you've got to catch yourself. Thank you. So, thank you. I hope it made sense to talk today. And that was the whole point, just to have some sense.
