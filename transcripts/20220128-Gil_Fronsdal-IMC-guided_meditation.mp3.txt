 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello folks. Very happy to be here and welcome to this meditation session. This will be the last morning for a while perhaps to being here at IRC, the Insight Retreat Center. It's been nice to be here in this wonderful meditation hall. Some of you have been here and maybe some of you will be here one day. I look forward to the chance to welcoming you here in this wonderful place. Yesterday I discussed that one can use posture as a reference point for the state of mind, for the attitudes that we have get expressed in our posture. So attending to posture and having a reference point of an upright posture can indicate when we lose that and then we can look at why and what's happening inside. The other direction works as well in the sense that we can assume certain postures and that can be a reference point for the attitude for the mind. Our minds can change to a certain degree by the postures we take. And so the image of the Buddha meditating like we have here in the altar is a wonderful example of a balanced posture that balances attitude of confidence and calm. Confidence and trust perhaps. And you might find it interesting when you meditate to assume a posture of confidence. And maybe a posture that expresses manifests a certain degree of strength, which is not going to be energetic in a way that's tense and which will also allow you to be calm. And I think that confidence sometimes is an underappreciated quality and that more confidence can be available to us than we maybe can access through the mind. And one way is to do it physically, physical posture of uprightness. And I suspect every posture there's possible to find a way of being that somehow feels like now this holds my confidence or expresses confidence. And if I don't feel confident, sometimes the mind is influenced by the body. And so if the body takes a confident posture, maybe something begins shifting inside. So assuming, taking, entering into a posture for meditation. And perhaps for today you can see if you can take a posture that expresses some physical strength or confidence. Maybe by opening up the chest a bit more. Just ever so slightly bringing in the spine between the shoulder blades. That also opens up, expands the chest a little bit. Maybe your head can be a little bit more confident, maybe regal. Straightening out the neck. Maybe lifting the head up. When I first started doing meditation the instructions were to imagine a string from the back top of the head, lifting the head up towards the ceiling. And then to gently, maybe confidently, close your eyes. And as if you are filling your body with strength or confidence on the inhale and relaxing on the exhale, take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Taking in some deeper breaths than usual. Almost as if you are claiming your right to be here now. Maybe a kind of regal right or place. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And if you have brought in some confidence to your posture, does that have any influence on how you are aware of breathing and how you are aware of the experience of the body breathing? With a normal breath, breathing normally, on the inhale gently, filling yourself with some degree of confidence and strength, confidence in the value of being present here and now. And in the exhale, relax, soften, holding tension in your body. As you exhale, perhaps letting anxiety melt away. And then simplifying yourself. To settling into the rhythm of the body breathing.

One of the words for confidence in Nepali language is basada, which also means bright, kind of like luminously bright. Also means peaceful, serene, calm. In what kind of confidence, strong confidence, even unshakable confidence might you have? That also has qualities of peacefulness and clarity as part of it. A peaceful confidence. And if you imagine yourself having some form of peaceful confidence and that that peaceful confidence was the channel for your love, for your care, for your goodwill for the world, what would your love be like radiating from such a confidence? May whatever confidence and strength we've developed through this practice, may it be supportive, may it be channeled and used for the welfare and happiness of others. May we live, benefiting this world. May all beings be happy. May all beings inhabit their natural strength. May all beings be safe, partly as an outgrowth of their confidence. May all beings be peaceful because they walk through the world confidently. And may all beings be free, confident in the value of non-clinging. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free.
