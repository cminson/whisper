 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. So. So hello and welcome to this edition of Happy Hour. Happy to be with you all. And I notice actually as I'm starting to speak and smile and try to smile and speak, it's a little hard to talk because I just had a feeling done earlier this afternoon and part of my mouth is still numb. So it. That's what's happening anyway. We'll see how how much it impacts my my speech, but the vowels, the round vowels are going to be hard anyway. So. So for today. I wanted to invite us to this this new exploration. I haven't quite taught it this way, so I wanted to set the frame. So to set the frame, I wanted to invite you to consider, you know, there is this this game that is played in the context of maybe team building or I've taught it in improv courses and I'm going to describe it. And then I am going to invite us to see. Well, I shall just do it. Let me just tell you what it is. So so there is this game that's called Mirror, where you get in front of another human being physically. And one person is a and the other person is person B. And for a while, A leads with physical motions, raising their arms, maybe winking and physical motions and B tries to follow. B is the mirror tries to follow the lead of A. OK, got that. Can imagine yourself doing that. The second part of this game, person B takes the lead and moves their arms, maybe their body, their legs, walks back and forth or whatever it is movements. And and person A is the mirror tries to follow all their try to tries to mirror all their physical movements to follow them. So now B is the lead and A is the follower, the mirror. And then we often surprise people with this third one, which opens up your thinking, open opens up this this traditional way of thinking about being a leader or follow in life. And the third part of this game is no one is a leader. No one is a follower. And both are leaders, both are followers. So the idea is you learn, you get a sense of how to become in sync. No one really takes the lead, otherwise it really loses its edge. But movements happen. There's maybe a little movement and the other person continues it and the other person, the person. So lead is kind of handed back and forth and band following is handed back and forth. And so both people are following and leading at the same time, both entities. OK, and if you've never done this game, you can be mind blowing how it works and how it opens possibilities up actually. And if you've done it now, hopefully you're remembering the joy, the beauty of this, of being in flow with another human being and leading and following. So. So with this, I wanted to invite us to consider. The difficulties or the challenges in our lives. What if we were dancing? We were dancing in the same way with our challenges. We weren't trying to to lead, trying to dominate, trying to say, OK, challenge, I'm going to put you in a box. I'm going to deal with you. I'm going to get rid of you. And we're not dominated. We're not completely following the lead wherever difficulties and challenges took us. But what if we're actually in a dance, we're in a dance with life, we're in a dance with our challenges. So the challenge leads a little bit and then maybe we're following, then we lead a little bit with, oh, this maybe this challenge actually is a little bit. The challenge actually is opening me up to see in this way, to move in this way. And then maybe the challenge opens you up and moves you this way a little bit and you move and then you take the next lead. So it's a dance. It's a dance. And dance isn't a fist fight, isn't an act of domination, but is what life is made of. It's an infinite, infinite game. It's not a finite game when there's a winner and there's a loser. It's an infinite game of expression. So the title I want to give to this section, to this practice that I'm offering is Dancing with Grace. And there are two meanings to this. So what if this dance you're doing, this challenge, isn't it? Just that you're dancing with challenges in your life. What if challenges are actually expressions of grace, goodness in your life? And through this dance, you're being opened up to more grace, to more goodness, to more wisdom, to more compassion for yourself and for others. So dancing with grace. So your partner is grace. Your partner is grace. You're dancing with grace. You're dancing with grace. And grace is also the challenges too. It's both grace and challenge at the same time. And also dancing with grace, another way that in English that phrase has a meaning is, oh, when you dance with grace, there's a sense of your movements, your actions. There is a sense of uprightness. There is a sense of goodness, that the whole dance, the whole being in the world. So dancing with grace, dancing with grace, both of those meanings. So the invitation I'm going to make, I'm making for our practice together in the guided meditation as we're about to do it together. Of course, after we settle in with our breath, our bodies, as always with our intention is to see, to see our challenges as grace, as if we're dancing with them. It's through a way that they're pointing and opening us to goodness, to seeing things differently. And maybe seeing this whole dynamic as dancing with grace, instead of, oh, poor me, I have all these problems or these challenges in my body, in my mind, in my life. But seeing that you're dancing with grace, dancing with grace, giving a much more dimensionality in this plane. So enough of the framing. Let's practice together. So I'd like to invite you to land in your meditation posture. You need to shift and move. Arriving, arriving in this body, arriving in this moment. Connecting. Connecting with your feet on the earth, your sit bones, your tension on the chair, hands on your lap, your brightness of your spine, your sense of integrity of your posture, then relaxing, releasing all the tension, your forehead, your back torso, your chest onto the earth. Each breath opening you up further for possibility. Openness to possibility in this moment. Letting go, releasing thoughts, entanglements in this moment. No need, no need. If plans, memories, stories arise. Gently tell them thank you, but not now. Please come back later. I'm giving my heart, all of myself to this practice in this moment. Every breath. In breath, not breath. Thank you. Thank you. Just this breath, in breath and out breath. Receiving, receiving wholeheartedly, kindly. Letting each breath grace you, grace your whole body, your abdomen, your lungs, your whole being. The gift of goodness, gift of life, being received, this mystery of being human, being breathed in this form. Thank you. Letting your whole heart, your body, your mind, release, let go with each out breath. And you notice the beginning of the in breath. Greet the beginning of the in breath. The middle, the end of the in breath, can you greet at all? Middle of the in breath, the pause between the in breath and the out breath. The beginning of the out breath, the middle of the out breath, the end, and the pause between the out breath and the in breath. As if you're dancing with the breath. This breath being a dance. You're not leaving. All the time. You're not following all the time. You're both leading and following. And the breath and the body. This body knows how to breathe on its own. It's also leading and following. This body is a natural breath. Breathing is a dance. Not too complicated. Don't think about it. You're in thinking about this dance of breathing until a moment ago. Let it be natural. Let it be joyous. Let it be a dance of self-dance. Let it be a dance of self-dance. Let it be a dance of self-dance. Let it be a dance of self-dance. Let it be joyous. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you nothing more joyful than just dancing with the breath in this moment all thoughts can wait they can wait, not now receiving giving dancing with the breath with grace as a practice for what comes next you you you you you you you you you you you you you maybe when challenges arise in the moment just remembering this dance with the breath this dancing giving taking kindly spaciously can help bring perspective, groundedness grace grace to our dance with a challenge a difficulty perhaps but if you imagine yourself dancing with this partner this challenge in your life dancing with grace maybe a different attitude is shifting, attitude is needed not to dislike your partner, dance partner, not to try to dominate it not to be scared of it, but to open your arms hold their hand as if in a partner dance the sense of trust and let yourself be held both leading and following not so much thinking, you don't have to think about solutions but energetically shifting your relationship to this difficulty an energetic shift you're dancing, you're participating you're leading in some moments and you're following in some moments it's a dance completely engaged in this dance you're engaged wholeheartedly in this dance it challenges you, it also nourishes you there's some moves, there's some areas in the dance floor you've never explored, ever and this partner leads you there you don't have to know what they are but trust you follow and oh you notice another corner and you lead let's explore this to your challenge together and the more you dance, the more confident you feel this is a worthy dance partner challenges you, helps you grow, opens your heart teaches you but it's not always in the lead, sometimes it follows as you lead, both leading and both following at the same time passing the baton back and forth seamlessly it's a graceful dance again you don't have to put concepts and words it's just shifting a relationship maybe there's a sense of delight I get to dance, I get to participate in this dance maybe there's more zest maybe as you're dancing in your mind, your image there is metta, there is goodwill for yourself for the challenge for this space between the two of you on this dance floor, this space, this dance floor of life much wider than you thought it was, much wider much bigger, more expensive, keep dancing keep dancing with grace breathing in, breathing out and when in your heart it feels like this dance with this partner feels complete in this moment maybe you bow to each other and maybe another dance partner could be a challenge or could be a gift in your life, a blessing that leads you and you lead it you help it grow, it helps you grow the more you dance the more full of vitality, life, grace, kindness you become your heart becomes keep dancing with grace in your mind's eye whenever feels appropriate you can bow to your dance partner maybe another dance partner or maybe you simply sit and breathe, dance with the breath and feel into this shift in perspective with challenges, with mitta, with kindness, spacious, spaciously if you're still dancing, maybe the dance floor keeps expanding beyond your imagination, wow, so much potential possibility gross maybe the sense that has arisen or can arise is through imagining this dance dancing with grace, with challenges and difficulties maybe there's a recognition of your own ability to dance skills, capacities, goodnesses that you're getting to recognize and have more confidence in capacity to follow and lead, lead and follow into wisdom and love, unafraid, fully present who knew, who knew, I could dance so well I can dance so well, me all beings everywhere discover their capacity to dance more than they know with grace and may our dancing, our practice, our cultivation serve all beings everywhere, in goodness, in awakening, including ourselves Thank you all for your practice and for participating in this dance exploring together, so we have a few minutes for any questions, comments, reflections special reports from the field, how was this for you? Claire, I do happen to see your hand I usually don't see people's hand, there you go I couldn't unmute, I was having some problems anyhow, you may have noticed that I was smiling through the whole meditation and this is because, it's my favorite of anything you've ever done my husband and I started dancing tango 12 years ago and we dance every week, and what you talked about speaks so much to the practice of tango tango is sometimes referred to as a meditation and it is very much, tango people do not speak at all the music directs what we do, the man directs the woman through his steps and when you finish, you want to change partners, you just say thank you and that's the end of that partnership but it is such a cool experience, I really urge everybody here to try it it's really wonderful, it's the most beautiful dance you can ever do and it does encourage meditation, you don't talk at all to each other you just follow the music you're so much in the space of leading and following thank you Claire, thank you for bringing that in, being a tango dancer yourself that is sweet, that's lovely, yeah, appreciate that and I do want to point that one difference between the dance of tango as you mentioned and here in this meditation, it's obvious but I still want to note it is here we were imagining not leading or following in tango one person leads, one person follows, yes and here it is still leading and following yeah exactly, and here we're leading and following at the same time yeah, thank you Claire, yeah, beautiful, so lovely any other reflections that came up maybe as you tried this on or something about your perspective that maybe all of a sudden shifted with respect to some challenge you're having in your life it was maybe not thinking so much but there's a sense of wow, yeah, I can dance with this I can hold myself upright, Madison can you hear me? yeah I was at first confused by the idea of letting the thing lead I was working with this character of my anxiety that I have all the time with me and I was like this doesn't make sense, I don't want to go down this trail that they're trying to lead me but later in the meditation when I imagined that, letting them lead it was like I'm not afraid of you, it's okay, this is okay, it just I don't know, it sort of helped me not be afraid and build trust with it and that created a lot of space, so I just wanted to share that beautiful, thank you so much for sharing that, Madison that's it, exactly, because in a dance there's a sense of trust you're holding, like okay, I'm going to hold your hand and there's a sense of trust, and you also have, you know, there's give and take so that's exactly it, this shift in relationship, exactly as you said it beautiful, thanks so much for sharing that, that maids serve you, maids support you beautiful, Barbara still muted, my dear still muted, wait, how can we help unmute you, hold on hi again there we go, there we go, thank you, I just want to thank you, Nikki this was so different from other meditations, other meta practices and it was wonderful for me, my mind went back over the over 40 years that I was married, and times where my husband was the lead and other times, you know, over all the years it just, there was so much things changed as, you know, causes and conditions and health and, you know, different things that come up in life and so just that's what came up for me was to run my, you know, mind's eye through this sort of timeline of when I was leading and when I was following and I think it was a valuable exercise thanks Barbara, I appreciate hearing the sense of recognizing that actually you've been doing the dance of both leading and following in your life in your relationship in your marriage for 40 years did you say so leading and over 40 years leading and following well, yeah, it's done now, it passed away a few years ago I'm sorry, this was a nice meditation to think back over the things that we did together yeah, sense of appreciation of your and to bring it here in the present and here now, Barbara's capacity to dance with life lead and follow yeah, and that's a sense of confidence it builds yeah, wow, look at that, that's beautiful it's not always leading or always following, it's beautiful thanks for sharing that Barbara, yeah, beautiful nice, yeah, any other reflections and you can also type them in chat if you type them to me privately I won't read your name if you type them to everyone I'll read your name and yeah, anything else that might have come up oh, this is interesting and maybe what we'll do if I don't see Michelle, I think I see your hand there my challenge is very heavy but I noticed in the dance it got so light nice and we could move around so I appreciate that thank you thank you, Michelle, that's fantastic yeah, that's exactly, that's the intention for this meditation to shift our perspective from something that's heavy and unmovable, it's like oh, it's lighter it moves and that can create a different perspective yeah, different perspective of working with it, beautiful thanks for sharing that Michelle, Jerry says it seems that life is in fact a dance of change absolutely, absolutely so, speaking of the dance of change we are going to shift into small groups and practice together, this dance of life, dancing together and I'll create the rooms and the invitation is each person will share one nugget, one brief nugget maybe about this practice, what came up for you, maybe this sense of dancing with life, dancing with challenges really speaking about that for your own sake really and be held witness so that this perspective this sense can be spoken for you and really and it can be about a challenge or it can be about something good or again about this meditation or in general and if it comes to you and you want to say pass and just hold kind space for others that's perfectly fine and so let's do alphabetical order reverse alphabetical order just to shake it up a little bit first name and one nugget, next person one nugget, next person one nugget, again the first person one nugget you go round and round and remember you're just sharing from your own experience not asking questions, directing, leading just offering yourself your kindness and it might be silence so, ready, opening the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other enjoy the dance okay, the rooms are closed, everybody's back curious I tried this new feature with voice in the rooms, did you guys hear me in the rooms?
