The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, Ajahn Buddhadasa, Gaya Armstrong's teacher, number of students in this realm benefited from Buddhadasa,
which is that all beings dance at ease in the breeze with minds left silent by lying to rest all things.
Dukka has displaced Dukka, which has displaced other Dukka.
And it's hard to keep track of all the things we might worry about, so much to care about, so much to love.
And sometimes it feels like our nervous system wasn't really designed to care all the time.
I sort of wish it were, but it doesn't feel that it is.
And of course, how much rest we need, how much the heart needs to rest, what constitutes rest, that changes over the course of a practice.
But a flower isn't meant to be in bloom all the time, right?
Sometimes, I guess confession time, I really want to, I don't know, close buds, but I really want to pry open the kind of petals that are closed.
I guess more accurate confession is not that I really want to, it's that I do sometimes.
I know that's bad, it's bad, but it's like I have issues, whatever, you know.
This is my impulse, but a flower is not meant to be in bloom all the time, you know.
Heart opens and closes.
And I was considering the analogy with sleep, sleep, you know.
Sleep, this like pervasive disconnection from our environment.
We have our dreams, but from what's around us, pervasively disconnected, and that comes as a serious opportunity cost to just disconnect for five or eight or 10 hours.
But that disconnection actually is necessary for our functioning, for our learning, for our growth.
And our heart needs rest too.
And maybe, maybe equanimity is the kind of deepest form of rest for our heart, our own heart's way of sleeping.
Our heart, in other words, needs moments of being unstimulated.
We usually try to rest through more stimulation, you know.
Like we're overstimulated by life, by the human condition, by our responsibilities.
And then to soothe that stimulation, we kind of pile on more stimulation and build a kind of cocoon of unconsciousness.
And
we know those moments, right, of kind of like, usually technologically aided unconsciousness, you know, all the streams of data full.
And that's a kind of rest, but our heart is actually highly stimulated, and maybe we say equanimity, this fourth Brahma Mahara, is something like true rest.
So T.S. Eliot says, teach us to care and not to care, and sounds harsh, can't stop caring, right?
Teach us not to care.
We practice caring and we practice acknowledging that our wishes do not govern the first noble truth, do not govern samsara, this realm.
And the Buddha did worry about nihilism, worried that the teachings, this path might be construed in such a way it's compatible with nihilism,
and wanted to guard against that.
But it's, there's some concern, you know, in emptiness, one experience is it's highly interchangeable with others.
Really the raw material of samsara doesn't matter much at all.
That's what I was alluding to in the sit.
Everything becomes one, one taste.
The play of change of a niche.
And sometimes people get the sense from this that nothing means anything.
And when nothing means anything, love dissolves, goodness is at risk.
But then there's the other side, living with the sense that everything means everything.
Every moment has tons of writing on it, every decision, each longing, this pain, this hope, this lifetime, this generation.
And everything means everything.
And then you kind of can't stop caring or giving or worrying or can't even justify a moment's rest.
And so we trace out the middle path.
The middle path between everything means everything and nothing means anything.
We trace out the middle path.
And for me a lot of this is around the relationship, the balance of equanimity and compassion.
And so two quotes, both about the death of one's father representing these two sides for me,
somehow they capture it beautifully, equanimity and compassion.
So the first, first, Carl over Norse guard.
Now I saw his lifeless state.
And that there was no longer any difference between what once had been my father and the table he was lying on,
or the floor on which the table stood, or the wall socket beneath the window, or the cable running to the lamp beside him.
For humans are merely one form among any which the world produces over and over again.
Not only in everything that lives but also in everything that does not live, drawn in sand, stone and water.
And death, which I have always regarded as the greatest dimension of life, dark, compelling,
was no more than a pipe that springs a leak,
a branch that cracks in the wind, a jacket that slips off a clothes hanger,
and falls to the floor.
And Catherine Schultz from Lost and Found.
This is the essential, avaricious nature of loss.
It encompasses without distinction the trivial and the consequential, the abstract and the concrete,
the merely misplaced and the permanently gone.
We often try to ignore its true scope, if we can, but for a while after my father died, I could not stop seeing the world as it really is,
marked everywhere by the evidence of past losses and the imminence of future ones.
This was not because his death was a tragedy. My father died peacefully at 74, tended through his final weeks by those he loved most.
It was because his death was not a tragedy.
What shocked me was that something so sad could be the normal necessary way of things.
In its aftermath, each individual life seemed to contain too much heartbreak for its fleeting duration.
History, which I had always loved, even in its silences and mysteries, suddenly seemed like little more than a record of loss on an epic scale,
especially where it could offer no record at all.
The world itself seemed ephemeral, glaciers and species and ecosystems, the place of change as swift as in time lapse,
as if those of us alive today had been permitted to see it from the harrowing perspective of eternity.
It felt fragile, everything felt vulnerable.
The idea of loss pressed in all around me like a hidden order to existence that emerged only in the presence of grief.
A finger jacket slipping to the floor or something so sad, the shock of something that's so sad could be the normal, necessary way of things.
So we have equanimity and compassion in relationship.
Equanimity perhaps purifies our compassion.
Our compassion when purified by equanimity becomes less compulsive, less codependent, less grandiose, less self-righteous, more patient.
Then our compassion is strengthened by equanimity. Actions arising from equanimity are more potent, have greater moral force than those arising from clinging.
And so we zigzag our way through caring and not caring, finding the balance that's right in our heart for our energy, for what we're willing to give right now.
And we rest and we serve.
We offer this for consideration.
So thank you.
It's been good to be with you this week.
I appreciate the opportunity to explore these themes together, which feels very much actually in dialogue, even though all we've got is the chat and the talking.
It feels very much like a relationship and a liveness.
Yeah, so I will wish you well. Stay on the chat.
Questions might be able to, I've been reading Catherine Schultz often, so that's lost and found.
Gil has one more week of retreat.
I believe Nikki is here next week and then Gil will return the following.
So yeah, thank you. Thank you all. Yeah, may you be well.
