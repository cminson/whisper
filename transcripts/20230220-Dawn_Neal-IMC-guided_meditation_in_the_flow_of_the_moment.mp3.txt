 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning again. Good morning. And this week, this week we're going to be talking about, I'll be exploring, inner and outer harmony, teachings of the Buddha that talk about cultivating qualities of mind and heart that support the practice internally, the practice towards freedom, and also support beneficial relationships. So we'll start with a meditation. So whenever you are ready and done greeting each other, or even as you're finishing up greeting each other, the invitation is to look around your space, notice where you are, notice your external surroundings, maybe the walls or the sky and the trees if you're outside. Take a look behind you. And tune in. Tune into your surroundings, a soundscape around you. And then settling in. Settling into a posture that feels comfortable and alert. Noticing that you're seeing, softening your eyes, maybe allowing them to close. And checking in, checking in with this body. Noticing any sensations. First maybe the sensations of your skin touching cloth or air, noticing any textures, warmth or cool, pressure, lightness, and noticing the whole body, or the surface of your body meets the world. And perhaps taking one or two slightly deeper, slower breaths, releasing any excess tension, and allowing the mind, the attention, to rest inward, attuning to the sensations of your life's breath, or to the sound around you, and resting, resting in this moment. Perhaps noticing the rise and fall of the belly or abdomen, the flexing of the rib cage, the sensations of air in the back of the throat or the nostrils, or tuning in to the whole body breathing. As you're settling in, setting the intention and intention for this meditation, cultivation of mindfulness, perhaps may this be of benefit, or whatever intention works for you, and then releasing that, allowing the mind, the heart, to rest in the flow of the moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. See how kindly and how much friendliness you can invite the return of mindful awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Attuning and reattuning to the sensations, the felt sense of breathing of the moment, allowing these to carry you, carry you in the moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And in the last remaining moments of this meditation, Invitation is to notice, appreciate any little flicker of well-being, kindness, pleasure, relaxation, any of the benefits of this practice. Even just the commitment, the consistency of showing up, being here, and gathering those, gathering those together in your heart, and turning your internal gaze outwards, outwards to the others this life touches. Imagining sharing those benefits with each and every person and being you come into contact with, and even those further out, casting your inner gaze and opening your heart far and wide. May others be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings everywhere be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. Thank you.
