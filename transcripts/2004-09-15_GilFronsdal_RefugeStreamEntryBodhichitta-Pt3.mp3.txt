 One of the ways of talking about this process of being present for our immediate experience, being present to have a knowing presence for what's happening in the present moment, is to think of the practice as being a process of revelation. And revelation is not a particularly Buddhist word, but the idea that things are just being revealed. And revelation is, where does it come from? Things are being revealed, so an itch is being revealed, that's what's happening now, or a sound outside, or a thought, or a feeling. These things are being revealed, and that what's being revealed is, in some way or other, is constantly changing. It's always in flux, always moving. That if you really stay in the present moment, what you'll be aware of is things will change. Your attention will change focus on different things. What you're focusing on will change as you pay attention to it in some way or other. That one of the things you become aware of is a constant change in flux. And in fact, the idea of permanence, the idea that something actually doesn't change, more often than not, is there because we're not in the present moment, but rather in our thoughts and our ideas. And to a great extent, the idea of permanence is a concept that the mind makes up, and that when we live too much in the mind and our thoughts, then things can seem permanent. So, you know, it's fairly common, I think, for some people to have the experience to know that their depression may be, or whatever fulfilling their anger, maybe it's going to be impermanent, maybe it'll pass at some point. But in the day that it's happening, it's like, oh my God, this is it. This is permanent. I'm going to be this way forever. But if you really stay there with the experience, it'll change. It'll flow and move from those things. So the process of revelation, for me, is a helpful idea for the practice. So as I said before lunch, the first kind of major turning in the Buddhist kind of system or whatever that, Buddhist system is that of refuge. Somehow feeling that this, yes, something of great ascent, the great yes, yes, this, there's a new way I want to live my life, new kind of orientation for my life. And I want to place this somewhere near the center of my life, maybe at the center of my life, or close enough that I want to acknowledge this. It's a very important organizing principle for my life. And that somehow, in some way, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha represent, reflect this new value or this new possibility, this new experience. Having that deep conviction and trust and confidence in this thing we call the refuges of Buddha, Dharma, and the Sangha certainly can help a person relax and be more trusting and brings with it the tools of learning how to be in the present moment, paying attention to the present moment. It's very important to develop a certain degree of integrity. Without integrity, you can't enter the stream. What it says, enter the stream, you need to have a certain kind of deep conviction in the Buddha, Dharma, and the Sangha. And you need to have a strong conviction, not even more than conviction, you need to actually be a person of integrity. And that makes a lot of sense to me because if you want to be in the stream, you have to, in a sense, become the stream. And if part of you is holding back from the stream, then you can't be the stream. And being the stream is to have integrity. Integrity has a lot to do with being very honest about what's actually happening for you, who you are, what's going on, what your experience is. And I think that, for me, lays at the bottom of integrity. And if you don't have that kind of integrity, how can you expect then to become the stream or to enter the stream? Because you're holding back in some way. You're standing on the shore, kind of looking at the river instead of going into it. So it requires a very, my experience is, a very deep, thorough honesty about what's going on right now, getting real about who we are, what's going on. And then bringing presence, bringing awareness, bringing mindfulness to what that experience actually is. To recognize it, to be honest about it, to be real about it, and then to bring careful mindfulness to it. And if we do that, we'll notice a lot of things that get in the way. We'll notice that there's fear, many things you mentioned today. There's, you notice that there's ideas that this shouldn't be, ideas that I have to fix it. All kinds of ideas that get in the way of just letting yourself fully be there for that experience as it actually is, as if it has permission to be there, as if it has a right to be there in its own glory, its own situation. So you have, you know, whatever it might be. You have murderous rage. And so you want to be completely honest about that, but that's what's happening. And then you want to be able to almost enter it with mindfulness, really be present for it. And then that kind of, and in that doing, have a lot of integrity, be very real. And what's going on as a person, as you see, as you, as you begin to kind of enter the stream of the present moment, seeing what's there being very present for the immediacy of your experience. One element that gets born, it comes with that, is the arising of discrimination or discernment, to be able to see the cause and effect relationship of things, to see that things arise, that things pass, that things arise because of certain conditions and they pass because of certain conditions. And so it's not just simply kind of riding a present moment like a wave and only seeing that edge of that wave. But it's also having, the mind naturally will have some little bit larger sense of cause and effect relationship that's going on. You don't have to manufacture it. You don't have to look for that cause and effect relationship. But as you enter into the deep stream, the mind itself is a discerning faculty and it's a certain way when it's calm and relaxed and really seeing. You'll start seeing simple things and start seeing the arising and passing of things, how they arise and pass, what the cause and effect relationship that things are in. Now, this beginning to see the arising and passing of things, their arising and their seizing is very, very important in the course of Buddhist practice. And in fact, it's one of the ways, one of the descriptions in the ancient texts for the kind of insight a person needs to have that's synonymous with becoming a stream enter. So the next turning, big turning after refuge, is that of becoming a stream enter. And that is more than just the act of conviction or faith or confidence in something. But it's now it's somehow what we have confidence in, what we have deep trust in, what we intuit or sense actually has turned us, has changed us in some radical way. So we've allowed ourselves to be changed. And not everyone is willing to allow themselves to be changed. In principle, we might want to be changed, but not at the expense of being present for what's really going on. I mean, you know, anything but that. So let me develop some really good concentration and avoid what's going on. But you have, but you want to really be present. So the second turning is becoming a stream enter. And it's usually understood to be the first experience of awakening, of bodhi, of realization, of nirvana, of enlightenment, you know, always has more words for it. And the Theravada tradition, the early Buddhist tradition, posits that are four stages in becoming enlightened. And the first one is becoming a stream enter. The second is becoming a once returner. The third is becoming a non returner. And the fourth is called an arahat. What these mean is that a stream enter is someone who's entered the stream of the Dharma. And now the Dharma or reality is going to carry them because they're now inclined, they're leaning in that direction. Reality is going to carry them to full liberation, no matter what something will, it'll happen sooner or later. And what it says, what the tradition says, it'll happen within seven lifetimes. So there are people then who become stream enters and they stop practicing because they feel like I got a maid. It's not going to happen this lifetime. I know that's not going to be further. But I know I got a maid. And so they just coast, you know, and I don't know what happens to them. They coast for six lifetimes in the seventh lifetime. You know, there's something happens. I don't know. But the idea is that once you've gotten that experience of liberation, that then things are turned and changed for you. So there's no turning back. You're in the water, you're in the stream, the current, it's going to carry you no matter what. The second level or second stage of awakening is called a once returner. And this is a much more thorough or fuller transformation from this experience of nirvana. And now the person is guaranteed so deeply in the stream. So you know, maybe it's in the fast part of the river. And now the person is going to happen much faster. And the person is only going to be reborn one more time. So again, you could coast if you want. But next lifetime, it's really going to happen. You need to guaranteed only one more lifetime before you reach your full full awakening. The third stage is a higher degree of transformation. And this is called a non returner. And here the idea is that you're so deeply in the stream. Now it's rushing by, rushing by, rushing in it. And you're not going to be reborn at all as a human being. But you will be reborn in some kind of celestial realm. That's very fantastic to get born into. And in that wonderful place, you'll have your final liberation or awakening, your freedom. And then the fourth and final stage of awakening is what's called an arhat. And the word arhat simply means someone who's worthy, a worthy one. And this is someone who has been transformed completely by the stream. And this is where sometimes people say, they now have become the stream. Some people will say that stream entry, it's kind of like maybe mixing metaphors or ideas in a confused way. But it's kind of like if you're out in the desert and you just can't believe that there's any water here in the desert and you're parched and thirsty and you've been looking for years for water and just getting worse and worse, you're dying of thirst and you can't believe there's any water here. And then finally you come across a little pond, oasis in the desert and you say, wow, now you really know there is water here. You're standing at the edge of it. You really know there's water. Isn't that something? You have confidence, you're convinced about the possibility of water. There's no doubt in your mind the water exists, but you really see it. You know it. You can't go back now. Your mind's not going to go back. You're convinced. You know it. And that would be like stream entry. And becoming fully awakened would mean that you just dove right in. You dove into the pond and you didn't even hold yourself back. You just plunged into it and in a sense you become the pond, become the stream, you become the Dharma, becoming being Dharma. There's no difference between you and the Dharma, the flowing of Dharma. Until that point there is probably always going to be some, what it says, it's always going to be some divide between you and the Dharma, you and the flow of reality in the present moment. That somehow you hold yourself apart from it. I'm here, reality is there and I'm experiencing it. And there's different ways in which we hold ourselves apart. In which different ways in which this relationship to reality exists and the different levels of enlightenment have to do with the transformation or purification of some of these different dimensions or realms that we are doing it. So the stream entry in the Theravadan tradition is considered a very, very important milestone in someone's practice. And many people in the Theravadan tradition are practicing in order to become stream enters. A lot of teachers are hoping your students to bring them to stream entry. There's places in Asia that sometimes are, sometimes casually called stream entry factories because they seem to have a high success rate in leading people to stream entry. And so in terms of some kind of experience of realization in the Theravadan tradition, that's the one that's considered the most common, easiest to attain and the most commonly talked about. After that, people don't talk so much about what happens after that, they're at stages. Now what happens in Asia is that there are many different schools of meditation, many different school teachers and they have different definitions of what constitutes stream entry. What is that moment? What is that experience like? What defines someone when they become a stream enter? And so then you can have wonderful inter-religious dialogues and debates, fights, conflicts about my criteria of stream entry is better than yours. That teacher said, you have stream entry? Well, you can't be. That's nothing like stream entry. Because stream entry is this. So it's just ugly when you get into the world of trying to decide who has it and what it is and all that. And it's kind of unfortunate. But you know, so different people have different ideas of what that's supposed to be. Some of it focuses on being really clear about what the stream entry experience exactly is, as if there's some particular experience that it actually is. The most common way in the suttas that the Buddha describes stream entry, it kind of describes it, is he says that you know that someone has stream entry when they have unshakable confidence in the Buddha, unshakable confidence in the Dharma, unshakable confidence in the Sangha, and they're endowed with the virtue that wise people would praise. So you can decide for yourself, you have unshakable confidence in these things. And as your virtue such that a wise person would come in here and say, oh yeah, that's good. How you are. Or you have something you want to hide because you steal pencils from work and you know, or something. So that makes it kind of less mystical. It's not like focusing on some great experience, but rather on the level of, you know, something that's kind of discernible about how strong your confidence is. Another way in which tradition talks about the experience, early suttas talk about the experience of stream entry, is that it involves the very clear seeing that things arise and pass, that things arise because of conditions and they pass because of conditions. And there's something about seeing that, that leads to a kind of, to an experience of liberation. And I'll try my best to explain that. I'd like to read one, one quote from the suttas of a man who attained stream entry, description of it in its suta 56 in this middle length discourse. It's a householder whose name was Upali. So the Buddha talked to him for a while and then the Buddha, so here, I'll give you the whole thing. The Buddha gave Upali progressive instructions, that is talk on generosity, talk on virtue, talk on heavens, explain the danger and the defilement that comes with sensual pleasures and the blessings of letting go. When he knew that the householder Upali's mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances, elated and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to the buddhas, suffering, its origin, its cessation and the path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take die evenly, so too while the householder Upali sat there, the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him and he had the thought, all that is subject to arising is subject to cessation. Then the householder Upali saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, he crossed beyond doubt, did away with perplexity and became independent of others in the teacher's dispensation. Then he said to the, oh that's okay, so here this vision or statement, all that is subject to arising is subject to cessation. There's something about seeing that, so it's not a belief, it's not understanding it, but there's something in the direct seeing of the arising and passing of things, that something passes away and something arises, that is liberating and enlightening. And in seeing that, the person is transformed very radically and there's no more any doubts. The spotless Dhamma I, vision of the Dhamma, as it is, having a Dhamma I is the same thing as becoming a Stream-Enter. So in order to maybe to explain this a little bit, why this might be so, it might be helpful to understand a little bit more about the transformation that's supposed to happen when a person becomes a Stream-Enter. With Stream-Enter, the person is said to eradicate, to remove, destroy, bring to an end, three what's called fetters, three things that keeps the mind or the heart bound or shackled or in prison a little bit. And after all liberation is being liberated, right? So liberated from what? That which keeps us liberated, so the tradition has these words like you know shackles or bars or prisons and things like that. So Stream-Enter involves the ending of three and the first one has to do with getting caught up in the world in obsessions and clinging to self-identity, to see anything as being this is who I am. And in the Buddhological language of these texts, it'll say that the person no longer see that the body is self, that our feelings are self, that perceptions are self, that mental content, mental formations, mental attitudes and tendencies are self, or that awareness or consciousness itself is self. But in our kind of modern language, I think it's very fair and more maybe easier if we see it, as a person no longer liable to take anything as this defines who I am. Most people are taking things as this defines who I am. Often that happens in relationship to other people. We define ourselves in relationship to other people and other ideals or all kinds of things. And so we're looking at sense outside of ourselves and creating a definition of who I am, how I want to represent myself, or how I think I'm representing myself, or how I don't want to represent myself. This whole world of selfing, of self-identity. Who we think we are in relationship to other people. So you know, I am a kind person. So I might be a kind person, but to have the to cling or hold on to identity, I am a kind person, is to fall into this fetter. And why it's called a fetter or prison is that once I get caught in the idea, I am a kind person. I define myself that way. I've limited myself. I've contracted myself. I've narrowed myself in who I am, a definition of who I am. Any definition or any particular idea of who I am is much smaller than our capacity to be aware, to be conscious. It's kind of like consciousness or awareness is bigger, bigger than what we define ourselves by. So I don't know if you've had the experience of kind of being present. We can even do it now. Let's do a little exercise. Just where you are, close your eyes. And then think of some way, historically or in the present moment, something that you think defines who you are. Some idea of identity. Maybe even one that hurts to have. But it doesn't have to be one that hurts. It could be anything. Some concept idea of, this is who I am. I am this way. And then quietly say it to yourself. I am this. I am. And now say it again. And the next time you say it, as you say it, see if you can relax into a wider sense of presence, wider sense of being that's much bigger and broader and expansive than anything that's represented by that particular thought. So, open your eyes. I've never asked anyone to do that before. She made it up. How did it work? What happened? Is that meaningful at all? At a point to anything? Give you a sense of something? First figure out which of the many things that I'm trying to define myself by, I was going to choose. I had chosen that. I can see how it was a complexion. An exclusion. And even within that category, I was starting to think, you know, so I think it conveyed that. I want to know, to me, the interesting thing is the first thing you were going to realize kind of different ones. Crowded. So, the first of these, so with stream entry comes clear seeing enough of something that shows a person that any kind of definition of who we are is inadequate as representation of who we are. And since most of us go around most of the time, seeing the world through a self-identity, that's a very radical transformation for some people. So, you see, oh, it doesn't make any sense to define myself X, Y, and Z. If I do that, I mean, conventionally it does. I mean, I could say that I'm here at IMC, I'm a Dharma teacher. I could say that. It's a fair enough statement to make. If my psyche in some deeper way is holding onto that, clinging to that, then I become less than who I am. I become less than what reality is. It's kind of a contraction, a limiting that goes on. And if I stay in that limitation, it hurts. And it's possible for someone to stay in that limit, that kind of limitation for a lifetime and not know that anything else is possible. And stay in that contraction and think that's the way reality is made. That's what, you know, how could it be any different? This is what, you know, and it really takes something radical to break the shell. See, oh, there's a whole other way. The analogy for this given in the suttas is that of a blind person who's given a cloth to hold, maybe to, you know, wipe his face or blow his nose or something. I don't know what, but given this cloth. But it's an oily and grimy cloth, you know, stinky would work for the analogy, but grimy and oily and ugly. And then at some point, this person takes all his medicine and his, his or her eyesight is restored. And the person sees, wow, this stuff is really grimy. What am I doing carrying this look in my face with this oily, grimy kind of cloth? So the same way I said with ourselves that if we always stay in this contracted world of self identity, we might think that this is just fine. This is the way it's supposed to be. But when the Dharma eye is opened, they say, wow, how could I have been holding on to that? That doesn't make any sense. It's painful hold on to that. Why would anybody want to? Why would anybody bother? But until the shell has been broken, it's the whole reality is that contraction and how would a person know there's anything else? So the first transformation is, is in this basically kind of around a belief person no longer believes that any of these things, but belief is not the right word here. The person has seen in such a deep way that it isn't just a matter of believing or being convinced, but in some way, having the visceral feeling having, having the physical mental experience of what it's like to have a presence, which is not contracted around a self identity, to actually see that in a very, very thorough deep way. So that that memory of that or that, that experience then becomes something that maybe not always present, but it's close at hand. That you really, the possibility of having an identity or having a way of being a presence, which is not contracted around the self is so obvious because it's so you can experience it so close at hand. And because it's so close at hand, the tendency, the desire to cling is not going to, you know, it's going to loosen up more and more and more, enter the stream and they're going to just want to let go, let go, let go, because why bother doing this? Why bother picking up this dirty cloth again? The second transformation is a transformation of, at this point, the person is said to have no more doubt. There's no more uncertainty. And doubt itself or uncertainty is a fed or a hindrance. Keeps us back, keeps us inhibited or keeps us confused or keeps us from not from plunging in fully. And what it says, what it says, a number of things. One is that until that experience of stream entry, until you have the experience of actually radically stepping outside of that shell of self, the person is always going to have some doubt, some remnants of doubt about the Buddha Dharma and the Sangha. Even though their faith or their conviction or the trust is very deep, they're always going to have some doubt because they haven't actually tasted it or seen it for themselves. It's like you're in that desert and you have the map. The map says, yeah, there's water over there, but you know, can you really trust this map? I mean, that map was written 2500 years ago and, you know, lakes rise and pass, they dry up and, you know, how could you really know? And, but once you see it, you know that the lake is there because you've seen it. So then there's no more doubt about the existence of that lake. So once you had this experience, then there's no more doubt about the Buddha Dharma and the Sangha. It's kind of like then you have no doubt about that the Buddha was really liberated. Yeah, so if this happened to me, this is what could have happened to the Buddha. This is what happened to the Buddha. And for some people, it's a kind of almost like an act of imagination. Then you can say, wow, I know what's possible. Now, in a Buddha, it must be someone who's really integrated this possibility into their full being. Isn't that awesome? Isn't that amazing? The analogy I like to use is based on when we used to be over in Portola Valley. Portola Valley had this linoleum floor that had squares in it, you know, one square foot linoleum tiles. And sometimes we get there Sunday morning and they'd have a party the night before. And you could smell the beer that had spilled on the floor and it was all sticky and everything. Well, imagine that that linoleum floor with all the partying and everything could happen there. And it wasn't cleaned for three or five hundred years. You know, the doors are kept open, the dust comes in. And slowly over the centuries, you know, the dust and the beer and everything, the zafu dust and everything kind of builds and builds and builds. Until finally you have, you know, maybe like, I don't know, a foot of not just dust and grime, but because people have been sitting there and walking and dancing, it's really packed down and it's really solid, like baked, you know, with a hot summer weather and stuff like that. And after 500 years, people, you know, don't even remember there was a floor down there. I mean, no, you know, it just, you know, this is what it is. And then someone comes across some little reference in the back files of Portola Valley City Council that there's a linoleum floor there. And there's no, no, no, no, and no one, my father doesn't, my mother doesn't remember, their parents don't remember, their great grandparents don't remember. There's no way there's someone's like, yeah, I think there must be. So someone has the tenacity to start chiseling away at that floor. And it's really hard, you know, and it takes a lot of work chiseling and banging and jack sawing and, and slowly, finally, they get down to the linoleum floor and they clear out one square foot tile and they see, wow, it's a beautiful shut tile. I can polish a little bit and put some wax on it and it's really something. It's beautiful and smooth and wow. And now that person knows, yes, in fact, there is a linoleum floor down there. There's no doubt about it. Now they can imagine there's polyimoleum all the way out to the walls. Buddha is someone who's cleaned the linoleum all the way out to the walls and the whole floor is, is clean. So you can, that's kind of, that's kind of, you can imagine, you know, once you have that experience, you can imagine what a Buddha might be like. Yes. Maybe this is where I lost track of myself before, pick up from something earlier. The different, different meditation traditions have different definitions of what stream entry is. And sometimes even within certain traditions, people can have the experience of stream entry in different ways. And some people can have it, so it's really clear that something transformative and powerful has happened. The Big Bang, you know, theory of religious life. And in other people, it's like a whimper. It's like something happens and they don't even know it themselves. It's maybe the teacher who knows it. They come and report and talk to the teacher and the teacher says, oh yes, you know, the teacher recognizes it, but they don't recognize it. You know, it's very important not to look for, you know, a particular experience as being the thing, but it's experienced in a variety of ways. But in some way or other, it changes the person in some fundamental way. Now it's possible to have an intuition or a glimpse or, you know, in some sense, the world of enlightenment, the world of nirvana, the deathless dimension we have up there on the wall, is always here with us. So it's something that's always present. So it's possible to get some kind of relationship to it, some glimpse or some sense or intuition of it, you know, available to anybody if you kind of, you kind of help people. But one thing to kind of get a kind of some glimpse of it, it's another thing to see it so thoroughly and completely that you've been changed by it, irrevocably changed. So doubt. And it's also said that with the removal of the fetter of doubt, that's when a person really knows what the practice is all about. There's no doubt about the practice anymore. And maybe it sounds a little bit discouraging, but it's kind of like you don't even know what practice is until you become a stream mentor. And some people are practicing in order to become a stream mentor and go into spiritual retirement then. In a sense, you don't really can't really know what practice is all really about until you've had that that turning, that glimpse. And the third fetter is that of clinging, attachment to, it's usually translated as rites and rituals. Clinging to, the literal translation would be clinging to precepts or virtue, clinging to virtue, clinging to ethics, and clinging to, and it's either religious practices, one translation of it, or the other possible translation is to vows. It has both meanings, to religious vows. And I like to take it in a broader sense. It's any attachment to being ethical and any attachment to religious practices of any kind at all, whether it's rituals or crystals or anything. Now, this doesn't mean that because in giving up attachment to rites and rituals, to practices in ethics, that you're supposed to be unethical or not to engage in religious practice, spiritual practice. It means you're not attached to it. And there's a number of ways in which people are attached to these things. One way has to do with self-identity. People's identity can be deeply invested into being spiritual. You know, look at me, I'm cool, you know, this is the way they had the best identity on the block. And so that's one way people get attached to it. Another way is that out of a sense of kind of fear or hope or insecurity, I need to hold on to something for dear life so that I could, you know, get by in life. So I'm going to hold on to these rites and rituals. And that's a constriction. That's a, that's a, and it blocks the free flow of our life. The other way that, is that it's a confusion about what will lead to liberation. And so people think, oh, if I'm just ethical enough, that will lead me to liberation. If I follow certain rituals, that itself will bring me to liberation. But when you had stream entry, then the person really realizes that it's not a matter of rituals, not a matter of this practice, spiritual practice, different kinds of techniques of practice. It's not about vows or, you know, being a religious person. It really has to do with being able to see very directly some very deep aspect of reality of our mind, how it works. That's what it takes, is that's kind of seeing. So then you're not going to hold on and be attached to these things that they're going to get you enlightened because you realize they're not going to do it. They might be supportive, but in and of themselves, they are not going to get you liberated. So those are the three fetters that get dropped away with stream entry. In a sense, they're cognitive. They have to do with understanding. You understand something about identity or, you know, fundamentally self identity, usual forms of self identity. We have the little self, the egotistical self that we have, the ego self, which we often orient ourselves in life around, is only part of the picture. It's kind of a contraction that gets in the way of being free. Understanding about doubt and what is and is not the path. And then the last one, understanding some understanding about rights and rituals, practices and ethics. The next fetters, the next two fetters, which are diminished for once returners and eradicated for non-returners, is sensual desire and ill will. And so after stream entry, a person still has sensual desire and still has capacity for ill will. The one to returner just diminishes it. You have less after that. And you're less clinging to sensual pleasures of all kinds and to ill will. And then becoming a non-returner, then that's finished with you. You no longer have any clinging or drive or attachment to sensual pleasures or to ill will, having ill will. And so those are affective. They're more of an affective side of our life, the emotional side. And you can see that the intellectual side, or that makes the wrong word, the cognitive side of our life of understanding is a lot easier to penetrate and break through than the emotional aspects of our life, which is represented by sensual pleasure and ill will. So stream enter. So stream enter is one who sees into the world of impermanence very deeply, sees the arising of things and the passing of things, sees that with the arising of something, it'll pass away. Now why is that so transformative? One is that as you see impermanence with enough directness, with much immediacy, without any filters, without any attachments getting in the way, then you realize you can't find any self in that experience. You can't find anything in that experience which makes any sense to define this is who I am. So you see rising and passing strong enough that you can look around, it doesn't make any sense. That's on the way to stream entry. There is tremendous equanimity about that. It's one thing to see that, but then you can be afraid. People panic at this point, because we tend to organize ourselves in our life and feel safe by how we, by through the filter of our self-identity, who we think we are, who we think we need to protect, or how people see us, who we want people to see us, all this whole game of self-identity. When you see through that, begin to see through that, it can be very frightening, because then what's left? How am I going to trust reality then? How do I take care of myself? It's safe to be so exposed and transparent. I have to kind of hold myself and protect myself. Some people will panic, but when the practice goes deeper and that experience of arising, passing is something we relax into and develop a tremendous equanimity about, then at some point there can be a seeing, a kind of a seeing, kind of an experience, a kind of a, of that which is not arising and passing. And to give you a little information on how this might work, when we sit down to meditate, when the mind is agitated and very busy and active, the body can seem solid and fixed. As the mind gets stiller, the body is experienced to be more a field of changing sensations and flux, and its solidity begins to dissolve into a sense of flow and movement. As the mind gets stiller, there's a juxtaposition between the mind that's still and the body that's moving, but the mind itself, even though it's quite still, is a kind of a movement, maybe much more subtle. It arises and passes also. And there is something which is not arising and passing. And that is called, in the tradition, one of the ways is called the deathless. When the Dharma eye arises, the person not only sees arising and passing, but sees that which is in the cracks of the rising and passes, that which is other than, or sees that which is able to be the container for arising and passing, or that which is outside of arising and passing, that dimension of consciousness of awareness, which is not subject to arising and passing. And that's called deathless. And I liken it very much to the experience of timelessness, because it has no definition in time. It has a sense, the sense that it's always been there and always will be here. But it just doesn't make any sense in that kind of that dimension of consciousness to talk about where it came from, or what made it happen, what constructed it, what conditioned it, or that it's going to pass away. It has a kind of timeless quality to it. What happens to the timeless presence? Does it disappear? Moments disappear, right? This moment is going to go into the past, right? Just did. The timeless presence, does that disappear? I think in the subjective experience of timeless present, it just always here. It's eternal in a sense, the eternal present, they say. So the deathless has its same kind of quality. Some teachers will say that it really is permanent. It's always been. And some teachers will say, well, it's subjectively, it feels that way, but who knows? It's a dimension of consciousness. So in the early texts, that's the primary way in which people talk about stream entry. Teachers in Asia, one of the reasons why they want to have these stream entry factories, why they're so focused on that, it's kind of like a born again kind of thing where if you get saved, you believe in Jesus, then you're saved, you're taken care of, you'll be okay. And until then, you're not going to be okay. Well, it's kind of like the same thing in Buddhism, I'm sorry to say, a little bit shy to say, is that once you have a stream enter, then you're assured the word is assured or guaranteed. The word that's usually translated is assured, but guaranteed that you will be fully liberated within seven lifetimes. So the teacher no longer has to worry about you anymore. You're set. Get a person not far in their sets, you know, and what they do, you know, they can do what they do. And be nice if they keep practicing, but, but you know, they're set. So what do you think of that? Any questions at this point? Could be the seventh one. There probably is. I don't know. I don't even know about lifetimes myself. But this is what they believe in. And there are, there are people who supposedly can somehow see people's rebirth and look back in the past and see things. And well, it's important to the culture that he's spent his whole life proving to himself that there was no self. How could there be that trans-migration of souls? I mean, he proved that there wasn't. No, the Buddha didn't prove that there's no self. What do you realize is that? For all purposes. I mean, so there's metaphysical speculation. Right. That's what Buddha said. Any kind of discussion about self as metaphysical speculation is not needed. So rebirth stages. Oh, the there's a difference between a metaphysical self and an empirical self. If I have an itch, I don't scratch you. You know, it's itches here. And, you know, if I need to pee, you know, I don't send someone else to do it for me. You know, I'm the one who has to do that. So there is some integrity or some something that happens in this stream of life that's here that we recognize as being having some integrity in that stream. And what the Buddhist tradition will say is that stream will continue beyond one lifetime. But in that stream of rising and passing phenomena, it doesn't make any sense to point to any particular thing saying, this is the self. If you want to casually say, this is the self that gets reborn, nothing that is okay with that. But there is no thing that's being reborn. It's a stream of arising and passing phenomena. Now, it gets more interesting than this. So as I said, the stream entry involves understand a seeing through or dropping the fetter of self identity, you're no longer liable to take something as being a definition of who you are. There can still remain the sense. So to put that in kind of logical words, it's any kind of statement that can fit the formula, I am blank. I am, you know, whatever. When a person realizes that the blank doesn't make any sense to limit oneself or to contract oneself around the blank in any kind of way, there can remain a sense intuitive sense or a feeling of I amness. Yes, I understand that there's doesn't make any sense to, you know, identify myself with anything. But there's still a sense of I amness that remains. So we don't fill in the blank, just I am not I am blank, I am, there's an amnesty or I am here. And that can feel much prettier and broader, more expansive, spacious than any kind of contracted sense of self that comes, you know, with I am blank, that sense of I am is understood in tradition to still be a fetter is still a form of contraction, even though it can feel in contrast to what you had pretty, pretty wonderful. The Arhat, the last final stage of enlightenment is someone who's also let go of the fetter of I amness. And that's why they said that Arhat is someone who's entered the stream has become the stream. There's no separation between them. And you know, I am here and the world out there. So that's the highest level of realization. Yeah. The intuitive sense of amness, I am just I exist. I am a teacher in the I am sense. And then how does one how what's the concept for I amness? There's no concept. Oh, there's no definition. It's just a feeling of presence. You may feel a sense of being or sense of awareness. And with that sense of awareness, a sense of being a sense of presence, there's a sense of I am, I think that for I am, or, you know, I presence there for I am, I vibrate there for I am, you know, or whatever, you know, I'm aware. So, you know, I am to the sense of amness, I can still remain. And so, letting go of that, then the mind opens up to a whole other level of release of openness. So then, you know, this idea of becoming the Dharma, rather than becoming the stream, rather than being little bits, you know, distinct from it. That reminds me, I had some notes from Philip over to you this year, this book of no separation. Meaning, sounds like what you're saying for the Arahat. That was a Zen idea, I think that, that when there's no separation between yourself and what's happening, you simply are happening along with what's happening. Is that like what could be described that way. However, it doesn't make any sense in the experience doesn't make any sense. Because whenever you have separate, we have no separation, there's still some idea of I am in that. I'm not separated from you. If you know, both idea of separation and non separation disappear, there's no reference point to say we're separated or not separated. I found it very intriguing when you said the different fetters that fall away through the stages and that the conceptual and the physical boundary of sort of self goes away first, and then goes away with essential pleasure, and the likes and dislikes. Sometimes I feel in my meditation, especially if they're guided meditations, so I can really concentrate it. That the sense of boundaries, if I'm listening to sound as Norman Fisher, I think led us through the other day, Sati Center event, that I disappeared and the we're just listening to sounds in the environment. And there was really no distinction between me, the listener and the sounds. The sounds and me, it was really, really one space and just sounds emerging. But there was a very clear distinction between the sounds I liked. And I didn't even have a notion of that's a car, that's a door slamming and that's, but there was a very distinct sense of I like that this sound is pleasant and this sound is unpleasant. Is that sort of the same level? I mean, are you talking, I mean, do you have the same gradation in an individual meditation experience? Sort of the boundary of the self goes away. I'm not saying there was no sense of self, but there was sort of, you know, much more, but the sense of like and dislike was very clearly present. The sense of what? Like and dislike, you know, pleasant, unpleasant was very clearly there. So there's a distinction between things being pleasant and unpleasant versus liking and not liking what's there. So things might be very unpleasant or very pleasant in enlightened awareness, but there wouldn't be any liking or disliking particularly. I'm not even aware of the distinction. That's a very important distinction. Could you make that further? It really seems the same, seems to be if it's, oh, you mean you're talking about the cling in the attachment. Yeah, so to the pleasant and you want more of that and you want less of the sort of leaning into and leaning away. There can be unpleasant experience and no disliking of it, no aversion to it. Just there and what you're willing to be there. Okay, it's okay. Let it be there. And then there can be pleasant experience the same thing. Just let it be there. It's okay. The mind is a quantumist, at peace with it. Something I should have known. I mean, it's just something you forget and you have to be brought back to. And so that's a very important distinction to make because in that, in that gap or in that space between pleasant and unpleasantness and liking and not liking, there's a chance for liberation. Is to be free, to find some freedom there. So what you're saying is that our hunt will still know the difference between pleasant and unpleasant, but won't have any like and dislike. I'm not an arhat, so I can't. I think so. I'm stuck back on the deathless when you said that, can't remember exactly how you said it, but what I heard was that it's a, an awareness or a consciousness. A dimension of consciousness or awareness. And that it, it's timeless. In the same way that the present moment is a timeless presence. It has no. Right. Okay. Over and over, Buddha says that consciousness is conditioned on the, the object and the organ that's sensing it. I haven't seen a student in which he says there's any other consciousness than the conditioned kind. Mostly, mostly he has what he talks about and mostly that when he talks about consciousness in the condition types, he first, that consciousness which belongs to the five aggregates, the five aggregates, the five skandhas. So form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness. And, and that's primarily the kind of consciousness that arises in the, in, at the various sense doors. So when there's sight, there's sight consciousness that arises. And if there's no sight, then there's no sight consciousness that arises. If there's no smell, there's no smell consciousness at rises. If there's no taste, if no taste, consciousness to the rises that particular sense consciousness arise with the contact with that sense. And the mind is the same way. There's a particular kind of mind consciousness that only occurs when, for example, a thought arises and you know that thought is happening or other things internally. The Buddha also talked about consciousness without feature or a consciousness which is luminous. And it's a little bit hard from these kinds of texts to pull it all out. But the way that the parts of the Theravada tradition understand it and the way scholars pull out, understand the text, is that the only way to understand or the best way to understand what nirvana is, this experience of nirvana, it is not some kind of external reality you're tuning into, but rather it's this dimension of the mind, dimension of consciousness. That consciousness has no object which stands outside of objects in the sense it's bigger than objects. And so it's not being defined or arising because of a particular object, you know, sense object, sense experience. So it is a form of consciousness but it's not the consciousness that usually we're living in. I'm asking that there are actually very credible spirits, modern physicists who are doing work to try and come to a better understanding of why things work the way they do than what we have now, more unified. And they're actually beginning to throw time out of the picture at the very, that very, very objective level of what's really there. And to me that seems intuitively correct for reasons I could go on about for a long time. But I think that that is a very dear thing to me, is the sense of being this body in this mind will always be completely convinced of it. There's no way out of that. But at the same time there may be a deeper knowing that, and it goes along with this idea that everything is okay and perfectly and precisely okay, that and it always has been and always will. And to me it's just exciting to see that there are people that are taking it into physics as well. So you know it may be that after 3,000 or 6,000 years or however long it takes, people go, ah, that's what he meant. So one of the consequences of stream entry is the person knows now what the path is. Knows that the path is found by being fully present, immediately present, for what's happening in the present moment now. That's where it's found seeing there, that's the doorway in. And that happens to be the same practice that gets you to stream entry. So in a sense, stream entry is a little bit of an arbitrary division in terms of the practice a person would engage in. It's kind of like a little encouragement along the way. But before and after you do the same practice. And that's important because one of the forms of religious identity that people get attached to, even though you're supposed to know better at this point, is that of becoming attached to your identity as a stream enter. And there's a lot of suffering in Buddhist communities, in some Buddhist communities, around who has it and who doesn't have it and I don't have it and I'm supposed to have it and I'm not, it's just awful. And I think it's best not to be too concerned about it. If it can be inspiration and encouragement in your practice along the way, then great. And it could maybe be helpful as you go further in practice, it might be nice to know that this is a possibility or you might get close to it. But there are some people who don't know they have the experience, some people maybe will never have it. There are different ways in which the spiritual life unfolds and it's best not to have a linear model, it's best not to have one particular traditions model as being the model of how it has to happen. But be very deeply respectful for your process. And one of the things that I was hoping to convey today is that in order for this Dharma practice to unfold in a healthy way is for us all to in sense relax into what the present moment experience is and to trust that. And to the immediacy of this very moment's experience. And there's a lot of complicated ways in which we relate to the present moment and begin to understand those complications as a very important part of the practice. And just slowly learn how just to relax and just kind of be willing to just ride the revelation of the present moment. Wow that's happening, that's happening. And let it reveal itself. And I believe that there's a kind of an intelligence or logic or reason or causal nexus that our present moment experiences in if we're fully present in the moment what's unfolding. The psyche, the mind, reality kind of knows what's needed to be revealed in order for the psyche, the mind, to let go deeply enough to become free. So I think one of the most wonderful ways of attaining freedom is to very very deeply trust this present moment experience as it's unfolding. Almost you know become it, let it kind of move through you, let yourself be moved by it, let yourself be filled with it. And ending filled with that experience. Let your knowing of that experience be clear and crisp. Oh this is what's happening. So there's a two-part movement. Letting yourself be filled with the present moment experience, whatever it might be. Trusting it's okay to have your experience as it is. And then in some capacity of the mind know what that experience is. Let yourself be filled with experiences, be filled with embodiment often mostly. Let yourself really be embodied in that experience you're having. And then the mental side of it is has clear knowing of what that experience is, as clear as you can. And it's the combination of those two. The embodied sense of the present moment, coming into the present moment, being embodied in the present moment in all these different ways. And the mental aspect of clearly knowing what it is, that's the clearest way, I think to liberation, to freedom. At least the healthiest. So these exercises we did today, I hope you remember them well enough, that you do them again. And you don't have to do it with someone but you could certainly do them alone. Reflect on these things, you know. Try to learn, try to stay in that flow of your immediate experience moment by moment by moment. Notice, you know, why is it you don't trust the present moment? Notice what gets in the way of being fully present for the present moment. And just you know, be with what's being revealed in any given moment. It's 3.10 and we have 20 minutes to cover something we're supposed to cover today, but we don't have to. Which is bodhicitta. To talk about bodhicitta properly means covering 2,000 years of Buddhist history in 20 minutes. So I'm not going to do that to you. But let me say this and then we'll do a little sitting to end. Often the experience of defining ourselves in a particular way, this is who I am, becomes a kind of a barrier, a shell between ourselves and fully experiencing what's there in front of us. If that experience of that shell drops away and we can really, even just begins to soften, we can begin experiencing the present moment, the flow of the present moment fully and completely into that emptiness of the mind. Then one of the qualities of that open communication, that open perception of other people, other beings, is one of empathy, one of feeling with someone else and being with them. And that's one of the really beautiful qualities of human being, is that capacity of empathy of feeling. And the more empty we are of ego, the clearer and cleaner that empathy can be. And that empathy then, because there's a lot of suffering in the world, that empathy takes form in the context of suffering, of compassion. And for some Buddhists, at some point, they get a sense of the magnitude of suffering in this world. And they get a sense of how we're not so, in a sense, not so separate from others, or in a sense of how we're sensitive, very deeply sensitive to other beings. That the concern for other people's welfare becomes almost as strong, as strong or perhaps stronger, than concern for one's own welfare. And so then, practicing in order to support other people, help other people, becomes a motivating force in one's life. And it isn't something you have to construct or make up or think you have to do because you're supposed to be a good person, but rather something deeply innate in experience itself, in the flow of this movement of experience as related to reveal itself in the present moment. One way of understanding this is that as the filters for awareness drop away, as the definitions that contract awareness, they keep it limited, fall away, and awareness gets becomes more and more spacious or open or expansive, more empty in a sense, that that awareness is, doesn't exist independent from all the rest of our psychophysical being. You know, our psychophysical being is kind of a whole, it all works together. And so there's a inherent in that open awareness is a support of the intelligence of the rest of our being, the rest of our psychophysical being. There's intelligence in that awareness. So awareness by itself is not understood to be something that's kind of, you know, dull like a mirror, like, you know, just kind of just sees and that's it. But in that open awareness of the mind, there's all the intelligence of the mind, all the functionality of the mind is still there, but there's no tendency to cling or to contract or to define any part of ourselves by it. So all this intelligence is there. And so what what Buddhists like to say is that in the emptiness, there is compassion. In open awareness, there is compassion there. There's a movement of compassion there. That's almost part of it, because we don't, you know, all this other stuff is there. But in the clarity of the awareness, just seems like awareness is what is. But of course, if there's more to being human being, just awareness. And so there's this intimate connection in the Mahayana tradition between emptiness and realization and awakening and the experience of compassion. And compassion comes with it. And then it becomes a very important motivator for some people. And some people, their practice is organized around compassion, concern for others. They feel that they're practicing in order to benefit other people as well. That they're including the benefiting others in their own practice. And the last thing I want to say is that I believe that sooner or later, a person will stop practicing unless they have some sense that their practicing is also to benefit other people, other beings. Now, there's something wrong with a person stop practicing. So I'm not saying it's, you know, they're not doing it right. I'm just saying that unless if you want to continue practicing after a certain point, and different people that point is different, different places, it only makes sense and only motivations only there if we have some sense of how that's going to be supportive and helpful for other people as well. That's kind of part of our heart to heartfelt motivation. So I hope it was okay to talk so much. But that was not what I had in mind. I wanted to be more experiential. I didn't want to talk about things. So let's make up for that. As we're sitting here, I wonder if you can have some sense of the timelessness that we're sitting in, the timeless presence. This particular moment exists only right now. It'll never happen again. But as this timeless moment happens, it's within an ocean, a great big field of eternal present, timeless presence, no beginning, no end. In the awareness that senses the timeless present, perhaps you can feel it as awareness which is boundless. The awareness itself is timeless, expansive, and awareness which is not defined by the body, by the feelings, the perceptions, and awareness which is not defined by anything at all. Awareness which is infinite and empty and filled with all things. So thank you for being here and going along. I hope that today, some way or other, proves useful for you in your life, in your practice. It would be lovely if it somehow this day challenged you to look at the area of trust more deeply, confidence, and that maybe you could discover how to have a greater degree of trust in what arises in this wonderful life of ours.
