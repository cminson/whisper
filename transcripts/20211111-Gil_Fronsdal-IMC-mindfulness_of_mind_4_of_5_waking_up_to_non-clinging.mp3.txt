 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So before I give the talk, I want to make a couple of announcements while they're still in my mind, so I won't forget tomorrow. So next week, I won't be here, I'm teaching the first in-person retreat at our retreat center, Insight Retreat Center. And Matthew Bensilver will come and give the 7 a.m. talks and guided meditation. And he's also connecting what he's doing for next week, kind of a little bit larger package for all of you if you want, for the IMC community, the worldwide community. And it includes some evening events, and it includes a Saturday day long, a week from Saturday. And you can read about that on the IMC website, both in the What's New section on the bottom right, and also on the calendar if you go for next week, you'll be able to see these events posted there. And I'm so happy that Matthew's coming back. And with all the guest teachers that we have coming, if you're at all inclined to, if you want to make a donation for them, then there's an easy place to do it. I think on YouTube, underneath the video, there's some text about IMC, and there's a link to the Donate button. And the other thing is that on December 4th and December 11th, two Saturdays, we're having a next round of something we did last spring, which is a mindfulness circle for black-identified individuals. So African-Americans, Africans, anybody identified as black, Anne Royce, and I think it's Kristen Wicker, I'm sorry, Wickerman. Wickerson, I think. I'm sorry, I don't remember exactly. I never met her. But Anne did it before, and she's bringing her friend along this time to help her. And it's an opportunity for black-identified people to meet together and have some discussions and real teachings and community around this mindfulness practice. I see you in the chat, someone wrote Velcro, Leela. Velcro can be a heavenly messenger. Yes. I think what we're learning to do in this practice is to recognize the challenges we have, the way we get stuck and attached, as messengers as opposed to as enemies. And as a messenger, you don't want to kill the messenger, but you want to learn from it. You want to use that opportunity to wake up. And this idea of waking up is such a beautiful one, this concept, that when you wake up to something, nothing changes in the world, but you now see clearly, you now understand clearly. And so maybe there is attachments in the mind, clinging in the mind, but you wake up to it, and it's kind of like you've become bigger than it. And you kind of, oh, that's what's happening. I see it. And there's something about the clear seeing that there's freedom there. There's the big, the process of moving into Teflon is there. So the analogy I'm using is that sometimes the mind can be more like Velcro, more like Teflon, sometimes awareness. And for this week, I'm using these kind of synonymously, mind and awareness. So mindfulness of mind, mindfulness of awareness for this week are the same thing. And it's closely connected to mindfulness of the attitude or the way in which we relate to experience. And what's happening is we practice, we're restoring, there's a restoration process of the simplicity of awareness, the most simple form that's accessible to us. And some people might want to call it the natural state of awareness. It's a little bit philosophically dangerous topic, thing to claim, but it's kind of like that. We just feel so healthy, so right. This is home to have awareness, which doesn't stick to anything, but allows things to arise and pass through. And so as we become mindful of awareness, of mindfulness, mindfulness of mindfulness, mindfulness of attention, it becomes clear that attention is operating with a certain level of porousness, transparency, non-stickiness, non-clinging. There's a clarity to the fact that, yes, there's a sound outside. And it just comes through without any waves or ripples in the mind. It's true that my knee hurts, and there's no ripples, no contractions, no stories, no agendas around it. It's known clearly, and we're awake to it, meaning we've kind of become larger than any story, agenda, reactivity, judgment. And the awareness can just be with it, feel it, with some kind of clarity, like it's Teflon, like things just roll off or allow to just float. So as we do mindfulness practice, and this is not automatic for beginners, but as we do it and get deeper into the practice, at some point we become aware of the nature or the quality or the characteristics of how we're paying attention, the attitude, the engagement, the extra kind of baggage we have along with it. And one of them that's particularly significant for Buddhists is to become aware of the clinging that has us lingering on things, holding onto things, pushing against things, wanting things. And so we have to have this, as we see that clearly, and you can certainly let go of it, but it's also possible to wake up to it. And this waking up to it is the restoration of this healthy, liberated mind. And so we certainly can get relief by letting go, and please let go when it's easy enough to do. But there's a whole other process that has to do with this waking up, the restoration of a clarity in which whatever happens can occur, can pass through. And so one image that's sometimes used for this is the mind becomes like an endless sky, and the sky and things, you know, clouds, birds, all kinds of things go through the sky, but they don't stick to the sky, is the idea. The sky doesn't interfere with them, doesn't stick to it, doesn't hold onto it. The air, the sky just lets everything go right through. So there are times when awareness can be like that. And it is not necessarily so far away, that possibility, if we associate that with this waking up. So rather than saying, how can I be mindful of this thing, we can sometimes ask ourselves, how do I wake up to its presence? How do I wake up to it here? And what's the difference between being mindful knowing it and waking up to it? And as I've said, it's kind of associated with certainly kind of an expansion of awareness, where awareness somehow seems to have lots of capacity to know without reacting to what is known. Lots of capacity to allow things to just be there in the floating in the sky of awareness without doing anything, having an agenda, wanting anything about it. And so as we practice this restoration of a healthy mind, of a free mind, of a Teflon mind, or if you prefer more natural, is a lotus leaf mind, where the water drops or just roll right off a lotus leaf, or a skylight mind. And this is a very different orientation than how most minds are operating, where most minds are operating focused on what it wants or what it doesn't want. It's focused on objects of attention, objects of thought, and sometimes blinded by that or completely preoccupied with that, stuck on it. And now we're turning the attention, it doesn't have to be away from the objects of mind, but we're shifting the focus to something that in a kind of way is bigger than or larger than any particular thing that we're thinking about or wanting or not wanting. And in that spaciousness of mind, openness of mind, stillness of mind, smoothness of mind, there is a degree of freedom, there's a degree of space, there's a kind of a healthy feeling of being alive and breathing. And then we can feel, with that as a reference point, it becomes clear when the mind gets stuck, when the mind gets caught in something, when the mind gets preoccupied, there's stickiness there. And this is one of the great functions of this practice, is we get more and more sensitive, more and more attuned to when we get attached, when we get stuck, when we get contracted, when we get preoccupied in a way that's not so healthy and useful. And that heightened sensitivity ideally doesn't lead to more stickiness, doesn't lead to more judgments and self-criticism being caught, but becomes almost a delight. Oh, I see it here. And this is good that I see it. Great. This is the heavenly messenger, as it was said. And then to ask yourself the question, how do I wake up to this now? What is it like to be awake with awareness? So relaxation that supports a more open awareness, the recognition of awareness itself, the respecting awareness, and now the restoration of this wonderful capacity of awareness. And then tomorrow, the release, the release of awareness. So thank you very much.
