 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome, welcome to happy hour. I'd like to continue a little bit to kind of this exploration that I've been doing about the inner critic. And just to recognize this, sometimes the inner critic arises when there's a certain amount of difficulty when something isn't quite going the way that we want. There might be this quiet way in which there's this, you want to like lash out and blame or in some kind of way and sometimes the blame is towards ourselves. Sometimes, sometimes I wouldn't, I'd like make a silly mistake that's like, ah, sometimes I hear myself going, Tiana. I just say it out loud, right? And I'm like, oh, okay, here we go. Here's this kind of like this inner critic that's kind of saying, get it together in some kind of way. So there's so many different ways in which this inner critic can show up for us. It can be really strong and debilitating, or it can just be like a pesky friend too. So there's a wide range. And maybe for sometimes, you know, it's at one end of the spectrum and sometimes it's at the other end of the spectrum or maybe you only have it at one end of the spectrum. However, it is, it's pretty common. I want to say that everybody has it, but it's pretty common. But I wanted to point to something that we're doing here with like this loving kindness practice or this happy hour is that trying to maybe look at or consider or experience a different way of showing up or taking the authority or the power away from this inner critic. The inner critic can go away, but it's a long slow process. And this is this is part of it. But I want to highlight that when there are difficulties, whether it's just we're feeling frustrated because we're in traffic or we just made a really big mistake for our company and we're afraid we're going to get fired, whatever it might be. That we often think that there's only two choices for dealing with these difficulties. One is to just let all our reactions out and allow them to be expressed or felt. So often this reaction, as I said, is the inner critic. So when there's a difficulty, the inner critic gets activated and we just let it go, let it run loose and do whatever it's going to do. And somehow there's a way in which we're giving it authority or we're believing all the stories that it's saying, maybe because it sounds familiar. So that's one one reaction we can have. Or another reaction when there's some difficulties that arise, again, whether it's minor or major, quote unquote, difficulties, is to kind of like suppress them or deny them or just turn away and try to avoid them and not look at them at all. And of course, this doesn't work in the long run. Everybody has tried this. It's just human nature to try this. And if it did work right, you wouldn't be here at a happier or you would just be avoiding all the difficulties and you wouldn't be trying to come up to learn something else. But what I'd like to suggest is that this loving kindness practice is a third option. A third option, it's not just letting the inner critic run rampant and believe in everything. And it's not suppressing or denying difficulties. But the third option is to recognize what's happening and just hold it. Just hold it. Like, yeah, this is exactly what I didn't want and this is exactly what's happening. And can we just hold it? It's not always easy. And maybe we can only hold it for a little bit and then we have to do option one or option two. We have to vent or we deny or repress or something. But then maybe we can come back to this holding again. And this is absolutely something we can learn. And that we often can build a little bit of confidence with this holding like, oh, okay, it didn't burn me. Sometimes we have this feeling like, you know, like when there's a difficulty like reads like, we don't want to touch it because it's gonna sear us. But it's only through experience again and again and again of holding things that we realize, oh, yeah, okay, I can do this. And so part of this holding is we might say this is some compassion, compassion for ourselves. This recognition that there's suffering. Suffering is a big broad term that means just mild annoyance to read like the worst you can imagine horrifying. It's recognition that there's suffering, but meeting it with warmth and kindness. Compassion. Compassion. And so the self compassion practice, we practice with this idea of we bring to mind some difficulties and then we say the phrase, maybe these difficulties be held with kindness and ease. It's not always easy. That's why we're gonna have to practice this but sometimes it's just helpful to recognize, oh, actually, there is a third option. Between just letting them in a critic or the difficulty run wild or repress or deny it to hold it. Okay, so without as an introduction, let's let's do some meditation practice. Do a little bit of mindfulness, and we'll do is a little bit of loving kindness, because just to relax and warm up so to speak, like, allow the there to be some ease in the body and the mind. And then from that place of ease approaching the difficulties, just so that we have the muscle memory, so to speak, the neural networks path neural pathways, the mental experience of holding things with ease. So we're going to create the conditions in which we can do that here, so that you can then take that out into your daily life. Okay, so just landing in the body. This moment. Just feeling noticing the bodily sensations. Whatever is there. Is there a way you can meet it with a certain amount of openness. And allowing yourself to shift your posture so that you can be comfortable. No need to be uncomfortable. Resting the attention on the sensations of breathing. When the mind wanders, you don't have to make it a problem we just very simply gently begin again. Just tuning into the sensations associated with breathing. Thank you. And then to begin our loving kindness practice, bringing to mind a lovable being someone for whom it's uncomplicated straightforward to feel warmth care, love, kindness, goodwill. Bringing this lovable being to mind. Whether it's a furry family member or a human family member, or maybe somebody that you don't know personally but they have touched your life in some kind of way. Bringing them to mind, connecting them. And feel if there is any warm heartedness towards this lovable being tuning into that. It might not be there, that's perfectly fine. And then to support our cultivating loving kindness support our tuning in to this goodwill that we have. We can repeat these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May you be happy. May you be healthy. Thank you. Bringing this warm heartedness this connection this care with the lovable being can be helpful to check in with the body and see if there is any openness or warmth or softness on the heart or chest. If there isn't anything there it's perfectly fine. But if there is. Allow that to be a support for your loving kindness practice. Thank you. And then to extend this loving kindness to ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Can we extend this warm heartedness to ourselves. No matter how we find ourselves today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May I live with ease. Thank you. And then to extend this loving kindness to ourselves. We can use that as a support for some compassion practice for ourselves. In your life, a minor difficulty on a scale of one to 10, maybe a two or three. Bring that difficulty to mind. You can say this phrase. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. May there be just in a relaxed, easy way, like a support, a heart and a mind being filled with some warmth and care. While we are also expanding, stretching our capacity a little bit to be with difficulties. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Just the other difficulties are showing up. If ever it feels like it's just too much, you can do some mindfulness, go back to loving kindness practice. Whatever feels supported. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May this difficulty be held with kindness and ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So this idea of a third option of how to be with difficulties, rather than letting them get fully expressed or repressing them, holding them. And we could even say the inner critic, of course, is a difficulty. Or sometimes the inner critic gets activated because of difficulty, but it's all kind of intermeshed. But it's this recognition that sometimes we have a preference of either denying or expressing really loudly. You know, we have a preference for one end of the spectrum, or maybe we do a little bit of both. But just to remind us that there's a third option. We can just hold difficulties as best we can, as best we can, right? This isn't easy. It's not fast. It's not pretty. It's not, I don't know, it's not neat and tidy. But this is how life is, and this is how we learn to do things differently as we stretch ourselves and do something that we hadn't done before. So now I'd like to create the opportunity for you guys to express some of this care and warmth and ease and maybe hold difficulties with warmth and ease. I hope not. I hope this isn't difficult. But to allow you to be in small groups, and you can talk about this idea of maybe this idea of a third option as a way to be with difficulties. We might even consider, or we can consider, that the inner critic is a difficulty, right, when it's putting us down, pushing us around, that type of thing. So in these breakout rooms, it's really helpful if you just say one thing and just let it go to the next person and they say one thing, let it go to the next person, they say one thing, and then it comes back around. This is different than educating others, informing others, showing off for others. I know sometimes we just feel passionate about a topic and we just really want to talk a lot and share with everybody. But I think it's best if we have as a way to express our care for each other is to make space for everybody, the introverts and the extroverts, although everybody's voice to be heard and for everybody to feel like they've been seen instead of like, oh my gosh, there's only 20 seconds left. Okay, the last person goes, right? So instead to create an environment that is supported for everybody in the group. And for this group, let's go in numerical order according to the last digit of your phone number. Okay, here we go. Okay, welcome back, welcome back. Sorry, or maybe it was great that you were in there a little bit longer than you expected. I have a little technical glitch and didn't bring you back in. Trudy's giving, she didn't mind at all. Okay, okay, good, good. Sometimes it's nice to have a little extra time then. Okay, well, here we are at the top of the hour. But does somebody have like something quick that they'd like to say a comment? Was that nice to be in the group a little bit longer or like, don't do that again? Trudy. Oh, yeah, see, we have to unmute. I'm trying to, I cannot think I can unmute you. Yeah, you have to unmute yourself. Sorry, Trudy, I can't hear you. Okay. Okay, great, great. So thank you guys, and I'll see you on Thursday. Bye bye. Bye, thank you. Thank you Diana. Good night everyone. Thank you, thank you everyone. Bye all. Bye all. Bye. Bye all, good night, bye.
