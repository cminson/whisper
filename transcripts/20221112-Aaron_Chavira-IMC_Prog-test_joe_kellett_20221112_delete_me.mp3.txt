 So it's recording. So in the upper left you'll see the pause. I see. Okay. So here we are on looking at the discourse on the awareness of the body, Majjhma 119. And to understand a little bit of significance or highlight its value, it's helpful to see how it's different from the other two Satipatthana suttas. And one of the differences is it has a different refrain than the Satipatthana sutta, and the refrain emphasizes concentration. And in fact, the text itself goes through the four jhanas in a way that the other two Satipas do not. So that's significant that it brings the concentration in. The other significant difference is the amount of similes being used. And the Satipatthana suttas has only one simile, that of the wood carver using a lathe, therefore simile for the mindfulness of breathing. But this one has a whole bunch of similes, has four similes for the jhanas. These three similes which I take interpret to be a progressive movement inward from external stimuli to what triggers reactivity to what keeps us filled with wholesomeness. And then the two similes for some degree of awakening. And then the one more simile has to do with the mind that's like the great ocean that encompasses all the creeks that come into it. And I think these are very significant similes and it turns out coincidentally that this week seems to be the simile week around IMC. Because the people doing the Monday program we did was all about similes and this week 7am is similes. And here we come again, this emphasis on simile. And the interpretation I've been offering is that the similes actually are not kind of an adjunct to the instructions. They're actually part of the instructions. They're actually very, very clear and maybe precise descriptions of some of the things that happen as we practice that sometimes lacking in the prose sections, the sections that get more giving instructions or technical descriptions of things. And similes touch on a wide variety of our inner responsivity. When there's some people visualize and by when we have a visual of something we can understand it better. Some people understand them, send things more kinesthetically by movement and so when there's activity that involves movement that similes, it comes alive for some people. Some people understand better with the felt sense in the body. So if there are similes that somehow evoke comparison to how it can feel like in the body, it comes alive for people. So it's also easier to remember somehow, because you remember them semantically, you remember it with different capacities, not just memorizing words. And as I'm fond to say is that this text, these texts were originally oral text that people chanted, and they'd often chant it repeatedly to themselves because there were no libraries if you want to study a text you chanted it. If to yourself, but I think they're often communal research recitations, the monastics would get together, and they would recite it. And there's something different happens in the mind that just reading something when you're reciting because I think it's the, and then when you're saying the words and the similes, I think it penetrates deep into the body into the psyche in ways that I think for most of us just reading something doesn't do kind of opens things up or gives a deeper home inside for what we're reading the reference point. And I think in this text is its emphasis on on how valuable mindfulness of the body is. This is implicit in the Satipatthana Suta that any of the four foundations can lead to awakening. But here we find a very definitive statement that yes, it can the mindfulness of the bodies is enough. So these are all kinds of interesting aspects of it. What I'd like to emphasize today that, or suggest today that just to make it rather than interpreting what the ancients were doing. I'd like to say that for me, what struck me this year, looking at this text is a similes. And I like to think of maybe the similes maybe are the most important part. I think not a few people if they see that the opening of this text the same as Satipatthana Suta, they kind of gloss over the kind of kind of maybe even don't even notice that the refrain is different between the two texts. And certainly that was my case for many years. And, but the, but the refrain the similes, I think are very significant. And how we interpret the similes is also part of the art. And for the study guide I interpret them in particular ways. And I'm very conscious that that's interpretation. I hope it's a fair interpretation of them. There's a I don't know of any classic traditional commentary that explains what these are similes for except for the four Jhanas it's clear but the rest of them. So I offered this based on my reading the suit does how to understand them. I offered you some, some interpretations. So what I'd like to do today is something a little bit different than we have been is I'd like us to do a meditation, kind of a guided meditation, using the similes. And I hope this works for you if I kind of evoke in some ways, trying to just be each of these similes and maybe there's some way that you can take them in, be willing to receive them as I describe them. Imagine them. Feel them. You know, enter them. Give, give yourself the benefit without that you can do this. Put aside your hesitation or resistance to doing this kind of guided meditation, which if you have that kind of resistance. I think that's certainly sympathize because I think probably for decades I would have done the same. So I understand that that's easy to have. And also, if some of you feel like you don't have a very good ability to visualize, and so it seems like it's hard and you have to work at it you don't know quite how to do it. But it turns out that it's good enough. If you imagine you're visualizing. If you imagine you're imagining. And that when I learned this trick, then visualization meditations and imagine it using imagination, started to work much better for me. Because I was using maybe a more active part of the brain to try to visualize. And when I imagined I was imagining, I kind of dropped into some deeper quieter place that I didn't have to do it right it didn't have to actually look like anything. But when I was imagining I was imagining there was this kind of like free pass to just let it be whatever it was and it was turned out to be much more engaging. So, I'm going to pause quietly for a few minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So the similes begin with awareness likened to drops of water. Slightly non traditional interpretation. But for now, and these drops of water. We sprinkle into our body. We take our awareness and we begin letting it drop into different parts of our body for maybe letting the attention around on its own, finding its own way here and there in the body. Touching in as if each little contact with the body is like a gentle not just drops but maybe like a gentle shower of attention. That's wetting that part of your body with awareness. Maybe the shower is a little bit more strong on the exhale. Showering awareness into a part of your body. Letting the awareness move around to different parts of your body. Or the pulse of the rain shower. Maybe the strength of the shower is enough that it's a little bit like a massage. Letting the body relax a bit as the awareness fills particular areas. And then imagine that as you do this, the body fills with water that the body itself becomes full like a full lake. Maybe from the floor of the lake. You can feel the vitality in your body of being alive. People would maybe call it the energy flowing in their body. It might be feeling the various sensations that are taken in by awareness. Staying humming, vibrating, sensations of all kinds. Just flowing within the lake like a current. The current of sensations that is deeper than any one sensation. Opening up the awareness to have a global awareness of the whole body. As if it's a large lake of water. And as you open up and hold the water, it starts becoming quieter, it's stiller. The surface of the lake, blessed. Where the broad expanse of this lake is vast enough to hold everything inside of it. Floating quietly, peacefully. Imagining that this lake of still water is cleansing everything within you. Refreshing water, still and quiet, healing and cleansing. And then you step out of the lake, clean, refreshed in your body, and sit on the side of the lake with a wrapped in a clean cotton blanket covering all of you. Remember a feeling of being cleansed, bright, clear. It radiates from your body. And imagine that you are quite confident that this state of meditation provides you with grounded confidence. That you don't have to react to anything or be pushed over or around by anything or anyone. That you are resilient. That you are not open to allow things to impact you from outside. And in certain ways, some part of you, feels like you are a strong, heavy wooden door. And whatever is thrown against the door, thrown against you, it just bounces off harmlessly without harming you. You are strong and large and heavy and unaffected by what's thrown at you from outside. And within you, you have your soft and moist, also with confidence, relaxation, joy and well-being, contentment. So when there comes the sparks of greed or hatred or envy, annoyance, it has nowhere to land. There's no kindling for it to light. Because within you feel so contented and happy. The greed and the hatred, the little sparks burn out easily, having nothing to burn new. And this sense of being moist and content and happy, feel from the inside, is so full that any unwholesome thoughts or influences your mind might have. There's no space for them to flow into. Your contentment is so large that discontent runs off and falls away. But with all this contentment and joy and well-being that you have, it's held within the body that is partly constructed with all kinds of ideas of self, all kinds of ways in which we prove ourselves or show ourselves or make ourselves through the body. The body can be held in check by our ideas of me, myself and mine, the constructed self. But if we're willing to lower this constructed self, tip the container over on its side, we see that whatever me, myself and mine were caught in spills away, whatever's extra. The freedom of letting things flow away free of ourselves. And even better, the roughest, coarsest ideas of self, protection built like a fort, embankment, a dyke of mud holds a reservoir of water, not finely made like a jug or clay. The water too can be shattered and the water set free. The release of both what is wholesome and unwholesome. The release of even of well-being, letting it go with a greater well-being of freedom from all things. And in this way, the practice that you've done, imagine that it leads you to a place, maybe something you can recognize deep inside, where you're no longer have any discontent, no longer under the influence of discontent, no longer under the influence of pleasure. Imagine that this kind of way of practicing frees you from fear and dread. That somehow you're now independent from discomforts of the body, from cold and heat, hunger and thirst. They happen, but they don't have any influence on your well-being. You're not dependent by discontent and fear and physical discomfort. You are free and this body of yours becomes more like a chariot that you're riding. And you're free to move about this way and that way. No longer have any conversations anymore, just freedom, like a chariot rolling this way and that as it wishes. And then to end this sitting, to take some long, slow, deep breaths. When you're ready, you can open your eyes. So that was my attempt to give you kind of an impressionistic interpretation for bringing those similes a little bit of life for you. I wasn't trying to do an accurate representation of what they represented in the text. You can read the text and get some of that there in the study guide. But rather to see if maybe there could be a kind of a greater appreciation of what similes can do for us. And what we have here is interesting, I think, is that similes not only stand for themselves as things we imagined, but they also map out a sequence of practice. A practice that goes through the four jhanas, deep absorptions, which we'll study at the next series for this Majjhima course. And they also map a movement inward from external influences to what happens inside, the benefits we get of not being caught up. And a process of, you know, kind of describes that all this leads to certain kind of liberation, first stream entry and then full liberation. That involves the tipping over or spilling out of something that has been trapped or held in or caught by something that we've got that's been constructed by humans. A water jug or a built up embankment for a reservoir. So the similes, you know, also are providing a path, the directionality. And I can imagine that the ancient audience for this or the jhanthas of it could have had some sense of that movement of practice. That practice is not a static thing, but for these ancients, this dharma practice involved a movement along a path of growth and development, of unfolding, of becoming more subtle, something like that. So these similes are very personal. They bring things to light for us. They can touch us in very personal ways, in ways that maybe open something that helps to open as we go along this path. So I just wanted to use this occasion to emphasize the importance of this. And then to let you discuss it now among yourselves a little bit. And what I have in mind is a breakout group of four people or so, depending on their numbers here. And it'll be about 13 minutes that you'll have. And a lot of these metaphors had to do with water. Sometimes the similes, the water represents something really good. And sometimes it seems to represent something maybe not so good. Like we know with the breaking open the, you know, the reservoir so the water spills out, maybe. But what do you think about how often water is used as a metaphor? And why is water used so much? What's the value of water as a metaphor, as a simile? For Dharma practice? That's the question. And why don't you explore that? And as I always repeat, I think, H in your group, don't make more than one point at a time. Let it be kind of like really a chance for everyone to speak. And don't tell a long story to explain yourself what you have in mind. And think of it as a listening exercise and just kind of share the space and go around and around in these minutes, talking about what is the value of using water as a simile for Dharma practice. Is that okay? Is that understandable? Great. So when you're ready, Carrie? Sure. We'll pause the recording and then I'll do the class. Oops. Thank you for turning it on again. Okay. So I hope that this was a different way of doing the class to do the meditation like this, but I hope that it maybe made an impression, nice impression of the sutta for you that we read this time to look at it a different way. And any comments about your breakout discussion about water? Any insights anybody had that they'd like to share? Oh, yes, Catherine. I can't see the hands of everyone if you raise your physical hands. Oh, I'll put up my hand then, I guess, when I got you now but you were on the screen one for me so I can see you but people on two and three I won't see their hand going up there. So go ahead. Yeah, we had a very rich group with many meanings of water coming coming forward, and we sort of played on each other's presentations. And the one I ended with that I guess they wanted to share was water as unity and water is essence. And I was sharing this picture to change the setting to do this. From awakening to the nine bodies of water as solar spirit that becomes incarnated, and then returns to the source so it's the cycle of life and water is in some sense our essence. Nice. Very nice. Thank you. Nancy. Thank you. It's wonderful so many things came up in our group and it seems that we could just talk about water in connection with meditation forever. And then it just occurred to me that nobody does it better for me than I john cha. When he says, you know that wonderful quote, which I'm going to mangle and I'm sure other people can remember it better than I about a still forest pool and when the mind becomes like a still forest pool, all kinds of strange and wonderful creatures will come and drink from it. Yeah, maybe we all be such pools for to support all the creatures that come visiting us. Thank you. So, well, that was nice thing those two comments, the. So my impression of this suit, my esteem of it my appreciation of has got up over the years. I want to get a sense of the, the craftsmanship or the craft the craft crafting of this kind of text and the use of illustrations of ocud of similes, the placing of the refrain between the exercises that that is, you know, the location of this, the part of the text which describes the benefits. Oh, maybe it's an economical text in some ways that really all everything's important everything works together in a crafted organized maybe beautiful way. But to get sense of this, the beauty of this text, you have to somehow not just read it. You have to somehow inhabited or let it inhabit you with the imagination. And it's my suggestion that whoever edited put together this text was doing it intentionally to evoke the imagination of the audience. And so to, to read it with its original intent is to allow yourself to be carried by the imagery and the sense of it. And maybe it evokes something important about the Dharma path that we're on and how Dharma what Dharma practice touches inside of us. It's a deep place. What's touched. So those are my thoughts. And then this is the last class for this year, only because No, not enough. Someone saying no. Catherine saying no. I thought there was one more scheduled next week. Yes. According to the list. Yes. Yes, it was scheduled on the list. But I think Diana taught last week was supposed to tell you that we're not meeting again. And we were supposed to do two weeks on this on the on the panisati Suta. And we did one week. And then we did as a minute and then we were ahead of it with this one. And, and technically I could come next week and Diana but I think we're both a little bit over done with, you know, with teaching and teaching and kind of on the road teaching for about the next four weeks. So even though I could come at just too much. So that's that's partly it. So I apologize for leaving you in the lurch. Suta Lurch. And and then we don't really have time to really because I'm gone so much. Diana has gone quite a bit teaching as well that in the holidays come in and then there's teaching I have right after the holidays. So I think that the next time we meet this January 15. So it's about two months. And, and it'll be a fun topic so you know, do come back it'll be controversial. It'll be, you know, it will talk about concentration. We'll talk about John us, which those of us who are supposed to be with pastna teachers don't teach right, we're not we're not the ones who do that. So that makes it controversial that we're going to address it and look at it and consider what this is about. I love concentration I love the practice of it the experience of it, the teachings on it so it's a nice, nice thing and some of it will be review, because we know we just looked at that a little bit here, but we'll look at it a little bit more depth for a while. And then we'll get to the wisdom section of this module, the insights the wisdom that comes from the deepening of practice. And I think that the last module last will be the attainments. And we'll look at the various attainments so. So, January for lucky January 3 March April maybe we'll finish in April. We'll see. And so thank you all. So we can stop and those of you who are leading. Thank you very much for being here today and. And those of you who would like to stay well I'll just be open here for the next half an hour for any questions you want to have about this. So I've already. Yep, please. Hi, I'm just wondering if there, whether there are other sutas similar to this mindfulness of body sutas that are focused on each of the other foundations of mindfulness like mindfulness of building mindfulness of mind, not in this kind of clear way. Some of the exercises I see they set the set a baton a suit, the discourse on the four foundations mindfulness. It was probably an anthology it was an algorithm which they took two quotes from elsewhere and put them all together to construct it. So you can find the other exercises elsewhere, standing on their own, but not with this kind of clarity and focus of being its own suit on this topic. And, but what you. So if you're interested in, you know, reading more about the satipatana exercises in the connected discourses of the Buddha. There's a whole chapter on satipatana. And, and that's one of the places you would go to touch into some more of the teachings about satipatana. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And there are there are texts there are sutas where the punchline that climax or the kind of core where it all comes down to in the end is bed and the second foundation. But, so it's, it has a central role and some suitors, but not in a way that feels like it's a, you know, connected to the sattipatana suta. Maria. I wanted to share a simile that I've been using lately that was inspired that was inspired by your guided meditations on at 7am that you've been doing lately. And the simile or the idea that I've been using is jumping into a lake or jumping into the ocean and settling down down down down down down. And when I notice I'm not focused, I jump back in again and float down down down down down, and just rest peacefully there. So I don't know if you ever maybe you said that during one of our guided meditations jumping into the water but that's been coming up. With me, like the past few weeks. Nice, nice. I don't know if I said that but that's very nice. And not a few meditators. And I've had, I've had this where the experience of going into deeper concentration actually feels like you're going underwater. And that as you're coming up out of the concentrated states it feels like you're, you're actually coming up out of the water, like your head comes out. And I used to do that intentionally for some period of time, where I get very concentrated, I'd be meditating for a long period of time. And, and I wanted to kind of make sure kind of kind of kind of get my bearings make sure how that I was practicing in a good way that hadn't built up any tensions or. So, I would let I pulled myself out. Just to my head comes out of the water. Take a look around check in to see what was going on, because in a deep concentration I wouldn't feel my body. So just checking with my body how am I doing, and everything was everything was fine. And then I would just let myself think again. These are metaphors but what was interesting for me is that these met that that metaphor was very personal just came to me, and I did it very other people had similar but it just came to me on my own. And so some of it sometimes our body or mind operates in metaphors on its own without us even wanting it or planning it. And, and it was very evocative to have that metaphor of bring my head up out of the water and then going back in there was a line that I crossed, where I got more activated in my thoughts and all that and then I dropped down into the quiet place again. Thank you. So, integrating presence. This is Josh. If I'm reading this right, or if I remembering right I mean, there was a metaphor of a crow in here right like the water pail was filled full so that crows can come drink it and is that right. Yes, and I don't know can't bro crows drink water when it's a little bit off the brim. Well, as long as I can get to it but the what it struck me is if all the different things that could come up to that could drink from the water, a crow and I just assuming that there's no definitive answer why a crow was used but maybe there is a welcome speculation for that metaphor it was just it kind of flabbergasted me or just it struck me in a way and I don't know exactly why. Yeah, yeah, so I would love to have some ideas of that that I know what crow means or why I mean, I kind of assumed it was just kind of kind of a, you know, maybe because of the narrow beak it could just just it could it could drink a little bit from the top without disturbing it and spilling any and, you know, I can't get down too far because it'll fall in or I don't know it but I'm fascinated to but I don't have an answer. Yes, where I would begin if I wanted to try to understand it is I would go search for all the occurrences of crows in all the suit us and see if it's used as a metaphor anywhere else. Very good all the scholars here with their cross reference tools, it sounds like a task. Yes. Great. Thank you. Nancy. Thank you. My background with crows. I don't know this from reading other parts of the suit is but are often a symbol of death. And a group of crows is called the murder of crows and so they, they symbolize frequently. I have no idea how this fits into the discussion. I did want to mention those and aside there's a couple of people that are in our group here that also took Bob stalls class on the 32 parts of the body, which was profoundly moving and evocative, and when we talk about mindfulness of the body now. I think about it in a very different way. And it was so moving. And I would encourage anybody that gets a chance to take that class to take it. Nice, very nice. And I think one of the things that you're based on that that was just one exercise. If someone spends a lot of time with, you know, with all six of these exercises that the body, you know, it really would change your relationship your body dramatically. And one of the things I believe it does when you're really well embodied. It's a lot easier to go into concentration. It's a vehicle for it. Thank you. So, Susan. So I might, you might have already said this, or I might have interpreted this incorrectly I was checking this out so in the suit, there's the, the, there's the jug and it's filled with the water. It's so helpful that therefore Mara, there's no, you know, Mara can't enter. And then you progress, and it becomes about the jug breaking really, and the walls of holding the water breaking, and I just thought, maybe that's not a simile, but in one weird embedded way, it could be, you know, that you start off here, you know, and you're, you're this jug and you've got the water and, you know, but then down here, actually the water is broken. Maybe you talked about this but for some reason it seemed pretty profound the way it moved. Yeah, I think so. And, you know, these are, you know, a jug a clay jug is something's been made. And so, you, you make something you use in order to use it well. And, and then when you no longer need need it you have to discard it. And so, there are people you know meditation is a kind of a constructive things when these genres are constructed you're kind of, it feels like mostly we're letting go to go into them but they're there they belong to the constructed world. They're developing the mind the wholesome qualities of the mind we're kind of creating the best possible conditions for the heart and mind when we, when this Dharma practice, but we don't stop with good conditions, the ideas, everything has to go at some point. And so the whatever you're building and making has to be at some point destroyed. And, and then the water is set free. And what if the water is symbolizes awareness which I like to think of it, then it's awareness set free. If the water is something poison, then you know it's, you're free to the poison or something so exactly what it means I don't know. But I think what you're pointing to is very, very fascinating and worth reflecting on. I did want to ask you another quick question the concept. I was thinking about this too when you were saying this idea of concepts, especially in the 7am set. And I thought, how different life would be in terms of concept when there's no written word. Tell me a little bit more. I don't know it just came to me it's like if you know if our lives are our lives are surrounded by letters and words, and if it's not there. It just seemed to me that could truly open up a different way of relating to the world. As it's been explained. Yeah, and one way in many ways is probably not what you mean but what comes to mind these suit does is that without the written word. People were focused on listening in a very different way, listening to memorize. And it's pretty, I'm pretty confident that say that the ancients had a much better capacity for memorization as we do, because that was built into the whole structure growing up that they, my son went to a school when I went to school with a lot of memorization chanting songs and poetry in unison in class, and he has a phenomenal memory. And to what degree that was an eight and to what degree it was trained by his by his school I don't know. Thank you. Wendy. So, it struck me that in the suit up, it, you know, talks about all the different ways to meditate on the body to be mindful of the body, and then it talks about the benefits. One thing that I was wondering about is why all these different types of mindfulness, you know, do they serve different purposes, all these six ways of, of being mindful. Yeah, that's a good question. One, one possibility is for different people different practices are useful. People specialize in things different for different issues. These different areas of mindfulness are useful. Some people say that meditation on the corpse is good for people who are obsessing too much or maybe any obsession with sex. You know, maybe that overcomes that. And so there's different issues that maybe people are over it, overly identified with their body as the self. The four elements is a breaks open that. So it could be that it's been each one of them is medicine for different things. Some of them like the second and third one, you know your posture and your activities are just good all around for everyone. And everyone should learn that as part of practice. So, you know, I think that I know some people some teachers who would like to teach concentration, you know, develop a strong concentration will teach the 32 parts of the body, because that's concentrating. And teachers who want to emphasize the persona will often teach the four elements more than the 32 parts. And I think it's a it's a it's a it's a palette. And, you know, and you choose the different colors at different times as you as you do painting your practice doing your practice. So that's my best best answer for the moment is how's that sound do you have more, would you have any anything that you would add. Yeah, I felt like just from my experience the four elements, you know, seems to kind of bring me in connection with the natural world like that connectedness. And then the one about the body decomposing that one kind of just reminds me or impermanence. And so they do seem to serve different purpose but for me. But when you say make a lot of sense like maybe there's some with that I'm just practically thinking I picked the ones that resonate and like feel like it fits what I need. It's beautiful. Thank you, Wendy. Catherine. I have to say I, I remain, or have I'm unconvinced that just practicing mindfulness of the body is going to bring enlightenment or liberation or freedom or cessation. And I'm looking at the text, and both of the texts when 119 and what the previous one 118 do seem to be as you say crafted or composed text sometime after the time of the Buddha out of elements of the Buddhist teachings. We didn't say that part, but I mean you said the crafted part. But it just doesn't make sense to me that that simply mindfulness of the body is going to get you there. This, which is I guess also to say just concentration is going to get you there. It's like you you've developed a great sports car but you need someplace to go with it. So, I think, I think any comments on on that about. I think my response is yes and no to what you're saying. I think you're right that mindfulness of the body by itself might not get you there. And maybe your metaphor of, you know, need to have someplace to go is important here. The, in this, in this text here 119 the practice of mindfulness the body gets you concentrated. And that's what that's what the frame emphasizes you practicing practicing it up until a point you really concentrated. And it's that concentrated mind that's needed in order to have deep insight. It's always the insight which is liberating and the satipatanasuta. We're practicing there, up to the point that we have strong concentration, so that refrain gives us that insight or points to that insight. So in that sense, my first the body, you don't have to do a different practice and my personal body to be enlightened. But what you have to do is you have to get you have to get to the place where, where you're constantly. Oh, you're the only one who froze or did I freeze for everyone. You're not frozen for me go. Okay, I was frozen. Okay. So, so I want to summarize what I said quickly that the mind falls to the body is only liberating. If you get yourself concentrated enough to have the insights, but the insights are not practices, but they're the insights that result. So the, the. So the mindfulness of the body is enough. It can be your only practice you do, provided you get to that point of concentration with the insights occur. You build your fancy car, and it's fine but it doesn't really work until you get it out of your garage. But you also at the same time would somehow have the mental purification purification from the hindrances and basically embodying concentration, per se doesn't do that either. So this is what the refrain you know I apologize in my study guide. I didn't include the whole refrain. And the part that I didn't include where it says, so they go through the Italy's exercises. And at the end of each exercise, it says for the refrain part. It says, I'm going to speak about his translation here. Exactly. So this is. So, the, the thing of, of the household life abandoned is intentions and memories. It's similar to, you have to abandon the hindrances in order to get into John us. And so you have to abandon intentions based on the household life. You know, it seems like for some of us that seems disrespectful of household life. But I think for this ancient tradition, it was kind of inconceivable that someone back then could live a domestic married life with all the responsibility and all the pleasures of it, and not be. Caught up in greed hatred and delusion. And so you had to really kind of, and there those are called intentions based on the household life. So you had to be freed enough for those, which is a very very high level of practice you know as any of us know I think that it's not that easy to be free from these obsessions. Okay, a lot of other people have questions I just will demure once more that that in Jhana practice, as I was taught it, the, you're sort of paving over your karmic, you know, Sam scars to go to go into the jhanic state, but it's temporary you come back to yourself and that it may help with purification but you still need the insight to let go of. Right. Yeah. Right and the insights in order to shatter the embankments of the reservoir. Maybe they shatter. Yes. So, Robert. Thank you, you, my question was answered about the household life that was my big question I was waiting for but I had a second, which was, you said that the past teachers don't teach john is and that's why it's so controversial and I don't understand that, maybe, if you know this is an historical thing it's not so much true anymore. But starting at least in the fifth century. Buddhism started to posit a very radical distinction between insight practice and Jhana practice, and they were considered to be two separate paths, and that, and people would could choose one or the other. But if you did the concentration path all the way to deep you had to kind of that itself was a dead end. And then in the in the 20th century, with a number of teachers in Burma, they came up with a very radical idea that you didn't have to do any Jhana practice to become a stream enter you just have to do very strong insight practice directly. And this proved to be very popular and very effective to some degree, and it became the most popular form of meditation in Burma and from Burma spread out across the globe and helped create the IMS and IMC and all these places that were following in the wake of that. But the result of that was it was based on this idea of two separate practices. And so the Vipassana teachers would say oh we don't do Jhana actually sometimes we're discouraged from doing Jhana just go directly for the truth, this is the direct path, just do this. And, and there was kind of a war going on. And very the Vipassana teachers are very dismissive of Jhana's and, and they would tell oh that doesn't count that's not important and, and then there are people who are doing Jhana's like in the 1980s and 1990s there were people who were doing Jhana practice, and they were discounted by some of the Vipassana teachers and Vipassana practitioners or, you know, and I was a little bit responsible for this too in the 1990s. And, and, and then slowly, I would say, not until the 2000s, they start to be, but slowly there started to be an appreciation of Jhana's in the Insight movement. And it started first maybe in the 80s with a little stream. And that was a Upandita that Burmese teacher taught Sharon Salzburg and meta Jhana to do loving kindness practice up to the point of Jhana. And, and for in her case, Upandita would only teach it to people if they had become stream mentors. But Sharon, she supposedly then was a stream mentor, came back and started had this idea of offering Jhana practice to people who were not stream mentors. And then they started teaching people is meta Jhana, Jhana through meta. And that slowly grew and grew and, and the other teachers who were trained to do this as well. And, and so it started getting kind of a little bit taught kind of on the side and a little bit being taught and then there were people who had practiced with Ayakkama, learned Jhana's and they kind of were on the edges of the insight scene and dialogue. The big change I think was so and the Burmese teacher, Paul came on the scene. And, and he was really he was he represented this radical split between insight and and Jhana and, and that happened in the fifth century, and he really took the Jhana path. And so then the. And, and so slowly and then, and then a number of people and one of the first in the West to do this was the Nisraviku and who came pointed out, wait a minute, this split that happened in the fifth century was not there in the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha did not see a difference between Jhana practice and Satipatthana practice and mindfulness practice. They were integrated, they work together. And you see that in the descriptions of the third and fourth Jhana there's Sati mentioned there is mindfulness mentioned there. And so I'm I'm and so my interpretation now is that the level of concentration that was needed in Burma to do the insight practice there is actually very high. And so that up and eat maybe Masi side out talked about the passana Jhana. And but they would say, Oh, this is a light Jhana. And we don't do the strong Jhana of people that only do that. But I can my interpretation these days is that the passana Jhana where you're going through the same sequence as the four Jhana's and they really, really describe the states very well. But you're not in some kind of trance you're not kind of zoning out entirely. That that's this is probably what the Buddha was teaching closer to the Buddha. So it's called Suta Jhana versus Suddhi Maga Jhana. So there's all this stuff right. But in the in the that's a long story to tell you that there was a split. And starting in the 80s slowly, slowly, slowly, there's been a healing of that split. And how complete that healing is or when it's useful to keep them apart and not apart is part of the art of teaching and practicing that make that make some sense of it for you. Yeah, thank you. And I look forward to learning more. Thank you. Appreciate it. Lydia. So, on your study guide page four, under the Realizing Direct Knowledge, you mentioned about the second simile that probably referred to it fully removing off once asavav, which is the taint. And I just don't have a good understanding of the taint. And I trying to distinguish those from the hindrances. So, yeah. So one thing I want to use your question as a occasion to say, is that you find in the suttas that the meaning of similes changes from in different suttas. So the idea of the wet wood that you can't light here it means you're it's a happy story that you're wet and can't light up with the green-headed illusion. Elsewhere, the same simile is used, and what being waterlogged is being filled with green-headed illusion. And if you're filled with green-headed illusion, then the spark of practice won't take off. But if you are filled with wholesome, you know, feelings, then the spark of unwholesome won't won't take over. So you find the same simile used different ways. You have to be a little bit sensitive to the context and how in the suttas the context. And I think in this 119 that you have to what water means in the context of it changes in different similes. You have to kind of be fluid. So then it comes to the story of the asavas. The word asavas seems to be literally mean something like an outflow, something that flows out. It could also mean inflow, but the word itself is sometimes used for pus in a wound that's kind of flowing out. It's also used as an extract from an intoxicating plant in ancient India, is that extract is called asava. So it's something intoxicating, something that's a wound, a pus that's flowing out. So it has this idea of something. So it's possible that has idea of flowing out. And since when you break down a dam, the water flows out, I kind of thought it's a way of freeing yourself from the asavas. That's fine, because otherwise, you know, when you let the dam break open, yes, the water gets freed, but then it just gets absorbed into the dusty ground. You know, what good is that to anyone? I don't know. So I don't know what to do with always with these similes. And the asavas, the hindrances are more surface motivations we have that are rooted in deeper attachments. And asavas are sometimes used as to stand in or as a perspective to understand the deepest attachments we can have. Attachments to pleasure, sense pleasure, attachments to our stories, our opinions, our views, attachments to existing attachments to ignorance. How can you be attached to ignorance? That's what they say. So, so, this help you address your concerns, Lydia. Yeah, so it sounds like asavas is deeper. It's more root of the hindrances. Very helpful. Thank you. Yolanda. Yeah, I'm just wondering about the benefits of being mindful of the body. Yeah. Well, I would say, in my case, anyway, I don't understand why or how, like supernatural power, divine ear, divine eyes, you know, understanding the past lives. I mean, to me, that's those kind of things are not even benefits. They're like, kind of like, I don't know, like, like, you know, some Indonesians believe in that. I'm from Indonesia, right, as you know. But I don't. How could they be benefits? And how do I get those benefits without getting without having them? The. Remember, we just we had the six extra six mindfulness exercises. And then we have the four jhanas. Yeah, so the these benefits come when you do this practice up to the point of jhanas. And I think that almost any practice you do to the point of the fourth jhana, you'll get these benefits from it. And in the suttas elsewhere, when they describe how from the fourth jhana, some of these psychic powers come from that. So it's not so much it's coming from the mindfulness of the body, it's coming from this very strong concentration you have. And so in that strong concentration, there's an idea that there's certain kind of seeing of beings being born and dying. Exactly what this entails, whether it's you're really seeing that happening in the real world, or it's a little bit an act of imagination that somehow providing you with it, that view that that's what happens. It's hard to know. And whether these psychic powers, you know, like here, like, you know, the divine ear and supernormal powers, if you actually read what how they described, it's pretty far out, you know, flying through the air, going through all these things, touching the moon with your hand. You know, I don't know anybody's ever reached up and touched the moon. So is it meant to be taken literally, or all these things symbolic or representational something else. And when the Buddha or maybe they were people believed in it back then. But the Buddha was brilliant in assimilating other people's beliefs and redefining them for his own purposes. And so maybe, even though they look kind of far out psychic, walking through walls. Maybe it means something different in a symbolic way, which wasn't preserved in the text. But at some point in the ancient world, they understood this is just represent something, some symbolic dream like state or something. So that's my, you know, or maybe people really can that I mean, there are people who go into these deep, deep states of concentration and come back and report all kinds of marvelous things that happened to them. And are they to be taken literally or they kind of dream like experiences they're having that they feel so real. I had a wonderful experience of, you know, maybe a fantastic psychic power, kind of a being in two places at once, it was great. I was sitting, it was sitting in meditation happily meditating, and they rang the lunchbell. And so I stood up to go for lunch. And then when I was standing, I realized I was still sitting. The whole experience of standing was completely realistic, like completely 100% like this really happened. And I was just stunned, like I'm still sitting here. So I decided to stand up again because it was lunchtime. And then when I spent my time I was standing, I was, I'm still sitting here. What's going on, you know. So, was it my psychic body leaving my body to stand. And you know, there's two bodies, the one sitting and the one standing. Or was I in some kind of dream state, you know, that I was kind of sleeping maybe in meditation kind of half asleep and dreaming and. And so I just dreamt myself that I was standing but it was so realistic. So who knows what this is about. So I don't really know. But this is an example where for the most part, you say you don't want to believe in it. I kind of skip over it. That's what I've been doing, skip over it, but it keeps coming up, you know, in every suit then I was like, well, maybe somebody has experienced this, you know, maybe, maybe. And then there you do text critical studies of where it appears in the text and you compare it to the Chinese translations and the Chinese translations don't have them. These kinds of things, some of them are in the same place and you look at the text as a whole, it seems like they're always in these texts that seem like you can make an argument they're later texts and. And so you can do all these kind of argue, you know, but none of these arguments and evidence for it are reliable yet. Right. So there's no evidence. Maybe we some people would like to say, oh, this is later after the Buddha. That'll be convenient for the people don't believe in it. We don't have evidence yet. Yeah. Well, thank you, Gil. Oh, it's that's five o'clock. So, oh, so thank you. I think some hands went down. Sorry we missed you. So, thank you. And, and I'm going to miss doing this for a couple of months I enjoy this text a lot and this chance to share with you and interact with you around this. So at some point I guess probably in beginning of January you'll get the study guides for concentration. And then we'll continue. So, if you want to unmute and say goodbye that would be lovely. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, everybody. Thank you. Happy holidays everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Happy holiday. I had the old life during next week on my calendar too. So I'm glad Catherine brought this up, but I'm glad you and Diana are taking some time off if you need it. Yeah. So, so yes I carry maybe you can you send out the message every Wednesday right about through the zoom link and all that. Right, only when there's one of the few things on that so the IMC website under special and year long program still has November 10 and the Sati center still has November 10 as they show the
