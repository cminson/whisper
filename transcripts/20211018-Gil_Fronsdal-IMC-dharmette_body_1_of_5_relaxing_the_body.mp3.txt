 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So this day, this week, the focus is on that part of the mindfulness instruction that has to do with mindfulness of the body. Of course, the mindfulness of the body practice begins with mindfulness of breathing, the focus for last week. The breathing is a completely embodied part of our experience, and now it begins opening and helping open us to the rest of the body. The simplest instructions for mindfulness that we teach here at IMC is that when you use the breathing as the basis, as the home base for meditation, as a default, just if you're wondering where to have your attention, have your attention with your breathing. So just a default, just automatically think about it. But if something else becomes more compelling, there used to be the teaching when something else becomes predominant, then the idea is two things. You can either let go of the breathing entirely, focusing on it, and bring your full attention to this, if it's in this other thing that's predominant. So for now, it's going to be the body. So if something becomes more predominant in the body, then we practice mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of that place. If someone, the other option is to stay with the breathing, but in a sense, maybe through the imagination slightly, is to imagine you're breathing through or with the strong sensations in your body. Sooner and later, the body will speak up with strong sensations for beginners in meditation. Taking a meditation posture is quickly uncomfortable. And slowly over time, the body adjusts and stretches and opens and gets stronger, so that there's some ease in this yogic posture of meditation. And it's really well worth to work through that time. But you don't need to strain yourself meditating. You don't have to force yourself to stay with discomfort. If some discomfort becomes too strong, then change your posture. You don't have to, if it feels like you're getting stressed by the meditation itself, then don't stay with uncomfortable things. But there's also this turning towards what's there in the body. And today's kind of topic is relaxation, to relax the body in a deep way. So one early time where I started learning the value of relaxation was when I was a Zen student, and there were times that my knees hurt a lot from sitting. We sat and meditated a lot. In Zen, you weren't really supposed to move while you're meditating during meditation. So if you're uncomfortable, you have to kind of bear it. And so I noticed at some point that around the knee pain, there would be subtle micro-tensions in the muscles around it, like resistance of maybe kind of, it was an expression of resistance to the pain, and that contract around it. But that tightness actually made the pain worse. And if I relaxed those micro-tensions, the pain got better, got less. And it was just enough. There was a difference from being overwhelmed to managing fine with it. But I had to be very attentive, because if I didn't pay attention, then the reactivity I had would creep in kind of unknowingly, and the muscles would be tight again. And so I learned to kind of stay there and feel the sensations there, the tightness, and relax them, relax them. I learned also that I had sometimes subtle tension in my fingers, and they were ever so slightly pulled in. And it was an expression of some kind of feeling of like I had to work hard here, I had to engage now in doing this meditation thing. And I learned to recognize that subtle tension in the fingers, and relax it, and keep it relaxed. And that had a reciprocal relationship, or a relationship to that attitude, I had to work hard here. And as I relaxed the fingers, that attitude would soften. Unknowingly, the attitude would return, and the fingers would get tense again. And so I learned to do a regular part of the check-in as I meditated, was to make sure my fingers were relaxed. And it was something that was relatively easy to do for me. It was a micro relaxation, it wasn't a big deal, it was a micro attention. Same thing with the belly. In the early years of meditation practice, I had a lot of tension in my belly, and my belly was always tightened up and held in. And I didn't make it a big project, but probably two or three times in the course of meditation, beginning, and in the middle, and near the end, or something, I would relax the belly. And oftentimes in the beginning, it would just tighten right up again. And I didn't make much to do with it, I just kind of periodically relaxed. But over time, over the months of doing this, the belly learned what it was like to be relaxed. And as the belly became more familiar with it, and more at home in it, I could feel, you know, it became more of a regular place, easier to be there and relax belly. But also, the anxiety that seemed to be the genesis of that stomach tension began to loosen, began to recognize it. I hadn't recognized it until I started kind of hanging out with the belly and feeling the tension there. So as you do mindfulness of the body, it's helpful to keep an eye out for where the tension is, where the holding patterns are, the tightness. And not to make it a big project, or be very ambitious about the relaxation, but it is helpful to relax. So as many of you know, I teach here in these 7 a.m. meditations to relax at the beginning, always to relax at the beginning. But as the meditation goes along, it's useful to kind of check in, is there some tension there? Any tension crept in. In some of my longest retreats that I sat, where I sat in very deep states of meditation, I developed a practice of, I would sit for sometimes for a few hours at a time, and I would pull myself out of the meditation, you know, with my mind, I would still look like I was meditating, but I would kind of pull out of the concentrated state and look around for a few seconds to see if any tension crept in. And if there was, then I would relax that tension. And often the relaxation had to do with something in the upper head that was connected to trying a little bit too hard to be focused, a little bit too hard to concentrate, and it would be a little contraction there. So I would relax, and with the relaxation, the consciousness softened. And then I would dip back into the deep place of meditation. I found it so useful to always kind of come out and check. And some people, as they get concentrated, get tension in their face, and come out of the concentrated state, relax the tension, and then see if you can get concentrated without that tension building up. Some people find that in meditation, even if they don't try to do a lot of relaxation actively, that just meditation is relaxing. The genesis of a lot of tension has to do with the tense way we think and the tense things we think about. And as in meditation, that thinking quiets down, that source of tension begins to lessen and become weaker and weaker. And so some people find just simply staying with the breath, focusing on the breath, letting their attention kind of ride the breath, be with the breath. Then there's not so much attention available to all these thinking that are stress producing. And so just that, then people find themselves relaxing, sometimes progressively, and sometimes they realize after the fact, boy, am I relaxed without trying. So it's important also not to try too much to relax. There are times when I try to relax my body, and I made it a project, and I couldn't quite do it. I could do it a little bit, then I'd try some more, do it a little bit, then it just kept me busy in meditation. And then I wouldn't try to relax. And I would just stay focused and be with my breathing and get constantly breathing, and lo and behold, that part of my body relaxed. So we don't always want to do kind of frontal assault on our attention. Sometimes we have to just accept it and allow it to be there, and just do the practice and trust that it'll relax on its own. And then finally, an interesting thing to do with the relaxation of the body, if you feel there's tension somewhere in the body that doesn't want to relax, don't worry about it. But sometimes it's very interesting to relax around it, relax the attitude towards it, relax the outer layer of reactivity, perhaps around it, like my knee pain, I tighten up around it. So if the shoulders are very tense or the belly is tense and it can't relax, don't worry about it. But maybe it's possible to relax something a little bit wider circle in the body. Just around it there might be a softening that can happen. So today's theme is relaxation. And relaxation is just, I think of it as kind of like the entry level variation, entry level kind of taste of the deep letting go that in Buddhism is called liberation. And it partakes, relaxation shares some of the goodness and some of the qualities of deep, deep relaxation, freedom, liberation that comes. And so we're kind of getting a hang of it and feel for it. The body gets a sense and it helps prepare the ground for deeper and deeper letting go and relaxation as meditation proceeds. So thank you for today. And you might spend the next 24 hours familiarizing yourself with the tensions in your body, the times and places and ways in which you tighten up. And it might be just fascinating to see how much it goes on. And then, but also are there simple ways you can relax that? What happens if you stay and don't allow, relax or don't allow the tensions to build? How does that affect your day? So thank you very much.
