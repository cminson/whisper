I think that sooner or later , anybody who meditates 
becomes aware of a wandering mind. Usually it is really 
soon  [laughter] . The mind wande rs off into thoughts , 
and is un able to stay in the present moment in a strong 
way. Sometimes, in noticing that, it is interesting to ask 
yourself t hree vipassanā questions that can really help.  
 
The first question: In order to be present, in order to 
really be here, what has to be acknowledged?  
Generally, when we ask that question, there is 
something in the present moment that is being 
overlooked , or is not being included.  
 
The second question: In order to be present, what 
needs to be accepted? Sometimes people are fighting 
what is happening in the present moment , or the y are 
denying,  or are un willing to look at something. What 
needs to  be accepted? Maybe it is the wa ndering mind 
itself. I don’t mean accepted in the sense of “Go ahead 
and do whatever you want, ” but accepted in a way that 
you are not in conflict with it , and you’re also holding it 
with attention in a caring way .  
 The thi rd question: In order to be present, what needs to 
be let go of?  That is sometimes the most interesting 
question , because you might have an answer, but 
having an answer doesn’t help. Then it becomes a 
process of reflection, looking more deeply into what yo u 
believe is important , and why it is important for you. 
What is going on for you that you can’t let go? If you do 
that in present moment time, by really staying present 
with that question, not analyzing it in some historical 
way, then you will find y ourse lf in the present moment , 
rather than spinning out with the wandering mind.  
 
What needs to be acknowledged ; what needs to be 
accepted;  what needs to be let go of ? – the three 
vipassanā questions. Maybe at the right time you can 
ask them.  
 
Thank you.
