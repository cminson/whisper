So hello everyone, and here we are at the third talk in this five-part series on meaning. 
And that the meanings we have for ourselves, meanings we have for life, can come to bear on our meditation. 
There's a connection with it, and sometimes that sense of meaning we have animates and activates our meditation, like search for meaning, staying close to it. 
Sometimes it agitates it, sometimes it gets caught up in these topics of meaning. 
Meaning, the important meanings we have can influence how we meditate and why we meditate. 
And so to begin looking at the meaning-making aspects of the mind and meaning-making aspects of how we live our lives is important all around, but it's also important to really kind of clarify what we're doing in meditation, what meditation is about for us, both so that we can maybe have a little bit more wholehearted engagement. 
We know why we're doing something, but also so that sometimes the meanings we assign to meditation or connect to it are not helpful. 
They actually get in the way of the depth and full potential of meditation. 
So there's this idea of meaning sometimes connected to the big questions of life that people are sometimes very strongly motivated to find or to live by or to establish for themselves. 
So something as big as what's the meaning of life or what's the meaning of my life that I want to have? There's these big questions about death, what happens when we die, what happens to us after we die. 
And so people are trying to understand that and that affects the relationship to meditation. 
Meditation for some people is a strategy in order to deal with death. 
For some people it's understood that mindfulness meditation is one of the best preparations for dying and so wanting to die well or die freely and not die with difficulty. 
But some people it's meditation is not about dying well but about being reborn well or not being reborn in the future. 
And there's a strong momentum or approach in Buddhism about practicing in order to become free of rebirth. 
So some people that's really important for what they do and that kind of informs and animates their whole dedication to meditation. 
Some people mistrust meaning making and don't see a need for it. 
And for them meditation is not about the big questions of life but have to do with the simplicity of the moment. 
Just living this moment in a nice way. 
But that also is connected to meaning. 
Somehow the idea that just living fully for this moment in a simple, clear, free way, that that's meaningful, that's important, that's a valuable way of living this precious life that we have. 
And so this idea of what interpretation, what understand we have about what this life is about. 
So these are things to reflect on and partly reflect on what's most important for us. 
And the value of really spending time with that and looking at it. 
Then we can ask the question, how does my meditation support what's most important for me? And it's possible that if meditation doesn't support what's most important, maybe you shouldn't meditate. 
Maybe there's better things to do. 
Maybe to do things that actually support what's most important. 
But if meditation in fact does support what's most important, then maybe then there's a more easier to do it or more motivated to do it. 
And we see the connection and it really encourages us to be more fully involved with it all. 
Also to realize that maybe consciously or unconsciously that we have these large existential questions or large existential answers some of us live by, engagements as part of all this, then it's possible to investigate more deeply. 
Kind of to turn the attention around 180 degrees to really look deeply inside. 
Where are these existential beliefs? Where are these ideas? What is fueling them? What do they arise out of? What's the source of them inside of ourselves? And rather than accepting as a given, not questioning the philosophy or the beliefs that are there necessarily, but rather questioning maybe or looking deeply, what is motivating that? What animates them? What is their fuel for thinking this way or being this way? And what I mean for this, I'll give you some examples, that some people will ask, what's the meaning of life? Some big question like that. 
And I might ask, what's the emotion that is fueling that question? And some people will say, it's fear, fear of missing out, fear of not doing it right, fear of failing this life, or fear of not really understanding what's the purpose of my life. 
And if fear is motivating it, then the practice of mindfulness is to turn the attention around to really attend to the fear before we attend to the big questions, and really go deeply into it and be present until that fear dissolves. 
And when the fear dissolves, then what has happened to those questions? If those questions are big questions or the big kind of meanings of life are not fueled by fear, what fuels them? Or if they're not fueled, what happens to them? Does our relationship to them change? The beliefs might still be there, but if they don't have the strength that comes with the power that comes from the fear, what happens to it then? The same thing with death. 
Concerns with death might have to do with fear and to look at the fear deeply. 
Sometimes what fuels these things is conceit. 
Somehow it's about me and myself, and I have to prove myself, I have to do what's right, I have to account for myself, I have to show that I'm a good person, I have to prove something. 
And so these big existential questions are very tightly connected to ideas of identity, of conceit, of attachments to self. 
Right now I'm using all of these in the context of how they involve attachment. 
And so we investigate that, we bring our attention to that. 
And so this idea of turning around 180 degrees and really looking deeper and deeper rather than letting the big questions of life, the big existential conclusions and ideas of life hover there in our life as if they're like a fixed thing to stay with and live by. 
Mindfulness meditation involves looking deeper and deeper. 
What animates it? Where does a source inside where these kinds of beliefs, understandings come from? What fuels them? And so it's a paradigm shift in a sense from being concerned with something that we can be aware of, we can think about, we can believe about, to something that's deeper than what we think about or what we believe about or that kind of focus and we're turning around. 
And what is it like to be believing? What is it like to be searching? What's it like to be holding on to these ideas that has to be this way? Or this, you know, if I don't kind of believe this or hold on to this kind of thing, everything will fall apart and these beliefs keep me safe, maybe. 
So these big existential questions in this mindfulness tradition are important to see. 
The big existential conclusions we've come to, they're important to see. 
And then, but then look more deeply, what's going on under the surface? What is the source from them inside? What is the feelings, the emotions, the fears, the conceits, the, you know, what's the complex that's all about? And how this all connects to meditation is that it turns out that these existential questions, these big answers we have to the big questions of life, more often than not, will interfere with the full potential of meditation being a full releasing of all attachment. 
And when all our attachments have been released, what happens to our relationship to these big existential questions? Big existential big, you know, answers that we might be trying to live by or living by. 
They don't necessarily go away and the answer still might be relevant for us, but it's a kind of a whole different world to live in with them if that we've been able to take meditation all the way to its potential to a full release. 
So what is your relationship to the big questions of life, to questions of meaning, questions about life and death and what is it, questions of what's most ultimate, questions of God and heaven and rebirth and purpose and do you have something that you believe is ultimate? Or are you searching for that? And to respect that you, whatever it is you're doing like this, respect it deeply but then turn the attention around and look more deeply at what's underneath that, what's fueling it, what's animating those beliefs, so that involvement and see what you see there and find and see if that might help you to become quieter, stiller, more at ease, more centered here and now in that place where there can be no attachments. 
So thank you very much and continue this idea of meaning tomorrow.
