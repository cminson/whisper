 So this is how I often practice myself and with others. To be realistic, it does take a lot of effort. You do have to sit every day. Your meditation practice has to be not something that you do once in a while. It has to be basically the basis of everything in your life, which means you probably sit every day regularly. You go to retreats regularly. I hasten to say in the example that I've given that even after I solve the koan of my feelings in relation to my wife, that doesn't mean that I now necessarily mean it. It might actually completely change my relationship to my wife, but maybe not. So maybe I still go to the counselor. So I've seen it happen both ways. It's rather astonishing. Sometimes the whole problem that seems like working this through is like all these things involved and very complicated. It just goes away. Gone, as a result of this practice. Sometimes not. The result is, aha, now I get it. We still have to work through all those. But now we can do it. Couples counseling, of course, doesn't always work. People go to couples counseling for a long time, or whatever kind of counseling it is, and come out the other end without any improvement whatsoever. Because somehow there has to be an inspiration. So this is what the koan does. It gives us a real inspiration and understanding, which either clears up the problem or gives us the strength and the commitment and the ability to work on the problem on a more relative level. So I conclude then, these remarks about a koan study, with this possibility, a way of understanding koan practice. About I think, losing any of the depth that the koan practice offers, but at the same time applying it to our daily living in a more direct way, as genjokoan. And that's my, in my practice, that's my favorite method. I do sometimes turn my attention to koan and talk about koans, as I will this afternoon with you. I do sometimes for students who are interested assign koan. But I think the genjokoan is the most important practice for those of us living in the world and facing the ordinary everyday difficulties of human relationships and fast paced world, which is slightly crazy, or more than slightly. So that's what I wanted to say about, in general, about koan. And I'm happy to, if anything you want to ask about that or bring up or comment on, please. So if you have a situation, say, I like the one that you pass, I'm ready to say, I'll say, why am I angry or what is the time that I'm not? I can understand when you're sitting as a chair to do that. I'm not really angry. I'm not really angry, but sometimes, I'm just like, I'm going to do this, instead of focusing on the feeling, emotion, or content. Yeah. Yeah. In that sense, it's similar. And I have the master. Yeah. Yeah. How do I do that in the moment? So I sort of drop down in the body and have that question also. Yeah. Repeating that. there's no words, because you begin to see that the words are rather artificial. And it's more like, it's very similar to what you describe, it's more like dropping down to the level of the feelings, only instead of being aware of the feelings as an object, or trying to understand them, or analyze them, or observe them, it's more like you become the feelings as a question, as a feeling of what is going on, what is this? So that there's no, and this does take some committed training over time, that you can develop this spirit or this ability to, more or less, just, I think your phrase, to drop down is very good, to drop down to the level of what you're feeling, be very, very immediately present with a feeling of inquiry, without any words. But to get there, you may actually spend a lot of hours repeating the words, you know, over time, and you may find yourself sometimes, in that moment, dropping down to your feelings and using the words, what is it? But after a while, that falls away, it seems a little clunky or unnecessary, it's just this, almost a texture of being immediately present with inquiry. And then, one is not, just by virtue of that, one is no longer caught in the way one would have been otherwise, where the various kinds of clashes and some scars around those feelings kick in, and you start acting on it and making matters worse, as we so often do, you know. I mean, my office says, my idea of Buddhism is, just don't make things worse. And it is, when you begin to look, you notice how active we all are, you know, in making things worse. Things are bad, you know, it's not that everything is rosy, there are a lot of problems. But if you didn't make them worse, I think the problems would be, actually, could even be wonderful challenges. Yes, life is interesting, there are problems, but just don't make them worse. So I think this kind of Genjokoan practice would help one quite a bit not to make things worse. I have a somewhat historical question. I was a little interested in what you had to say about how in Chinese Buddhism that Cohen would use to bring the practice, at least this is what I heard you say, of bringing the Samadhi and the Pasama together in practice. Yes, yes. And as a person who has only been exposed to terra vata, it seems, in fact, within the Vipassana tradition, we are now at a similar point where we never use Cohen to get there. Right. Would you agree with that kind of simple? Yes, I think, as I said in the beginning, particularly, what the American Vipassana movement is, a development that's recent and it's developed in the context of world Buddhism. So as far as I can tell, I know lots of Vipassana teachers have practiced Vipassana, have gone to Vipassana retreats, and as far as I can tell, there isn't all that much difference, really. I mean, I think that's right. I think that there's some kind of classical Vipassana that bypasses Samadhi and there's Samadhi practice, but mostly what we practice here is not so much difference between Zen meditation and Vipassana. So I think a lot of Vipassana teachers do practice Samadhi and Vipassana as one practice. Yeah. I have a small question. I hear you said the word Cohen and you used it to say it over the plural. Yeah, the Japanese word. There's no plural in Japanese words. Oh. Yeah. And I'm wondering if there are communities of people who live currently on the village to be expressive. Oh, yes. Actually, the lineage of Zen that was founded by Taizen Mizumi in L.A., which now has various branches and teachers, although they're a Soto lineage, they practice Cohen system. And also the lineage that was started in the West by Robert Aiken, which is a lay Zen lineage. It's a fairly recent lineage. That lineage also practices Cohen study. And so there are many, many teachers in both those lineages. Those are the main two lineages that do Cohen study in the West. Also the lineage in the Rochester Zen Center where Kaplaroishi, I think they also practice Cohen. So there's lots of Cohen study that goes on in the West. Our lineage doesn't – we study Cohen and the Weidogen did it by speaking about Cohen and having a studying Cohen in our daily life practice, but not going through a curriculum. Yeah, the Japanese doesn't have tenses or – so you know by context, whether it's yesterday or today, one Cohen or one thousand Cohen. In practicing and showing Cohen as a focus for daily meditation practice, do you recommend – let's say you're sitting down at seven in the morning, do I pick and choose what the Cohen is or is it whatever is there at that time of the conference? Or do I look back and say I had this big emotion yesterday and I should look back? Well, I think it helps to work through with the teacher and get some feedback and guidance. Somehow that seals the Cohen and makes it real because there is this problem of, well, I just pick and choose Cohen, so what is this real? And then you can't commit yourself to it. When it's given to you or sanctioned by somebody that you respect in the Dharma with whom you're in a relationship, it seals it for you and then you feel that you can actually give yourself to it. Because meditation practice is interesting, it requires a certain kind of full commitment and devotion, which if you're shaky about that, it hinders the practice. But that's not to say you have to have a teacher to do this, it just makes it easier in that way. So I would say there's two approaches. One is – and I think we have to be careful here – this is not about analyzing our feelings or trying to understand our feelings. So I wouldn't, myself, if I had something happened yesterday, it was emotionally trying, I wouldn't necessarily say, well, then I better meditate on that today. But if there seems to be a theme, like if one notices that there's a certain kind of reactivity that keeps coming up, seems to be a theme of this time in my life. So it's not just that yesterday I was angry at somebody, but that I'd been experiencing many moments of this same kind of anger in different ways, I might then take that as a koan. What is anger? I might craft my own koan. What is anger? What is fear? And breathe with that. That would be one way. The other way would be just the koan of the present moment. What is life? What is being? What is this moment? What is the breath? I mean, I have a way of practicing with the breath, where I, by stages, develop concentration on the breath and then inquire of the breath. What is this breath? Which is a way of saying, what is this life? And again, it's not a matter of so much breaking through all of a sudden and having this great insight as it is bringing yourself to that level of your living, to that level of recognizing, this is life. What is this? It's kind of like, that's the basis for everything, right? We don't have life. None of our problems would exist, right? That's the way to solve all your problems. Don't be alive. Then you have no problems. But, so the basis for all of our problems and joys and hopes and fears, we have no interest in whatsoever, right? We're interested in our hopes, our fears, our desires and so forth. But we have no interest whatsoever in the fundamental basis of the wall, which is this life and what is it? So if you meditate like that in the morning, returning to, what is it? What is this life? It's as if you're waking up the basis. And then what happens over practice, over time, is that that basis is never far away, never far away. You look at the sky, it's right there. You feel a powerful emotion, it's right there. And so you want to develop and cultivate this capacity to be very close always to the basis of everything. And like I say, ordinary life more or less is absolutely forgetting about the basis. One never notices one is alive. We're too busy complaining about our problems. Even no matter how many problems you have, you are alive. You have no idea how you got that way. You didn't make it happen. You didn't particularly deserve it or do anything about it. It can be taken away from you at any moment. This is a fantastic paradox, completely unknown. You never give a thought to it. You never appreciate it. You never wonder about it. You don't even know that it's so, because the rent is due. And you lost your checkbook or whatever. Yeah, the rent is due. You did lose your checkbook, but you're alive. And a whole different thing when you remember that, when you're always close to that. And I think that's fundamentally what koan practice is all about, keeping you close to that fact, so that it's always at your fingertips. You sit regularly with the moo koan? And when I encounter the who, the koan, I immediately come up against that source of human misunderstanding. That I find it challenging to make myself understood. That I see other people finding it challenging to make themselves understand. That we face this having to wave our arms and our lips to come across to one another. This occurred to me today, some of you have done this, and also in the past. I wonder if you have any remarks or any words about... I'm just close, but I have an issue with Anata. An issue with Anata? I read that there is no self, I think this is what we've been told. I'm committed to this plan, but I continue to have some trouble understanding if it was the case that I had no self, and that there really was no koan. How could it be the case that we have so much trouble making ourselves understood? How could we express ourselves perfectly and are constantly perfectly understood? I actually don't think that this is really a problem, but certainly in our experience we don't feel that. This is what you're speaking to. It's not a matter of slashing your way through the clumsy means of communication that we're always working with, until you find a way to make it right. It's more a matter of coming to a recognition that regardless of how much we are constantly misunderstanding each other, we also are always meeting heart to heart and face to face because we are so close to one another and so intimate with one another because we're all occupying being together. There's a kind of immense closeness and a perfection of our communication. So it's more a matter of recognizing that than it is figuring out how to communicate and studying within ourselves the real source of our feelings of not being heard and not being understood, not understanding and not hearing others. Those feelings and thoughts need to be clarified and worked with, for sure, on a foundation of the recognition that there is perfect communication. Then your point about Anatta, no self. Personally, I don't think that the Buddha taught that there is no self and that there is no who. I actually don't believe that the Buddha taught that. I believe that when he taught, he certainly taught about, used that term, but there are sutras where he basically says, if I say there's a self, this is incorrect. If I say there's no self, this is also incorrect. The Buddha was not interested in propounding a doctrine that there's no self and making us all feel like idiots. How come if there's no self, how come I'm worried, worried? Or how come I have these experiences which seem to indicate a self? He wasn't trying to mess us up in that way. He was only trying to let us know that our understanding of the self, our relationship to it, is causing us to suffer. We need to understand this experience that we have of subjectivity, that we actually have this experience of subjectivity. We need to understand it in a radically different way and appreciate it and live it in a radically different way than the way that we're living. In order to try to explain what that different way would look like, he talked about amnata. It's like I have a friend who's a rabbi. My favorite story that he tells is about somebody who comes screaming into him angry. Rabbis have to deal with this. He comes running screaming at him angry saying, I don't believe in God, I don't believe in God. My friend says, well, hold on, relax. Tell me about the God you don't believe in. The person then goes on a rant about this God that he doesn't believe in. At the end of the rant, the rabbi says, well, I don't believe in that God either. So in other words, no self is just like the self that you believe in is not the self that you are. That's what no self is designed to teach us. We do have an experience of subjectivity. It needs to be clarified. If we clarify it, we can live differently. I think that's the burden of the Buddhist teachings. Not in the Pali suttas, but in later Mahayana teachings, there's a whole kind of map of mind, which includes a whole sort of level of consciousness, which is called self. There's a whole big how subjectivity functions in the context of our experiencing, perceiving, feeling, and so forth. In that way of talking about it, instead of talking about no self, what's talked about is a revolution. It's actually the word revolution in the way self is lived and perceived, a revolution. I think that's what the Buddha was indicating when he talked about no self. He meant there needs to be a real, completely different understanding of self. In the mind only teachings of Buddhism, the Mijnati Matrada teachings, or the Yogacara teachings, Tikhana Han writes about it in his book, which I think is very readable. These teachings, unfortunately, are super hard to understand in their Indian philosophical guise, especially translated into English and so forth. But Tikhana Han has a book called transformation at the base. I've given a series of lectures on this book, and it's possible that they're available on my website. I don't know if they are. If they're not, you can email the tapes person and ask her to send them. But transformation at the base, this is interesting, important teachings for us, because I think for Western people, we have such a culture of self and ego and so forth, that I think it's counterproductive to get too focused on the idea of no self, because you end up sort of denying your basic psychology, which was not the Buddha's idea. Shall we take a little break now? It's 11 o'clock. Can we break to 11.15? Thank you very much.
