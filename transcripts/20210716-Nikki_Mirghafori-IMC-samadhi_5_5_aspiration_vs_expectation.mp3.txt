 So greetings, greetings, international sangha, friends around the world, green and blue planet of ours. So for this week, we have been exploring supportive conditions for cultivating samadhi, also translated, often translated as concentration, but perhaps more preferably translated as calm, unification of the mind, calm abiding, etc. so that there is less of a sense of tightness in the word that there might be associations for some people with concentration. And today we combined them all together and brought in the container, the container that holds them all, which is our attitude, intention. So again, we had started with relinquishing what is not helpful and on the other side of the coin, realizing, oh yes, there is beauty, there is grace, there is delight, joy in the simplicity of the present moment. They work together, they support each other, these two supporting conditions. And then the other couple of supporting conditions we talked about. One was relaxing the body, relaxing the body so the mind can relax. And then if the body is just relaxed, well maybe the attitude becomes a little too relaxed, but then on the other side of the coin with a relaxed body we have coming back again and again gently, atapi coming back, perseverance, gentle perseverance. And together, vitaka and vichara, connecting, connecting and sustaining, connecting and sustaining, vitaka containing initial application, vichara sustaining. So all of these four, and you see two and two, the first two are kind of a pair, the second two are kind of a pair. And then what holds all of these is our attitude, our intention, the mind that is meditating. And attitude and intention is so important that actually I have been weaving it through all of these teachings, all of these supporting factors. Our attitude is not separate from them, it is in the way we show up, in the way we approach each of these factors, it's not separate. And yet it is important to name it today as the container that holds it all, holds our practice, holds our cultivation. So a few notes on attitude, on intention. So Utejanya, a Burmese monk I've practiced with, he likes to, he has an interesting way of putting attitude, and he often says, what is the quality of the mind? What is the mind? He says, what is the mind that is meditating? Is it a greedy mind? Is it a mind that has aversion and ill will in it? Is it a confused mind? So is it a mind that is infused with the three poisonous roots already? Or is it a mind that is infused with their opposite, with relinquishment, the ease, generosity? Is it a mind that is infused with kindness, goodwill? Is it a mind that is infused with wisdom, with trust, with faith? So knowing what is the mind that is practicing, what is the mind that's meditating, is it the mind that wants, okay, alright, I want to get concentrated, I want this, I want that. That is the quality of the mind, and at first, if you're beginning in our practice, sometimes it is hard at the beginning to notice the quality of the mind, because we might be a fish swimming in water, it might be hard to know if the water has dye in it, has a little bit of color in it, we may not notice, but just gently keep noticing what is the attitude in the mind, what is the attitude in the mind. And I tell you, especially with the practice of samadhi, practice of samatha leading to state of samadhi, I've seen so many practitioners get exceedingly tight, exceedingly tight and unfriendly, and the sense that, okay, in the meditation hall and practicing under retreat, they become so attached, without seeing it, they become so contracted, attached to the quiet, to the connecting, to the breath, to this, to cultivating this, that they become really brittle, the mind becomes really brittle and irritable, every sound, every door that closes, every noise outside, every breath next door is like, I'll make it stop, quiet, quiet, I'm trying to develop concentration. It's ouch, ouch, ouch, notice, so if that arises for you, it's okay, just realize that the practice is becoming their source of suffering because of the attitude in the mind. It's okay, it's okay, is the mind, does the mind have generosity and kindness or grasping, craving and aversion, just notice what is the mind. So that is one question you can drop in now and then and become attuned to it, become attuned to it in a very friendly, gentle way because again, it's the water that we swim in in our practice. And similarly, the sense of intentionality is what is the intention? Is it, is the intention, me, me, me, I want this, me, me, me, what is the intention? You get to know it. Is it an intention of service? Are you giving your heart to this practice without expectation? It's wonderful to have aspirations but not expectations. So how are they different? An aspiration is a beautiful intention, to have an aspiration, an intention, an intention, let me use the word aspiration, for waking up, for service, for generosity, for kindness. So as an aspiration, it lifts us up, it supports us in our path whereas expectation, I expect to wake up, I expect to become more generous. You see, it's much tighter, this expectation tightens us, it makes us smaller, it becomes about me, me, me, I expect whereas, ah, aspiration, aspiration, as if we're putting ourselves, we're putting our precious minutes, precious moments on the altar of humanity together. It connects us to something above and beyond ourselves that we are a part of, we are a part of, it expands us, it expands us. So attitude, intention. Another thing I wanted to bring here which is important is an attitude of interest and curiosity, interest and curiosity. So whatever happens, even if your mind is distracted, if things are coming up, if it's maybe, as long as there is interest, curiosity, there is zest, oh this is interesting, ah, this, just like a scientist of your own mind, there is no failed experiment because you always learn, as long as you have that attitude, as long as the attitude is one of openness, curiosity, learning, interest, chanda, zest, this interest in practice, set up, okay, alright, it's alright, I gotta sit down, it's my 30 minutes, alright, okay, I gotta do this just as I brush my teeth and yeah, I'm supposed to meditate because I read in whatever news articles that it's good for me, oh don't, don't, if you're showing up like a soldier, like every day it feels like it's drudgery, stop practicing for a week, just don't until you love it, until you miss it, until like, oh yes, even actually for longer, until you really feel the desire, the love, the curiosity, interest, so do it with love, do it because of love, not because I have to, that's the perfect way to kill aspiration. So, so dear ones, there's so much more to say about samadhi, about this beautiful practice of cultivation and as I said, it's been a primary practice, the jhanas have been the primary practice for me and I do like to mention with gratitude, really with love, my Burmese teacher Pa Aksayada, the jhana master, the living master, jhana master, with a lot of devotion and love, so offering the goodness, yeah offering the goodness of my practice with you this week to him and all beings, all beings everywhere, so.
