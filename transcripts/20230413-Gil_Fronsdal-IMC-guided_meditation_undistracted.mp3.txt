Greetings.
Nice to be here with all of you.
I feel kind of cozy sitting here.
This is the second time I've sat down here to meditate in this hall today.
At six o'clock there was a meditation with the group that's here.
It was very nice.
And now with this, with all of you, thank you for being here.
And one useful definition for mindfulness
is that it's being undistracted.
And why that's useful is that it doesn't imply that we have to do anything
except maybe let go of our distractions.
And then we are there, aware of whatever is left.
So to let go of distracting thoughts,
let go of thoughts that interfere with being aware.
And then be aware in whatever way remains,
being aware of whatever arises.
And you could even be without any choice.
Whatever arises in the present moment in awareness is allowed to be there.
And this kind of way of understanding mindfulness is supported
by the idea that we're present for whatever arises easily.
We're not looking for something or trying to make something happen
or trying to penetrate deeply into the nature of reality.
Just very simple, lightly, calmly, receptively, easily, with ease, whatever comes.
And it can be a little bit easy to be impatient or feel like it's not enough
because after all meditation, mindfulness, Buddhism is pointing to
all kinds of fantastic great states of meditation, and attainments, and all kinds of great things.
And so that's what's important.
And just something ordinary, like just whatever arises in awareness,
may seem like it's too ordinary.
But it's not ordinary because most people live their lives distracted.
And the continuity of this ordinary, easeful, undistracted state leads to great freedom.
It is a kind of a freedom in itself.
So to begin with a posture that has a little bit of intentionality in it.
If you're sitting in a very relaxed way, in an easy chair,
or some other posture that's very relaxed,
see if you can do a small adjustment that adds a little bit of intentionality to the posture.
It could be sitting up a little bit straighter.
If you're meditating, laying in bed, you might stick your forearm,
point your forearm up towards the ceiling.
The upper arm can be flattened in the bed, and so at a right angle, the forearm points this up.
And that's a little bit more, requires some intentionality.
And then gently close your eyes.
And without much more preparation,
what in your experience, here and now, arises effortlessly, or arises easily?
What is easy to be aware of here and now?
And as you're aware of whatever is easy,
is there any momentum movement in the mind to wonder off and thought?
A kind of wondering off that eclipses a present moment awareness.
A wondering off and thought, where we lose touch with
being easily aware of what comes easily to us here and now.
And if you do find yourself moving into distracted thoughts,
you might just use the phrase or the word, undistracted,
maybe like a question or a reminder, to open again in an easy way
to be aware of what's easy here.
What's left when you are undistracted?
For now, there's nothing else you need to do.
You don't have to focus on the breathing.
You don't have to have something that you're focusing on
and trying to stay with.
Just come back to the simple place where you can be aware
of what appears easily in awareness.
And if there's commentary and judgments about anything,
that's also a pull away from being aware easily.
That's all for now.
Thanks for watching.
Staying close to this undistracted place,
being aware of what comes into awareness easily,
you might notice that the mind sometimes settles on certain experiences.
Other times, there's a shifting sensations that are coming in,
almost like the mind just moves between things, floats.
All kinds of things are appearing, shifting.
All kinds of things are appearing, shifting.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
Undistracted.
And then you might let awareness be more centered on the body breathing,
becoming aware of whatever sensations of breathing arise easily into awareness.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
As you return to undistractedness and being aware with ease for whatever is easy,
easily comes to awareness, whatever is easy about the breathing,
is there any tranquility, calm or peace,
in that easeful awareness?
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.

All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
All kinds of things are appearing.
Undistracted.
What remains when you're undistracted?
And what is it like to be aware of that easily, with ease?
And if whatever is occurring here for you is uncomfortable or painful,
emotionally, mentally,
what might it be like to know it with this easeful awareness?
Whatever is painful, whatever is dukkha,
let it appear, let it arise easily into awareness without becoming distracted by it,
without being pulled into commentary and stories.
Undistracted awareness of the challenges that arise simply and easily,
here and now, the hearness of them.
And in this simplicity of awareness,
might there also be a tenderness or warm-heartedness,
a compassion that vibrates or is awakened
in the ease, in the calm, as part of easy awareness, calm awareness,
easy compassion, easy tenderness, a kind-heartedness.
And now as we're coming to the end of the meditation,
bringing to mind someone in your life who has challenges of some type or other,
and in these last couple of minutes,
bring them to mind and see if there can be for a couple of minutes
a simple, light, easeful sense of care, compassion, tender-heartedness, kind-heartedness,
not a doing so much as, what can arise when we're undistracted?
And may our ability to be undistracted
as we go about this suffering world
allow for our capacity for simple compassion
to be present and available, always ready to wish everyone well.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be free of their suffering.
May all beings have their burdens and depression lifted.
May all beings be free of their afflictions.
May they get well.
May all beings be safe of harm.
May all beings experience peace, not war.
May all beings be free so they can breathe easily, smile easily, care easily.
May we all care for each other.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
