Dharmette: Responding from the Heart  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

This morning I mentioned that it’s possible to practice 
mindfulness as a technique from the control tower, 
where you’re the agent who’s applying mindfulness on 
your life. Or it’s possible to practice it from the inside 
out, where you let the awareness – the mindfulness – 
emerge. Mostly what we have to do is to be present and 
get out of the way. We get out of the way for awareness  
to operate.  
 
The human being – the human mind, the mentality, the 
heart – is very powerful.  It has tremendous capacities to 
operate if you leave it alone. Some practice could be 
underst ood as learning to get out of your own way. 
Really letting go of the distractions, letting go of 
preoccupations to allow some deeper thing to operate. 
One of those deeper things is awareness itself – 
mindfulness itself. Where it emerges, rather than 
someth ing that you do.  
 
I said earlier that “to be alive is to be mindful.” When 
someone says they don’t want to be mindful, to me it’s 
similar to saying , “I don’t want to be alive.” The two are 
completely connected. In a similar way, I could say the same thing about love. Love – in terms of mettā , loving 
kindness, compassion, sympathetic, apprecia tive joy, 
equanimity  – the brahmavihāras  – these are  also part of 
this powerful capacity of our human inner life – the 
heart, the mind – that wants to operate , and wants to be 
there if you give it a chance.  
 
If you can get out of the way enough, I think that 
awareness will just be there. Something like love will be 
there as well.  You may not be able to predict  the exact 
form it takes, . To say “I’m going to be loving,” and do it 
from the control tower as a technique, as a thing you’re 
supposed to do, might be ok. But I still remember this  
one time in college , where  I was going to be really 
loving and kind to this woman in the library. So I talked 
to her , and I think she probably was disgusted. 
Afterwards, I thought , “Wow, that was pretty saccharine , 
or forced.”  
 
It’s possible to be in the control tower and overdo it. 
Perhaps s ometimes some of you have felt oppressed by 
people’s kindness coming in that way. It’s also possible 
to mostly get out of the way  of the heart’s resonance – 
the heart’s ability to have empath y – and to see what 
arises from that. In different situations , there might be 
very different flavors or aspects of love that might come. 
This idea is to get  out of the way , and respect and see 
what arises in different circumstances . I think  this is 
quite p owerful  – as opposed to having  preconceived ideas of how it should be, how it’s supposed to be. 
There’s nothing necessarily wrong with having ideas  – it 
doesn’t have to be as bad as me in the library – but 
sometimes it can be quite inspiring to think , “Oh, this is 
what I want to do here ,” and then apply it.  
 
The thing that most people don’t appreciate enough is 
how the practice can support us in getting out of the 
way. How we can learn to drop the distractions , the 
preoccupations ? Drop the busyness of the mind, the 
need to be in the control tower that makes things 
happen, and that judges, compares, measures 
ourselves, tries to prove ourselves, and defend 
ourselves ? All this stuff we do that covers over these 
wonderful, quite beauti ful and profound capacities deep 
down inside  of us . 
 
As we start this new year, I would like to suggest that a 
wonderful c apacity that we all have is to love. To be 
able to meet each other , and walk through the world 
with other people , and see them with ou r kindness, our 
sense of mutual support, knowing  we’re in this life 
together. It’s a hard life. For many, many people , it’s 
difficult to be in this life . There are so many challenges . 
Everyone is going to be challenge d sooner or later , if 
they haven’t been  already. There are going to be major 
challenges that come along. People know that they’re 
going to die, they’re going to be sick. If you could meet 
people in some of the challenges they’re up against,  and if you don’t  cover over your response with fear or  
distress or responsibility for it, I think it would melt your 
heart. In that melting, your love, your kindness, your 
compassion, your care  would pour forth .  
 
The same thing goes for ourselves. As we go through 
our life, there are all kinds of challenges.  Chances are 
relatively high that all of us are going to run into some 
kind of challenge this coming year. How do we get out 
of the way of the heart’s response? Can we somehow 
discover where the heart’s deepest response can unfold  
and arise ? Can we be responsive to whatever the 
challenge might be ? Chances are that what will come 
out of that will be love, compassion, kindness, support. 
Something like that.  
 
Just as mindfulness, or awareness, is a natural capacity 
that will flow out of you if you g et out of the way, so will 
love. Maybe there’s no real sharp difference between 
being aware and being loving or having love. Maybe the 
two are inseparable. Two sides of the same hand. I kind 
of feel that way. I don’t really see a sharp divis ion 
between awa reness and love in all its different forms. 
Except maybe for romantic love, which is a bit more 
complicated. We use the word ‘love’ in so many ways in 
English, but the brahmavihāras are such a beautiful 
thing.  
 
If you are interested in love and what are called the brahmavihāras  – the four divine abodes in Buddhism  – 
if you’re interested in this capacity of your heart, it’s a 
wonderful thing to make love a theme for your life , and 
to read about it, learn about it,  touch into it, explore it, 
talk to friends about it . Learn from yourself.  
• What have you learned about love over your lifetime 
to date?  
• What is your relationship to it , and how can you 
touch into it?  
• How does it work for you?  
• Are you interested in it?  
• Does it have any value for you?  
• Does it have more value than some of the 
alternatives that you give yourself over to?  
• Do you have more confidence in love?  
• Or do you h ave more confidence in greed, hate, 
fear, or…food?  [laughter] That touched a nerve!  
 
Reflect on it , and live with it. It’s a beautiful thing, a 
worthwhile thing. To have that somehow interwoven into 
our practice of mindfulness makes the mindfulness 
practice so much richer and more alive and, I think, 
more  realistic.  
 
May it be that this year your awareness and your love 
are inseparable from each other. They go together.
