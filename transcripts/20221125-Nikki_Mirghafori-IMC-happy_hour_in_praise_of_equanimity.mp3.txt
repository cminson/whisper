 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. Dharma, here we go. Okay. Hi, everyone. Lovely to be with you. Hmm. So, so the season of holidays in the US, VR in the US have started. You know, Thanksgiving and Christmas is coming and all that. So holidays also, they perhaps may, they're both stressful and they have lovely aspects. They're lovely and they're stressful both. You know, we can focus on one or the other, but it's both. And in some ways, it's not so different from the rest of life. It's lovely and it's stressful, right? Both of those, we can say, but life. So, so what I wanted to, to reflect on tonight and invite us to practice with is the fourth Brahma Vihara. The Brahma Vihara is again, as a reminder or the practices of the heart, mental loving kindness being the first one, compassion or karuna. The second one, third one is mudita, vicarious joy. The fourth one is equanimity or upeka. This, this beautiful expansion of the heart to be with whatever is with stability, with care. It's not aloofness, it's not, oh, I don't care, you know, listen, you know, talk to the hand, I'm not listening. That's not equanimity. We know that already, but I always want to remind us. Equanimity can be more nuanced, can be more nuanced compared to the other Brahma Viharas. And yet it is the Brahma Vihara is the faculty where the other Brahma Viharas rest on its loving kindness, compassion and vicarious joy rest on equanimity. Because if they don't rest on the stability, on the open heartedness, on the spaciousness of equanimity, they can re-ear into the opposite. Metta, loving kindness can become clinginess or compassion can become grief or distress or say, udita, vicarious joy can re-ear into either pride or its opposite into envy. If it doesn't have this open heartedness, this open heartedness of equanimity, just open hearted, spacious, stable, it's just such a beautiful quality to have. And it's not cold, it's not aloof at all. Otherwise, they wouldn't be part of the Brahma Viharas, right? All the Brahma Viharas we have, Metta, we have love there. So wait, how are these in the same family? Oh, okay, so equanimity isn't cool after all, it has care in it. Of course, it has care in it, has care enough in it to be stable, to be present, to be with what is. So I'd like to invite us to consider, to relate to equanimity tonight as we practice, a spaciousness of the heart, just complete spaciousness of the heart, spaciousness of the mind, for our own sake, especially say, if challenging emotions, if difficulties arise, there is a sense of equanimity, there's a sense of peace and ease, which again, can veer into Metta, can veer into, for others, it can veer into vicarious joy, it can veer into gratitude for ourselves, it can veer into compassion if there are challenges. So equanimity is responsive, equanimity can be quite responsive. So we start with equanimity and there are different flavors, different places we can go. Whereas again, aloofness is, oh, you're not paying attention, it's like, whatever. Whereas equanimity really faces, it opens the heart and faces. One last thing I want to say before we start practice is that it's such a beautiful quality of the heart and the more we expand our heart and the more we make our hearts, our minds spacious through equanimity, the more we can contain, the more we actually surprise ourselves as to what we're made of, right? What we're made of, we can just surprise ourselves, wow, this, I can be with this too. This too, I'm not losing neither my confidence nor my temper. Oh, I have a sense of spaciousness to meet, to meet what's happening, to meet what's happening with appropriate response. So, so in praise of equanimity, in praise of equanimity, this beautiful spacious quality of the heart. Yeah, it's glorious, glorious equanimity. Equanimity is really glorious. It's such a sublime state, really such a sublime state to cultivate spaciousness of the heart. It's very generous. Equanimity also is the ground for generosity, just being with all there is. So, all right, I can talk a lot more about the joys and the perfection, this beautiful quality, which is actually one of the perfections, as called one of the jewels and put as practice. But let's just practice together. Let's just try it on for size, cultivate, enjoy a taste of it for ourselves. And if there are areas when tonight equanimity does not arise or the opposite of it arise, clinging or aversion, not a problem, not a problem. Use the opposite of equanimity, which is aversion or clinging, as a pointer. Oh, there's equanimity lacking here. Oh, can I be with the lack of equanimity present here? Because then you can bring in equanimity to lack of equanimity. And that's like an Aikido move in practice. So, all right, let's do it. Let's practice together. So arriving, arriving. Arriving in this body, arriving in this moment, sitting with integrity upright, and making space for whatever is present right now. There could be fatigue, there could be boredom, there could be resistance, it could be joy, anxiety, whatever is present. Hi, everything. Hello. Bring it on. Open your heart. Spacious, spacious, stable, this body connected, rooted. Everything can be here just as it is. Connecting with the breath. Feel the connection of the body, to the earth, through the feet, your sit bones on the cushion, on the chair, hands on the lap. Relaxing the body, resting, connecting to the earth. Let the in-breath be received in the abdomen, the lower abdomen. The entirety of the in-breath, the pause between the in and out breath, the out-breath and the entirety of it, and the pause. Calming soothing each breath. Spending a few minutes just connecting with the breath and the body, to settle to arrive. The joy, the joy of just being breathed, nothing to do nor to go. Taking refuge in this moment, just be breathed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to invite you to imagine. Your body is a boat. is a boat on a lake that is still on a still lake the water is very still your boat your body is quite stable it's floating letting your body relax it's a nice day maybe it's sunny warm pleasant this body this boat floating on the water the water of life meeting meeting the circumstances floating floating your body can relax the boat is still let yourself enjoy this sense of relaxed relaxed stability floating on the water you you you you you you well now let's imagine this in this boat just stable steady floating on the water your body breathing relaxed in this image enjoying the day warm sunny birds coming sitting and the boat leaving that there is some wind there's a little bit of wind and there are some waves some waves on the water and the boat meets them the boat moves a bit and it undulates waves of life your body be relaxed yourself to your your breath soft no fear no worry this is just how things are conditions of life is to have some waves conditions of the water or to have some waves perhaps the energy of the waves actually bring a sense of the liveness energy into the body into the mind vitality riding the waves in your boat and your raft still enjoying the sun the birds and the waves spaciousness of the heart spaciousness of the heart calm openness not contracted into fear but open spacious you you you and maybe while you're in the water you see another boat another boat that's floating and and coming towards you maybe you see this boat coming right towards you you then maybe at first there is some concern or worry or fear or anger about the other person who's driving the boat right towards you until you realize there's no one in the boat it's an empty boat it's drifting it's moving towards you is born of causes and conditions it's impersonal you and perhaps you realize that this boat that is you floating moved by the currents the wind it's also so much born of causes and conditions so much of it is impersonal it's impersonal you no need to take it so so personally or be worried concerned contracted maybe the heart can relax be more spacious and appreciating the interdependence of all things the wind the flow the waves energy of life ah the heart relax in the midst of all of it still meeting it with kindness with wisdom with compassion but not in the state of contraction and spacious appreciating that you are moved by part of all these costs and conditions not permanent not personal not inherently satisfactory and yet miraculous amazing this whole being human this whole being alive this whole being filled with all you be a part of it no matter how it is how the waves go you you can we invite the heart to relax with the comings and goings of things with the waves as we float the comings and goings of weather random boats on the water enjoying the sun on your face and your life you get to you be on the lake and these waves how amazing you you maybe you can imagine maybe some challenge that's happening right now in your life is as a wave in the water you the wave that comes and goes yet another wave here it is it's okay the heart and the body be spacious calm relaxed or maybe even joyous the writing's wave floating through it your vessel is stable sturdy you you there is a sense of uprightness in the dhamma in this practice you there are just waves it's okay they've been through a million waves in your life you've grown in experience in wisdom how to write them more ways may they help me grow in kindness towards myself towards others grow in wisdom you you as we bring this practice period to a close whatever happened or did not happen having kindness appreciation for yourself you've showed up you've done your best if there are a lot of waves during this practice period it's okay let your heart be spacious and kind bowing to the waves it's okay uprightness uprightness in the dhamma in this moment a sense of clarity and uprightness and offering this goodness co-created together in this practice to all beings everywhere our lives are intertwined with everyone else everything else how amazing wow may we be of service may our lives our breath our work our thoughts our being alive may be of service the goodness in the world in ways we cannot even imagine may all beings everywhere including ourselves be free thanks everyone thanks for your practice practice well it's a different and new way for us to explore this practice of equanimity we had never done it this way on this uh atati hour with this kind of a guided meditation with with waves just a different way to explore it and maybe there is a nugget of something in this in this visualization the way that we relate it to it that worked for you great keep it keep that insight keep that way it worked and maybe it didn't no problem you tried it on for size you can let it go it's all good so so um yeah questions comments reflections what did you notice what was it like for you what happened there was also a little uh invitation there with with anna tile and insight in there you caught it but anyway jerry i see your zoom hand please oops you got muted again let's unmute you please oh you're still me what happened still muted um there we go there good thank you uh i guess um i know that in buddhism intentions very important um and certainly i i don't question your intentions nikki but i guess um um when you know there's a in the lay presses i would call it gaslighting is a popular topic nowadays and one of the things that you mentioned was don't take it so seriously which is often a term used by people who may not have good intentions to try to undermine another person just don't take it so seriously like another word said you're not in touch with reality and it can be a form of bullying and i know that wasn't your intention but and i didn't take it that way but when i heard that word don't take it so seriously i wondered um how that fit and i understood the intent was to have yourself maybe look at what's happening and what's coming up and is it yeah actually i want to pause you for a moment jerry because i i remember saying don't take it so personally personally yeah so don't take it but i didn't say seriously so that's different that's very different in the dharmic so i want to pause you here because not taking it seriously that's different i can appreciate how that might bring along but not taking it personally that's dharmic language and i'm using that very specifically thank you to hear the difference yeah i i hear the difference uh and uh i get it it's coming from the die i knew your intentions were good but it just it's just sort of twigged a bit where if someone else is using if yourself is using it like the person and asking them to question it uh that's but that's very different jerry so i want to pause you because i i do hear that there's something happening here with with with with both the language and also the you know there's something that has happened you know with gaslighting and sort of but i just want to be very very clear with the intention and with the distinction here so pause so stay with me for a moment jerry okay thanks so so with with not taking it seriously that's different that's like that's not going there but not taking it personally is the concept that we're working with here and the concept of anatta in personality impersonal ungovernable not self not me myself nor mine and there is a sense of impersonality which is really a deep deep wisdom teaching in in buddhism and i trust that you're having practice as long as you have you have had insights into the impersonality of the body of the thought process that there's there's so much impersonality so taking your thoughts personally for example you're taking your body aches personally it's not personal it's or or things that happen arise and like oh person it's just we take so much to be so much personal and we suffer because we take things so personally so so that's a that's an invitation not to take things personal because they aren't personal and and there's a lot of lyle that right now i'm talking about the kind of the shallow level of this insight but they're very very deep deep levels that even this being who is me is is born of causes and conditions it's not personal it's really not so that's what the teaching is and it's a deep teaching oh and the invitation is not to take things personally yes oh you got muted again you're welcome to say anything or just let it be uh it's very helpful thank you thanks thanks jerry yeah okay staff please so i just want to say i was pretty distracted but i think it was because i didn't meditate this morning like i usually do i usually meditate on my own and or in a group and i've had a bit of a stressful day but you know the practice was really useful but um i had to keep returning trying to return my mind to it trying to return my mind to it so but i really always appreciate it would be later practice so much so thank you beautiful thank you staff thank you for saying that and and as you know well that's what i would say is that's perfectly fine distracted buddha just say oh yeah distracted buddha just need to bring back and come back and come to the center and that's perfectly fine just the causes the conditions of the mind are not always the same and that is impersonal because of what's happened through the day or didn't sit like oh yeah it's impersonal it's like of course it's it's it's busy right now terrible me i'm a bad person it's like no just like this is what happens like it's impersonal it's born of causes and conditions this busyness of the mind and then you and then you work with it with wisdom you work with it with wisdom beautiful thank you thanks staff lovely and claire i see your hand thank you um i raised my hand for two reasons one is that i loved your metaphor of the boat on the water i thought it was absolutely spot on for me um the other thing though was a question that came up i have for a couple of years now used the concept of acceptance uh to deal with complex situations um and is that similar to equanimity you think slightly different slightly different so so so the idea the the concept of acceptance is is when we accept what is instead of resisting what is so it's not um again uh about acceptance it's not equiessing and it's not giving up so that those are important things that you already know but for the benefit of everyone so with acceptance your sense of accepting yeah it's for example my back is hurting right now by hating it by by being upset about it's like accepting the truth of the moment is acceptance so there's an opening of not resisting it whereas equanimity is more about um so so equanimity includes acceptance but it goes beyond acceptance it includes the opening and not denying what's happening but then there's this this attitude of neither attaching nor resisting so it goes beyond it does that make sense yeah there's a more equipoise great thanks thanks for that and jean you're the last reflection please thanks nikki i actually just had a question um i i did really appreciate the guided meditation and the um the way you defined equanimity is open-heartedness i never understood it that way and it was really lovely and the way of metaphor um but i wonder repeating yourself if you could just if there's anything else to say about why it is we suffer so much when we take things personally um i find myself you know sometimes saying why me like why did it happen to me and i i can kind of understand that that makes it worse but i i don't know if there's any other dots you could connect there thank you yeah yeah thank you um so so there are a lot of reasons why we suffer when we things take things personally it's a longer dharma talk but i want to come to to specifically what you just referred to which is why me let me just say something about that because it's it's a particular example of the bigger bigger case like why me that that if that arises and you know it arises for many of us in many different times so so not to have judgment because that why me arises that's number one but but if it if it arises um the there is a sense of of excuse me it's it's um as if i've done something wrong so it's it's belittling i'm separate like everybody else is okay everybody else has it figured out but but i'm less than i'm worse than i there's just something special but especially in the negative way and that is the delusion of separateness it's the delusion it's denying our similarity in humanity every everybody you know everybody has challenges and in this life it's dukkha unsatisfactoriness is is a characteristic of being alive we just don't see it our minds are are often focused on me me me me me me right my life my body my this like that's just that's how we operate evolutionarily yes oh sweet sweet dear human being you know this is how we operate and yet when that happens why me try to open that up try to open from the constrictions of of me and what's happening to like oh oh just like others instead of whining me just like others just like other human beings i'm having a difficult day right now just like other people just like others just to to to take away that that separateness yeah thank you yeah so okay i spoke a lot and looks like we have less time today it was going to be a short um uh short groups so so let's um let's turn to them it's always sweet to to have to be in small groups so so here's the invitation i have today um for the group so the invitation is um as we get together in small groups of three is and since the topic is equanimity is that the the prompt is what supports your equanimity what supports the sense of being with um the the waves that arise what supports it and maybe what challenges it if you wanted to explore what what supports my equanimity and what what challenges it and maybe what supports it is contemplating the dharma meditating being calm eating a good diet or no sleeping whatever it whatever it might be what helps my equanimity what challenge is it and i suggest uh going in in circle in in you know round robin fashion each person will say will offer a reflection the next person the next person etc so uh take care of yourself take care of each other each person will just be offering from their own experience and this is going to be pretty short tonight so um um yeah we'll probably just be what less than five minutes in groups here we go it's gonna be gonna be gonna be lightning round all right take care of yourself take care of each other here we go so yeah so it's uh seven o'clock already so i will um respect the time and let's just dedicate the merit of our practice together may all beings everywhere be safe happy healthy and well may all beings be free including ourselves thank you all thank you for your practice may you be well may you be calm may you have equanimity may your heart be spacious may you have a wonderful weekend take good care bye
