 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So again, a really warm welcome. Warm welcome to everybody. It's nice to see you all. So today I wanted to talk a little bit about, sometimes we might, and there's nothing wrong with us, just kind of like highlighting different ways in which we might approach our meditation practice. And sometimes we might approach it in a way in which we just want to be having a different experience. So we're going to meditate so that we can, I don't know, create the conditions for something else to arise rather than what's going on right now. And certainly that can be helpful. It can help bring some nourishment, some ease that our nervous system calm down, these types of things. But I also wanted to say, and maybe this goes without saying, but maybe it's implicit or it's kind of a natural way in which we are approaching us. But I'll just say this for something to highlight and for us to think about. And that is this idea of having a spirit of discovery. This spirit of discovery. So this idea of like, oh, what is there to learn here? What is there to see here? What is there? What's happening? Not so much with this idea that we have to accumulate knowledge, that we have to get something in particular. But maybe to highlight it, that it's an alternative to sometimes we might find ourselves falling into this trap of the sense of, am I doing this right? I'm probably doing this wrong. Everybody else seems like they're doing it right. Or maybe we might have this idea, am I getting what I want? No, I want this particular experience that I had that other time. Of course, right, we have these bring these attitudes here, but it can be really helpful to have this spirit of discovery. So that has a, the house thinks to unfold. Those things to follow the natural rhythm of, you know, arising and passing away. I think we all know this when we're doing loving kindness practice. There's no guarantees that loving kindness is going to arise. There's no guarantees you're going to have any particular experience. We're just creating the conditions in which it makes it more likely. So the spirit of discovery, it's also maybe a counter to sometimes this. Sometimes we call this sinking mind, where maybe there's a certain amount of quieting that happens, but then there's a way that there's, there's a lack of brightness. There's just this dullness, this, like everything's kind of quiet and you're in this cottony little fluffy place, which initially might feel like a relief. Like, ah, but then what you discover is that the energy just continues to drain out of it. It's not a, it's not enlivening. So maybe at first it feels like a relief, but then often it can feel, we feel that our motivation for practice or motivation for anything just kind of drains out of it. So the spirit of discovery, can we notice what's happening in the body? What's happening in the heart? What's happening in the mind? Not that we have to find anything in particular, it's more just this general approach. And of course, many of you have been coming here to happy hours so regularly, which is such a beautiful thing. But of course you're noticing, oh yeah, today is a little bit different. Oh yeah, there seems to be this emphasis, this direction. Nikki and I are different teachers, we have different styles, you are a different person on different days. So, but just to maybe notice the mood or the attitude that we're bringing to our practice, so that there can be this, I'm using this word spirit of discovery, but we could also just say curiosity. And when I hear this word curiosity, I kind of reminded of, you know, have kids often have a certain delight. Oh, what is this? Running around, figuring things out. You don't necessarily have to run around, but just this like, oh, what is this? So, maybe this last thing that I'll say about this, the spirit of discovery, part of it is as a counter to some other attitudes we might be bringing. Am I doing it right? I'm not having that experience I want. I'm just going to sink into this dull, fluffy place to kind of insulate myself from everything else. But having this spirit of discovery kind of supports a sense of possibility. It's onward leading. And dare I say, the possibility of having an open heart toward everyone, of not being closed hearted, being open hearted. I'm using this kind of vague language, open and closed heart so that you can find your way with it, without my having to say specifically what it is, but we know what it is sometimes when we have closed our heart to others. So this possibility, the spirit of discovery supports the sense of possibility. And I'd like to say with loving kindness practice, this possibility of having an open heart towards everyone. Okay, so with that as an introduction, let's do some practice here. So, finding our meditation posture, a posture that feels supported. And then, maybe, the non-skeleton, the fleshy bits, kind of like hang from the skeleton. We have to use musculature in a way that's uncomfortable but in a way that expresses our intention of meditating. And again with a little bit of spirit of discovery with the body. How does the body feel right now? Just in a general global sense. Maybe there's some tiredness. Maybe there's some energy, maybe some restlessness. Whatever it is, it's welcome, welcome. And then, tuning into when the body is connected to the chair or cushion. Whatever we're sitting on, feeling grounded, feeling supported. Maybe bringing awareness to any areas of the body that is asking for attention. In the areas that are noteworthy or maybe there's some areas of tightness. Maybe in the neck, the shoulders. And then, to rest our attention on the sensations of breathing. Feeling the expansion or contraction with the breath, the chest or in the belly. Maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose. What is it like to have a spirit of discovery with the sensations of breathing, bringing some curiosity? What does an in-breath feel like? What does an out-breath feel like? And then, to begin our loving kindness practice. Bringing into mind that being for him, it's easy. Easy to feel warm heartedness, feel care, goodwill, love, respect. Choose any or all of those words. This could be somebody with whom you have an uncomplicated, lovely relationship with. It could be somebody that has touched you through their teachings, their writings, but maybe you don't have a relationship with them, per se. Or maybe it's imaginary kittens, puppies, babies. Maybe it's an actual kitten, puppy, baby or furry family member. Bringing the lovable being to mind and connecting. Perhaps visualizing the lovable being. Can you connect to that sense of goodwill that you have for them? I want to say some phrases too. Cultivate, develop, support this loving kindness. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Connecting with this lovable being. May be bringing some of our curiosity. But there's a feel to connect. Without the sense that you have to figure it out, more of a sense of possibility, openness. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. And then to extend our loving kindness to a good friend. Somebody we have a relationship with and that we care about. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Sometimes it's helpful to feel into the body and see if there is any sense of openness or warmth. Maybe in the heart, the chest. Allow that to maybe be fuel or warm heartedness or goodwill or metta, loving kindness. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you live with ease. And then to extend our loving kindness even further, to include ourselves. Sometimes we neglect ourselves, but always sometimes. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Extending our loving kindness again, to include people we don't know. Perhaps somebody we see on occasion in the neighborhood, perhaps somebody on this Zoom call. Sometimes it's a little more difficult, but it can be really helpful to choose an individual as opposed to just generic people you don't know. It can bring some curiosity to this more so. For somebody you don't know, what is it like to have goodwill for them? May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. For somebody we don't know, it might take a little extra energy to stay connected. There's more people that we don't know, and we do know. We're just having goodwill. Care, warmth, respect for people we don't know. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. And with ease. For somebody we don't know, it might take a little extra energy to stay connected. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. And then we'll do a little bit of equanimity practice. For this practice, bring into mind somebody that you care about. And she's a little bit bothersome sometimes. A little bit irksome. Not the most difficult person in your life, just somebody who sometimes is a little bit troubling. Bringing this person to mind. You have a different phrase. I wish you happiness, and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness, and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness, and I cannot make your choices for you. Use some of this equanimity practice. Loving kindness, wishing them happiness, and setting some boundaries. And then to end this meditation, feel your feet on the ground. Feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. So this idea of the spirit of discovering this. So the sense of, I mean a sense of possibility, including the possibility of having an open heart to everyone. We didn't do practice, loving kindness for all beings everywhere, but that's the direction we're going with this practice, right? So this, just this, as opposed to this kind of clamped down constricted version. I know I only want this one particular experience, dang it. So, but instead to like, oh, okay, this is what's happening now. We bring that attitude, that stance to our practice. So can be helpful to talk about some of these ideas with others to talk about either. What is it like to have this spirit of discovery this sense this opening to the sense of possibility this curiosity. Sometimes we often associate that with mindfulness practice, but I'm having that be not excluding as part of a loving kindness practice, just highlighting it. Or you could talk about just how that meditation was for you in particular, you could talk about this idea, what is it like to have this maybe curiosity we could say. And we'll go into groups for about 12 minutes. And it can be helpful to not say every idea that you have about this, but instead whoops. To have an to. Sorry I'm just balancing the rooms here a little bit number of people that there we go, but to have this sense that there's a sense of possibility, I'm sorry. So the way to do the small groups is that to have one person maybe just say one thing and then it goes to the next person, and then they say one thing and then it goes to the next person. So in this way, it's not necessarily just a whole slew of monologues, but instead it's an opportunity to learn from each other and to kind of share some ideas. So, I can say, let's go in the order of the last digit of your phone number. And here we go. Welcome back. Welcome back. Any comments or questions or something you'd like to share. Some of you are smiling, that's a good sign. Yes, I'm gonna say it. Diana, and I said, I want to see chose us because we all have blue shirts on them them them they match with them. That's cute. I should do that right like okay. Everybody was up. But you know this right but zoom just does it for me right, it does it automatically, but then I can see the number of people in each room. So then, sometimes, you know people leave and then tonight at discover like one person was in a room by themselves so I had to take them out and put them in with somebody else or something like that. So, I'm not, I'm letting zoom, make all those decisions except for when they need some rebalancing, but that's nice I hadn't noticed the blue shirts. Abraham, you're wearing a blue shirt, maybe you should have been in with them. This is not blue this is gray in the evening twilight. That's a special shade that's a special shade it's close to blue like blue. I shared in our group that what was really important to me today about opening up was opening up to this group I could really feel the desire to just be warm with the song and house, how warm the song I was, and the group ended up being like that it was just a really warm experience. And I just wanted to tell everybody here that I enjoyed the warmth and I, I took a lot of it so nice. We all can use some warmth right we all can use some warmth. Yes, Barbara. So I really enjoyed our breakout group, and we all have, we all shared, you know, challenges we're facing these days, and one of the participants said that reminded us that the Buddha says that this will change. And if we're in a breakout group a few weeks from now. It may be different things. So, again, it was very warm and very nice. Great. I'm happy to hear that. Thank you. You know when we were in person we would do breakout groups, then we called them small group discussions. And then in my role as a teacher, I could just kind of feel like okay there's a lot of laughter going along, or I could see our people smiling or they frowning or people with their arms crossed, so I could get a sense but now I have no idea what goes on right now. I'm off my screen and so it's nice for me to be hearing this. Thank you. Thank you. You have to open to that. Thank you Abraham. Next time it might be different to right. I will tell you Diana that I was the one who said that that Barbara said the change would happen so I wanted to tell you I'm learning something. Oh you're learning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice, nice. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Oh yes, Jerry do you have a quick comment here. Yes. Yes, the warmth makes you be able to make to space difficult challenges and make difficult decisions. It can be enormously supportive right even just it's a, it's may not be a giant gesture, but just this feeling of warmth really can be nourishing and supportive and ways that perhaps we often don't appreciate. Thank you, Jerry. Okay, so we're one minute past the hour so why don't we unmute and say good night say goodbye. So, thank you all.
