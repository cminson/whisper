The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So again, a warm welcome. I'm just going to offer a few reflections.
Some of you were here last week, or not last week, earlier this week on Monday.
And on Monday I talked about the healing potential of net meditation.
And I'm going to kind of continue that theme, but it's a healing potential of metta and compassion.
And this time less focused on the body and more focused on the heart and mind.
So I'll just start with a really brief recap of a story many of you probably already know, and that is the story of the Buddha and his childhood and his early adulthood.
He was raised as a Sakyan prince, intended to be the heir of his father's kingdom.
And it is said that he was spared no luxury, anything he wanted he got, really, and he excelled at all different kinds of study and archery and all this other stuff.
And also had access to kind of every single sensual pleasure available at the time.
And that included even like the gardeners would go around at night and deadhead the flowers to where not even flowers wilted in his presence.
So I mentioned that because at a certain point in his life, as a young man, the Buddha gave it all up, he renounced it, and he left and he left all the luxury he left everything in order to engage upon a path of deeply committed contemplative practice meditation.
It was quite vigorous, I'm not going to go into it but he let go of all of the hedonism in his life and embarked on what scientists now would call a eudaimonic kind of orientation.
In other words, he stepped off the hedonic treadmill hedonism hedonic of using pleasure as a way to gain happiness and was pursuing a eudaimonic life of greater meaning, purpose, spiritual growth.
And in the Buddhist case he practiced with such deep commitment to ending suffering that he did reach full awakening, full liberation, and ended his suffering.
That's pretty amazing.
I don't know about you but my heart and mind can make an awful lot of suffering and have that completely inspired the philosophy, the religion, the tradition of Buddhism.
So science has been catching up to some of this, not all of it.
Some of it is in the realm of philosophy, religion, of course, but a lot of scientific studies have been done, many, many, many have been done in the last 45 years on meditation and a significant handful of those have been done on metta loving kindness and compassion practice.
And a number of those studies suggest, let's just say lesser benefits than the complete ending of suffering, but still very significant benefits to the heart and mind.
And I'm particularly going to mention some of the benefits of metta meditation and compassion meditation.
This eudaimonic sense of joy, purpose, well being, enhanced cognitive abilities, including the ability to concentrate more readily.
What else here, presence with others and oneself correlated with increased initiative, what's called an internal locus of control, a sense of efficacy in the world, and increased positive emotions, most notably life satisfaction.
Let's say more about the benefits of this practice, I'll be back next week next Wednesday in relationship to relationships, when I'll be also talking about the most powerful form of kindness and compassion practice which is relational.
I'd like to move into the world, but this practice, but for now, I just want to speak more to the benefits of the contemplative practice, which the Buddha talked about in a number of the suitors.
I'm just going to paraphrase here a few of the ones that are particularly benefits attributed, like ascribed to our hearts and minds. The first of those is sleeping better.
The second is waking more comfortably.
The third is no evil dreams. So, doesn't say no bad dreams at all but none of the really wicked awful ones.
The ability to concentrate quickly and to die uncomfused.
So, some of you know I'm a hospital chaplain and it is no small benefit to die at peace and uncomfused. I can tell you friends from having been with people who have.
And there's, you know, I can't fix what happens for someone at the end of their life but I can engage with them with this loving attentive presence.
And it is such a gift to the person and their loved ones present or not. When that person already has that lack of confusion that loving presence for themselves.
It makes a phenomenal difference at the end.
So, those are my reflections. And the invitation now is to make yourselves comfortable and some kind of posture that balances alertness and relaxation.
I always say please take care to turn off anything that beeps, buzzes, interrupts, alerts, or otherwise, you know, might disturb you.
And I'm changing the settings a little bit.
I don't know why it wasn't allowing participants to start video but if you wanted to start your video now you could.
Just invite you to relax, sit back, enjoy this practice for a little while. As every time that I offer a guided meditation and I'd encourage you actually to do this in any guided meditation.
Please use what works and leave the rest. You don't, you can disregard it if it doesn't work for you.
Starting by relaxing your body, softening and closing the eyes, closing the eyes of comfortable for you.
It's noticing where your body is in space.
It's noticing how your body is kind of feeling their energy, your relaxation, tension, spaciousness.
Maybe a couple of intentional perhaps slightly longer breaths and really letting anything out on the exhale that wants to be released.
It's noticing the internal stance, internal patheter of the heart and mind.
And inviting that to soften, to relax.
One resolve, atitana. May awareness fill this body and mind.
Be kindness and compulsion. Fill this awareness.
Be kindness, compulsion, awareness, factory.
Oh, create all of this body, heart and mind.
And then when our life, your attention to settle. Perhaps to settle on breathing.
The sensations of breathing, if that feels natural and comfortable for you.
Or simply on the sensations of the body. Or on whatever object of awareness feels most speddling and prominent for these first few moments.
Some people find background sound to be helpful.
Knowing attention, arrest, battle.
And inviting in all of this present moment experience.
And moving the breath and body.
Any bits of energy, ulcers of thought, emotion, reaction.
And allowing them to fade into your peripheral awareness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Or perhaps more generally, opening awareness and knowing.
The rising and fading way of sound or sensation.
Thank you.
A little bit into the moment.
The invitation is to call to mind and memory.
And being who you find endearing. Easy, proper kindness, care, compassion to.
Or even just as simple as a being that brings you a sense of joy or affection in an uncomplicated way.
Or a cute fluffy animal, an endearing child.
Anyone or anything that brings a smile to your heart.
Some people find it easier to stay with the idea or concept of this other one.
Or perhaps an image or even a felt sense of them.
We're right here with you now.
Imagining what you find endearing about them.
Not so much conceptually, but just perhaps a notion of their good qualities or virtues.
Or an expression or movement.
Imagining being in rapport with them.
Feeling the response.
Your heart, your body, your mind.
And effortlessly noticing how our response might move through the heart.
Movement of the heart.
Gesture of kindness, friendliness, goodwill.
Another minute, gesture outwards on the out breath.
Receiving what it feels like in the heart.
To the body on the in breath.
I think they're really intentionally focused.
These feelings of kindness.
While wishing.
Passion for any slight difficulties they may have.
Which outwards towards them through this body towards this other one.
Perhaps the out breath.
Imagining radiating these qualities towards them.
Like a gentle soft moist summer breeze.
The glowing gentle luminous light of lantern.
And focus these well wishes, these kind intentions with words.
Using the ones that I offer or any simple words or phrases of your own.
Thank you.
Having a rhythm of net kindness.
Perhaps on the breath.
Perhaps with the words.
I think through all of this body, heart and mind.
Fusing and saturating.
The other one and yourself.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Perhaps facing the healing down your forehead.
Or allowing the mind to come to you.
The feelings of kindness.
Thank you.
Or allowing the intentions of kindness.
Compassion, good wishes.
Full like water.
Radiate like life.
Just like summer breeze out in all directions.
Every part of this heart and mind.
And moving outwards and bounded.
As near or far as feels natural.
Rather than to fall.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Exactly as it is.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Any sense of spaciousness or simplicity or comfort or boundlessness.
All the awareness and allowing kind awareness itself.
The experience.
Or the intention towards kind awareness.
Both are powerful.
So boundless.
And letting go into the awareness at the moment.
When we assume or anything that arises.
Arise within a field of boundlessness.
All the kind regard.
Thank you.
The body, heart and mind.
All the unimpeded.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And in the last moments of this meditation, calling to mind again.
Perhaps the beings in your life, neighbors, friends.
Imagining extending a sense of kindness out through your life.
Through your day, through your night.
That's what that feels in the heart and mind.
Remembering always to encourage yourself.
Thank you.
Thank you for your kind attention, friends.
Before we leave the silence, the invitation is to take a moment
and then kindness to the other people in this Zoom room.
Being or unseen.
If you have trouble turning on your video, the call started with an odd setting.
So just raise your zoom hand and I'll turn it on for you.
Just taking a moment to take in your fellow sangha mate.
For them kindness.
We had just a moment or two for some short reflections of anyone wants to share
how this meditation was for you.
I did notice someone.
Thank you, Jamie for your text for letting me know about sound.
I'm afraid the sound was more challenging than usual tonight.
I had some background noise and I think my microphone over filtered.
Hopefully you got the spirit of it, the tone of the words yours and anyone else's
sometimes conveys as much or more about Mehta as the content.
Any thoughts.
My lens is okay too.
Just one last reflection on my part here about this.
As I was saying a moment ago about the sound.
The tone of voice is something really powerful to consider.
In our meditation practice.
So many of us have been conditioned with habits of inner criticism or harshness.
And it can be really helpful to notice the tone.
Of whatever thoughts are happening internally.
To notice my saying, may I be happy as if it's a chore or requirement or an obligation.
Or am I saying it in a loving, kind understanding way.
I was listening to a neuroscientist recently and he said that.
Most of what relaxes our nervous system in terms of.
Picking up receiving a sense of affection or feeling felt or kindness actually comes from the tone of the words and not the words themselves.
So, we know this from talking to babies and some animals, right?
So just an invitation to consider your internal voice and perhaps external tone of voice to.
Now, the invitation is for those who want to do some relational kindness practice.
The favorite part of this happy hour evening for a lot of people.
And if you don't want to, you're welcome to stay in the main room and just meditate silently until we come back together.
I'm going to explore with each other, maybe how this practice might influence your own way of being, either with yourself or with other people and that can be tone of voice or it can be more broadly.
Way of walking into a room, way of listening, way of engaging.
Just to explore that with each other. And if that prompt doesn't work for you, you're welcome to choose the way to talk about your practice, your meditation practice.
But please be mindful and keep each sharing a little bit short so that everybody gets a chance and maybe you can go around more than once and deepen each other's sharing that way.
So, see you back here in about seven, eight minutes.
Seven minutes.
You will get a warning at six minutes, and then you'll have another 60 seconds.
See you soon friends.
That was funny because I said Morgan, I said, Oh, we've lost her and then I go and I click leave as well.
I didn't think I even clicked. It's good to have you here.
So nice to be here. I was going to say I just you said last week about the best, the most regulating thing is another human being.
You said that on Monday. Yes, and I keep thinking about that. So thank you for your things. Appreciate you.
Thank you.
Can you repeat, can you repeat what she said Don, I couldn't.
And you were breaking up a little more than I think your bandwidth is low but she's referring to a quote that I quoted Lisa Feldman there at a neuropsychologist, a neuroscientist who has this quote the best thing for a human nervous system is another human being.
And she also says in fairness I did not get this quote last time the worst thing for human nervous system is also another human being.
I got points to the choice that we have right, like being good sangha mates being fellow practitioners being, you know, kind in our hearts we can actually show up for each other in a way that we have a palpable presence for each other.
Yeah, any comments on that or any reflections from your breakout room or the meditation or earlier. Love to hear what is on people's minds. Yes, Peter.
What you said reminded me of another saying as well as a follow on to it. And that's saying as hell as other people.
And so we can say heaven is other people.
We sure can right.
And it reminds me of a saying my mother used to say which wasn't relating to that but she would say you know, something like there are a lot of Matt, what is it.
Well basically there are a lot of mackerel in the sea there aren't all like beautiful.
Boy, there's like a lot of and so you have to find like there are times where you think I'll call so and so but you know that that's going to be hard on your nervous system.
So you postpone that call because that one, you know, is more challenging so.
Thank you, Deborah.
Nancy you've got your hand up and then Melissa after you please.
We were reflecting in our group about
being overworked and liking to rest and I was reflecting on
before I quit working before I got sick that my tone of voice that I used very intentionally in my work was often
very very accusatory, very threatening, very intimidating.
And, you know, if I were to go back to that type of work. Again, I probably would practice very differently.
But learning to take that tone out of my vocabulary, so to speak is has been really freeing and
actually the gentle being able to really express the more gentle side.
It's been a very healthy exercise.
Beautiful.
Beautiful. Thank you so much for that.
And what a profound thing to notice about your own way of being internally and externally right because they're related.
Melissa, please.
Okay, I'm going to try and share this without.
When you spoke about the words that the way we speak the words to ourselves other words of loving kindness.
It reminded me of probably 25 years ago when I first came to the phrases of loving kindness and that's how I first started meditation.
And you know, like, I wanted it so bad.
You know, I wanted those things for myself so bad.
And this, but the seed was there, you know, but the way I said the words to myself at that time, there was a harshness to it.
But still, the seed was there, you know, the seed was there.
And now I think like we were speaking about this in our group to the way that you teach it with like with just dropping the words and coming into a sensation and honestly tonight I fell asleep and I knew I was going to I was so tired.
But I came anyway because I knew just being held in it, and that's a kindness to right the harshness was all gone I knew.
I knew it was okay.
So what I fall asleep I'm going to be here and held in Metta right, but my point is that the way that I don't so I don't know maybe didn't do it tonight.
I'm getting a bit longer than I'm sorry, but the way that I know you did on Monday that you create a space to have a feeling and then we hold ourselves in that feeling.
For me that creates a softness to where I don't have to be so like pointed with the words, you know.
But I still have like a tenderness towards that part of me, 25 years ago that wanted that wanted, you know, may I be kind may I please be kind right, because it wasn't there yet but yeah the seed was there.
Yeah, but it took it took a long time to get here.
Yeah, such a beautiful reflection.
What you're saying just makes my heart light up. It's like, and it's such a good reminder like those seeds are there in the intention.
Even if there's harshness, even if it's dry, even if we're distracted. If we fall asleep, whatever it is, it still works it works even when it doesn't feel like it's working because that intention is such a powerful conditioning on the heart and mind.
It's a kindness just to have the intention to be kind.
And, yes, I did teach it that way tonight.
Just by the way, it's a way that really works for this heart and mind so I like to share it that way because it, I feel like it gives more permission for all of us to come up, whatever parts of our hearts, minds, bodies, psychies and want to be there can just be held in that.
And we're all holding it for each other in this group, which is one of the beautiful things about the happy hour of Sangha.
So thank you all for your practice. It's a real honor and privilege and joy to be with this Sangha.
Everyone, thank you for your presence. Thank you for your time and your practice most especially may all beings benefit from this practice. May it flow and ripple out and may all beings be peaceful, happy, safe and free.
Thank you again for your kind attention and I'll see some of you next Wednesday.
Thank you Don. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all you lovely people. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you everybody.
Bye. Thanks so much. Do it again. Thank you Don. Thank you. You all.
