 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's very nice to be meditating with other human beings together in a room. It feels pretty wild. We're living on the edge. Are you able to hear me? Okay, yeah. I had more appreciation, I was thinking during the meditation, I had more appreciation for what my children go through at school because they were in elementary school and they wear a mask all day. And I don't wear a mask all day just to go into a store or do something. And so it's quite an interesting thing. But I think that they've gotten used to it. There's some way that kids are so resilient and they just adapt and adjust. And it's normal, it's the new normal in a way until it isn't and then will change. But I'm grateful that we can be together and even given the limitations and say hello to all of our friends who are watching online. It's also been such a gift to have YouTube and Zoom. And I really couldn't imagine doing Dharma teaching over the computer before all of this. But then you're like, huh, actually works pretty well. And I appreciate the accessibility of it. There's something wonderful to be live in person and you kind of have a certain energy of each other or in a meditation retreat to be with each other and kind of encouraging each other. But not all of us can get to a center or retreat center and there may be physical challenges or just life. Parents of young children, it's very hard to go away, to go overnight. So maybe one of the blessings of all of this is to have opened things up a little bit more. I wanted to share this morning a little bit about, well, the talk, we'll see what it ends up being, but was inspired by this quote that I came across. And it's from the writer Guy Davenport. And we hear a lot about the science of meditation. And it's very, very interesting research that's happening and neurology, neuroscience, imaging, MRIs. And this is kind of the world we live in. And so there's a way that when something starts to be backed up by science, you know, science is kind of our religion, right, in the West. So one of our religions. So when something starts to be validated by science, then it opens certain doors. And it's a good thing, maybe. But this is not a quote about that. So this is maybe the other side, which is the art of practice or the art of meditation. And I don't know if Guy Davenport was a meditator, but he was a writer, an intellectual. And so he says, art is always the replacement of indifference by attention. And I think there's a way for me that this sort of sums up our practice. And maybe also could perhaps be a bridge connecting the sort of formal sitting practice or meditation practice. With our life. It's often a question that we have, okay, I come to IMC or a Zen center or somewhere and meditate. And that's good. But how do I bring this into my life? And so this idea that art, maybe the art of living or the art of Dharma, is always the replacement of indifference by attention. And what it made me think of is that there can be a certain kind of aesthetic, a certain kind of form of Dharma, of Buddhist practice. For those of you here at IMC, we have a certain form here. There's a certain, there's a kind of the Buddha and just the kind of the way this place is set up. And we're pretty casual here. I don't know if you've spent much time in Japanese temples or Zen places, but there's quite a strong aesthetic, right? There's usually this spare wooden floor, kind of like the floor out there or something, just this simple wooden floor and white walls and black cushions. So I was thinking when I was driving here, I was walking in the building, it's like, oh, how much I've missed these forms. There's something, I think there's something powerful about being in a place that is dedicated to awareness, to wakefulness, to compassion. And there's something in that aesthetic, in those forms that's transmitted. It's like I could just sort of feel my nervous system rearranging. It's like, oh yeah, let's remember this place. I remember when I first started doing Zen practice, there was something mesmerizing about... So in Zen, there's usually a priest who will... everybody's sitting already and then the bell rings and then the priest comes in and offers incense and bows to the Buddha and then he just does a few things. But I remember just this, I'd sit and I'd wait and then slowly the door would open and you could hear the door and you'd hear the rustle of the teacher's robes. And the students were all facing the wall. So you're not exactly watching this. Sometimes you are, it just depends on the situation. But there is something kind of mesmerizing about it and the smell of the incense. So there are these certain forms, it's a kind of an aesthetic. Different cultures have different... I don't think there's anything particularly sanctified about one or the other. Different cultures, different groups, different traditions have their own forms. One of the things that took me a long time to get my head wrapped around with Zen practice was it seemed so particular and nitpicky. You don't bow like this. You have to bow like this. And then you have to correct you. So you have to put your elbows up when you bow. Okay, okay. And then you don't enter the meditation hall. I'm trying to remember. You don't enter with your left foot first. You enter with your right foot first. So this is like, okay. Okay. And some of them were lovely. Some of these forms are really lovely. And so, I think that's a very, whenever you would pass someone on the road, you know, kind of the path, the form was you don't, hey, you don't turn to them and say, hey, what's up? How are you doing? You pass them, and when you get to about level with them, you each bow silently. It's a very lovely thing. And it's a kind of acknowledge the other person. You're not stopping to chat. You're not asking anything of them. But it's this, you know, it's this kind of harmony. Here at harmony, you meet each other. And so, of course, there's a form for that. But these forms can feel strange at first. And it can feel like, I remember being exasperated. It was so random. Why the left foot? Why not the left foot? Why the right foot? But after I was away for years from Zen temples, and then when I went back one morning in San Francisco for a Saturday morning talk, and I couldn't believe how emotional I felt smelling the incense, the bow, and everyone kind of, they do a service, people kind of line up, and there's a certain circling kind of like a mandala. And I felt really emotional. And there was a kind of poignancy to that. And it was, oh wow, these went in in a kind of deep way. And even though I just grumbled the whole time, oh God, why do we have to sit here like this? And there's a certain very uncomfortable Japanese way of sitting, which is called seiza. I think it's uncomfortable. Most people think it's uncomfortable. After a while, I think everyone will be uncomfortable. But it's like sitting on your knees on a hard surface. Sounds nice. And so you sit like that for service, and so all the chanting, you know. But I even enjoyed that, you know. And so what I want to say about these forms, and so here at IMC, we have our own forms, and our own way of doing things, and our own way of being together. But you kind of expect if you come here, there's going to be a meditation, someone's going to ring the bell, people are going to be, treat each other in a certain way, there'll be some teaching. You know, we have our own forms, and our own rhythms. And what I wanted to say about these forms is that, you know, in one way, there's something very wonderful and helpful about ritual, you know. And it doesn't have to be a kind of exotic ritual, or something that feels, wow, that's so, for me, incense, was wow, that's, you know. But just the value of ritual, the value of doing something again and again, and that there's a kind of safety, I think, in that kind of predictability. I think of my children, and I think children in general are like this, that children really thrive on predictability and stability and routine. We have our routine for everything. There's a routine for getting ready for school in the morning. There's a routine for going to bed. There's a routine for, you know, and we do the same things, we brush our teeth, and take a bath, and this, this, this, the story. And before I had kids, I would have thought, oh my God, I can't imagine doing the same thing every day. You know, that sounds so boring. But I have to say that I delight in these routines. I kind of look forward to them. You know, I have my own routines. I make a coffee in the morning, and that's a routine, right? And you have to, you know, do my exercise, or do my this, or my that. But there's a way that, because we've set up these forms, we can relax. It's not like we have to reinvent the wheel. Oh my God, how are we going to get from here to there, and get the kids dressed and fed and blah, blah, blah. No, we know how we're, everyone does their thing. They unload the dish, they're supposed to unload the dishwasher. Feed the dog. We do this. We do that. And because we know what we're going to do, we can relax. And there's a part of us that can just let go into that. We're not thinking so much about what we're going to do. So ideally, doesn't always play out like this, but ideally, we can, you know, we can let go a little bit, and we can appreciate, you know, this moment, what we're doing now. I don't want to worry about the next thing. I know what's going to happen. And so there can be a tremendous benefit to the ritualization of life. You know, and I think in a Buddhist monastery, they have taken this to the tenth degree or whatever, you know, in the classical texts, I think for monks in our tradition. There's something like, I don't know, 200, 300 rules that a monk has to follow, a nun has to follow. There's a way to wash your face. There's a way to wear your robes. There's a way to walk. Why? You know, it's not because there's some universal absolute best way to wash your face. And if you do that, you're going to, you know, whatever, get some great karma. It's that I think when life is imbued with a sense of ritual, then there's something that gets elevated. It's not just this random, oh, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. And this is one of the things I realized in the monastery is it's like each of these forms serves to bring us into the moment. So you don't just barge in to the meditation room. Boom, you know, schlep end. So there's what you stop. And at least for me, I had to look down and think, because my right and my left are a perpetual mystery to me. Oh yeah, walk in on this. You know, and there's a way that these forms help us to be aware. And we don't just plop down on the meditation cushion. You kind of, you know, in that tradition, you bow to the cushion, you turn around, you bow to the room. And there's a way that all of this ritual and these forms and this aesthetic, it sort of elevates the ordinary. What's something that's ordinary that we don't even think about, we never think about? Well, you have to think about it because there's a way to do it. And so little by little, I came to appreciate just the ways that through form, through ritual, through repetition, it helps us to be more conscious. What's been on autopilot sort of becomes conscious. And then at a certain point, and this is very nice, it's like it becomes second nature. So now for us, when it's time for the kids to go to bed, we know what to do. It's second nature. We're not trying to figure out, oh, should we brush our teeth tonight? Well, maybe, maybe, maybe it's a good idea. I mean, maybe not. I don't know. This is what we do. This is what we do. So, and so after spending some time in these training places, in these monasteries, when I went back to my life, in one sense, there was this great sense of relief and freedom. Okay, I don't have to wake up at four in the morning. I don't have to do this. I don't have to sit like this and someone's watching. But a funny thing kind of happened. It was like I started to see or appreciate a little bit, what I like to think of as the forms of everyday life. Is there some way that we can look at our life, look at our space, our home, our routine? Is there some way that this can be elevated, this can be seen as kind of a practice? It's a form. It's one of the things I love. I don't know if they still do that, but I know my kids in their previous school, they lined up. One of the forms was all the children lined up. And when they entered the classroom, they shook the teacher's hand. They're probably, I'm sure they don't do it now because they're not. No kisses, no handshakes. But they would shake the teacher's hand and look at the teacher in the eye and say, good morning, good morning. You're in this kind of meeting, this meeting, this form. And it's a little thing. They could have just all ran into the room chaotically. But there's this kind of moment, this moment of meeting. And so what are the forms in our life that we can in some way bring this kind of care and bring this recognition that there's an opportunity here? Sometimes when I'm lucky, I think about this when I'm driving. Driving is a great example because almost always we're driving in order to go somewhere. There's a utility to it. And we can be so focused on where we're going, like I'm late and this and that, that there's almost no attention paid to how am I right now? How am I driving? How am I wielding this awesome responsibility of being in this weapon basically? How am I caring for all the other drivers on the road and the pedestrians and the bicyclists and the animals? There's a lot going on when we drive. And sometimes I'll see someone who's a child who looks really young but who's on a bicycle and the bicycle's kind of, and they're bicycling to school or bicycling home from school. And I just feel this wave of tenderness. It's like, oh, right, oh yeah. This is sacred. This is a sacred responsibility I have right now. And what is it to just, you know, just let that resonate. And it changes me. It changes how I relate to driving. You know, with that feeling, it's like, oh, I want to take care of this person, this child. I want to, you know, and sometimes, you know, sometimes I listen to the radio or the news or something when I'm driving. But sometimes I turn it off and there's this wonderful silence. And it's, I often feel like, you know, I don't know if meditation gives anyone mind reading powers. I once asked my Zen teacher, can you read minds? And he said, I can read Dick Cheney's mind. This was a while ago. But when I'm driving and there's silence and it feels like I'm harmonizing with the car and harmonizing with the road. And then I'm aware of the other drivers and I can kind of perceive what they're going to do before they do it. Right? You know, people, there's this sort of, okay, this person's going to probably try to get over. Or this, you know, or that person looks really distracted or this, you know, you sort of just, there's a whole other way of knowing that I think we can often miss. You know, if I'm caught up in some story or idea or listening to something, that intuition is sort of, it's a little bit covered over by the kind of conceptual mind. So, you know, this idea of the forms of everyday life. And then I think, you know, so maybe we could say that to see our life as form or ritual, you know, has certain benefits and brings us into the moment, perhaps makes us more aware, more conscious. But then I think the perhaps the most powerful way of understanding ritual and understanding this idea of kind of repetition and form is what is it to, I don't know exactly how to say this, but to separate form, little bit of separating form from function. Usually we think of the form, the purpose of the form is to, you know, the reason we drive is to get somewhere. But this idea of, while acknowledging, yes, we're going to drive to get somewhere, what is it to totally let go into the experience of driving? And I think there's a different way of relating to it when it's not merely a means to an ends. You know, a great example with, you know, children, it's like, yes, there's children go to school to learn different skills, to build those skills and to be, you know, functioning adults. But I don't think it's accurate to say the purpose of a child is to become an adult. You know, a child is a child, a child is perfectly a child. And is in this moment is perfectly expressing who they are. They are totally occupying the form of childhood. They're going to have the hopes of a child, the dreams of a child, the awareness of a child. And that's not wrong. That's not incomplete. There's actually something perfect about that. And so, so what about meditation? You know, is meditation, is it like driving a car? And we're driving, when we meditate, we're driving to, I don't know, where? Enlightenment? A perfect calm mind, an empty mind, compassion. You know, maybe, maybe those will be destinations for us. But maybe the deeper meaning of meditation is not so much as a vehicle for something else, but as its own expression, its own complete expression in this moment. When we sit, when we're here, when we're breathing, that's enough. That's totally perfect in itself. It's not like we breathe and breathe and we're breathing to get to the, to where? You know, the end, or to get to some perfect breath. It's like, no, the form is, is the function. When we take this posture and take a breath and let go of our preoccupations, this is it. You know? There's no moment in the future where we'll be more alive than we are right now. We're already here. We're already alive. We're already present. And so I think the great mystery and paradox and gift and invitation of Dharma practice is to accept what we already have. You know? We're always so preoccupied with what we don't have and what's over there and what we could have had. And we really don't see this amazing treasure, this amazing gift that's already here. So art is always the replacement of indifference by attention, the shift. These moments that have been ignored have been, well, that doesn't matter. That doesn't count. That's just, you know, these, these get blessed with awareness, with care, with kindness, with love, with attention. You know, attention is such a powerful form of love. I think that must be why we love dogs so much. You know, I'll just be in my own dream world and then all of a sudden I'll notice, someone's just looking at me and gazing at me, waiting for a treat or something, but you're ready to go play. But I'll just look, my dog, you're just looking at me. You know? And so what is it to bless all of these moments of our life with this attention? I'll just share one more quote from Guy Davenport. He said something, again, talking about art. Art is the attention we pay to the wholeness of the world. So that idea of appreciating the wholeness and appreciating each moment, each thing, this great, great gift of this practice. Thank you. Thank you very much. Do we do questions? You're welcome to stand up and stretch, but if you have to go, but if anyone would like to make a comment or a question, please feel free. I don't know if we're going to pass a mic or I could also just repeat the question if you have something. Yeah, you can do it. Yeah, I'll repeat. Okay, yeah, so just to repeat, just appreciating the reminder to accept how life is right now versus being caught up in ideas about the future. Yeah, yeah, thank you very much. I think it can be one of the great insights of meditation to begin to notice how much we think about the future. And then there can be another insight on top of that. All those thoughts I had about the future. The future was totally different, never worked out that way, you know, or maybe sometimes it does, but I appreciate that. And we can realize that thinking about the future is something that happens in the present moment. It's just another something that we can notice. It's probably important to think about the future, you know, it's an important function of a person to be able to do that. But in meditation, we just get to notice, okay, how is this operating for me? I notice for myself, thoughts about the future sometimes can be fueled by an emotion like fear. Like I'm worried about this, and I'm going to think about it and nail it down the way I want it to be. So just to notice, just to notice all of it. I remember I once asked one of my teachers who was about to give a big talk, just a Dharma talk, but it seemed very big to me because of a room of like a hundred people or more in this very formal setting. And I was walking with him down the stairs on his way to give the talk. And I think because I couldn't imagine, I mean, I sort of put myself in his position, I thought I'd be out of my mind with fear, going to give a talk, you know, public speaking or something. I just couldn't, you know, I couldn't imagine it. So I asked him, I said something like, you know, just sort of blurted out. I said, are you thinking about your talk? You know, or something. And he kind of laughed and he said, I'm just walking down the stairs. You know, it is a great teaching. It's great, you know, like even if we're heading into, you know, whatever it is, something where, you know, the dentist chair, that can be, you know, people can be nervous about that, right? Or whatever it is. It's like, but right now I'm just walking in, you know, I don't have to worry about that. I'm just doing what I'm doing. And it was this great, you know, the more practice we have to just do what we're doing. And then it's like things, you know, like what we were worried about, maybe, you know, just takes care of itself in a way. So thank you. Good to see you. Nice. Did everybody hear that? Just talking about the idea of ritual and just seeing our kind of morning routine through the lens of ritual. You know, and yeah, I think it's something that we can sort of play with and experiment with and see what brings us joy. What are the rituals that I, a friend recently posted something about. They were making coffee with an automatic machine and then had the idea to get out the stuff to do the kind of hand pouring. And he said, oh my God, if we've been missing this taste, you know, all these years and it was so, so beautiful to just take the time and do this. And so yeah, I think, you know, as much as our life can allow us, there's something wonderful about that. For me, this is a way of bringing a kind of meditative perspective, into what's our, we're going to be making coffee anyway. We're going to be driving the kids to school anyway. How can we, how can we savor this and perceive it's, what is sacred about it? What is special about it? I think maybe when we have some kind of encounter with the fragility of life, you know, the mortality, the preciousness of time, there can be this, these ordinary moments that I've just been on autopilot are so special. You know, I want to savor them. I already see that my children are, you know, they're nine and seven, they're baby too, but like the nine and seven year old, they're sort of like, they're going on like 35 or something, you know, they're all kind of on their way. And it's like, oh, I remember when they were a little younger, a little more innocent, a little more. And so for me, it's just this, just this reminder to appreciate this, because this is going to change. This is going to be no, we don't know how, we don't know when, but this is going to change to something else. And to just appreciate this. Thank you very much. I really appreciated your talk today and found that it was continually bringing me back to the present. Last night I got a phone call from a very dear friend that her husband, who had been suffering from dementia, had died a couple of days prior. And so I found myself, you know, I sent out word to many of our former coworkers to let them know and found my mind going back to memories of this very kind and gentle man, and then forward to attending the funeral and so forth. So from the past to the future. And I appreciated your talk bringing me back to the present. And it's, I guess there's nothing like the fragility of life, as you said, to help us recognize that someday we too will not be here. Thank you very much. Thank you. I just want to echo back what you said about shifting the attention. Particularly earlier after you said that I recognize how we can shift that attention and change the way how we relate to the world and all things. And when I look up outside this tree by the window, wow, this tree I've been here many times, very ordinary tree, but all of a sudden I feel a very different feeling towards it. And how you talk about seeing kids on the street riding their bicycles, how often we see that, but we don't really think much of it other than we were in our head. And how the whole essence of being mindful, being the present, the enlightenment that we are seeking all the time isn't to be on the clock night, it's just this mundane daily moments when we can actually get in touch. So very beautiful. I really appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you very much. Thank you. I mean it's the, I think this shift in perspective is like the, this is the pivot point of dharma, of Buddhism. It's like we're not, it's like nothing changes, but everything changes. When we have that shift, we're able to, oh, see these things I never saw before, but they were always right here. And what a gift to bring that awareness, that shift into our life, into our relationships, into our work. It's like, this is like one millimeter shift or something, but thank you. This is more of a comment, but that something that has helped me is actually to have gratitude, like when making tea or coffee, to actually say thank you to the water. If I actually pay attention to water and how much I use it, but to just say thank you to the water, I say thank you to the gas stove and the gas water heater. It's like, okay, gas. Oh, that's petrochemicals. But just having a sense of, okay, this tea kettle, it's metal, where'd that come from the earth? Where'd the gas come from the earth? And just taking things back, but yeah, trying to take it back to having a sense of looking at, you know, what's making this tea. Okay, herb spices, where'd they come from? The earth. Farmer's son. It's a cycle, but it really helps bring me back on necessarily maybe mundane things. Washing fruit again. Oh, there's hot water again. Yeah, it's a simple thing, but it helps my brain. Beautiful, beautiful. Yeah, I mean, this is gratitude, gratitude practice, and it's appropriate for our Thanksgiving holiday, and just appreciating the interconnectedness of things. When my kids leave food or rice, you know, don't eat everything in the bowl, because I tell them, they kind of roll their eyes, a farmer spent a whole year to grow that one grain of rice, and just think about that. So, right, I love it. And I think it's easy to not think about that in that mindset. So, thank you. Thanks for the talk, and I really enjoyed and appreciated the discussion of forming new rituals and kind of paying attention and creating new routines that allow a sense of safety and security and stability. And I'll just say, for me, meditation, so much of it has been about letting go of habits and kind of undoing the automatized way of being. And so, I'm hearing that meditation, paying attention, can help really create new habits or ways of relating, like in an intentional way. But it also, such a big part of it, at least for me, has been undoing habits and undoing those routines and just not automatically going to the next thing. And so, that's kind of a paradox, but I was wondering if you could just say a little bit about that. It's interesting. Thank you. It's a great observation, and I think, you know, I sort of think that as a human being, we depend on habits. You know, we're always forming habits. We're always practicing something, whether we realize it or not. So, it's exactly what you said. It's like being conscious about the habits that we're creating. Everything we do, you know, we're priming ourselves to do it again. If I lash out in anger, not only am I, or impatience or something, not only am I angry in that moment, but I'm creating that groove, that pathway. So, the next time, it may be more likely that I'll kind of have the same reaction. So, I think just that acknowledgement that we're sort of like habit making machines. Everything we do is sort of setting in place for that to happen. It's more likely that will happen again. So then, what are the habits we want to establish? And what are the habits that, as you said, aren't useful, aren't helpful? Maybe we inherited in some way from our own background and say, well, I always do that. I never decided to do that. It's not really good for me to do that. And so, I love it. And I think that, you know, I was saying, even with these, for me, very awkward, random-seeming rituals in the monastery, at a certain point, even they become second nature when you're there. It's like, oh, it's something you do. And there's almost, it's not a bad thing that it becomes second nature, but the danger is we lose our awareness. But the good thing is, when it becomes second nature, we can really, I don't know, I want to use the word individuate. It's like, if you know, so I'm in the process of learning Tai Chi. And so Tai Chi is just like these 37 postures. So there's a kind of choreography that you have to learn first. But that's just the beginning. I mean, that takes years to learn for me. We have got time, right? So you learn the choreography. So one way of thinking, you usually say, okay, I'm done. I learned it. But actually, that's just the beginning. Once you know the choreography, then you really get into it. You really feel the energy. You understand how do I shift the weight? How do I, you know, there's a kind of personalization to it and it becomes alive. So once, you know, maybe in a way, once we establish these habits, then we bring them to life. And we're not so much thinking about, okay, which foot do I, you know, it's like driving a car. We don't think about it anymore, the mechanics of it, but there's still so much there to, you know, such a practice. So, yeah, thank you very much. Okay, well, appreciate seeing you and being here. Yeah, be well. Have a good holiday. Thank you.
