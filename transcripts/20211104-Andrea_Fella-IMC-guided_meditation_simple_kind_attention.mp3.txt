 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. That might be the breath for you. It might be just a sense of the body sitting here. It might be a broader sense of just aware or knowing yourself here and now. So whatever is easy in terms of remembering that you're here in this moment. It's almost like a gentle landing that we allow our minds and bodies to come together. We can sometimes feel like our minds are kind of out there and scattered. And so it can feel like a gathering or settling or a landing of the mind in the body with the body. And so not trying to force that, but just connecting with whatever's simple, easy to connect with. It may be something obvious in your physical experience. But just the breathing or the posture, a broader sense of the body sitting. Or maybe an energetic experience of the body, a vibration, a pulsing, a tingling throughout the body. With the body as a body. Simple. And also perhaps recognizing or taking in that hearing is happening. Again, really simply. The sounds in your space. The sound of my voice might be a distant hum of a refrigerator or maybe if there's not a particular sound in your space, just one of the internal sounds in your body. Sometimes we hear a high-pitched tone when there's not a lot of other sounds. Hearing as hearing. No need to make more of it. It's just sound happening and being heard. Can it be that simple? The landing mind and body together here. Maybe also recognizing or taking in the mood or tone in the mind. Again, in a simple way, what's obvious about how you are in this moment. Are you tired? At ease? Scattered? Settled? Nothing. Outside of the realm of what's possible to be known, we can know scatteredness. No tiredness. And not have to try to fix it or change it, but just kind of landing with how you are. I sometimes talk about mindfulness, this kind of connection with experience. It's like a dear friend checking in with you. How are you right now? This dear friend not wanting to change you, but just to really understand how you are. Mindfulness can be that sort of connection with ourselves. And it can really feel very friendly, very intimate, and quite nourishing to be met in this way. Just meeting yourself as you are right now. Sometimes as we explore this possibility of meeting ourselves as we are, we might notice that something can relax or... It's like that friend, you know, when we're really met with somebody. It's like, oh, I can just be myself right now. Sometimes just this landing with ourselves can bring a movement in the direction of relaxation. And if you notice that, just kind of take that in. If you're not noticing that, take whatever that is in. However you are, it's okay. As we land with ourselves in the present moment, experience may change. Whatever feels most obvious or easy to connect with may shift depending on the conditions of what's happening in your space, what's happening in your body and mind. And so we don't have to hang on tightly to any one experience as if this is what it means to be present, to be with this experience. If the attention is shifting from one thing to another, see if it can be okay for the mindfulness to kind of follow along where that shift is. Again, kind of with the friend analogy, describing what's happening for you, it might be that something arises and it's like, well, this is now what's happening. And my dear friend might be just willing to go on that ride, not have to hold back and get the answers about what was there before, but just, oh, this is what's here now. Let's see if I can be with that. And so the attention with mindfulness, practicing mindfulness in this kind of receptive, allowing way, we have to have a particular object or home base for our mindfulness. It can be that the mindfulness kind of follows the attention, whatever's most obvious. Oh, this is what's here now. Just receiving, kind of receiving whatever wants to be seen. Again, with that sense of care and connection and friendliness, oh, this wants to be seen right now. Even things that we think sometimes are out of our realm of practice, thoughts arising, well, we can know, oh, there's a lot of thinking happening right now. Or perhaps a strong emotion coming up. This is what it's like to be a human being feeling that. This is what it's like to be friendly with that experience too. To be that friend that accepts and allows us to be who we are in this moment without judgment, without reactivity as we are. And for some of us, this approach or exploration of allowing the changing experience can feel a little ungrounded, a little chaotic. You could try just noticing that part. You could try that. That might be an approach. Oh, it's chaotic. There's a lot going on in here. That might allow a kind of a settling or a knees. And it's also fine if it feels supportive or more easeful for you to connect with something, direct your attention to something simple in the present moment like the breath or hearing. Just narrow down the field of mindfulness. That's fine. For some, that open, non-directing of awareness can feel more easeful and for some, holding to a simple object can feel more easeful. Letting that kind of where it's most natural, easeful be a guide for your practice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
