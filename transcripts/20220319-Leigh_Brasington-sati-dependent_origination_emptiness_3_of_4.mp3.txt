The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in
Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org.
Well, everybody's getting back. I thought I'd share with you something I learned
earlier this week. So Sati, that's the word we usually translate as mindfulness,
right? And usually what you find is something like it originally meant
memory, Sanskrit, Samaritan. And I think that's correct. But it turns out,
there's another way that Sati can show up. It can show up as the
locative past participle of the word to be. And so, yeah, I don't know exactly
what a locative past participle is, has something to do with location.
Anyhow, it could be something, well, if we looked at the four elements as
mindfulness practice, you could say, using Sati, Sati Earth would be
there is Earth, there being Earth, actually, there being Earth, there
being water, there being fire, there being air. So Sati has a sense of
remembering to be here now, but it also has a sense of recognizing what's
going on right here. There being Earth, there being fire, etc. Just a little
tidbit to throw out while everybody gets settled again at their computer.
Okay. So the next thing I want to talk about is middle length discourse
number 38, which is, excuse me, the greater discourse on the destruction
of craving. And it's the chapter in my book on page 48 of the PDF, Sati
the son of the fisherman. Again, if you don't have page numbers, you can scroll
back to the table of contents and perhaps you can click on Sati the son
of the fisherman, but you probably don't need much from it. It's not
really going to be giving you charts and so forth, just a little bit from it
and I'll put it in the chat. Now, one thing I definitely need to say at
the beginning is that one of the most important things to bring on the
spiritual path is being comfortable with, I don't know. I mean, if you're
not comfortable with, I don't know, then you'll have to just come up with
anything so that you're not uncomfortable. It really is important that if you
don't know that, yeah, okay, you don't know. I mean, for everything you know, I
could generate a dozen things that you don't know very easily, like what's
going on in the equator at noon and the nearest inhabited planet to Beetlejuice
or, I mean, there's just so much we don't know. And so it's really important
to be comfortable with that because otherwise you just start grabbing on to
some idea to make you not uncomfortable. And in so doing, you start cleaning to
that idea and, yeah, you lost your open mind that's really necessary for
advancement on the spiritual path. Now, the reason I say this is because I
don't know what happens when we die. I got no memory of ever having died. I
seen lots of supposed evidence, but none that I find 100% reliable. So, yeah,
it's just in the I don't know category. I don't know what happens when we die.
I'll find out, or maybe I won't, but, you know, at some point, something will
happen. So that's the preface to this Suta. As I said, it's the Suta on the
destruction of craving. And it's actually two different discourses jammed
together to make one Suta. The first discourse is on the destruction of
Bhava Tanha. Bhava Tanha would be craving for becoming. And then the second
discourse is the destruction of Kamma Tanha, craving for sensual pleasures.
The craving for becoming actually has two aspects to it. One aspect would be
craving for becoming something in this life. So I'm craving to become rich and
famous, or I'm craving to become whatever you want to fill in, right? So this
life becoming. It's not so much a sensual pleasure or anything, but just you
want to become something. There's V Bhava Tanha. You don't want to become
something. I don't want to become sick with COVID, right? So they could be
craving of V Bhava Tanha as well. And both V Bhava Tanha and Bhava Tanha are
setups for Dukha. So we need to overcome these cravings as well as overcome
craving for Kamma Tanha, craving for sensual pleasures. But both of these
Bhava Tanha and V Bhava Tanha could be craving in terms of your next life.
In my next life, I want to be reborn in a family that has a Mercedes Benz,
or I want to be reborn as a Deva, or whatever, right? So you have some idea
of what you're going to become in your next life and you're craving for that
to happen. Or, excuse me, that was the basic idea behind the dominant
spiritual paradigm at the time of the Buddha, Brahmanism. But Brahmans were
craving to be reborn in union with Brahma. They wanted to become in union
with Brahma. Now the Jains, which was another large spiritual group at the
time of the Buddha, they were craving for not becoming. They were so intent on
not doing any action that would have karmic resultants that the best thing
you could do as a Jain would be to starve yourself to death. Not a really
useful thing to do. I highly recommend against that. But they were so
afraid of, yeah, whatever they were going to become in their next life,
that they were craving not to become. So like I said, I don't know what happens
when you die. But Sati thought he knew. He thought that his consciousness
would transmigrate to another incarnation. A number of monks heard this
and they said to Sati, is this true? Is this what you think the Buddha teaches?
And Sati said, yes, as I understand the Dhamma talk by the Blessed One is this
same consciousness which roams and wanders through the rounds of rebirth,
not another. And the monk said, do not say that, Sati. The Blessed One has said
on many occasions that consciousness is dependently originated. But Sati,
even though he was questioned and cross-questioned by those monks, refused
to give up his pernicious view. So the monks went to see the Buddha,
saluted, sat down on one side, told him all that he had transpired. And the
Buddha said to one of the monks, tell Sati the master calls. So that monk
went to find Sati, friend Sati, the master calls. And so Sati went to see the
Buddha, saluted, sat down on one side. Sitting there, the Buddha said to him,
Sati, is it true that you think what I teach is that this consciousness
roams and wanders through the rounds of rebirth, not another. Yes,
Venerable Sir, as I understand the Dhamma that you teach, this very
consciousness roams and wanders through the rounds of rebirth, not another.
Sati, what is consciousness? Venerable Sir, consciousness is that which
thinks and feels and experiences here and there the results of good and
bad actions. Consciousness is that which speaks and feels and experiences
here and there the results of good and bad actions. So what do you think of
Sati's definition of consciousness? Think that's good? You like that
definition? The Buddha responded, you foolish man, when have you ever known
me to teach anything like that? For on many occasions, I have said that
consciousness is dependently originated. But you misrepresent us and store up
much demerit that will be for your harm and suffering for a long time.
Monks, do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this Bhikkhu Sati
tells it? No, Venerable Sir, for on many occasions you have explained that
consciousness is dependently originated. Good monks, it's good that you
understand this. And then the Buddha says, but this monk Sati has stored up
much demerit and he will be known by his pernicious view for a long time.
And here we are two and a half thousand years later and we know poor old Sati
because of his pernicious view. So the Buddha says consciousness is
dependently originated and it's reckoned by the conditions on which it
depends. When consciousness arises dependent upon eye and sight objects,
it's reckoned as eye consciousness. When it arises dependent upon ear and
sounds, ear consciousness, nose and smell, nose consciousness, taste and
tongue, tongue consciousness, body and tangibles, body consciousness, mind
and mind objects, mind consciousness. Just like a fire is reckoned dependent
upon what the conditions are upon which it depends. When a fire burns in a
forest, it's a forest fire. When it burns dependent on rubbish, it's a rubbish
fire. When it burns on a house, it's a house fire. When it burns on chaff,
it's a chaff fire. When it burns on cow dung, it's cow dung fire. In the same
way, consciousness is reckoned by the conditions on which it depends.
Now consciousness is a really important word in the Buddha's teaching. It
shows up as one of the five khandhas. It's one of the six elements when it
starts talking about the six elements. The word is vinyana. And there are
the six consciousnesses of the six senses. Now, these are not separate
things. These are, well, our conceptualization. I conceptualize hearing
consciousness, ear consciousness, if I think about becoming conscious of a
sound. But that's not separate or different from eye consciousness, but
it's not the same either. It is arising based on a different thing. It's
the capacity of the mind to know. But it's dependently originated. And what
the Buddha is teaching here is that consciousness arises dependent upon
sensory input. And if you think about it, when have you ever been conscious
when there was no sensory input? I mean, well, every night, right, when you're
in deep dreamless sleep, yeah. But you weren't conscious then, were you? I
mean, you were in deep dreamless sleep. There was no sensory input and there
was no consciousness. Or if you've had surgery and they put you out, well,
there was no consciousness, even though there was no sensory input. If
someone has a dream, then the mind consciousness comes back. Or if it's
an unfortunate thing where you're not completely out when they give you
anesthesia, well, yeah, you may be hearing things or something. This has
been reported, but it's hearing consciousness. So, yeah, as I mentioned
earlier, there's always an object of consciousness and the object is
apprehended through the senses. So consciousness arises dependent on the
senses and dependent upon there being an object and dependent upon the
interaction of mind and body. You need the mind to basically process what's
coming in through the bodily senses for external and you still need the mind
to deal with your mental sensory input as well. So the Buddha points out that
consciousness is dependently originated. And then he starts asking questions
of the monks to see if they understand dependent origination. And the first
question is, monks, do you see that this has come to be? Well, commentaries
make a big deal of figuring out what the this is referring to. And they
decide the Buddha pointed to his own body. Do you understand this has come
to be? I don't think that's what's going on. I think what was going on is
that the Buddha was asking, monks, when something comes to be, do you
understand this has come to be? In other words, do you realize something
has arisen? Yes, Venerable Sir. Monks, do you understand this has come to
be dependent on that? Yes, Venerable Sir. Monks, can there be confusion
about whether this has come to be dependent on that? Yes, Venerable Sir.
And the questioning goes on in this vein and it gets more and more and more
tedious. As much as I love Majama 38, Majama 38 has pages and pages of some
of the most tedious prose in the whole canon. We get the 12 links of dependent
origination in their forward arising order. And then we get them in their
forward ceasing order. And then we get them in their reverse order arising,
in their reverse order ceasing, in recapitulations of all of this stuff.
It goes on and on and on. You should probably read it once. After you've
read it once, then you're probably like, okay, just turn the pages and get to
the real part of the matter. But basically, what I'm guessing has happened.
There were some useful questions and answers there. And then as this Sutta was
being preserved, the monks who were preserving it just threw in a little bit
more and a little bit more into the question and answers. So they had a
catechism of question and answers. Remember, these Suttas were preserved
by chanting them. And when you learn to chant them, that's how you learn the
Dharma. I mean, you didn't have a book. They didn't have books back then.
Right? If you wanted to know about a Sutta, you either had to memorize it
yourself, or you had to go to somebody else that had memorized it and get them
to recite it for you. Right? And so, yeah, you learned the Dharma by learning
to recite the Suttas. And so being able to recite the 12 links of dependent
origination at forwards and backwards and arising and ceasing and so forth,
yeah, that's a good teaching tool. And so that got jammed into this particular
Sutta. But eventually it comes back to the heart of the matter.
Because knowing and seeing in this way, that is, in terms of dependent origination,
would you run back to the past wondering, were we in the past? Were we not in the
past? What were we in the past? How were we in the past? Having been what,
what did we become in the past? No, venerable, sir. Knowing and seeing in this
way, would you run forward to the future thus? Shall we be in the future? Shall we
not be in the future? What shall we be in the future? How shall we be in the
future? Having been what, what shall we become in the future? No, venerable,
sir. Knowing and seeing in this way, would you now be inwardly perplexed about the
present? Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from?
Where will it go? No, venerable, sir. So what the Buddha is saying, do these
questions about, well, the past, the future or the present, arise in you if you
look at the world in terms of dependent origination. No, venerable, sir.
Monks, are you saying this just because I'm your teacher? No, venerable, sir.
Monks, are you saying this based on your own experience? Yes, venerable, sir.
Good monks, it's good that you know this from your own experience.
All right. So I just put the questions in the chat if you want to look them over.
But basically what the Buddha is saying, if you understand dependent origination,
you won't be wondering, what was I in the past or even did I exist in the past?
And you won't be wondering, what will I be in the future or even will I be in the
future? And you won't even be wondering, what am I now? These questions won't
occur. For example, what happens if you fall off the edge of the world?
Does it hurt? I mean, you fall off the edge of the world.
Do you land on something and it hurts or you just keep falling?
If you just keep falling, do you fall faster and faster and eventually the
friction sets you on fire? That would hurt. Or would you like starved to death
or something? That would hurt. So if you fall off the edge of the world, does that
hurt? Well, these questions never occurred to any of you, right?
Because you don't believe in the edge of the world. That's not how you understand
reality. You understand it's a sphere and there's no such thing as the edge of
the world. The questions make no sense at all, right? If you understand dependent
origination in its general sense, that basically everything arises dependent on
other things and that you are no exception to this, you too arise dependent on only
other things. There's no entity you be found. Then the question of what was my
entity in the past or what will be my entity in the future or even what's my
entity now doesn't occur because you're not conceptualizing an entity.
If you really see the general teaching of dependent origination, which could be
stated as everything arises dependent on other things, what you wind up seeing is
what I call soda pie, streams of dependently arising processes interacting.
That's all there is. There are all these streams of processes that are
dependently originated and they intersect at this point that I call me.
Now, what are the streams that have made you who you are? Well, some of it's the
genetic material you got from your parents, right? Okay, but you're not your
genetic material. I mean, if you think you're a genetic material, you've
identified with the body and your body's going to die and you don't want that,
right? So you're kind of hoping you're going to be something else like your
education, but maybe the language that you speak. I mean, those are all streams
that come together. There's your family of origin, who your friends were when
you were a little kid, what books you read, what movies you watched, who your
friends are now, which Dharma talks you hear. The list is probably literally
endless of all the streams of dependently arising processes that have impacted
to make you who you are at this moment. I'm speaking to you in English, right?
That's because I live in Northern North America, where English is spoken.
That's because some British guys came to North America, they ran off the Dutch,
they ran off the French, they ran off the Spanish, they suppress the natives.
And so their language got left here and that's what I learned.
Okay, so I'm an English speaker. When I first encountered the Pali word
mudita, appreciative joy is usually a translation. I didn't know what mudita
meant, but when they told me it was sympathetic joy, I still didn't know
what it meant. What's sympathetic joy? And it was only later I began to get a
sense of what mudita was because we don't have that concept in English.
We have the opposite envy, right? So my language has to some extent
determined who I am, the concepts that I have. This is all we are.
We're just the intersection of a bunch of soda pie, streams of dependently
arising processes interacting. That's all you find anywhere.
I mean, if I hold this up, you know what it is? It's a cell phone, right?
Yeah, everybody knows that. No, this is a bunch of streams of dependently
arising processes. It's plastic and metal, and this is a rubber case
and this silicon. So it's what? Dead dinosaurs and sand and some
mining operation and some poor soul probably in China that put it all
together. Oh, and whoever wrote the software and put it on that and
whoever sold it to me and all of that's come together and now I have a cell
phone, right? But when I say this is my cell phone, that's a concept and it
doesn't fully capture what's going on. In fact, it's probably not possible
to mentally, in my head, fully capture everything that's gone on into
making that cell phone. And it's the same with you. You can talk about your
genetics and your family of origin and your education and all this other
stuff. But what about that nice lady in the grocery store who complimented
you on whatever, you know, that fitted to your system and you probably
forgot about it till I just mentioned it. Maybe you don't even remember it,
but that's part of who you are. All this stuff has come together. Most of it
we don't even remember and it's made us who we are. When you can look at the
world from a soda pi perspective, from perspective of nothing but streams
of dependently arising processes, interacting, the question of what was
I in the past? What will I be in the future? What am I right now? Don't
occur. And this was basically the Buddha's answer to Satya, the son of
the fisherman. If you could understand that your consciousness is just
another soda pi phenomenon, then you wouldn't think that it's going to be
reincarnated or rebirth or whatever phrase you want to use. You wouldn't be
wondering what will I be in the future or what was I in the past? And you
wouldn't be so inwardly perplexed about the present. So that's the first
discourse in this sutta. The second one is about kamatana, overcoming
craving for sensual pleasures. And basically what it says is we're caught
up in looking for pleasant Vedana and we don't know any other source of
kamma, sensual pleasures. And what the Buddha suggests as a way to overcome
kamatana is what is referred to as the gradual training. If you're
interested in the gradual training, the best sutta I would say on that is
dikenakaya number two, the samanyapala sutta. But here there's an abridged
version of it. And basically a tattagata arises in this world who teaches
the dharma, which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in
the end. Someone hears the tattagata, gains faith, goes forth, keeps the
precepts, guards the senses. It's mindful of all that they do, content with
little, sits down to meditate, abandons the hindrances, practices the
jhanas, and realizes there's something more delightful, more pleasant than
the sense desires they've been pursuing. So the Buddha's answer for
overcoming kamatana is jhana practice. Experiencing that pleasure and
realizing that the pleasure of the senses is temporary, fleeting, and
dependent on other things. So that's what I've got for the moment on this
sutta. I'm going to stop here and see if there are any questions.
Thanks. I don't know if this is the place to bring it up. But when you mentioned
the jhanas just now, when you started your book, you talked about how the
Buddha had become the old history of the Buddha going to learn meditation
and becoming more accomplished in his teachers and basically learning the
jhanas. But being an expert in the eight jhanas, at some point he had this
thought, like it was new and original and came up in an entirely different
context, that maybe the jhanas are the key in some ways to awakening. So
this may have something to do with dependent origination, but I just
wondered if you had anything you wanted to say about that.
Right. Yeah, so the Buddha learned, well, we know for certain jhanas seven
and eight, so we assume jhanas one through six as well from his teachers
and they offered to make him co-teacher or sole teacher and he turned it
down saying, yeah, when I come out of the jhanas, it's still dukkha, it's no good.
Right. So he's looking for something that's really going to take care of the dukkha,
not just an escape, temporary escape. So then he goes and practices the
austerities and now it's six years since he left home and he goes, this
austerity stuff isn't working either. There's got to be some other way.
And he starts thinking and he remembers an incident from his childhood when he
fell into the first jhana and he thinks, could these jhanas be the way to
awakening? And then he decides, yes, these are the way to awakening.
And he realizes he's so emaciated that he's in no shape to practice jhanas,
so he starts eating, his friends leaving and eventually he regains his
strength and he sits down under the bodhi tree and becomes fully awakened.
So what was the difference?
He realized that his first teachers were teaching him the jhanas as the
end of the spiritual path. And he's like, no, this is temporary, this is not
it. And when he thought back on it, he realized, oh, this is a skill for
means. It's not the end of the path. It's a means to the end of the
path. And he combined his jhana practice with investigation and guess what
he was investigating, dependent origination. The sutra reference for
that, it doesn't mention the jhanas, but it mentions that the night of his
awakening, he was investigating dependent origination. That's Samyuta 1265,
the city is the name of the sutra. So the answer to your question is that the
jhanas taught by his teachers were taught as the end of the path. And he
realized, no, this is not the end, but they are a useful skill to have on the
path to take you to the end. They were a useful means.
So I saw some stuff flashed by in the comments.
And acronym for Streams of Dependently Arising Processes Interacting, SOTAPI.
That's where it comes from. If you look at the back cover of my book, there's a
picture of people eating pie and drinking sodas. That's so you can remember it.
SOTAPI. The basic jhanas. Oh, how much time do you people have? You want to spend
until midnight? No, I didn't think so. Okay, so the jhanas are eight altered states
of consciousness brought on by concentration that yield even more
concentration. They're a preliminary practice for your insights. Okay. And I
have a book called Right Concentration that goes into them in detail, or you
can go to the website, leighb.com, and there's actually a link called jhanas,
and there's a bunch of information there that you can click on and read about them
and so forth. But basically, they're concentration states. And by stepping
through them, you generate a mind that's concentrated, clear, sharp, bright,
mable, wieldy, and given to impotentability. And that's the kind of mind you want
when you start investigating reality, doing your insight practice, doing your
vipassana. So it's the, it's the, the preliminary practice, the warm-up
exercise for your insight practice. Okay, Aaron.
Yes, Leigh, thank you very much for this presentation today. It's certainly
helping me to understand dependent origination, the way I thought it was
to begin with. Good. So my question is, you've mentioned insight
meditation, and we're just talking now about concentration. My understanding
to practice vipassana or insight meditation does not require even the
first jhana. What do you have to say about that? Well, what the Buddha
recommends repeatedly is keep the precepts, guard your senses, be mindful,
be content with little, overcome the hindrances, practice the jhanas,
and do insight meditation. All right. This shows up in about 30 different
suttas. It was, it was a curriculum for the monks and nuns. However, what
happened over time was the understanding of what exactly constitutes a jhana
kept getting, well, more and more concentrated, deeper and deeper levels
of concentration were required until it became almost impossible for anybody
to do it. By the time of the commentaries, so we're talking Vasude Maha,
eight to 900 years after the Buddha death, at that point, the understanding
of what constitutes a jhana had become so difficult that almost nobody
could do it. The Vasude Maha literally says, of people who come to
meditation, only one in a million people can get to the first jhana. So
since you're supposed to do insight practice, and yeah, if you're supposed
to do it after the jhana and only one in a million people can even get
to the first jhana, this isn't going to work. So let's just throw the jhanas
out. And that's what we have as standard. Yeah, a terrifying Buddhism
today. The jhanas are there. Yeah, but you don't want to waste your time with
that. However, if you go back and look at what the Buddha was talking about,
he makes a big deal about the jhanas. And he makes an even bigger deal
about the importance of sila samadhi panya, morality, concentration,
and wisdom. If you're going to practice insight meditation, I highly recommend
you get some degree of concentration before you start your insight practice.
If you just sit down, I don't care what your practice is, it's not going to go
nearly as well as if you invest some time in getting your mind settled
and quiet. That's just the nature of human minds. You really do need, yeah,
a concentrated mind to be able to see reality. When we look at the world,
normally we're looking at it in terms of can I eat that or will that eat me?
I mean, yeah, we get a little more sophisticated than that, but it's pretty
much, is this something I want to get or is this something I need to push away?
You notice I is right there in both of them. I want to get it. I need to push it away.
Well, when you look at the world from an egocentric perspective, you don't have
nearly as good a chance of seeing what's actually going on as if you can look
at the world from a less egocentric perspective. If you get your mind well
concentrated, you shut down your ego construction. I'm assuming all of you are
aware that you're constructing your ego out of your thoughts and emotions and so
forth. So if you stop doing that and start examining reality, which is what
insight practice is, you're going to have a much better chance of seeing what's
actually going on. So, yeah, those who say you don't need to concentrate.
I'm just not in agreement with that. You don't have to do the Janas. If you can
do the Janas, that's helpful. But, you know, Janas, some people find them easy.
Some people find them really difficult. You know, if you learn the Janas, you
will find them very beneficial. But there are other ways of approaching insight
practice, but all of them described in the sutras have some degree of
concentration to get you started, including, say, Majama 118, the
discourse on mindfulness of breathing. The first part of the 16 steps of
mindfulness of breathing will get you concentrated. So concentration is
really important. And it's a shame that western Buddhism makes so light of
concentration. It is an eight-fold path, and the eighth fold is right
concentration. So the Buddha obviously thought it was important.
So Lee, how can I know that I have enough concentration to start insight
meditation? Trial and error, basically. You know, there is a point of
diminishing returns. So if you sit there working on concentration until you get
tired, well, that was too long. And if you don't work on it long enough,
you're more distracted. One way to know is to learn, say, the first four
Janas, and then when you step through the four Janas, yeah, you're going to
have really good concentration for doing insight practice. So one way is to
learn the Janas, because they'll give you a nice measuring stick as to how
much concentration you have. But if you don't know the Janas, let's say
you're doing an hour-long meditation period. I'd say spend somewhere
between 20 minutes and half an hour getting concentrated first.
Okay. Thank you.
Right.
Mary Ann.
Thank you. Thank you. So thinking of soda pie as being what's at any point
in time, that's basically what's going on. And thinking about how most people
feel, or a lot of people I've talked to feel like they've changed over the
years. I'm thinking, I'm wondering if changing is really about getting
closer to right view.
Yeah. So soda pie originally was streams of dependently arising phenomena
interacting. But you know, I thought about it and phenomena sounds too much
like a noun. So I changed it to processes to get the verb nature of it,
because as you say, everything is changing all the time. And in fact,
so I heard a Dharma talk from Joseph Goldstein and he said, you should
think of yourself as a verb, not a noun. Because you're a bunch of processes,
your circulatory process, endocrine process, digestive process, breathing
process. So yeah, I'm actually a collection of processes rather than a
thing. And then I started looking around and realized everything was a
process. There really aren't any nouns. It's just that some verbs move kind of
slow. And we think they're nouns, but everything is changing. And so it's
so many processes impacting us, the processes are changing in the
intersection, which I call me is changing all the time as well. I mean,
presumably you went and ate your lunch. You're different than you were when
we first sat down here this morning. Because yeah, right, you have changed
the process part of the streams that are making up who you are now with the
food you eat for lunch. So yeah, it's all changing all the time. The Buddha said
that it's better to spend one day noticing how things arise and pass away
in a century, not seeing this. So he was very big on trying to get people to
see the arising and passing nature of the universe. Does that take care of
your question? Yeah, thank you. Yeah, you're very welcome.
Sorry. Hi, thank you. So on the genres as I try to sometimes progress through
them, I mean, third to fourth Johannes, what if I don't exactly experience it
as it's described, which I haven't, you know, so then, you know, I don't know
where I am. So I just get confused in there and I'm a parking in the tree.
Maybe I'm just like, you know, am I all through the body? Am I not? I mean,
you know, I get caught up in the mind stream kicks in. Yeah. So the book
writes concentration. People kept asking me, write a book on the Janus.
I'm like, you can't write a book on the Janus. That's ridiculous. You've got
to work with a teacher to have some clue of what's going on. Oh, come on,
write a book on the Janus. I've heard over again. And so finally it was like,
all right, I'll write a book on the Janus. So I wrote a book on the Janus.
And yeah, I'm surprised that people are able to learn the Janus by reading a
book. I never could have. I needed somebody to actually tell me what was
going on. They needed to give me really clear instructions. I need to go play
with those instructions and come back and describe to them what was going on.
And they could tune it up and I could go do it again and get it a little
better. So for people that learn them on their own, I'm amazed. I'm really,
yeah, that's amazing. That's wonderful. But if you really want to know,
am I doing it right? Yeah, you're going to have to sit down one-on-one with
somebody that knows the Janus, describe what you're doing and see what they
have to say to either say, yeah, that's perfect. Or yeah, try doing this a
little different and so forth. I mean, I still think writing a book on the
Janus was kind of ridiculous, but 16,000 people had bought the book. So I
guess maybe it wasn't totally ridiculous. Including I, sir. Thank you. No,
no, it was wonderful. Thank you. Yeah, it's just, it's just really hard to
know where you are. It's without asking somebody, you know, explaining exactly
what you're experiencing and having them give you the feedback. May I ask a
question from previous session? Yeah, yeah. Okay. On the ignorance that I was
talking about, it comes in from the previous lives. You know, with the pig,
the Tibetan circle of the pig that comes, no, did I get that wrong? Some people
say it comes in from the previous lives. All the Buddha said was, it's there.
Well, it's there. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. So you are ignorant of what's going on
at noon at the equator on the nearest inhabited planet to Beetlejuice. It
didn't come in from your previous life. It's just you never knew that, right?
Right. You also don't know what's going on at noon at the second closest planet
to Beetlejuice or anything like that. Exactly. Right. It's just so much that
we don't know. It's not that we are ignoring it. It just wasn't there. And
that's part of what the Afecha is about. There's just tons of stuff that could
have been known that we don't know. Yeah. The important stuff is Anitya Tuka
and Nata. We want to know about those because that's what we need to understand
to get out of Tuka. Okay. And then sometimes I've heard that they say that
someone comes in with like a good, good process of handling perhaps painting
or something or some more concentration than other people. And then they say
they probably have completed in the previous lives. I'm just wondering if
there is like something that just gets generated from one to the other. Not
that I, you know, I mean, I know there's genes that have been passed on,
but the other part I don't subscribe to at this point. I have no idea.
Yeah. Not annoying. Thank you, sir. That's it. Yeah. So people often try
and describe, explain what's going on in the present by what happened in the
past. And if they don't see anything in the past person's present life,
then they'll ascribe it to some previous life. But I don't know what happens
after we die. I don't know if I had a previous life. I don't find any evidence
indicating I had a previous life. I was really good at mathematics from the
get go. I had really good concentration from the get go. Why did that happen?
I have no idea. I just have to leave it in the I don't know. I'm not going to
ascribe it to some other person that I have no conscious connection of that
they did whatever. I mean, this is just the hand I got dealt. I don't know who
was dealing the hands. It's like, okay, that's what's going on. But yeah,
when somebody's trying to explain something by saying it's coming from a
previous life, they're speculating. I'm sorry. And, you know, I have a background
in science. I want to know more about what you can actually talk about and
leave the rest of the stuff and I don't know category. I don't know why I was
good at math. It just seems so obvious to me. That's all. But I don't know why
it seemed obvious. Thank you very much. Right. Steve.
One thing I like so much about the idea of seeing it in terms of processes is
that you've got the idea that there are inputs, something happens in the results
and that's that kind of that's so in line with the dependent origination.
The inputs are whatever happened before that are influencing what's
happening now. And then the process has certain lifetime and then it stops.
And that's kind of what happens at death too. A lot of our processes that are
running stop. Others continue on. And it really also ties us in with kind of
the interrelationship between us and everything else that's going on, other
beings, other matter. Yeah. Yeah.
So when I say I'm at the intersection of a bunch of streams of dependently
arising processes, that's not the end because I act. And my actions are
another stream or multiple streams of photo pie. Right.
So I wrote two books. Okay. Those are streams of dependently arising
processes. They've gone out into the environment. Hopefully somebody finds
the books useful. But you know, also I, you know, I helped a little old lady
across the street. That too is a stream that went out there. You really want
to find your rebirth? Look at every intentional action you do because
every intentional action you do is going to have karmic resultants. Right.
That's going to change the universe, not in a big way. If any of you have the
ability to change the universe in a big way, you've been slacking off on the
job lately and things are getting out of hand. So I presume none of you can
change the universe in a big way, but we all get to change it in a little way.
Well, better to change it to make it better than to change it to make it
worse. And so you're basically being reborn with every intentional action.
Your intentional actions are reprogramming your own brain, but they're also
reprogramming the universe. And we're not separate from the universe. We'll get
to that in the next talk. But yeah, you're exactly right.
Yeah, this is just this huge flow and there's this intersection that comes
together and it goes out. You want a picture? Think of an hourglass.
There's all the sand coming down to that little point that you call me and then
it flows out onto the bottom. And it actually turns over and does it again
and again. Right. Okay, there was a whole bunch of stuff went by in the chat.
Let me see.
We're all walking stacks of conditionally, continuously permeating as a result
of streams of soda pie. Yes. When is my next Zoom presentation on the
Janas? I don't have one scheduled for a day long, but if you contact the
Sati Center, they might be interested in scheduling one and then I'll do that.
All streams of action have impacts from ripples to waves. Yes.
Somebody else posted that my talks on the Janas are all available on audio
Dharma and also on Dharma Seed. If you go to my website, oh yeah, it's all on
my website. Click on the Buddha. Look down on that little menu and see talks.
Click on that. There's a whole retreat there, including a bunch of talks on
the Janas, but a Zoom day long on the Janas. Yeah.
And if you really want help on the Janas, yeah, it's sort of got to come on
the street. And my schedule, of course, is on my website. It's all on my website.
So anything else on Sati the son of fisherman and his mistaken view?
All right. So we're going to take another break.
I'm going to come back and talk about emptiness, but do your bio break, stretch
a little bit if you need to, and then meditate and get in some more
meditation before we start talking about emptiness.
