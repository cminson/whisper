The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
From the break, and to start the second half, we'll spend a little bit of time
of meditating, just to help us get settled again. The break, I felt a lot of energy
and it was, for me it was great to see the excitement and the enthusiasm for what
we're doing. So we'll spend a little bit of time meditating just to get settled
again.
And Kim did a beautiful guided meditation earlier. So for this one, I'm not going to
do as much guiding. We'll have some silence in the beginning and then I'll
just drop in a question into the meditation. So to start, just take an alert,
upright posture. And if you feel comfortable, gently close your eyes.
Bring your attention to your breathing.
And to the sensation of your feet on the floor and your seat on the chair or the
cushion.

As we continue meditating, continue being mindful.
We know that things arise from a string of cause and effect.
Actions have consequences.
Our actions have consequences.
What we do makes a difference.
So what would it be like to sit here now, engaged in the practice of mindfulness,
if you firmly believed that how you practiced made a difference?
