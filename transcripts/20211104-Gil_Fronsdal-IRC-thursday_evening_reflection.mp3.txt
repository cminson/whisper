 So then again, if you can go away, so you know you're here. Thank you. And a few thoughts coming, bringing this day to an end is that it is sometimes difficult to appreciate how significant and important valuable it is to be on retreat, like in the middle of the retreat. Sometimes we struggle, sometimes we get involved in our own little world of practice, and there are challenges, and we think maybe we're not doing so well. But in the scale of what human beings do, this is one of the most worthwhile ways of meeting oneself and working with oneself and finding a way through the difficulties and challenges, the attachments, the clings, the reservoir of unresolved feelings and emotions. And if it's been difficult today, it's probably been more worthwhile. A spiritual path that's easy is probably not a spiritual path. So I want to appreciate whatever your practice has been today. I'd like to suggest that as you go to sleep tonight, or if you're in a different time zone, when you go to sleep, that you lay in bed and reflect on the day of practice in two ways. You reflect, you appreciate yourself and the practice you've done. Find something to appreciate about this practice and yourself and your efforts. It is a remarkable thing. And if you can't find anything to appreciate about your practice and how it's gone today, then please borrow my great appreciation of what you're doing and your participation in this retreat. That's the first thing. And the second thing, and it's important this is second, you reflect over the day without any judgment, negative judgment about yourself. Consider, were there ways today you could have been more wholeheartedly practicing? Are there ways you could have given yourself more fully over to the practice during this day? And just kind of go through and recognize what those moments were, just to learn from it. And then, before you're ready to really drift off to sleep, maybe set an intention for the next day, for tomorrow, to be more wholeheartedly in the retreat. Those little gaps, little places where you're not so completely involved, maybe you can close those up a little bit tomorrow and be a little bit more fully in the retreat. So, appreciate yourself. Review the day. And then, set a wish and intention to be more fully in the retreat tomorrow. Less gaps. And then, the best of your ability. Slip into sleep contentedly. Content for a day well spent. Thank you very much, and I hope you sleep well.
