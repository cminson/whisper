Dharmette: Attitude Matters

Perhaps I can say a few more  words about what I talked 
about earlier : about  attitude . Almost always , we operate 
under the influence  of, or through the filter , of some 
attitude , and  it’s easy for that attitude go unnoticed.  
 
There’s an analogy I like. I don’t know whether you’ve 
had this experience. You drive around in a car with a 
clean windshield , and then slowly it gets dirty because it  
hits the bugs. It  happens so slowly that you don’t n otice 
how dirty it’s getting . But it’s getting dirty enough  that 
you hav e to strain to see through  it. Still you don’t 
notice , because you’re focusing so much on the road , 
and the traffic , and driving safely . What does the glass 
have to do with driving? Then, lo  and behold , you stop 
at a gas station and clean the windshield . When you 
start driving again , you’re amazed at how clea n it is . 
The world is clear ! Those of you who wear  glasses 
perhaps have had this experience occasionally . I’ve had 
someone say , “Gil , I’m going to clean your glasses for 
you.”  “Oh!”  
 
It’s possible to go for a long time with something that 
interferes with  our ability to see clearly because we’re so focused on our life . We’re focused on what we’re 
looking at, what we’re concerned about , so that we don’t 
notice the medi um through which we’re seeing, through 
which we’re perceiving . The attitude can often be t he 
medium ; it’s the background, the filter . There are all 
kinds of attitudes. Some attitudes are fine or helpful; but  
some are disturbing, disruptive,  or create  obstacles for 
us. 
 
What’s interesting about meditation practice is that 
sooner or lat er if the  mind gets quiet enough, even good 
attitudes need to fall away  – even  things we think are 
great and wonderful . When I was in Burma with U 
Pandita, I was surprised at one of the things he would 
teach us . He said, “Don’t  have any compassion.” He 
didn’ t actually say it that way , but that’s  how I heard it. 
What he meant was that, when doing deep meditation 
practice,  even the attitude of  having compassion was 
extra . Compassion  might be  there . He wasn’t  saying 
don’t have it . But to assume or take on any kind of 
attitude  isn’t needed when you get really still.  
 
There’s another thing that opens up when you become 
attitude free . The hold, the  grip that attitudes may have 
on you is loosened up. The idea that  it’s important to 
have an approach,  or an underlying in tention or  attitude  
is loosened up . Some attitudes have to do with beliefs . 
A belief in the background supports the attitude. Or 
there’s an attitude  in the back ground that supports the  belief . Which comes  first depends on the situation . But 
just turn aro und and look , and see what  attitudes  or 
beliefs are operating  in the back ground. Some beliefs  
are not really articulated . Nevertheless , our background 
beliefs influence  everything we do.  
 
One of the  surprises people have on meditation retreat s 
is slowly seeing over time the basic principles they’re 
operating under  highlighted . They see the repetitive 
patterns over and over and over again . In daily life , 
there are so many interruptions , and so m any different 
things going on  that the m ind jumps around a lot . There 
are distractions , so you  don’t really notice. B ut on 
retreat , after a while, every time the  mind wanders off , 
you’re conscious of it . You know where the mind has 
gone , and you start seeing its repetitive patterns.  
 
It’s not uncommon for someone  on retreat to come to an 
interview with a teacher and say, “I had no idea how 
pervasive my fear was . Fear underlies everything  I do 
and think , and I had  no idea.” Sometimes when 
someone says this to me , there’s no obvious indication 
that this is a fearful person  – it’s not visible from the 
outside. And i t wasn’t visible to that person until they go t 
quiet enough to actually see what was going on in the 
background.  A whole series of things can be 
background attitudes or approaches.  
 
When I’ve worked  very closely with  people on  their breathing in meditation , I have found it interesting that 
when they get quiet enough to really track their 
breathing and see what’ s going on  in their breathing, 
they find that these attitudes are embed ded in how they  
breath e. For example, it’s not uncommon that the place 
in breathing where we give up control is at the end of 
the out breath (there’s often a letting go there). F or 
people wit h the attitude of liking  to control everything, 
they feel unwilling to breathe out all the way.  Or that’s 
the place where th ey wander off into thought, or  easily 
get distracted . It’s a little frightening to let go , because it 
seems like a loss of control.   
 
And then I’ve known people who  don’t want to breathe 
in. They’re fine with breathing out, letting go of 
everything, giving  everything away . But breathing in is 
oppressive  – it’s like too much input. “Leave me alo ne. I 
have all this work to do. B reathing in is work ; my life is 
work ; and I don’t want to work.” So there are these very 
subtle attitudes. F or some people , the hitch  – the place 
where the speed bump  is – is not with breathi ng out , but 
with breathing in.  
 
There are people who are a little reluctant at the 
beginning of the out breath . Everyone’s breathing fine, 
but you have to be very still to watch what goes  on. 
There  can be  a very small  reluctance to breath ing out at 
the top of the  in breath , beca use it’s losing something, 
giving something up. The attitude is  to hoard everything, keep ever ything close in, including the breath . So there 
can be a slig ht reluctance.  Talking about the breathing 
in this way point s out how subtle the operating attitude 
or belief can be in the psyche , and how influential they 
can be in many different ways.  
 
An attitude  can influence things as subtle as how you 
walk. If you’re walking through  the city, through the 
town , it could be that you’re doing it with an attitude.  
 
Or how you sit. I spent three years at Tas sajara Zen 
Monastery. I n Zen monasteries a lot of things are 
choreographed . How you sit i n meditation is 
choreographed. You sit in a certain way: upright, 
straight back, hands in a particular position, head in a 
particular position . When you stand up , you have to 
stand in a particular way , hold your hands a certain way . 
When you step through a  doorframe,  you have to step 
through in a certain way. W hen you eat , you have to eat 
in a choreographed way . You have to bow in a certain 
way. What you do with your body is often 
choreograph ed, and you have to fit in. T he 
consequence of doing this for thre e years, was that 
when I left Tassaj ara, I suddenly became aware that I 
had a lot more choices . I had always had these choices,  
but I beca me aware of a lot  more choices about things 
I’d never considered that I had choices about . It never 
occurred to me that these choices were interesting or 
important . For example , how I would sit in a chair became a choice . Before I went to the monastery , I just 
sat in chairs. Then  I bec ame aware that I had a choice, 
and t here were many differ ent ways of sitting in a chair. 
I could slump ; I could sit up straight ; I could use the 
backres t; or I could not use the backrest. I started 
noticing these attitu des. I could sit down  in a chair,  but 
how I would sit  was partially influenced by my attitudes , 
my beliefs, or what I was  trying to do . Whereas before , I 
was ju st innocently sitting in a chair, this Zen practice 
interrupted or interfered with that. It’s a  bit of a drag to 
always be thinking about what I’m supposed to do . 
Sitting in a chair is  suppo sed to just be relaxing, but now 
I had to think about how I sit in the chair bec ause there 
are choices . What’s the wise way to sit in a chair?                   
 
I remember once when I was a college student , being  
really depressed. I was sitting on the couch where I was 
living,  and at some  point I noticed that I was slumping 
so deeply into the couch that my shoulders were almost 
down to the seat of the sofa. That got my attention. 
“This is kind of dramatic,” I thought. “ Let me sit up  
straight.” S o I sat up straight , and when I sat up straight , 
all this energy  came,  and much of my depression lifted . 
Maybe I wasn’t so depressed if it was that easy , right? 
What that taught me was the impact of posture . My 
attitude of giving up influenced  my posture , and the 
posture then p robably had a feedback loop influencing  
how I felt . Sometimes it’s a spiral , and we spiral out.  
 So what is your attitude? What i s your background 
mood? What are some of the back ground operating 
principles that might be there all the time  – ones you 
may not have been so conscious  of, but are always 
there ?  
 
When you open a door to go into a  new place  – a room, 
a store, some place  you haven’t been  – is there a 
common pattern in the attitude with which you step 
through that door? Do you go in with concerns and 
worries , or do you just walk into a new space without 
any thought about it at all ? Or are you just completely 
random in whatever you might be concerned  about , or 
what ever your a ttitude is ? Or is  there a common pattern 
in what you do when you come into a new place?  
 
If you answer an email, or if you’re composing an email, 
is there an attitude that you have?  
 
I have attitudes . One attitude  is that I like getting the 
mail here at IM C. I’m the one who gets the mail here . I 
don’t know what it  is about picking up mail that is 
comforting for me, but I find it pleas ant, so I actually like 
doing it. It’s one of my little pleasures. I open it up and 
see what’s there. T here’s seldom anything for me , but 
that doesn’t matter, I don’t care. There’s just something 
nice about it. That’s an attitude I have.  I just go along 
with i t, and it’s easy.  
 Sometimes I see I have an attitude about emails. “Oh 
no!” It’s very imp ortant to track and be aware of these  
attitude s, because if I don’t track the se attitudes  and 
take responsibility for them, then some of them can 
cause  trouble.   
 
For those of you who might have an attitude , I’d 
encourage you to be  more mindful of it
